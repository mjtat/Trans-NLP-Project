ShackledPhoenix,asktransgender,Did your Tastes/Appetite for food change?,"Wow two questions in one day.  Look at me being all social.

So anyways, I've always been a food lover, a voracious carnivore and a notable cook.  I've been annoyed the past couple of weeks because I thought my food wasn't turning out well.  Things I've cooked  many times... weren't very good. 
I was thinking about it today, trying to figure out what was wrong when I noticed it was the meat I disliked.  The pasta, the Mac and Cheese I made for the first time ever, rice and veggies were absolutely delicious.  I was picking out the meats and enjoying the rest.  

Inside my head I'm thinking ""Heh I'm eating just like my ex.........wait a second!""

I'm probably being silly but curiosity strikes!  Has anyone experienced their food preferences changed after starting HRT?"
protodro,asktransgender,Should I say anything to a friend that I think may be trans?,"I have a friend who reminds me a lot of how I used to act a year ago. She has trouble befriending women, many of her friends are trans people, she's not generally very happy, her behaviour and voice inflection is masculine but not in a ""butch"" or ""tomboy"" kind of way, and the way she presents herself makes her seem like she doesn't feel at home in her body.

I'm not sure if I'm just projecting my own gender issues onto her, or if I'm right and I might be able to help her somehow. She knows that I'm trans and that she can talk to me about gender whenever she wants to. Is there anything more for me to do, or should I just wait?"
MusteredCourage,asktransgender,Will weight loss hamper breast growth?,"So my girls have really started kicking in to gear and I'm super happy about it, but the problem is with summer coming up I'm looking to drop about 20-30 pounds.. But if that's going to make my boobs and hips smaller I'm really not interested.. Will it have an affect at all?"
Throwawaywerky,asktransgender,What should I do in workplace environment when incorrect pronouns are used?,"So to start off, for obvious reasons I did a throwaway. I like my job and want to keep it. 


I have a (recent M2F) coworker that made the transition and changed her name. When she was hired she was male and had a male name. I am not close with her, nor do I interact daily with her. 


Of late i have noticed higher ups in the company using the incorrect pronoun when speaking about her. They say ""he"" and ""him"" when she isn't around. Now they *do* see her more often than I do because they travel to her location and have met her both before and after her change. But anytime I hear them use the wrong pronouns i cringe, as does everyone else at my location.  

She has changed her name, thus making that distinction that we as *other humans* should respect. My own management basically told me that the ppl who keep doing it are fucking morons, but since we don't know there's nothing we can really do. 


Am I wrong in thinking this *is* a big deal, even if she isn't present to hear these incorrect pronouns? Am I wrong in assuming that she made the **clear distinction** of her own gender by changing her name and that it's silly to continue to refer to her with the incorrect pronouns? 


How is this approached in the work environment normally? I just kind of feel like it's 2016, and people should know things like this and just give the same respect for everyone regardless of whether in your work environment or in your personal life. 


TL;DR my upper management is consistently referring to a recent transgender coworker with the incorrect pronouns. Lower management at my location agrees it's ignorant, but since we don't work closely with her we don't know the situation and thus can't/won't do shit. Should I pursue this further, and if so how? "
pingarella,asktransgender,Dealing with Dysphoria: How do you manage?,"Was just curious about how other's cope with dysphoria, occasionally I'll get hit by a bout of doubts and sadface feelings. And I'm not sure how else to deal with it. 

Some info that might be helpful is age, how long you've been transitioning, which end of the spectrum you sit (MtF, FtM, somewhere in between), and ways you cope. 

Ty c: x"
MentalGwen,asktransgender,Anyone else have intermittent dysphoria?,Feel myself slipping out of it again. It's like I'm on a certain type of cycle where I'm either trans or indifferent. Maybe a better way of explaining it I'm either feminine on the inside or I don't think about gender that much. It's kinda like I get my fill of reading about transition and focus on other things for a few months but then BOOM my transness comes back and gets me full force. Unfortunately I'm more euphoria heavy and that leaves too -- a shame considering feeling like a girl feels better than even the best orgasms IMO
lyn46,asktransgender,Electrolysis in Brooklyn/Manhattan?,"So I'm 21, started HRT on 08/26/2015, and have gone through about nine sessions of laser so far, full face and neck. While I'm not sure exactly when I'll be starting electro, I know it'll happen eventually. I have a couple of laser sessions left before my package deal expires, and I *may* go back for a few sessions after that. I've still got some stubborn hairs left on my face and neck, and a few blondies that've popped up since starting 'mones. 

What I want to know is if any of you have done electrolysis in NYC and where? Would you recommend it? Any advice? Thanks in advance! "
Veretrix,asktransgender,"Where should I go to best discuss what -romantic I am? (If here is okay enough, I have a question...)","I am aware this is likely not the place to ask this, but it seems as though there aren't really any subreddits specifically for the various ""romantics"" (panromantic, aromantic, etc.). I will ask my question anyways, but if there is a better place to discuss it, please let me know and I will relocate the question. Anyways, here it is:

Can I be considered panromantic if I am not romantically attracted to men/male/masculine people, but I am still okay with Genderqueer/Genderless/Gender neutral people, Trans women, and Cis women?

EDIT: Just found polyromantic. Pretty sure that fits much better than panromantic, as it is ""romantic attraction to multiple, but not all genders""."
olivia_black,asktransgender,First BA Consultation: Sizing for a tall MtF Help w/o HRT,"Hey AskTG, I had my first BA consultation this morning. It was incredibly affirming. I was very happy to hear that the the plastic surgeon felt that she could give me a very natural looking breasts without any breast tissue. (I have a high risk for breast cancer so I am looking at transitioning without HRT) 

We talked about sizing and we are looking at a silicone high profile under the muscle.  

I am just shy of 6'3"" and 200lbs.  She urged me to go north of 400 CCs to fit my frame. 

Any thoughts on going big enough? Or too big?  

Any tall women out there who had BA want to share your CCs? 

Thank you! "
Veretrix,asktransgender,At what point before/during your transition did you start to use a new name/pronouns?,"I am still deciding on a name for myself that is either female or gender neutral, and I am just curious. Did any of you wait until certain criteria were met in your transition before a name/pronoun change? I kinda want to, but I think it might be a bit odd, as I don't currently present as female or feminine and I am pre-HRt, sooo yeah..."
Fredgregjoe,asktransgender,I could use some travel advice.,"So I'm going on vacation in a week or two and me and my family are going to be flying to our destination.

Here's the problem. I've been on hrt for about 2 years (time really flies) and I'm still in guy mode full time. I'm pretty skinny and have been taking a low dose so my development hasn't been super noticeable but I definitely have some curves and last time I've measured am at an A cup.

It's been about 10 years since I've dealt with TSA and I didn't have boobs then. To people who have traveled in recent years, is this enough to raise red flags? I know some men have a bit of boobage, but they usually aren't 115 lbs on a good day.

Also I don't have a prescription for my meds, is it better in this case to just put it in my checked bag in case they wanna check my carry on? I know I risk them losing my bag and being without them in this case. But honestly I think I'd have bigger concerns in that case, lol."
Lea91,asktransgender,"Effects of HRT on height, shoe size and hands","I heard HRT can slightly change your height, feet and hands. So to my fellow trans girls, how have you changed in these measurements?

Annicorn,asktransgender,I've just been outed at work aparently.,"I just had someone come and see me to tell me there me there was a rumour going around that I was having a ""sex change"".  I immediately laughed and told her the words she choose were a little off, but yeah.  I'm out amongst friends and family, and I'll go out in public as myself, so I figured it was only a matter of time, but it's still really thrown me.  I wasn't ready to talk to the site manager yet, and was actually planning on waiting another six months until my current boss retires.  Now I don't know what to do.  I'm a little upset by the language this person used, even though they were just repeating what was said to them so I'd know what was going on.  I'm a little upset that it's spreading as just a rumour, because it's not on my terms.  I don't know who knows what, and who's saying what.  What do I do?  The more I sit with this the more I freak out, and I'm about to finish up for the week."
claire_sonahue,asktransgender,Would gaining weight be beneficial?,"I'm 5'9 - 5'10 120 lbs and I'm really just skin and bones but I have trouble gaining weight, my brow bone and Adam's apple are fairly visible and I really don't have much fat, would gaining weight maybe 10-20 lbs help conceal these things and give me a softer feminine look?"
astrodissonance,asktransgender,Are there any studies that cover the cause of genderfluidity?,"As in peer reviewed studies, I've had significant issue finding studies that try to explain it. 

My unscientific explanation is that it happens when, during the developing stage in utero, the dosage of hormones is in a stage that could lead into transgenderism, but development and personal experience affects us, leading to a shifting, or bending gender identity. But I wish to find hard studies around this aspect of transgenderism.

This came about because, once again, on the internet someone (who claims to be transgender) is telling me genderfluidity is bs, and everyone who claims they are, are full of shit. 

I'm not sure if I am genderfluid, but I have very little doubt in my mind over this. And I wish there was data on this, as I feel that it is way underrepresented."
Izzy10235,asktransgender,Name Change Hearing. What do I do here?,"I filed a petition for a name change today! Ahhhhh! (I'm also being kicked out in May, but... Whatever!)

So now I just have to wait until the hearing is scheduled. Is there anything important I need to know? What exactly happens in the hearing? All I got was that it's short, informal, and I'll be asked why I'm changing my name, the reasons for which are fairly obvious. 

Being me, I'll probably be terribly nervous and shaky the entire time until I leave..."
[deleted],asktransgender,"So I just got a email response from Dr DiMaggio's office, it was a bit crushing","Sorry, typing on my phone.  Anyway, just received a response from MDM's office and they mentioned that my face had difficult areas that needs work.  (Some of their English was not the best but very understandable) They told me they could make my face more feminine bit not fully female if I understand correctly.


That felt so crushing and confusing (especially the difficult face comment) since when I'm in girl mode, I totally pass.  They also mentioned that they think I need a lot more work than I thought I did.  Areas I thought I need, they don't think I do.  Suffice to say, my photos looked kinda bad but dang.  


Anyone else have experience with MDM?

Cantantalope,asktransgender,Would you accept a message like this from a partner?,"Im 27, FtM. I was in a ""lesbian"" relationship for about 2 years before I came out. 
As I would expect from any partner there are going to be certain difficulties that will be worked out over time. Especially since she identifies so strongly as lesbian.

But in a text message discussion about the weekend I get this one back from her..

""As if you are. This is a bigger thing for me than it is for you. You choose this, this is what you want. You have had all tbe time in the world and you leave it to last days..""

Any thoughts?

EDIT: 
Specifically, i will be having top surgery on wednesday and this weekend i was wanting to talk with some more distant friends about my transition (people she has only met 2 or 3 times at most).
She started convo with what she was thinking of planning for Saturday (a lunch with another couple). I told her what potential plans i was thinking of.

The lead up texts..

Her: Would you like me to be with you to support you?  i know id like to be there to support you. But ultimately it's up to you if you'd like me there with yoi

Me: No thats alright. I can do it. 
But the way things are at bloody work is mental. Be glad when accreditation is over at end of year ������������

Her: do You really not want me involved or around at all. .....if so.just tell me to get lost

Me: No its all good really 

Her: You know you really Suck at making me feel ok with you leaving me out. 

Me: I wouldnt  call it leaving you out. But im sorry u feel that way.

So today at the appointment he looked at my blood test results and decided to up the spiro to 200mg and also add 50mg of cypro, as well as 2mg of estrogen. Has anyone else done this?

Thatnewgirlrachel,asktransgender,"Can we build a list of resources for people asking ""Am I trans""?","So this question gets asked on the daily on here, and there's always different articles and books that people say ""look, if you read this, you will learn to look at gender in a new light and that will help you"". I want to build a list of them and hopefully (mods willing) get it put in the sidebar or on the wiki or something. It sure would have helped me! Oh who am I kidding it still would :)

I'll start. Be warned my knowledge is slanted towards AMAB questioners, because well that's me.

**BOOKS**

* *Whipping Girl by Julia Serano* - I've heard this referred to as the MtF bible. This is all about all the different kinds of sexism and transphobia with a special focus on those experienced by trans women. It just so happens that trans women exist at the juncture of gender discrimination and gender identity discrimination (two completely different things) and this book helps deal with them both on an internal and external level. Helped me a lot since I grew up in a conservative town and internalised the whole ""You have penis. You big and strong. You have vagina. You pretty and demure."" thing.

**ONLINE ARTICLES**

* [*The Null Hypothecis by Natalie Reed*] (http://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis) -
The ""null hypothecis"" is the idea that because we live in such a cisnormative world, we only ever ask for proof that we are trans and not that we are cis. Cisgender becomes the ""control sample"" and we have to prove our hypothesis that we are trans. That's completely intellectually dishonest though. In reality cis and trans identities are just as valid for each other and the idea of which is normal is ultimately useless. A better way of going about questioning is to directly compare ""evidence"" for ""I am cisgender"" and ""I am transgender"".

* *[That was dysphoria? by Zinnia Jones](http://freethoughtblogs.com/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/)* - A list of some of the more subtle signs of dysphoria that trans people encounter with a slant towards MtF folks since that's who the author is. Not all trans people experience dysphoria as feeling like they're ""trapped in their own skin"", and this goes through some other ways dysphoria can manifest. It's always important to remember that everyone is unique and it's not like just because you are trans you experience your gender in the same way as other trans people. That would be as dumb as suggesting all cis people experience their gender in the same way.

There's a few more that I can think of but it's late and I'm going to bed. The point is to get the whole sub thinking about this stuff! What resources really helped you figure yourself out?

*Also really need some AFAB input since I'm not so knowledgeable about resources for people transitioning in the other direction :)*"

glastonburytrans,asktransgender,Thoughts on hormones whilst planning not to transition,"A brief summery - I'm a 35yo married man with 3 young children in England. I'm currently under the care of my local GIC, and have completed the assessment phase where I have been diagnosed as being transgender. My family situation has me in the position where a full transition is off the cards, at least for the foreseeable future, and this is my choice.

My question is regarding the use of hormones for those who wish to continue in there assigned gender. I'm finding my current situation near impossible to live with. Depression and dysmorphia are making the day to day an ever increasing struggle. 
Although I have chosen not to transition for the sake of my marriage and my children, I need to find coping mechanisms in order to function. Have people maintained their assigned gender whilst in hormones? Is a low dose an option? Am I deluding myself that this is possible? 

I would appreciate any thoughts on this in order to form a plan for myself. Thank you.  "
krw13,asktransgender,Dating,"So, I finally pushed past my own fears (and some of the natural burdens as well, like basic finances) and began going through the steps towards a full transition. I started seeing a voice therapist in the fall, started seeing a psychiatrist in January and will be visiting with a doctor the first week of March.

As a male I have always been an extrovert, but I am much more reclusive as female. Naturally, part of it is looks (though I get a decent number of compliments - I totally doubt myself) and voice (I can kind of fake it in small doses)...even in environments where those are non-factors (texting, online) I am still very introverted. 

For others who have transitioned and found success...what point did you tell your SO about your birth gender? If you have had a chance to experiment a little, what way did you find the best to approach the subject?"
Azure-Arenia,asktransgender,Any good therapists in CO?,"I live in a suburb area a little while to the south of Denver. I've talked with my mom, and she had said it may be good for us to see a therapist for this. I was wondering if anyone knew any good ones in the state or nearby."
Baridian,asktransgender,Ive grown. I dont know what to do.,"So, over the last 7 months or so ive been telling my parents i need hrt, ive kept growing. I wanted to start hrt soon so i wouldnt be really tall, but over the 6 montys i had to go to therapy before i could get fucking puberty blockers, ive grown half an inch, started getting hair under my chin and on my chest. Im so upset that i couldge avoided all of this if my parents had picked a better clinic. One that didnt require 6 months of therapy. This whole thing's left me suicidal for about a year now. What am i supposed to do? At this point, im 5""8.5' before i was only 5'8"". That puts me from being taller than 90% to taller than 98%. What do i do? I was trying my best to stop this happening."

RainbowLoli,asktransgender,Can anyone these to me? I'm confused by what these terms mean and the difference between them,"Along with the best way to counter someone who says that they are?

Difference between: Transgender, transsexual, transvestite

To my knowledge: Transgender is the general term for the population, Transsexual is a more scientific or old term, while transvestite is an older way of saying drag king / queen.

Also, can anyone explain to me what genderswaps, trap, and futa have to do with trans and / or why people say they are transphobic?

The trans people I know say that they have nothing to do with transgender or gender identity and I'm confused by why other people say that those three things are transphobic while my friends say that they aren't? "
tranquest,asktransgender,"I don't ""feel"" male or female, but I'd prefer to be male (but was assigned female at birth); am I trans?","Back in the 70s when I was growing up, the trend among educated liberals was the idea of treating babies and children in a non-gender-specific manner. My sister and I both had female genitalia and there was never any issue or question as to our gender, but we were never told that particular toys were ""for girls"" and thus appropriate for us or ""for boys"" and thus not appropriate. Our toys were things like Lego, cars, puzzles, and stuffed animals. Conspicuously absent were baby dolls, Barbies, and toy cleaning equipment, but occasionally someone would gift us with some sort of pink/""girly"" item and it would be added to the collection, though our parents did somehow impart the idea that they were not on board with this. 

I did not own any dresses or skirts, nor did I wish to. Stereotypical ""feminine"" behavior/attire/interests were distasteful to me and I did not consider them appropriate for anyone of either gender. Being prissy, wimpy, crying, and concern with being pretty were all things I associated with weakness and inferiority, yet it was also obvious that they were things others associated with ""being a girl."" 

In my family, household chores were nearly all done by my father, since his profession allowed him more non-work hours. He did not take any pride or pleasure in these tasks, but nor did he appear to care that they had fallen to him instead of a woman. I did sometimes wish that my mother was at home to braid my hair and bake me cupcakes (things my father was also not doing) like many of my peers' mothers, but I didn't think it was her obligation as a woman to do so--I just wanted the braided hair, cupcakes, and other perks of having a full-time ""home-maker"" to serve the family, especially one whose sense of self-worth is wrapped up in making the fluffiest frosting in town. 

So on I went with my life, wearing jeans and t-shirts, often purchased from the ""male"" clothing sections to avoid inferior fiber blends and ""girly"" designs, with no gender-based instructions from my parents and no concern for the gender-based judgments of others, as I considered these signs of chauvinistic and backwards thinking. I recall being shocked and enraged when I was nine and a teacher decided a rainy day meant the boys could go outside and play but the girls could not, as getting dirty was apparently inappropriate for girls. I could not believe that any adult at school could treat us so blatantly unfairly, though I was well-aware that other kids' parents did behave this way often. I just figured this was because they were idiots. 

Through high school, I continued to not participate in ""girly"" activities, wear makeup, or dress in ""girl-clothes."" I resented being forced to take Home Ec, but enjoyed Shop class (at my school all students took both classes, regardless of gender). I actually did like to cook, sew, etc. but it seemed kind of dumb to have a class for it and the teacher would frequently make gender-specific comments (not to me, just in general), which was annoying. The idea that my gender was supposed to dictate my preferences, career, etc. was something I always resented. Unlike so many gender-nonconformists' reports of their upbringing though, I was literally taught from birth to resent this way of thinking; it was not me, a lone dissenter, standing up for my personal right not to conform; it might be fair to say that I was conforming to the ideas *I* was taught--that being female was something that historically had been grounds for discrimination and still was, but that it had no inherent built-in qualities (other than the reproductive role).

As a junior in college, my birth control failed and I got pregnant. This was a very painful experience: it was nothing I had ever wanted and having to tolerate the agony of pregnancy and giving birth brought home the biological injustice of being female in a visceral way. Somehow I survived though. I had chosen to wait to find out the sex of the baby until it was born, and was dismayed to discover the poor infant was a girl--she was disadvantaged by society and biology. It wasn't that I disliked girls or disliked her for being one, but like most parents, I wanted my child to have every advantage. Although I had few ""maternal"" instincts, I managed to raise her to adulthood. Through her childhood though, I noticed that things had shifted: unisex and gender-neutral were gone and girls were expected by most of society to wear ""girl clothes"" and play with ""girl toys""; everything was supposed to be pink and lavender and plastered with gaudy declarations of stereotypical femininity. 

Which brings us to the world today: I remain a non-makeup-wearing, non-dress-wearing, non-pink-loving, adult with female genitalia. Had I had a different upbringing would I now feel that I have a ""male brain"" and am therefore male? Is gender-specificity worth something after all and I should try to switch over? I would love to be treated like a male: reading of transmen's experiences has made me covet the male experiences that I never thought could be in reach. Being taken seriously for what I say rather than how I look would be great. People thinking my jokes are funnier would be amazing. Are those ""male thoughts""? 

Realistically though, I would never manage to pass for a manly-type male, since I am rather petite for a woman and my bone and skeletal structure are stereotypically feminine. Would transitioning therefore be a mistake, as I'd just be an even more confusion-inducing person than I am now (not that anyone has ever mistaken me for male--they just don't ""get"" why I won't wear makeup and heels, etc.), or have times changed enough that I should give it a shot?

"
katiecakesss,asktransgender,Last Night,"This is a rant.

Last night my father and I had another talk. What started as a conversation about my blooming military career spiraled into this anti-trans thing.

&gt; ""My best advice for you is to not mention any of 'this stuff' while you're in the military. You're *only* in there for *four years*.""

I told him I didn't want to talk about this until I move. I said every time he brings this up I don't want to talk about it. He disrespects me. I will never forget the time my mother cried as he cracked a joke about my private.

&gt; ""Well too bad. You're my son. I can talk to you about whatever I want to talk about. That's not your decision.""

He went on to say that transgender people were mentally ill. This is my fault (I'm sorry, I made a monster). I gave him that idea when I introduced him to dysphoria (telling me I was in pain and this wasn't my decision) and he took it the wrong way.

&gt; ""You don't treat mental illnesses by encouragement and making changes to your body. If you refuse to seek real help we're going to have some problems.""

I told him putting on makeup and nail polish doesn't make me ill, and I mistakenly mentioned my stash of beauty supplies. He told me to get up and give them to him so he could throw them away.

&gt; ""I don't want to see any of that *shit* in my house again.""

So I got up, left the room, and left our apartment. I lost it. I wanted to run away. Again. I only got down the stairwell before he stopped me.

&gt; ""Get back up here. ***Now.***""

I couldn't think straight. It's like I've lost control of my self. I just told him ""I'm scared"", but I had to give in. I only have a few more months before I graduate and get away from these people. I don't want to make this rougher than it needs to be.

I got upstairs and gave him the supplies. He disposed of them. This was the absolute *worst* kind of submission. He told me

&gt; ""This is my house, and you abide by my rules. Boys be boys and girls be girls. You are a boy and always will be. If you don't follow the rules we're going to have a problem.""

He asked me why I was scared. I told him I felt some aggression between us. Stuff like this has happened before. I was afraid it would break out into violence.

&gt; ""You have no reason to fear me. I'm your dad. I love you.""

And then he pressed me to be myself.

&gt; ""Stop trying to someone else. You are influenced so easily. Be yourself. You're a boy.

And he mentioned

&gt; ""Why 'Katie'[my name]? Is it because of Bruce Jenner? Isn't it a coincidence how close 'Katie' [my name] sounds to 'Caitlin'? You weren't like this before that.""

And he asked me why I 'want to be a girl', which I have no real answer for. This is why I want to speak with a professional that will ***work with me*** instead of telling me I'm just a gay man who needs to get a girlfriend urgently to make me straight (this has happened to me before). I said I didn't have the capacity to be as happy as the people on stage during the pep rally that happened that day. I found myself to be envious of the cheerleaders on stage.

&gt; ""See, this is what I mean. You're trying to be someone else. You want to be like the cheerleaders. Stop it.""

This whole time, I was shaking. Like, *really* shaking. My father said this was all just an act, just like I 'acted' to be scared in the hallway, which was to his embarrassment.

&gt; ""It's all in your head. That's the truth. You can't be a girl.""

Every time I want to add something, he interrupts. All of our conversations are rigged. He always wins. Politics, anything. My father was once a drill sergeant. You **can not** bargain with him. He always gets what he wants.

Last month my mother wanted to schedule an appointment with a *psychiatrist* (about this) but she could only get me with a school *psychologist* because I don't turn 18 for another three months, and I live overseas. My father said he will press on to get me to see a proper psychiatrist so they could convince me that I'm a boy. Regardless if that's true or not, I feel like this will only make matters worse. I can only use the military hospital, and I'm worried they'll spray out some shit like ""autogynephilia"" to make my father happy, or maybe they'll do something to prevent me from getting hormones. What if they say I'm delusional and try to diagnose me with a serious illness that'll prevent me from getting proper treatment? Or what if they put ""gender dysphoria"" on my record, which will delay my entry into the military? I don't know.

He said he is not giving up on me. He will do everything he can to prevent me from transitioning. He will cut my hair. He will throw away my beauty supplies. He will tell me to change my name back. He tells me

&gt; ""Most people who do this to their bodies regret it intensively and commit suicide. Have you even seen any statistics on this?""

Which is another thing, he pretends he knows everything about transgender people but he thinks it's 'just a surgery'. When I swoop in and say something he thinks I'm being a smartass, and when I try to correct him and he calls me a child, tells me to know my place, and says children don't talk back.

&gt; ""This is an irreversible decision, and it will ruin your life. People won't bother with you. In the military, you will be looked down upon. People will say 'Oh, he's that? I don't want anything to do with him!'.""

He made me a savings account for me to buy a car, but he said he won't let me use any of that money for my transition because

&gt; ""Not a penny of my money will go towards that.""

So yes. I was very sad/angry.

Today I talked to my guidance counselor about this. At first I was worried that I was blowing this way out of proportion. This wasn't abusive, it was normal for parents to do this to their children, right? I'll admit I was a little scared because she wears a catholic necklace every day. I said I thought this was something I should just stop talking about altogether, but she kindly asked me what the issue was and I trusted her enough to tell her. It went really well.

I told her all I want is for my father to stop talking about this *at least* until I move out. I told her about my other experiences with my family and she said she doesn't think I could last those three/four months without help, and that my father needs to stop. Unfortunately, there's not much we can do about it.

She is the only adult to have ever stood up for me on this (that I know irl, you're awesome). She totally gets it. She knew a lot on the subject, except about informed consent clinics and she said 'Bruce' Jenner is detransitioning to prove my father wrong ([a common myth](http://www.snopes.com/media/notnews/jennergender.asp)).

Today has been better, but I'm scared of when my father comes back.

One more thing is, she says I'm *questioning* my gender. Everyone who knows tells me I'm unsure. I'm not. I'm a girl full time. On the internet. But that's just pathetic/desperate/sad, right?"
discipleofgirling,asktransgender,Do you think that gender/genital dysphoria is akin to body horror?,"A lot of people don't realize how much unconscious comfort they get from being in a body they identity with. The genre of body horror shows the awfulness of being in a mismatched physical form. I feel like we in the trans community experience that to a degree. Certainly not so to a level of that kind of grotesque, but we are definitely disgusted with the bodies we're born with.

That being said, I think that cisgender folks might actually be able to better see where we're coming from. Give them an idea what drives us, not that we jusy up and decided we wanted to be the opposite sex."

I pass when people take a quick glance or if i I'm not under a spotlight, but in a one on one interview where I'll be *talking* a lot... I just don't know, probably not. I'm fine with being upfront about it, but I'm not sure if and when to say, ""yeah, I'm trans."" I know I'm not *obligated* to do so, but I feel like it would make me more comfortable knowing I've addressed it and made sure *they* are comfortable with it. It also doesn't help that I'm kind of nervous, seeing as this is would be my first job since coming out (and I really want this job).

scarn421,asktransgender,Medical Students Wishing to Be Competent &amp; Sensitive with Transgender Patient Care,"Good Morning Redditors! 

My name is Sydney. I am an occupational therapy student that is working on a project with a group of other OT students looking to explore healthcare disparities for transgender persons and how they manifest. Also, we are concerned with how  being a transgender person has impacted your ability to do the things you want to do, such as going to the store, using restrooms, completing the things you have to do in your daily life. Has it made it easier? More difficult? 

A little background. Occupational therapy is concerned with working with individuals to allow them to reach their highest level of independence in those activities they find most meaningful. Whether that be simply taking a shower or participating in meaningful social activities. We look at what barriers an individual with health needs has and how we can help our clients over come them to regain their independence. 

Also, we are looking to further explore common cultural beliefs and values that are within the transgender community so that we can work towards better client centered care. We understand that cultural beliefs and values vary greatly within any community, therefore we are not looking for a single answer. Rather we are excited to hear all of nuances about your community!

Thank you in advance for your time and sharing with us!
Sincerely,
Sydney"

I want to die but I'm terrified of death.  I don't know what good a hotline could do.  I don't want to break the hearts of those that love me either, especially my girlfriend, but I just feel like a monster around everyone, not myself, because of my body.  I just want to escape it, all I do is sleep all day, and I never go out and socialize anymore because nothing relieves this.  I never wanted my life to become this.  I don't even hate being trans I just hate my genetics and my body...fuck I'm like one in a million and I'm completely alone because of how enormous I am.  I can't do this.

zauraz,asktransgender,Small rant or something...,"Sorry but i felt that i needed to write down my thoughts. Have written here before but I can't cope with it...
Long post aswell.

Who am I? Is the question I ask myself nearly always. I think I am trans but this changes when i sometimes feel ""Ok, Being a man"" whilst at other moments I am on the verge of hating it and really want to be a girl. 

At moments I can only doubt and nothing else and I feel down and don't want to do anything. I hate my body and myself. I am probably the most ugliest and disgusting person alive... When I am at school or anywhere I try to hide the bulge my pathetic genitals make.. Worst of all is during physical education.

I have talked to a regular psycholog but he came to the conclusion that my main problem was my self-confidence and a depression that I have had since i was bullied several years back.

When I was younger I tried dressing in clothes of the opposite gender and have always dreamt and believed that I want to be a girl. 

Several years these thoughts where only in the background and did not affect me that much until I started talking to someone that came out as Intersexual. I  came out to her that I doubted my gender at times. 

New Year 2015 I told my two closest friend from my high school. They were accepting. This made me regret my choice to tell them but the moment i told them i felt amazing and I would even say good.

Finally I decided to tell my mother about this and ask for a gender therapist. I decided to not tell the rest of my family as I did not want them to know until i decided. My mother however accepting did not say anything about this when contacting the medical service in Sweden which is my country she did not say anything about it so I got a regular psycholog which told me what I wrote above about self confidence and depression.

During the evaluation meeting with psychologist I however mentioned that I was unsure but he just said that we would return to that later. 

My psychologist told me to stop researching and reading about the doubts as he believed them to make them worse. I stopped searching for info and it faded away a bit for some weeks but then returned with me losing energy and becoming even more depressed. During the time i did not have a problem I accepted myself as me and I have made my hair grow longer to trying to find myself a bit.

I am growing more and more frustrated of now knowing what I am or what to do. Am i really trans or is it just like my brain tells me some sort of phase or lie i've told myself...

I've lost all of the certainty that I had when coming out and the depression I thought I was coming out of slowly thanks to my new class but steady has only worsened in the last days to new levels. I have started feeling mentally exhausted in school and I have no motivation to study. I have at breaks pretended to sleep because I don't have any energy to try to pretend to be happy and socialize with my friends that much. It is not often but it happens. 

I try to hide myself and today was the first time I really felt that i wanted to cry. I did not do it and held it within myself but it was close...

I don't know what to do anymore..

eabrmposr,asktransgender,"Clocked at a distance, getting freaked out","EDIT: Yo I've been on HRT since 11-25-2015 so yeah that's only almost 3 months

This has happened to me a couple of times and it's really starting to freak me out. Last night this lady who needed bus fare basically asked ""sir, can you help me out...?"" from across the street, in the dark. Well, there were streetlights. I was wearing a bike helmet, backpack, lady coat, skirt, lady boots ... like, honestly what the fuck? 

Then a couple weeks ago I got clocked while washing my hands in a womens' bathroom. My back was to the door and to her. She saw me from behind and instantly freaked - not like, mad at me, but clearly confused as to why there was a dude in the womens' room. 

This is really gnawing at me. I'm not even particularly big - I'm about 6' tall but I'm pretty skinny. My shoulders are broad but I didn't think *that* much. I do have a pretty big head and my hair still hasn't grown out very long yet. What freaks me out is that these are mostly things that won't change with HRT or even surgery. 

Am I expecting too much too soon? Should I just be lowering my expectations? Do I need to just give up and start going out in boymode or something? I get my legal name changed with a new ID and everything on Friday. I'm starting to get scared of what will happen when I hand people a female ID and they just won't accept that it's me. "

I long for friends, so that's probably my biggest deciding a factor. A place where meeting like minded/open minded people isn't so unbelievably hard. Do you have any recommendations? Advice?

Catt_Nap,asktransgender,Trying to figure this all out,"Hello everyone!

So, after a strong bout of depression, I finally came to the realization that I'm transgender. I've wanted to be a woman my entire life and I haven't been able to mentally put two and two together until recently. Since then (about a month and a half), I've been happier than I have ever been and have been legitimately taking care of myself and my body better than I have my entire life. I want this to continue, and I want to keep moving forward. 

I just started seeing a gender therapist, and I think it's a great start... However, I feel like I want to just take the plunge and start on HRT immediately. I know there's an informed consent clinic within an hour of where I live, and it would not be a difficult thing to go and get a prescription. I'm unsure if this is a good way to go, and I feel like I'm split straight down the middle, 50/50 on what I should do. Should I hold off on going to the informed consent clinic, continue seeing the therapist and see where I am in a couple months, and hopefully start on HRT, and have my insurance company handle the expense? Or should I go for it, damn the expense (money's not really an issue here) and see how everything goes?

**TL;DR;** recently figured out that the nagging depression in my life is because I'm transgender. Started Gender Therapy. Could go to Informed Consent Clinic to get HRT now, or could wait until insurance will (most likely) cover it. Unsure what of what to do."

Bteatesthighlander1,asktransgender,"[NSFW] What are your thoughts on the Idea of ""Masochistic Emasculation Fetishism""?","I guess trigger warning for dysphoria and rape fantasies? 

I'm not especially into this, but it often comes up with some of the domination stuff I am. Which is to say, I'm not so much asking on my behalf as I am for wondering if this sort of thing should be thought of as like, bad or whatever. 

So subs like /r/MEFetishism and tumblr blogs like [this one](http://wxhluyp.tumblr.com/) (Yeah, the background itself on that blog is NSFW) talk about the idea of a ""masochistic emasculation fetish"". The basic idea is that its a fetish based around a man forced to act in highly exaggerated imitations of  traditionally ""feminine"" activities and often grow to love it, despite their better judgement. Which is to say, most of this is from the Point of view of the ""emasculated"" individual, with realtivity few people being into it from a dominant perspective (relatively)

The theory asserted by these people assert this sort of thing is fundamentally different then dysphoria because (keep in mind, these are not necessarily my opinions, I'm skeptical on these claims a few accounts)

1. It shows a highly exaggerated view of femininity under fairly limited circumstances,  often focuses on how people mock the emasculated individual, focusing more on humiliation then everyday life or one's own personal opinion. 

3. Women are not, typically, aroused by something like being seen wearing make-up in public or being seen in a dress, therefor people who have this fetish are not truly seeking to be more like a woman. 

4. EMF is fundamentally fueled by a fear of being humiliated for not meting society's standards of masculinity, rather then any legitimate medical concern. 

I guess, as a few general statements, do you think that engaging in this sort of thing encourages homophobia, misogyny, or trans phobia? I know there are a few different views on what does and does not count as kink shaming these days, so I'm not sure whether or not it should be thought of as appropriate to criticize this kind of thing.

Do you think this is a subsection of ""autobiographer"" that encourages people to rationalize their dysphoria? does that raise moral concern for the fetish? "
Throwawaytranswhat,asktransgender,What am I doing to myself?,"(Throwaway for obvious reasons.)

I don't think I'm supposed to be a girl after all. I thought I wanted to be, but suddenly everything feels wrong.

I'm telling people to call me a name that isn't mine. I'm telling them to use pronouns that don't reflect my sex. I'm taking pills of the wrong hormones for my body. I'm a boy, but my face is girly and my breasts are growing.

Why am I doing this? I have always known I was a boy. I didn't even begin questioning that until puberty, and it took me another ten years to convince myself I'm really a girl.

Yeah, I'm attracted to girls, but I'm asexual, so the fetish/autogynephilia explanation wouldn't make sense either. Getting off wasn't about pleasure as much as just getting rid of horniness - the one effect of HRT that *doesn't* feel horribly wrong. Picturing myself as a girl just made it easier.

Why would I be making myself think I'm a girl, and then convince everyone of the same, and go through the whole long and painful transition process?

I'm thinking of going back to a boy name and male pronouns again, getting rid of my girl clothes, and quitting hormones. I don't know what I'd do about my breasts, though.

I'm just a stupid boy who thought he wanted to be a girl. Can anyone help me figure stuff out?"

Anyways, is there anything at all I can say or do to at least smooth out his views. I won't be able to completely change his views, unfortunatly. Because of his relationship to the bible and God, I am a perversion to him. An according to his favorite apologetic (one he currently has a GoFundMe for so he can meet him in Isreal) I am just a freak who wants to dress like a woman and peep in bathrooms and all I'm going to do with the transition is peep and make other uncomfortable while not helping myself."
ka-teen,asktransgender,HRT drain off a lot energy ... How to you handle it ?,"Hi there !

I've started Oestrogen less than a mont ago ...
since i'am more and more frequently really really exhausted.

Before, i was on cypro for two month without any issues (in fact i was supa powa healthy then !!!) ...

I'am aware of all the body work of HRT, (as my breast already started growing with cypro).
But i'am still a little dazzed about how it feel right now ...
It look like i was more ""sensitive"" before i started oestrogen (far more emotive, a lot of heat puff).

Does anybody as some similar experiences ?"

dysphoricdude,asktransgender,Patches vs. injections,"so i'm currently on 3 .1mg patches twice weekly.. 100mg spiro 2x daily.. i've been thinking alot about switching from patches too injections and basically my primary concern is that the estrogen levels won't be as constant with injections as with patches.. i'm concerned that between injections the levels would drop too much and that i wouldn't be getting a consistant level of estrogen which means i would have mood swings and a whole other host of potential side effects.. 

can someone weigh in on this? did you switch from patches to injections? what happened? what's the difference in subjective effects? are injections as good as patches?

thanks folks :)"

NoLuck_butBacon,asktransgender,BCBS and Callen Lorde's HOTT question. Help please &gt;&lt;,"Hey everyone! I'm freaking out slightly/a lot right now.

So I entered the HOTT program at Callen Lorde and am going legit with my meds and stuff, yay!

Downside, lab work. 
Like, I'm pretty sure my insurance isn't covering it (if I read this correctly) and have to foot a bill that's over 1k now. 

HOTT said they'd foot the bill to anything the insurance doesn't cover, but does lab work count? 

Mostly for anyone else with Empire BlueCross BlueShield insurance having ever had the same situation.

eldritchterror,asktransgender,[MtF] What to expect for muscle loss/weight gain?,"I'm going to be starting HRT very soon (little under a month) and I just want to kind of prepare myself for what kind of eating habits I'll have to change and exercise and such. Right now I'm around 125 lbs, don't know my body fat % but I can tell you it's low. 

Right now I exercise about every other day, my routine is 100squats, 100 calf raises, 75 push ups, and 200 crunches. I add a few other things in to work on thighs and butt a little more in 3 sets of 10. I walk a lot and skateboard around town occasionally. 

My eating habits are pretty bad honestly. Like they are just absolutely atrocious. It's less of eating and more of just snacking most of the day on cereal and chips. They are in small portions though since I still use those little plastic kids bowls since they are just the right size heh. Whenever I do have an actual meal it's either fast food or a frozen tv dinner. I don't have problems with over-eating and I don't snack when im bored, or keep eating even though I'm full, ect. Occasionally I'll have some carrots or an apple, but I definitely don't eat as healthy as I should. I'm also probably drinking soda into an early heart attack, although it's diet so it's not AS bad, and I also try to drink at least 1 big glass of water a day. 

I know sleep schedules play a heavy role in this as well so I'll let you guys in on just how unhealthy I am. I'm unemployed right now and it's near impossible to find a job where I'm at (not even grocery stores or gas stations are hiring anymore :&lt; ) so my sleep schedule is all fucked up, not to mention I have insomnia. I normally wake up around 2pm even though every day I tell myself ""get up before 11, you can do it, you're literally already awake, just get out of bed!"" and I typically just play video games, read, or draw through the day while I pray there's a job opening somewhere. My meals are normally at 5pm and around 10-11pm. I go to bed anywhere between 4-6am and this horrid cycle repeats itself. I either go for my walks/skate around town/work out around 1-2am since it's normally empty and it's nice.

TL;DR: My life style is unhealthy, although thanks to the metabolism of a nursing wildebeest and being overly-self conscious about how I look, I'm no where near as unhealthy as I could be. What should I expect from starting hormones; will I stay about the same, or am I getting ready to blow up and gain 200lbs

foxfire66,asktransgender,How long did it take you to see improvement on your voice?,I'm mtf and hoping to get hrt soon. One thing that I feel would hold me back though is that I'm scared of hrt working quickly enough that my voice is still terrible by the time that I fail boymode. I've only tried a few times but when I do practice my voice it sounds terrible and I feel like I'm getting no where. I see no signs that I can or am improving. I'm wondering if anyone else felt this way and if so how long did it take you to start seeing improvement?
fnvt,asktransgender,Friday Night Voice Thread #200,"Welcome back to the weekly voice thread! This thread will be posted every Friday night here on [/r/asktransgender](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender) until the community loses interest.

So what is this thread? Simple: it's an attempt to encourage others to work on their voices, by showing the progress others have made on their voices over time. The previous voice thread is below if you're interested in seeing how we've progressed since last week. Feel free to post a voice clip, even if you're just starting out. I know it's something that's not easy or fun to work on at first, but trust me - once you get something that starts to sound good, you're going to get a huge boost in confidence!

**If you feel like you're late to the party, don't worry!** You can still drop a voice clip even if it's been days since the latest thread was created, and hopefully someone will help you out. Also, feel free to drop more than one voice clip in the same thread!

##Some tips for working on your voice:

* Stay out of falsetto! Falsetto is only useful in finding your head voice, it's not a very good place to go for finding a voice to speak in. Falsetto is the vocal range above your normal vocal range, and you should feel a ""break"" in your voice as you transition from your normal vocal range up into falsetto
* Work on your resonance! You should feel no vibrations in your chest when speaking. The target you're looking for is your ""head voice""
* To find your head voice, try pushing your larynx (the thing your adam's apple is attached to) up as far as you can, and attempt to ""throw"" your voice out of the top of your throat instead of your chest. You should feel vibrations in your mouth, teeth, upper throat and maybe even your nose when you're doing it correctly
* Once you get your head voice, take your guy voice up into head voice and you should get something that starts to sound female.
* Talk to yourself in your female voice when no one else is around, so you can build up muscle memory

##How to rate others' voices

If you don't know the vocabulary to describe what someone is doing wrong, feel free to simply state how close you think they are to passing. Please be honest and respectful, and don't tell someone they pass when you know they don't so that they don't end up using the wrong voice techniques. There's nothing worse than building confidence in a non-passing voice and then realizing it doesn't pass later on and you wasted your time.

If you are going to post your own voice clip, please help others with their voices as well! The best way to make this a useful thread is for everyone to pitch in :)

lemonslime,asktransgender,"Seeing yourself, trouble?","Does anyone else feel like they've never truly fully seen themselves in the mirror even after years of transition? Like I can kinda basically see myself in selfie photos sometimes but never fully at all in the mirror. It's because my body still has weird distinctly make parts to it (very large head) that are never going to go away so it's like just grey space something that I see, a weird mash of male and female not really distinctly one or the other. I see this all the time."
OccasionallyFriendly,asktransgender,"Uncertain If I am Transgender, Lot a bit confused :)","So I could leave you all with the boring details, signs I might be transgender and all those other wonderful things but instead I am just going to leave you all with how i am feeling right now. To put it simply for the most part during every day life any trans thoughts I might be having do not effect me or jump into my brain. ""they do sometimes when i see a really pretty girl and get sort of jealous"" But as soon as I am home alone especially during/right before bed my head seems to literally FLOOD with Transgender thoughts. for example: 1. I wish i was a girl 2. I Really want to be a mom someday 3. I wish i had boobs. 4. I wish i had a boy to snuggle and hold me close ""I know if i was gay I could be thinking that to"" But the thing that has me doubting myself is the fact when i'm out with ""the boys"" having fun it doesn't distract me but as soon as i am alone it seems to just consume my thought process sometimes. I'm literally the only 19 year old boy I know who still needs to be hugging a stuffed animal to fall asleep and it is super embarrassing. The hair on my thighs especially freaks me out. Sometimes when i get super excited i literally sound exactly like a girl and usually I try to act like I don't care cause i'm afraid if I get excited my Feminine voice will rise to the surface. ""it has happened before although no one has said anything I notice and am kind of ashamed like waiting for someone to poke fun at me."" I don't know now I'm doing what I said I Wouldn't do and making small random connections. But lastly when people call me by the female name I have thought of ""only in Online chat so far."" It makes me REALLY HAPPY and my middle name is so manly it makes me want to cry. Okay that is all sorry i rambled And thanks for listening! &lt;3 wait... reading ��

llamachurper,asktransgender,So I don't know what to,"I'm living in the UK right now, currently not out and quite unsure about my feelings right now. Ive had quite a few horrible anxiety attacks over thoughts that perhaps I'm transgender and ive been having these thoughts for as long as i can remember. I want to seek medical help but I'm unsure of the process of transitioning on the NHS/private and where I would start. Any resources or possible advice on the subject would be much appreciated as I'm almost at breaking point and I don't know what I might do to myself If these feelings get any worse."
betterindreams,asktransgender,I'm having a bit of an identity crisis in regards to my new name,"Hey everyone,

So I've been on hormones for just over 4 months now and I feel like I'm in bit of a lull in my transition right now. The first few months have been amazing for me mentally and emotionally. But because of my lack of patience, the slow physical changes have started to increase some body dysmorphia. I know in the next few months is when a lot of physical changes start to occur, but as I mentioned, I can be impatient.

So my mind has wandered to my name. I'm still undecided on my new one and now this is consuming most of my free time. I have a few that I'm mulling over, but I'm constantly checking out name sites to see if anything jumps out at me. Has anyone else gone through a similar process before?

Right now I feel like it's hard for me to start thinking of me as my proper gender identity with my old name. I was talking with a friend recently who said something along the similar idea. Right now, I feel if I lock down my name, myself and others can start to associate that name with me and the momentum of my transition can continue. Any thoughts on this part?"
isamystery,asktransgender,Advice for a job interview?,"Hello everyone! (posted on /r/ftm as well)

I recently applied for a few part-time jobs, during which (if I'm hired) I will be starting HRT. And, during the interview, I'm not sure whether or not I should bring up the fact that I'm trans? On both applications, there was nothing about gender identity/sex to fill out but I would like to make it clear to my employers that I'm going to be going through hormone therapy (so it isn't a surprise later). 

Any advice anyone can give me?

Thank you in advance!"
mrstalin,asktransgender,So I need some advice,"So I'm about a week away from being 8 months HRT and I've been really struggling lately with feeling invalid and like a freak, like I don't belong anywhere. I'm sure this is just internalized transphobia getting me down, but its really getting me. 

I can't see myself as a woman, I can't get mad in my own defense, I've barely been able to eat lately and I spent an hour and a half last night crying after I got out of my evening class. I can feel so hard for every single one of you, and I do, but the moment I think of myself I'm so hateful and I constantly finding myself trying to invalidate myself in my thoughts. 

Do any of y'all deal with anything similar, or have even overcome it? I just want to be myself but I can't imagine a future in which I'm happy. This isn't limited to other transwomen btw, I'd love input from anyone."

KrisEtKris,asktransgender,So... When the heck should I change my voice...?,"2 months HRT here and I am getting pretty feminine to the point where I feel like I will mostly pass in couple months but on the contrary, my voice isn't.

I am not saying that I don't know how to train my voice. My voice is fairly trained and I can pull myself all the way up to the female vocal range but I am afraid that if I change my voice right now, all the people I know would look at me weird.

So I have couple solutions I made up in my mind. I can either wait until summer break and use my female voice after I come back or just don't care about people's look and start using it.

Honestly, I don't know which one would be a wiser choice but if you were ever in a similar situation, please let me know how you overcame it."

While others have said my jaw is soft, my forehead is not overly masculine, and they've seen cis women with noses as big as mine.

Trans-Normal,asktransgender,Seeking Advice,"(Wall of text inc.)

I'm (currently) a 24-year-old man with a wife and a 6-month-old son. I've fantasized about being a woman since junior high, but I've had little opportunity to indulge my fantasies, growing up in a conservative Christian household (I'm now Pagan). My wife knows, and she's bi, but I'm pretty sure she would have a hard time if I chose to go consistently feminine even part-time. I'm also concerned about the impact on my son if I switch around or fully transition. Obviously, there's potential for discrimination, loss of friends and family, and issues with work in store for me too (currently unemployed).

To make matters more difficult, I've got a bass voice, stick-like figure, masculine arms and legs, and a desire to keep my original sex organs. I'm not even sure if I want to grow my hair out and/or shave my limbs, because I don't know how much of the time I want to be which gender. I have a wig and makeup, plus some clothes, but I rarely get to use any of it. I regret to admit that the vast majority of trans women disgust me--including myself--because I've got a really high bar for ""passing""... which I feel terrible about. I know a few other trans people, but it always seems like they have an easier time than me. Cis women are worse; I get turned on and jealous. In any case, I can't help but find my original self, as a man, ugly.

I've been dealing with serious mental health issues over the past year, but my treatment is finally proving successful. Unfortunately, that's left me with a lot more time to dwell on my gender. I'm really just not sure what to do. My wife's made it clear that she doesn't want to deal with this curveball right now, what with our baby and her school and my (lack of) work, but I don't know how much longer I can handle the confusion and self-loathing.

So. Any advice?"

I get this nauseous feeling because I see a man looking back and that's NOT what I want.

suyazus,asktransgender,Confused about my gender identity,"I already wrote about it on /r/lgbt here (please read it before commenting here) https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/449yrx/confused_about_my_gender_identity/ and as a result I was lead here. What I didn't mention in that post though is that another reason why I want hysterectomy is that I have terrible cramps and very heavy bleeding during my 9 days long periods. So now I guess you could say I'm fully ""a woman"" since my chest started growing too. But I've always had horrible pains on my period since I first got it. I don't want to be a woman, I don't want to wear this ugly title of a female, but nor do I want to be male or in any way associate myself with being a guy. I feel like if I get rid of my uterus I'll free myself from being biologically female. I feel like I'll finally find that place between neither genders where I'll feel comfortable. I wanna start wearing a binder too but I don't have anything to use as a binder so I'll have to buy it somewhere I guess. I don't know if I want a top surgery though, they're still small anyway even if they just started growing so unless they get too big I won't consider removing them. 

I get so uncomfortable, annoyed and dysphoric whenever I have to fill out an application and there's an option to choose between female and male. Why can't there be ""neither"" or just an option to ignore it???? Even on facebook when you go to your gender settings you HAVE to put something if you don't want default ""female or male"". You HAVe to BE \something\ T_T. I don't wanna be neither and I don't want a label but I feel so lost without one and if I do have a label and if I do admit that I'm not ""default"" I'm gonna be admitting that I'm abnormal and I'm trans and I don't wanna BE trans I just wanna be. Me. Somewhere in between or just completely beside the default. You know how in math they teach you about a line. That a line can go left into negative and right into positive (like male to female or smth). I don't want to be on that line at all. I don't belong there, I hate it there. I feel like I'm somewhere in space far away from that line...I don't know how else to explain how I feel...Please help me"

She mis gendered me at least ten times, and every time apologised and corrected herself. At first it didn't bother me cause I felt like she was trying. After it kept happening though, it really started to bother me. I don't know how I should feel because she did make an effort to listen to me, and to validate me, and I think it is just a case of her being programmed to not accept trans people, but trying to anyway, and having that societal programming fuck up her pronouns consistently.

redwoodheron,asktransgender,Estrogen: Equivalent doses between patch &amp; pill?,"Hi there! I did something really dumb yesterday and neglected to refill my E patch subscription (estradiol/Climara, .05mg/day) on my last patch day, at which time it couldn't be dispensed. I'm going to have to wait until Monday before the pharmacy can process my refill, but I do thankfully have some oral estradiol valerate (Progynova, 2mg) on hand.

Does anybody who's gone between these two methods of estrogen delivery know approximately how much of the pill I'd need to help keep my E levels up until Monday? I'm not looking to overdo it, just keep *some* E in my body; I recently tried to cold-turkey HRT (woo, family pressures!) and it made for a very, very bad time.

**TLDR(???):** Waiting on a .05mg/day E. patch refill until Monday. Have 2mg E. pills on-hand and want to maintain even a little estrogen, because going cold-turkey is rough. What's a safe/regular pill dose?

Seriously, thanks in advance for any input!"

Martha-Helen,asktransgender,Weird things going on with me; suddenly feeling cis after crushing on someone [crossposted on r/NonBinary],"Hello people. I currently identify as an aromantic bisexual agender transfeminine individual (woah, lots of labels there). Something happened, though, that is shaking me up quite badly on top of the self-doubt that's already there.

Yesterday, I fell for a girl at my school. I could only observe her from a distance, and as she smiled, something just clicked.

When I have girl crushes, my imagination gets sexual quite quickly, and with this girl, I feel the need to be a cisgender man and not the transgender person that I have been fighting for. This weirds me out because I now feel as though all the work I put into discovering my gender identity is gone with the wind once I'm kind of 'back in my proper role' (&lt;- read manly man). I wanna sleep with my crush, give them a proper fucking, generally just be 'the man they need' (how sexist is that?!).

Dysphoria becomes unimportant. The features I hated about my appearance are all of a sudden feeling appropriate. I tell myself I should actually rejoice because the burden of being trans is seemingly only related to me feeling as though I'd 'failed as a man'. But it only makes me more unhappy. I can no longer trust my own judgements. The reasons that make me want to identify as trans seem like a fraud, I become disconnected from myself.

I don't know what the hell is going on with me and I need advice ASAP. It's tearing me up."

EpigeneticMaiden,asktransgender,I can't shake my spectre...,"So Ive been on HRT for just over 2 years (845 days according to my phone). I always see other trans people (in news stories, on tumblr, or friends on fb) saying how after a few months, they start seeing their changes, that, to be cliche, they start seeing their real self. 

For me its been two years and I see none of that. My skin is softer and i have tiny boobs, but other than that I fail to see any difference. Everytime I look at myself, it feels like i still have my old maleness just exuding from me. The only way I can describe it is like seeing the spectre of him whenever I see my reflection. If feels like its gonna take saving for 4 years to get FFS before I might finally be able to look myself in the eye. Hell, most days I dont shower cos I can't bear to see myself still. 

So aside from the obvious self-pity, I was curious if anyone else struggled with lack of changes in their transition/taking several years to feel happy with yourself/if you ever get frustrated or angry with your transition?"

snowdemon177,asktransgender,Has anyone else initially thought they were binary trans but later on felt most comfortable with a non-binary identity?,"I'm 21 y.o AMAB person on 9 months HRT, Spiro and E. I came out and started transitioning as a trans female, but I have always been plagued by doubts as to my gender identity. I was uncomfortable with being a cis-male, and I was not a feminine man and did not want to be a feminine man. But at the same time, I felt uncomfortable with being a binary female (feminine or masculine or anything in between), and I would not feel right identifying as one even by myself in the comfort of my own room. I also was not very excited when a lot of the feminizing changes happened on HRT, and I did not care for my breasts at all - in fact, they made me feel worse and more dysphoric. I understand that I do not have to pick a label, and that there is no pressure to pick one. My therapist says that I should just present and behave however I want to, and explore different modes of presentation/behavior, which I agree with and have been doing. However, right now I feel pretty good about identifying as genderqueer. If I were able to cherry-pick traits, I would want female fat distribution, hips, a functional penis, no breasts, a male voice, a passably female face but not too feminine, and a more masculine presentation, to list a few. I just feel very comfortable visualizing myself as someone like this. 

The issue is: how can I become someone like this? HRT/no HRT will just push my appearance towards binary female or male, which I am uncomfortable with. My therapist mentioned something about titrating my dosages, and idea I am unfamiliar with. Does anyone else have any experiences similar to this or have any advice? Thanks all.

Osricthebastard,asktransgender,Guys I can finally breath.,"After my therapist (who was also prescribing my hrt) closed her practice down without warning and disappeared without any word, I spent a few months wondering if the rug was going to be pulled out from under me and Id be forced to detransition after only 4 months. I managed to find an ic clinic in my area and about a week and a half before my hormones were due to expire I managed to score another months supply contingent that I get my first round of labwork done asap, which I did. Then there was a mix up with the pharm and nobody could get in contact with my new doc and a solid 4 days before my script ran out I managed to get things sorted out. My dose was increased, then pending 1 month on the new dose I got more lab work done and my dose was increased AGAIN. She ordered the scripts for the increased doses right after Id just filled my next months lesser dose so now Im sitting on a fifty days supply and feel like I can actually relax about this.

If I wasnt sure if I was really trans when I started, all the fear and anxiety Ive felt over these dammed prescriptions sealed it. Im terrified of a forced detransition. I cant think of anything scarier right now.

Later found out my first doc got dementia and pancreatic cancer and thats why she closed down the practice and disappeared suddenly. Yeesh."

EmmaMD,asktransgender,Positive coming out story with the parents.,"I read/hear about lots of horror stories with people coming out to their parents about being trans. My parents are considered more on the ""liberal"" side of the spectrum, but more of the upper middle class type liberal, rather than the hippy love everyone type. (Just figured I'd preface the story with that.)

After my epiphany that I am trans and my subsequent beginning of therapy, I gradually came out to friends I trusted and knew would be accepting. Telling my parents always lingered over my head. Through Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's and until last week, there was this constant tension. I hate keeping secrets from my parents. I distanced myself and didn't talk to them as much. Even with the logical side telling me, ""They love you"", I was still terrified. I felt like they would be disappointed in me, or as if I failed them. Every time they referred to me as their ""son"" or their ""little boy"", it cut away at the attempt to mount my courage. I went to them several times with the goal of telling them, but backed away and would beat myself up for the two hour drive back. 

Finally, one day, the anxiety/guilt of keeping the secret from them exceeded my fear. Not telling them was holding me back from taking the next step. Despite all the best laid plans to come out with a certain strategy, I simply texted my mom telling her I had something important to tell her and that I didn't want her to tell my dad just yet. I assured her that I was not sick and that it was simply something that has been plaguing me my since at least elementary school and explained that it was the hardest thing I've ever done (including medical school). She replied back that they would love me no matter what. After further explanation, she sent me this. 
http://imgur.com/iTKnXah
(I then called her and ugly cried for a good hour on the phone.) 

Two days later I completed the letter, emailed it and then texted him saying there was something important and that I wanted him to call me after processing it. The wait felt like an eternity, but was realistically only about 10-15 minutes. My phone rang and he launched straight into saying, ""I will always love you more than you will ever know, no matter what gender you are."" We then discussed things, in between more sobbing. 

The next day, while I was at work, I got a text from him. It was completely unexpected. 

http://imgur.com/G9W4PmJ

I visited them that weekend and we discussed things further. Aside from the standard things that I didn't expect them to know (orientation versus gender, etc.), it went well and ended with warm hugs and a sprinkling of tears. They promised their support. My mom even told me she wanted to be with me for any possible surgeries in the future, as well as told me that she was going to send a check for sperm banking.

One week afterwards, I feel so much lighter. My thoughts are clearer. I smile more. Despite the long road ahead with the inevitable struggles, it is comforting to have the extra support. 

The moral of the story is that coming out is hard...really hard, but doesn't have to be the horrendous experience you expect. It can also be liberating.  "
[deleted],asktransgender,"I hate my voice, don't understand what's going on, should just give up.","I'm trying to read the MtF voice regimen, I'm reading resources to change my voice to female, I'm reading tips friends give me, I'm trying to watch videos.

bebopbaloobop,asktransgender,Question from cismale dating MTF,"Hello AskTransGender,
I'm hoping this an appropriate place to ask this question.  I've have been dating a girl for the past 3-4 months, she is mtf transgender, I did not find this out until about 3 weeks ago, she never mentioned it to me, never really hinted at it, and only revealed this fact to me as we were in the midst of being intimate.  I don't want to be distasteful, but I have no other way of saying it... I had no clue until her panties came off.

I paused, I thought a bit, and realized, that I really like this girl, this 'part' of her doesn't matter.  I don't know if I said the wrong thing and upset her, I was in a little bit of shock.  I looked her straight in the eyes and told her 'I like you so much.  I had no clue.  I'm a little shocked.  I am completely fine with this, but I honestly have no clue what to do next, or how to do it.  Why didn't you tell me on our first date?'

The moment was over, she was obviously a little hurt.  I didn't mean to hurt her feelings.  Things were a little awkward for the rest of the night, but we seem to be back to normal now.  After some discussion I think I have made it clear that I'm really ok with everything, we're still together etc, but she seems very reluctant to be intimate again, I guess that is understandable, I just don't know what her perspective about the situation is now.  All she tells me is I should know what to do and smirks.  Everything seems fine, except that the reset button has been pushed on being intimate.     

I'm not sure what I did wrong, or what I'm still doing wrong. At no time have I been a jerk about any of this.. Am I being unreasonable or stupid by asking her how to go about the love making?  I've only ever been with cisfemales, I barely understand how to do it with them.  Am I just stupid?  Or is she being difficult?  Please advise."

If I decide to stay with Joey as a nickname, I'd just feminize my birth name (Joseph to Josephine) and change my last name to Rose (I don't want any connection to my dad).

The name thing is the biggest question mark for me at this point, although they were everywhere at first. Living as the woman I am is approaching, so I gotta figure it out.

My ex-wife is in her life and although she is not perfect, I consider her to be a good mom because her main issues is more financial but she works and tries to get ahead in life but can barely support herself.  I only bring that up because I don't want it to sound negative towards her.  We have moved past most of our differences and we get along great. Truth be told, I consider her a good friend as I have been able to count on her when I've needed help.  I believe she has always sensed there was something up with me but she doesn't really know anything.

I'm sorry, about that being so long but I needed to provide some background before my question.  Once I come out and start to medically and socially transition, I don't think I will have much trouble with her if any at all but I like to be prepared to be on the safe side.

Is it possible that she or someone else could convince a judge or child services to take my daughter from me just for transitioning whether if my trans status is a direct or indirect reason?

My daughter is very well taken care and in fact spoiled.  I know my daughter can probably adjust to me transitioning(at least I hope) but if someone took her from me then that will devastate her and I both.  And although I can't see myself living as a man much longer, I would do anything if it meant that she would be safe and happy regardless of the cost of my happiness."
Sergeant_Static,asktransgender,"Use of the word ""Transexual"" vs. ""Transgender?""","So the way I'm looking at this pertains to the difference between sex and gender. From what I've gathered, *sex* pertains to biological and physiological characteristics and *gender* pertains to a social construct and identity, such as a person's pronouns.

Based on this, someone could make biological and physiological changes to themselves without changing their identity, and someone could make a change to their identity without undergoing any physical transformation. Logic would dictate that the former would refer to a 'transexual' person and the latter would refer to a 'transgender' person (bearing in mind of course that a person could certainly be both).

However, I rarely hear the words ""transexual"" or ""transexuality"" used; it seems ""transgender"" is used as a blanket term for everyone. Can someone explain this to me? Is there a reason that the word ""transexual"" is not frequently used? Is it considered offensive?"

I pass, and that was an issue for me, at first. 
Until it wasn't and everything that happened physically following that has just was 'right'. 

Life has followed a curve up until now, I've been severely depressed, and I thought I saw the light... the truth is, I've become more isolated than I thought possible. 

I work a 9-5, and that is basically all I am. I thought the transitional period was resolved, but you know, stepping back helps provide the larger picture. 

I've lost everyone, aside from my parents. Dating is basically a non-starter, and I'm starting to run out of video games...

I don't see a happy-ever-after, and I'll never have kids.
I'll never make much money, and I'll never find a purpose. 

My life rolls around in a never-ending cycle, and I can't find a drive to escape it.

wideopenseas,asktransgender,Am I actually a man?,"Sorry for using a throwaway account, I just don't want this tied in any way shape or form to my rl identity. 

I was assigned female at birth. However, I have never been comfortable living as a woman. Even as a young child, like in kindergarten, I hated wearing dresses and would throw tantrums if forced to. Eventually my parents stopped. My first boyfriend called me ""secret Asian man"" in fact because I have so many masculine traits-- I am good at science and math, I like driving, I like fixing things, I like video games and am extremely good at them (better than most men), I play a very masculine instrument, etc, etc. If you didn't see me or know my name but were just told about me and my interests, you would think I was a man. I also HATE how being a woman is so limiting. I have been subjected to sexist discrimination,  harassment, assault, the lot of it. I am fucking sick to death of it and I KNOW if I had been assigned male at birth, I would never have experienced it. I just lost a very good job because my boss wanted to sleep with me and I rebuffed him, which caused him to retaliate against me and when I complained, I was fired. I HATE living in this female body and I want a male one. I am just scared of coming out, honestly. Scared of what my family and friends will say. I feel like I would have to move to another city to truly be able to start over. 

Also I am short and I wonder how hard it is to be a short man.

Henchman24RIP,asktransgender,For those of you who have transitioned after 30 - How can I finally forgive myself for waiting so long?,"I've been struggling with a lot of things these recent weeks. Self hatred has been something I've pretty much always had, and as transition continues to be difficult, and my finances continue to be so dismal that after being full time for five months, I still only own one bra, it's not getting any easier. 

A sticking point is this massive regret about waiting so long, and a pretty hefty dose of jealousy towards the younger generation who has all of these opportunities that were never available to me. 

I knew I was trans back when I was probably six. In 1989, no one would've considered that for a kid, even though all of these really intense signs were there. 

When I was 14, which would be 97, I joined an email group that was moderated through Susans, specifically for underage trans people. I did that with an AOL account. I still couldn't do anything about it. 

I wouldn't let myself, because I was positive my professional sports career was more important, and I couldn't compete if I transitioned. I was competing internationally, full sponsored, and loved it so much that I couldn't walk away from it.

When I was 16 I bought clothes that I would wear after my parents went to bed, with money I earned working at a CompUSA. At the time I had the biggest crush on my best friend, and always fantasized about what could be if I had just been a girl. 

The cross dressing and information gathering continue through my early twenties, until finally in 2005 I started seeing a therapist. Eventually that led me to a specialist who is now a board member of WPATH. 

He cleared me for HRT almost immediately, and set me up with an endocrinologist.

I completely panicked. I couldn't do it. I was convinced I would just be some freak. There were no positive trans role models that I knew of at the time. 

I had already come out to four friends, bought clothes, and started dressing when I went out. It wasn't that out of place 'cause it was the goth scene in San Francisco. 

I hid from it from then until I was 32. The girl I nearly married knew, and we did some gender play now and again. I thought it would be enough. 

I tried very hard to become the guy I'd want to date, and to date the kind of girls I wanted to be. I thought I could live vicariously through them, and I hoped that would be enough. 

I'm finally past a year of HRT now, but with all of these stresses in my life, I find myself going back over all of these times and years when I knew, and didn't, or couldn't do anything.

I'm happy now that I've finally transitioned, happier anyways, but dealing with the dysphoria and intense self hatred through my teen years and twenties left me with a pretty destroyed life. 

I never honestly thought I would make it this long. By my estimation when I was younger, I'm already 10 years past what I expected my shelf life would be. I had four suicide attempts, two of which landed me in the ICU. 

How can I move on? How can I forgive myself? 

It feels like it will never happen until my transition is more complete, when I start passing, when my life is more solid and less terrifying every morning...

I would've passed so easily, and so well, and had all of the financial backing of my parents who had money, if I had just accepted this earlier. 

But I took the hardest path I could through my teen years and my twenties, and then when I couldn't take it anymore I transitioned at the single hardest point in my life. 

I can't forgive myself for the past, and I can't seem to have any hope for the future. "

Leconfuse,asktransgender,"25 male, or trans? (Nsfw content)","This is going to be awkward. Hopefully not offensive, but I apologise in advance. I'm 25, male, and autistic (if that has any relevance) and for ages I've had the question of my gender quietly stirring in the back of my mind and this week it's been constantly at the front of my mind. I should start where I first started to suspect; porn. I have something of a fetish for gender switch fiction. I've always thought it's just a fantasy, but a part of me wonders whether it's something more. I feel the need to say sorry again, I imagine you get this a lot. Frankly, I wouldn't even be asking if it wasn't driving me insane. I can only apologise and beg that you can take me seriously. I realise there is a million miles between fantasy and reality. I always hated myself. My mind, my body, everything. I always felt at odds with the societal expectations of manhood, to be some stoic, sports obsessed, insensitive asshole. But that's society's problem, not mine. But sometimes I think of what I'd be like as a woman and I feel just a little better with that idea. I don't know what any of this means. I realise there's not only two options here, it's a spectrum just like autism, which is one frustration I can totally understand, btw. People like their clean cut little boxes, I suppose. I just don't know where I am there. I tried to look for advice without asking but nothing was specific enough. Also there were just weird points like ""try it out"". How? Put on a dress and go to the local lgbt bar? I don't even know if I have a closet to come out of yet, so I definitely don't feel confident enough to go that far. Cant think of a way to do that without repercussions. Without people knowing and judging and never forgetting. Please tell me if you know of any ways. What if I were to discover I'm completely comfortable being male after all, then people forever thought I was in denial? That's the heart of the issue, I suppose. Fear. I don't want to be trans, not because I think there's anything wrong with that, but because I understand how much harder it would make things. I'm already autistic with depression and anxiety, I don't want to be any more disadvantaged. If only we lived in a better world, huh? I think I've covered everything. I made a separate account to post this, and I'm not confident in my ability to remember the password, so I'm not sure I'd be able to add anything later. I'm that paranoid about anyone finding out that I dare'nt even write it Down. Thank you for reading that brain vomit. I feel a lot better just to write it somewhere. And a third time, I'm sorry if I offended anyone. If it's any consolation, I'm very stereotypically British, I don't like talking about porn any more than anyone likes hearing about it."

crafting-ur-end,asktransgender,Clarification Welcome! How to be more aware or respectful.,"Hello! A few minutes ago I managed to piss someone off who I respect a lot. We're not really friends per say but we are both in a discussion group. For clarification, I'm a black female, call me P. Anyway I posted a meme that had been labeled racists and sexist and asked for clarification- the concept of it went over my head and a woman named A stepped up and filled in the blanks for me. The conversation went very well. Sometime later D comes in and starts discussing feminism. It evolved into a conversation about gender- particularly where gender stereotypes come from, how they evolved over time; stuff like women are weak and men are strong. I wanted to get to the origin of all of that and in the end D and I both decided that gender was a made up construct, it didn't matter (I meant this in the context of stereotypes). D is gay and has struggled with appearing masculine enough his whole life but he is not transgender. A little while later A flies off the handles and goes in on mostly D but it was aimed at both of us, upset at the cisist(?) language used and very hurt. I check the page sometime later and noticed that this was not a good thing and so to prevent an argument between A and D I just delete the post completely, seemed like the right thing to do. A flips out, post something up that's all righteous fury so I send her a message explaining why I deleted it and a very sincere apology, I notice we live in the same city and offer to apologize formally in person. No response. I also apologize on A's post in front of all the group members and formally explain to the mods. 

Please help me understand what went wrong? I do not want to hurt someone the way I've hurt A again. Also, please be a little patient with me, in on mobile so my grammar and spelling may be a little lazy and some concepts may fly over my head because I'm not in your shoes. I'll do the same.

gammaTHETA,asktransgender,An open letter to myself. (Chime in if you can help me!),"I've been thinking long and hard over the past four years about my sexuality and gender identity. Three things have remained consistent; I'm okay with Male or Neutral pronouns, I'm not into male identifying people, and a complete indecisiveness over what I want to happen to my sexual organs. I was born male and I want to remain male, but I want sex reassignment surgery. This isn't some kink I have, this is a serious thought that's stuck in my head for a long time. I haven't come across any other person who feels similar to me, and it feels pretty isolating. Furthermore, I feel like other people might see me getting SRS so I could be a ""half-ass"" transfemale while still retaining all the privilege I have from being perceived as a cishet male, even though that's not what I'm trying to accomplish.

It was very confusing to think about all this while preparing for life out of school so I decided to put it off for some time and come back and think hard about it later. Now is the time, and I still have no idea where to even begin. The psychiatrist I talked to seemed completely flabbergasted and wasn't much help to me, and my General Practitioner was even less help. My friends all tell me I can do what I want to my body and I believe them, but there's still this nagging feeling that I'm doing something other people would despise me for both within and outside the trans community.

Where do I start? Can I talk to someone who knows what I'm going through, if such a person exists? And is there a better term for my situation than a disgusting slur specifically targeted towards F-to-M trans people? What other questions should I be asking that I'm not asking?"
[deleted],asktransgender,Post-Op Depression. Therapy Results?,"Hi asktransgender,

I used to post here under a different name (YinYanga) but I deleted that account somewhere end last year I think. Not that any will probably remember but just incase ^^

So I am now more than 3 months Post-Op and I've slowly slipped into a depression;  it's harder to get through the day, less things excite me and at home I am being numb from being anxiety-riddled in public. I think of how feasible suicide or detransition would be. I only go out for groceries once a week and try to ventilate the house

I think the combination of having to stay at home for a longer period to recover, my obsession with passing/anxiety and it being winter just became too much

Just after Christmas I went to my GP to get a referall for a sexologist/therapist because I realized I wasnt going to get out of this and I want to work on some core issues because I've let this build up over the last 10 years, shortly after I came out

I wonder if someone is or has been in a similair situation? Its a lot harder to find resources and specific experiences once you're Post-Op but I feel like I am thrown back in time before transition atm. Which is sad but it's the way it is :("
kirito1342,asktransgender,If I transition how will it be dating.,"15 m here, I have dated b4 I have had about 3 gf and some other smaller ones that I wasn't sure if we were dating or not. I'm bi but I'm more into girls. And if I did transition I would be lesbian.

My personality is like a fun loving person, I admit sometimes I can't just shut up, but I'm NEVER going to take anything to seriousezezez. Screw dat I'm always going to find a way to laugh at somthing. My friends compare me to marciline from adventure time. But somtimes I get shy like telling my parents I'm trans lol. Also I have a dark sense of humor like laughing at others mistakes and a dirty sense of humor. 

To cope with being trans I make jokes about it. Like my friends joke around calling each other gay. Then I'd say I'm not gay I'm lesbian. Or I'd say something like a have a dick, but it's inside me and looks exactly like a pssy, but it's not. I can sit here for days talking about the stuff I say.

BUTTZ back to de subject. My therapist thinks I would be the perfect girl and I should transition soon. But I need my parents to know, and my dad getz prettttttyyy violent and he hates gayz. My mom either wouldn't care or convince me I'm not trans pft honestly Idk how she will react.

So I made a list of pros and cons to transition I want to do it but there's so much to worry about.

Pros: 

1. I can feel happy in my body,

2. I can be myself,
 
3. I can have my dream life, 

4. I can be how I picture myself,

5. I can be who I want to be, 

6. when I cosplay at my first convention I can be Ryuko from kill la kill lol it's somthing insignificant but lol.

7. I can dress as cute as I want. 

8. Being treated nicer

9. I can be a Tom boy and I think with my personality(loving batman, playing video games, and being femine) I would be a perfect girl and it's my dream life.

10. boobies lol I had to put it in the list it was to funny to pass up I'm very childish

11. I can dress how I feel

12. I can be the perfect nerdy girl.

13. I can be less shy to be femine.


CONS:

1. if someone finds out I'm trans.

2. Everyone I know would perceive me diffent

3. I will miss out on doing guy stuff

4. peeing sitting down lol

5. It would take a lot of time and work to change.

6. money

7. It would be hard to change my voice.

8. What if I don't like being a girl.

9. I have to be lesbian to have children because i wont have a egg like regular women. PS I want to be lesbian but what if I don't find a girl as a girl.,

10. Always being asked out.

11. transgender get paid less

12. I would lose my family.

13. what if I become a outcast

14. What if I get abused for being trans.

15. What if I decide to back out while on hormones and I can't.

16. Telling my family

17. For a while others won't tell if I'm boy or girl.

18. Being an abondond by my family and not having money because that.

19. When I'm around  my friends on instinct I act more manly (more douche baggy) so will that change.

So the one that concerns me is being lesbian. My dream life is to be lesbian have a well paying job and utube channel. Me and my girl friend will be in apartment or house that has white walls and grey carpet and we will both be playing video games on the couch and me and my gf will become famous on utube. 

Yay it's a pretty thought out dream right hehehe.

But what if I don't find that girl, what if I can only find that girl as a guy. But then again what if I don't find that girl at all. MHHH this sounds so deppresing and I don't like deppresing things (pouty face) but then again finding the dream girl is always hard right. Its not like those rom coms where the girl is right there.

I know that finding a girl the main part of transitioning but u know my life would be pretty complete if i had boobies lol. So any advice should i transition and if u can tell me i would love to know a way to tell my parents im trans."
stefy84,asktransgender,Disadvantages and limitations of being a woman,"I have been in touch with a gender therapist lately, and one of the the things which made me think most is the following. She told me that my desire to be female seems to be genuine, although it will take time to ascertain my transsexuality she said, but there is one thing I should absolutely consider: ""Are you willing to accept and embrace even the disadvantages and limitations that being a woman entails?""
Since for me it doesn't matter for me (womanhood = happiness), but I would like to show her that I've understood that, what are in your opinion these limitations or downside that I should consider? What do you think it's much easier as a man.
She went on to say: you will have to do a lot more effort in everything you do, you might be fooled by mean individuals, besides mentioning some other predictable details (wearing a bra, behave in a feminine way...).

Well I, guess that society's problems has nothing to with banks having low reserves of cash while loaning out big amounts of cash, people believing and not questioning ideologies and the human condition. 

 I find it comical that I can get so more dangerous things with much ease compared to get hormones. Its not like my less than average limp penis carries a bigger threat than a AR-15.

Kacie38,asktransgender,Has anyone had any experience convincing their employer to cover transgender surgery or any other treatments?,"I recently found out that my health insurance at work does not cover any transgender surgeries under our plan at work. The insurance company covers it under other plans.  From my understanding, the plan is self funded by my employer, meaning that my employer actually pays the claims but the insurance company only administers the plan and claims.  Long story short my employer decides on what to cover.

That said, my employer is actually a good company and I love them.  They been better to me than I deserve.  Also, they value diversity and they were praised for their equality and have strict non discrimination policies.  So with that I don't think they are excluding the coverage to be hurtful.

Its going to be at least a year or probably more as I'm only going to be starting hrt hopefully within the next month and hopefully living fulltime sometime after that and as you know I have to do both for at least a year each.  So I'm not quite ready to come out at work just yet so if I do this I would be outing myself.  

Would you recommend that I talk to hr about coverage or would you recommend that I not ""rock the boat""?  I suppose I can ask about this when I come out but I also can't wait until the last minute to know what is going to happen."

my partner is mentally/emotionally fragile, they I can tell have invested everything in me and I am the sun to their solar system, if you will.

I'm worried that if I come out, it would be like their sun going super nova, it would kill them. and they will panic and freak out . They freak out when ever anything bad happens and I am in a lot of ways their rock and sun and constant in the world..

now here I am facing the need (not want but need) to transition and I know this may be to much for them to handle, will likely be the end of my relationship with them, they have flat out told me that transgender is a fad :|. and on shows that have had transgender situations they always make light of it. so...

As for therapy, I'm sure it's very effective but I would prefer to use that solely on the side for assistance and therapy.

Lizasaurus2,asktransgender,Insecurity about my appearance.,"Hey folks. I've been fretting over my appearance recently. I suppose I want to be attractive but up until now I haven't been sure if I am. It's been bothering me. I'm done thinking about it and I've drawn a conclusion.

I think I pass (I get gendered correctly by strangers on Omegle) but I don't think I'm actually attractive. I don't get the same number of upvotes on subs like transpassing and amiugly that attractive people do. I don't get the same amount of attention and the same body language from strangers that attractive people do. My friends and family tell me I'm good looking but I can tell they're just saying that to make me feel better. I don't think I get as many messages on OKC as other girls do.

On their own, each point wouldn't make a very good measure of whether or not I'm attractive but together they paint a picture.

Anyway, now I need to come to terms with this. How do I do this? What has everyone else in a similar situation found helpful?

Sorry if this post just sounds like moping. I know there's worse things in the world than not looking good but this has been bothering me and I'd like some advice.

Patricia_W,asktransgender,Feeling dirty and unreal about myself,"Can anyone relate to this?
As a MtF transgender I knew deeply inside me for a certain time now that I would like to transition. But very often when I dress in my favorite clothes I just feel empty (don't know how to say this) and dirty, especially when I'm clothed up and looking in the mirror. The little devil in my chest comes up and does evil talking like ""I will never be a real woman"" or I feel very perverted and transphobic towards myself. It's crazy that I never feel like this against other transgenders, I'm absolutely fine with their desires, but there are days when I'm just totally down and feel like I could never be a real man but also no real woman. 
Actually I'm in this mood and had to took of my female clothing and replace it with my old male clothes, not cause I don't like to be female anymore but because I can't bear this feeling of dirtyness and disgust of myself in these clothes. ;(
That feeling brings my totally down whenever I think about it, today would normally be a very nice day but these feelings just ruined it for like half the day. Will transitioning help me over this, what do you think? Do you have/had these disgust of yourself too?"

AliceOfRohan,asktransgender,So my psychiatrist now thinks Im a transvestite.,"Some of you might remember me from this post about a week ago https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/43ujy1/ive_been_diagnosed_with_gender_dysphoria_a_few/ thank you all again for all the answers!

Im obviously still going to my therapy sessions, but now, the very same psychiatrist that diagnosed me with gender dysphoria now says Im most likely just a transvestite.

He told me that all transsexuals manifest what sex they feel like they belong to, for example, young boys playing mommy and wearing pieces of cloth like wigs or skirts, and young girls refusing to wear skirts and dresses among other examples.

My doctor asked me to tell him about when I was young; it was when I was about 3 or so that I wanted to wear my mom's and aunt's shoes. I loved to ""do"" my moms make up and couldnt wait to wear a bra.

When I was 9 I realized I liked girls, but it was at that time when a feeling of ""not belonging with the other boys"". I started to ""steal"" clothes from the laundry and would wear them in secret, this made me feel good, and I kept on doing it until 12th grade.

Around that time, with all the sex ed that we were starting to get, I started to realize that my body would grow into a very different shape than that of girls'. I started to grow jealous that I would never have hips, breasts or even a pretty butt.

Ive been in an unexpected depression for the last 2 years, on meds for 4 months. At first I thought it was the product of a relationship ending.

Last week my psychiatrist told me I had gender dysphoria; a couple days ago, after telling him a much more in-depth version of what I wrote here, now he says Im not a transsexual, but a transvestite.

Point is that I dont like to crossdress now because I dont like my body shape, and my doctor affirms that this is a Transvestite/autogynephilliac mindset. 

My question is, am I really A transvestite? I feel really down right now, I guess I was kind of expecting my doctor to tell me I was trans, even moreso, I was almost sure I was trans... Now, Im back at the start...

I've been in therapy for one year to help me discover the root of my cross-gender feelings *and* figure out if transitioning is right for me. In this year, I've uncovered 1) that my cross-gender feelings began as a young child (say, five or six) and 2) that they are not due to a serious trauma I suffered as a teenager; unfortunately, I haven't gotten any closer to deciding whether or not to transition. In fact, my gender dysphoria has seriously diminished in the past 1.5 months. Of note, I started an antidepressant about that time. My dysphoria has waned so much that I feel like I'm wasting money by going to therapy at this point because I don't know what to talk about.

My question is this: what is happening to me? Has the therapy/antidepressant ridded me of my depression and gender dysphoria? Has anyone else experienced something similar or have an idea about what is going on?

Hexavxozy,asktransgender,Defending Caitlyn Jenner got my mom curious...,"Did I just out myself? What should I do? I'm a 17 year old human questioning my gender identity. Recently, I've been beginning to think that I would be happier off living as a girl and I wish I would have born female. I'm still debating whether or not transitioning is right for me, but being a minor, I feel I can't get the help I need. I've been avoiding telling anyone except for a few close friends.  The only thing stopping me from talking to a professional is my fear of talking to my parents about my issues and being made fun of or not being accepted. I feel like I can't tell my parents anything and it really makes it hard for me to ask them for help, especially with something like this.

Today, my mom and I were sitting downstairs in the family room. My mom had some show playing with the Kardashians in it (some of you know where this is going. My mom starts talking about Caitlyn Jenner and how the situation is strange, ""What if that was your dad?"", ""Which one is he, a boy or a girl"", she wouldn't know how to feel about it. I was getting rather uncomfortable at this point and said something like ""I don't think you understand the situation"". My mom immediately ASKS ME IF I'M A GIRL. My heart starts beating so fast and I get super nervous and don't answer. She continued to ask me similar questions like: are you going to turn into a girl, are you a girl, do you think you're a girl. I didn't answer and was silent. She asked me if I was going to answer her questions and I blurted out ""I don't want to talk about it"" and went to my room.

My mom definitely knows something's up, between this confrontation and multiple other incidences that most likely tipped her off. I don't know what to do. I feel like my parents won't be able to handle the fact that I am transgender and won't accept me. If you have ever been in a situation similar, please let me know what you did and what helped you, but any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading my rant.

also have a senior project i am constantly falling behind on. its a simple enough project, but i just cant motivate myself to make it. 

my mom is getting surgery. i dont remember what its called, the one where they remove some of her uterus? i dont remember exactly. but thats stressful as fuck.

then the little things. i produced some rap music, and tried to rap over it. i hate my voice so bad. i scrapped it, will probably never release, which really disappoints me.

then every night looking in the mirror. im sick of seeing my face there...

it all just hit today. i started crying in class. everyone ignored it except for the teacher, who tried to calm me down but it didnt help. i just worked and held back the tears to avoid further embarassment and moved on through my day. no one has asked me how im doing in years it feels. no one would care to listen anyways."

First thank you all for creating this space.  I work for a therapeutic community.  We have developed a group for female identified sexual violence survivors.  We have clinicians that are currently trained only in mono-gendered interventions.
I welcome all insights.  I am sorry to say our staff is not currently trans* culturally humble/ competent.  

Would a flyer which says:
Group is open to female identified survivors. 

Signal that is a space open to those who feel significant connection currently or at any point with femininity.
Should we re-work the outreach materials?  I would prefer not to make any identities a footnote or asterix.    

Thank you for your insights in advance!

3. I had one use left of my Bumble &amp; Bumble shampoo, and all I thought about all day was coming home and washing my hair. Mom threw it away. Yes, I cried over shampoo today.

4. I drop a plate on the kitchen floor and it shatters into like a million pieces. My dad bolts in and starts playfully chewing me out, I have no idea he's joking, I start balling until he stops apologizes and gives me a hug

jiffypop45,asktransgender,Would adding finasteride to my HRT regimen improve hair growth beyond just Spiro alone?,"First some background about how my hair ended up in the condition it did.

I was dating a woman for close to seven years, we broke up and I took it pretty hard. I started exercising to get revenge on her. I shed 55 to 60 pounds in around 6 months time due to overexercise and an awful crash diet.

Eventually the exercise started giving me palpitations so I stopped working out but kept the diet. I'm 6'0 and weigh around 145. In hindsight I'd say it was a comorbidity of anorexia and gender identity. Women are thin, and that was one of the few things I could do to feel feminine.

Fairly recently I started having a lot of anxiety over my ability to grow out my hair  in addition to IBS symptoms I would contribute to a new job and my gender identity problems. Hair loss is not in my family. My mother's father is 90 with almost all of his hair.

I have since completely altered my diet. Prioritizing lean proteins, omega 3s (I take fish oil anyway), and I've added vitamin D with a multivitamin meant for hair and nails. I'm considering adding biotin in as well at my therapists suggestion. My stomach has felt much better and I'd like to think my hair is better it's much thicker though the front is still thinned. I'd say it's only been around a month so I am unsure of the time frame I need to be looking at.

I started HRT yesterday (yay) and am taking 100mg Spiro twice a day then 2mg E twice a day. I find very little written about Spiro and hair regrowth as most of what is online is in reference to finasteride. I did see in more than one place that individuals had done both at once.

I'd like to give myself my best chances of growing a full head of long hair. Would it be beneficial to ask my doctor if they would add finasteride as well or is Spiro doing effectively the same thing?"
transbutterfree,asktransgender,"Can the T blockers just ""stop working""?","Hello there! So, I have been on HRT since December last year and it was having some interesting effects on myself. Mood changes right on the first week, as well as erections becoming quite rare (yay). Then two weeks ago more or less, breasts buds appeared (they might have appeared a little earlier than that, but I only noticed them because of the pain &gt;_&gt;) and after freaking out about them a bit, I was really enjoying groping them and stuff. Fast forward for this week and... the left breast bud seem to have shrank a bit (the right one is the same size, but it doesn't hurt anymore), the erections are much more frequent again and I am not sure if my mood is worse than before because the blocker isn't working *or* if I am getting stressed because I think it isn't working. 

tl;dr: The testosterone blocker, which was working fine so far, seems to not be working anymore. Is that a thing? Might my body be fighting against it and producing even more testosterone? I can't visit my endo until mid March more or less, so if that is the case, I am screwed :("

veloci-nap-tor,asktransgender,How to deal with irritation during electrolysis sessions?,"I've recently started electrolysis, had 4 sessions. 

The first 2 sessions I was fine. I didn't use EMLA cream and it just hurt which I can deal with. 

But the most recent 2 sessions the pain of electrolysis was accompanied by a feeling of irritation. 

It wasn't present right from the beginning of the session, but like 20 minutes into it, the irritating feeling started to present. Then when she moved into a different part of my face the irritating feeling went away at first, but eventually came back. 

I'm thinking either the EMLA cream is having something to do with the irritation feeling, or because I've just started electrolysis and haven't had more than 5 days between a session since I started that my skin is still sore and healing from previous sessions and that is what's causing the irritation feeling?

If I'm wrong on those, how do I deal with this irritation feeling? "

* Planning my transition. 

* Driving across the country.

The list could go on and on. My transition is a good example. I've been planning it since I decided I wanted hormones back in high school (I'm 26). 

My trip across the country in my car included a lot of unnecessary items just in case.

I met my wife by having my bouncy ball ""veer out of my control"" and land on her keyboard. Allowing me to apologize and introduce myself. 

I obsessively plan sometimes. I have a ADD and in this particular aspect is a great help becuase I can simultaneously run through parallel ""what ifs"". Imagining what can be said, what the response is, what body language I need, and ect. Though I plan pretty obsessively, I also can see when I'm "" falling down a rabbit hole"" by following a though way to long. I just say screw it and get on with implementing everything. 

But you know what. When shits getting real and my planning has made everything easy, I get nervous. Waiting for another shoe to drop. 

I'm officially out at work at the beginning of March. Name change, business cards, the works.  This will also be the day I go full time, as I still present in boy mode/butch lesbian mode at work.

nervousyounghuman,asktransgender,Not sure if I'm transmasculine or just a really masculine girl.,"Hi everyone, you're probably tired of ""am I trans??"" posts so I'll try to keep this short :) 

For several years now I've been questioning my gender. I'm AFAB but I've never felt entirely comfortable being a girl - or more accurately, being ""feminine."" At one point I identified as a transman for a month or two, but being and acting completely ""male"" never seemed to fit me that well either.

I feel like I've always identified with masculinity more than femininity. And I don't just mean masculine in the way I dress (although I do often dress like a guy), or by having stereotypically masculine traits, but in this deep sort of sense of who I am. 

For example, I:

* Can't relate to women that well unless they're pretty masculine too, and a lot of my best friends have been guys. I just find men a lot easier to get along with, and I often feel like me and guys think alike more than me and women.

* When watching movies, 90% of the time I'll identify with a male character rather than a female one. And on the rare occasion that I do identify with a female character, they'll often be quite masculine (think [Vasquez from Aliens](http://www.writeups.org/img/fiche/2263a.jpg)) or they'll be a female character crossdressing as a man (Mulan was basically my favourite movie as a kid). I also relate to transmen a lot.

* Would love to have masculine-type appearance (broad shoulders, short hair, big muscles, etc.) but don't really have desire for a penis or to remove my breasts completely (though I'd love for them to be smaller).

* Don't actually dislike female pronouns, but really hate being referred to explicitly as a girl.

* When thinking about the future, picturing myself as a woman - *especially* a stereotypically feminine one - just feels absolutely bizarre. 

Has anyone else here felt like this and know what to do from here on? Any advice would be hugely appreciated :)"
Kacie38,asktransgender,Video games vs dyshoria?,"This may sound like a strange topic but I got up in a good mood this morning and was thinking about my life when I was younger.

Until recently I didn't realize I experienced dyshoria earlier in my life. Even when I was in denial about my gender issues I often imagined being someone other than who I was born in and video games was a huge part of that since I was a kid.

When I would get home from a school I would often escape to the world of Nintendo and in I would think of myself as the character and the obstacles and enemies in the game represented the problems in my life whether it was bad grades, bullies or family issues or etc. 

Looking back I'd have to say that I became highly addicted to gaming. A sort of Funny memory was about a year before I realized that I would be more comfortable as female was on Christmas Day in 7th grade.  Super Mario 3 jujust came out and we got it for Christmas. I played it all day and started developing a high fever and tried to take a nap. My parents tried to wake me up and got scared because I was hallucinating thinking I was in the game and told them ""don't make me cross the pipe!"" Lol. I was much better when I got outside for some fresh cool night air. Lol.

But if continued to be addicted to games and thankfully nothing like that happened again.

But thinking about this got me wondering that maybe the reason I never recognized dyshoria is that Maybe to some degree I had opportunity to experience different roles even if it was all in my head.  Considering there were not any resources available like today I'm thinking that this was good that I had some form of escape.

What do you guys and girls think and did you have similar experiences?"

I just want to say thank you for being there for each other and for being so damn supportive.

When I was 7-8 I had my first sexual experience with a boy my age, who wanted me to pretend to be Lara Croft while he dry humped me. I remember feeling absolutely revulsion during it and having to stop, which mirrors the revulsion I've had whenever I've reached orgasm from looking at the porn I do now (sissy stuff, mostly), or from my limited sexual experiences with guys.

Honestly I might just be gay and so deep in the closet that I've made a portal to a place where I can be whatever gender I want. The notions of being a girl started when I was around 18-19, *after* my first experiences with marijuana, which I can't readily discount as coincidence. First time I ever sucked cock I was high as fuck (not recommended for your first time by the way). But then again there's the countless nights where I'd go online and pretend to be a girl to chat to guys and get them off.

You might guess at this point that I have a serious addiction to porn. I can't take a break from it but I'm not sure if that's because I'm not satisfied sexually in the way I truly crave it or if because the addiction is pathologically severe. I also worry about things like estrogen exposure mixing around with my emotions and state of mind. Meanwhile I've been so diligent in taking care of my body so that I can be a proper looking femine sissy for guys while having the most masculine body you'll see. I'm not sure if I'm in a trance when I'm focused on that part of me or if I'm opening up my real identity. I have no idea what it means to be a girl, but I know it doesn't mean having smooth skin, or dressing up in a skirt and going on webcam to fuck myself with a dildo for guys.

I really don't know where to start with my problems so any insight would be greatly appreciate.

Also, we would love to find some trans resources in St Louis. Illinois has also expanded Medicaid and we are within the 133% poverty line.  Does Medicaid cover transitions?

Thanks, everyone."
cb4jc7,asktransgender,"I only feel dysphoric when I dress as female, so i guess the solution is just never present as F...right.......RIGHT?!","My whole life i've wanted to explore all things feminine.
Most of my life I ignored it and i was ok with ignoring it.
But it's 2016 now, i'm grown and people are a lot more accepting then they used to be so I decided to explore because why not?
Now whenever I try presenting as a woman (alone or with 2 close friends) the dysphoria is REAL, and I just wish I could ACTUALLY be a woman and I don't go to bed happy.
So what is the point? I'm thinking i should just go back to ignoring it...even if i do enjoy it at first...after a few hours as a woman I start to get sad and depressed and confused and lost."
doughaway7562,asktransgender,How long is the awkward androgenyous phase?,"So I've been awkwardly androgenyous for the past month or so - sometimes people stare at me, and I've been told people mistake me for a girl initally. It's been a lot more awkward than I thought it'd be - in boy mode, I wonder in my head if someone will think my hair's oddly long, or notice my chest. I'm not quite ready to do girl mode either - I pass, but throughout transition I went to being read as a guy, then a younger guy, and now an older lady. My body's also passing but not quite blending yet. So now I'm kind of just awkwardly waiting for when.

I know that it's YMMV, but how long did it take for you to leave the awkward phase?"

DJThrowaWeight,asktransgender,"How to cope with waiting for GRS? (TW: surgery, self-harm)","Longtime lurker, first time poster, created this throwaway because I have so much guilt right now...

I need some encouragement and validation. I am really struggling to keep my head while I wait for surgery for 2 years. I am 6 months into a 2 year wait that seems like forever. I feel so impatient and want relief so bad, my dysphoria has ramped up to a level I have never experienced before and was not experiencing prior to accessing the wait list. And yet, I also feel so ashamed of myself for the feelings I have.

 I worked really hard at my company advocating for comprehensive trans care through our insurance. And after a year and half of battling HR and executive teams, our company purchased the extra trans rider from our insurer, which has granted me and our other trans employees the ability to seek GRS surgeries. 

Now I am on a waiting list and struggling with the wait. I keep trying to reframe it as positive that I made it here at all and how fortunate I am to have surgery mostly covered and that the financial impact for me will be 1/5th of what it would be out of pocket. I am so lucky in this regard but I have massive feelings of guilt and shame for being so impatient for this relief. There are so many out there who have so many barriers facing them to getting an opportunity like I have. 

And at the same time, my dysphoria is ramping up so much so that I had to go onto anti-depressants for the first time in my life. Feelings of self-harm are always on the edge of my mind, which is something I haven't felt in almost a decade, and I don't want to feel. My sex drive is nearly non-existent which was not the case before. There's a light at the end of the tunnel but it seems so far away, and maybe there's a chance I move up on the waiting list, but I am so afraid to get my hopes up that it could come sooner. 

I am sorry if this offensive to anyone or if I come off as whiny. I am just scared for my mental health and I am working so hard to keep myself healthy, working to strengthen myself for surgery (eating better, 2 months tobacco free, more exercise), and yet I am in so much pain from dysphoria. I am so afraid I am not going to make it the two years. Not like I want to off myself, but like if I can't maintain my mental space and health at work then I could lose my job and shot at surgery. Everything feels like a threat to that right now, and I may be my own biggest enemy and hardly know it. My job is very tough and deals with other people who have mental health issues and may be experiencing their own dysphoria. It's very hard to deal with on a day to day basis and can be very triggering, but at the same time I love it, AND it might not be the best place for me right now, considering how my mental space is.

Has anyone had experiences like this once they got on the surgery list? It's like everything for me became such a struggle after. I can't concentrate at work, it interferes with my relationship, and I am just CONSUMED by the need for relief. 

How have/did you kept you sanity while waiting?

I don't want to tell my gender therapist or anyone for that matter about this because I really want (and need) to be able to get certain trans-related procedures done in the future.

eabrmposr,asktransgender,Weight gain on MTF HRT?,"I've always been pretty skinny - and this has recently become something of a concern to me. As I understand it, most of what goes into ""passing"" for MTF trans folks is fat redistribution. The problem is, as I see it I really have hardly any fat at all to redistribute. 

I'm also vegan and I mostly get around by bike. I enjoy this lifestyle for health and ethical reasons. But will that affect how my body develops and feminizes over the course of taking HRT? Is there anything I can do if I'm worried about it? 

Sorry I've been posting so much lately, my brain has just been bombarding me with all these questions and fears and insecurities and I'm not really sure where else to take it."
lilit3k,asktransgender,Anyone else got their Cypro cut from 50 to 25mg ? Any adverse effect on your transition ?,"I had my 3 month HRT appointment with my endo earlier this week and I told him about some weird side effect I had that I never read about anywhere else on this sub (small bladder ""leaking"" shortly after going to the bathroom, frequent dizziness when standing up, dry mouth when sleeping)

I ""was"" on 50mg cypro/4mg E oraly, and since my T levels were kind of low enough (0.61 nmol/l) and that I has some weird side effect that he himself never heard of from his other transgender patients, he told me that lowering my cypro to 25mg could help reduce these side effect without letting my T go back up that much. He then told me to renew the same prescription (50mg Cypro) but cut pills myself and go on this dosage for a month, and then get a bloodwork done so we can see if the T is still somewhat suppressed effectively... and if my side effects are at least a bit reduced.

So a few days went by and since I started this new dose, I don't feel the same state of ""peacefulness"" I had before and I it seems that some of my aggressivity went back from the grave just a bit. Could it be that my body is currently adapting to the new dose ? Should I wait another couple of week before reverting to my usual dosage ? but more importantly, anyone else got their cypro cut in half like this but still got low/safe T level afterward ? (That is actually the main concern here honnestly).

I must also admit that my somewhat weird sides effects ""seems"" to be indeed reducing after just a couple a days on 25mg.

So I think I think bad things about chronic illness. I sort of think about having chronic illness a lot. I entertain the possibility that I might have X, Y or Z disorder more or less all the time. It's bad and I think I just figured out why I do it.

I'm trans and I want people to stop hating me because of it. I maybe if I had enough chronic illnesses then people would actually feel sympathy for me instead of contempt. Maybe people would realize that my life sucks and I'm doing all I can to make it better.

I know that it doesn't work like that but I still can't stop myself from thinking about it. Worse, I'm now constantly doubting the diagnoses I *do* have.

transthrowawayasdf12,asktransgender,Am I a fraud? I don't know what to do...,"This is causing me some internal struggle and I would like some opinions about it all.

I've never had any feelings of being MtF until around 20 and never really even considered myself gay/bi/trans for my entire life until then, though I was never very interested in women either and was more ""asexual"" than anything. I guess it all began when I started watching gay porn and porn featuring transgender women. Things eventually progressed to sissy hypno and things of that nature. Eventually I started feeling dysphoria but I never was sexually aroused by thinking of myself as a woman... I just started to be uncomfortable with myself. It's like watching porn turned me transgender or at least made me realize that I've had this issue and repressed it. I started getting debilitating depression from my dysphoria after I realized that my body and the way I was treated socially wasn't right. I started disliking my private areas and quit watching porn for the most part. I went to a therapist and lied about my life saying that I knew for a long time and was suicidal about it in my teens. I eventually came out to my parents with the same bs story. I guess I was afraid of being seen as illegitimate and a fetishist even though I experienced no sexual pleasure from dressing as/being a woman. I also was afraid of being in therapy for a long time before I could start hormones. Eventually I got on hormones and was really happy about the whole thing and all its changes. Cut to nearly a year later and I pass just fine, most people have no idea I'm trans, have a new name, and am never misgendered. I have a boyfriend and new friends who know my past as the story that I made up for my therapist and parents (who are accepting and said that they saw the signs as I was seemingly depressed and never interacted with anyone... my mom asked me if I was gay a few times in the past). I couldn't really see myself being intimate with a woman now and am sooo much more content with how I look and feel. I've never had very many friends before and now I'm fairly popular and social.

All this and yet I still feel like a fraud. I feel like at some level I might not really trans because it started with pornography. I feel like maybe I convinced myself that I'm trans because of some sort of life crisis or mental issue. The thought of detransitioning scares the hell out of me and I just couldn't go back living as a guy. My interests and personality are so much different even though I never tried to change them, it really is like I'm a completely different person. I feel like the person who I was before is gone and I don't really even relate to them anymore as if there is a void in my past. I'm so much happier and social and a lot of issues were fixed but I still have this feeling of being a fake that I cant shake. I don't really think about it all too much either, though I have occasional anxiety attacks and I think they're caused by my repressed feelings of being a phony deep down as well as living a lie to my boyfriend and parents. There's no way I could tell them the truth, it would make them think that I'm crazy and my life is amazing right now and just getting better.

I don't really know what to do or how to accept myself better. Am I a fetishist even though I have no signs of autogynephilia? Am I crazy? Does anyone know of anything I can do to curb my anxiety?"
psylockebutfatntrans,asktransgender,On hormones for 5 years. Restarted medicine for hypothyroid and my breast feel like they're growing again.,"I don't know if its a coincidence or not. After a few years on hrt, I was put on a thyroid medicine. I eventually stopped taking it because I felt no change. My doctor recently suggested I start taking it again, which I did. 

Within a week, both my breast were tender again. It feels like they have buds and are literally starting to grow over the past 2 weeks. I've been wanting to switch from pill to shots for a while because this is probably the 3rd time in the past 3 years that I've felt like this was happening.

My numbers have always looked good, but I'm thinking maybe hrt wasn't as effective as it could be. I've been bouncing around and just using rural doctor for the past year. I'm in the process of looking for a doctor covered by my insurance. Hopefully I'll be able to see an endocrinologist for the first time in the near future.

the_omega99,asktransgender,"Avoiding ""sexy thoughts"" post GRS","So I was reading an account on GRS with Dr. Suporn which mentioned being instructed to avoid arousal for some period of time shortly after GRS (a few months or so), as it could cause bleeding and damage. Although my question is for GRS from any surgeon.

My questions for those who've had GRS (or done more research into it than me):

1. Just how severe is the pain, bleeding, and possible damage?
2. When arousing thoughts inevitably happened, was it easy to dispel them?
3. What did you do to avoid arousal? In particular, how did you deal with having a relationship at the time, movies bringing up arousing ideas, and other such possibly unexpected sources of arousing material?
4. How long did it take before you could pain free (and bleeding/damage free) feel aroused?
5. Mentally, I can't help but picture that once I have a vagina, I'm going to feel a strong desire to try it out. Even before I physically can masturbate, I assume I'd feel that desire. And that's pretty arousing. Did you have problems with that? If so, how did you deal with them?"
FromCirce,asktransgender,Some questions about starting HRT,"Okay. I'm realizing that I'm mentally ready to start hormones. Unfortunately, this is about a month out from the earliest I initially planned to start taking them, and I had some good reasons for waiting a month. So, now I've got some questions to help me decide if I want to start early.

First, are three and a half months a short enough to time on hormones that I can be relatively sure I can hide any effects? I'm living in an all male residence house until the end of the semester, so if I suddenly have boobs, that might cause some problems. I already know I have enough privacy to wear sports bras regularly, and I'm pretty sure that unless I'm in the fastest developing 1%, I should probably be fine, but I just wanted to check with other people.

Second, what is the first appointment with the doctor who will be prescribing the hormones be like? I assume there is blood drawn but is that it? I've been referred to a particular Doctor by my therapist, so I assume he won't be judgmental or anything, but what were other people's experiences?

Third and finally, how much follow-up did you need from your doctors? I've heard that the one complaint about this guy I've been referred to is that he can be very, very difficult to get ahold of. How worried should I be about that?

So that's it. It's kind of a lot. I'm really anxious about starting hormones. I very, very much want them, but I'm also a little scared at how real this whole thing is suddenly. I guess I would also appreciate any words of encouragement you could give me. "

So much so that I can't resist shaving me head, like it's something I have to do.  Then I snap back feeling all female again and it's all growing out my hair and doing my make up, poorly. I usually look like a space hooker.

I don't desire a sex change, but at the same time if I woke up male I'd be ok with it.

[deleted],asktransgender,Officially came out to my therapist today. I'll be considering this day one.,"Two weeks ago my doctor and I broached the subject of me being transgender. I have been seeing her for anxiety and depression issues for about six months now. Today I told her that after a lot of soul searching I've come out to myself and have decided to make the transition to female. She was very supportive and could tell how invested I was. I'm scared and excited and anxious and happy and a dozen other emotions all thrown in a blender to be made into the world's weirdest smoothie.

My biggest fear right now is coming out to my wife. She's weirdly conservative in that she isn't exactly accepting of trans issues but believes 100% in personal choice. I love her so much. I'm scared that if we can't make it work, who'll take care of her? Before we met she did nothing but work. She ate tv dinners for every meal. Her family is halfway across the country. Heh, you want to know what love is it's that I'm more concerned with how her life would turn out if we ever split.

But I painted my nails for the first time today. Wore one of her scarves to my therapist appointment. Felt really good. I can't come out to my wife for another month though. She has a huge career-deciding test coming up and she shouldn't have to deal with this extra stress. So the goal is by March 30. Which I can do.

If you're of the praying persuasion I'd appreciate it. I've come to terms with this and my faith. I'd really love it if someday my wife and I can just be two old ladies living boring lives with grandkids playing in the yard. I know that sounds awful to some but really it's all I want in the world."
Angelic_Siren,asktransgender,"Help me with an annoying name-related decision, please?","Hey, asktransgender what's up?

I have known I'm trans and sort of transitioning(Trying to get more and more andro) to the point where I don't really have a boymode anymore, I just have an andro-ish mode(jeans,converse, t-shirts, makeup and shoulder length hair) I am just now about to get hrt even though I figured this shit out almost two years ago when I was about to turn 17. So yeah I'm annoyed at myself for not getting on hrt sooner, that's for sure but that is not at all the topic of this post, I just thought I'd give you some backstory:) 

The point of this post is to discuss the fact that despite the long-ass time I have had to consider it, I still have not come up with a name. ikr What the hell? :0 I mean it's not like I haven't considered any. I have considered plenty, some pretty heavily. The problem is that I always seem to find something wrong with it. Sometimes it's too andro or not andro enough or too close to my birth name or I know/knew/know someone who knows someone with that name or........ you get the point. Soooo I don't know what to do. I think my therapist (and grandmother actually) is annoyed that I haven't picked one and I'm nervous that it will affect her willing-ness to write my hrt approval letter. I'm supposed to get it tomorrow after a month and a half wait since my last appointment. 

So I'm kind of at my wit's end with this whole name thing. Did anyone else have this problem? Or maybe your still having it? Should I just go with one of my more heavily considered choices and grin and bear it if I end up resenting it? Should I just pick one out of a hat? Or maybe call myself a random word, like..... Cat ooh or maybe Dragon? lol Seriously though any help would be vastly appreciated and I'm sorry if this post is long or ramble-y buuuuuuut Idk, my brain is weird:) Thanks peeps

LillianVJ,asktransgender,"So, I've been questioning my gender again after about a year of being more or less confirmed trans.","I'm not too sure if this should be going here, but I think it might be relevant enough

So, I've been thinking lately, and I'm not entirely sure what sparked it but I am starting to think I may not be trans after all, or at least not fully(?) I'm not sure how to put it, but recently I've decided to try using They Them pronouns and as of yet I haven't had much issue. 

And it seems to be changing my perception of my gender again, combined with stopping Spiro impromptu for some reason, and I've yet to really want to go back on it, however I'm still on my way to getting estrogen, and I definitely still want that. 

Is it possible I may be figuring out I'm closer to nonbianary than transgender? Or simply just trans with somewhat nonbianary leanings? I doubt a solid answer is around, but I sort of want to just get this off my chest.. 

Tl;Dr: trans(?)girl potentially is actually nonbianary or something along those lines"
Andysaurusrekt,asktransgender,Does anyone else feel guilty for being trans?,"Im a transman working towards a career in a male dominated feild, and i feel really guilty.

I feel as if i was only given some of the opportunities i had because they wanted women on the team (I don't pass at all so i often dont bother with it) When in reality as soon as i finish my studies I will be 1/2 way through my transition and for all intents and purposes be male.

I just feel as if im proving that women cant work in certain fields and that transgender people try to deceive others.

Does anyone else ever feel like this?"
superthrowaway192,asktransgender,Has anyone ever had to threaten DIY to get a prescription?,"Hi everybody, I'm currently seeing a doctor who works off of informed consent. When I last saw her she took all of my bloodwork plus a karyotype and gave me a recommendation to a local psychologist who specialises in LGBT stuff. She said she was happy enough to prescibe an AA, which I should be getting on Monday assuming that all of my tests are fine, but she seems reluctant to prescribe me E. I'm struggling to understand why she's reluctant, as I have no serious psychological issues or anything health related that would cause her to withhold it. I'd prefer that she gave me E of her own accord, as I don't want to force her into an uncomfortable situation, but I'm getting impatient to the point that I ordered a pack of estradot patches online. I don't want to blackmail her into giving me this prescription, but I can't keep waiting forever for her to decide that I'm ready. 
Any advice on my next move?"
LostUsrName,asktransgender,Lost sexual sensations?,"My girlfriend has been on HRT for about 4 years.  She lives in a different part of the country than I do and we see each other when we can.

Last time we were together, we fooled around a bit and she was into it and enjoyed herself (no intercourse). 

This time (about 6 months later) she no longer enjoys or is into fooling around or get any sort of pleasure from fondling of breasts etc.

She has told me she has doubled her dose (from what to what I do not know).  Her ""clit"" has shrunken to about 1 inch (from about 4) and she says she seldom gets hard and when (if) she does, it pains her.

Can anyone tell me what is happening?  Is it the hormones?  Is this a phase?  Will she get pleasurable feelings again (not in her clit) but in her breasts and from fooling around?

Thank you.

Edit - update:

I have talked to her about things.

Seems she has more than doubled her dose.  She is taking weekly injections and daily pills.  She has also developed genital dysphoria.

Trying to get her to ""lighten up"" on her dosage."
AgnosticThalassocnus,asktransgender,What are your coming out and early transitioning stories?,"Hi everyone, I am 19 years old and MtF. A few days ago, I felt compelled to write a coming out letter to my conservative, religious parents, but I had no intentions of sending it that day. I even time stamped it so that I could choose to send it months, or maybe even years in the future. I'm only in my first year of college and I am completely financially dependent on my parents, so I've always been extremely afraid how they would react if they ever found out. 

In the end, I sent that letter, because it was something of a masterpiece. Not once did I mention the words ""transgender"", ""transwoman"", or ""LGBT"", because I knew they might trigger a pre-set reaction in their minds. Instead, I described my gender and body dysphoria, my depression, and my feeling of disconnect. I only mentioned the fact that I have ""Gender Identity Disorder"". No parent wants to see their child suffer and I successfully won my parents over. 

They did their own research into what exactly GID, HRT, and ""Transgenderism"" are and through that research they taught themselves how trans people experience day-to-day life pre-transition. They have been 100% supportive, offering to pay for gender therapy and HRT and even announcing it to my entire extended family, who have also been very supportive. 

I was already transferring to a more liberal college in the Fall, so my parents offered to let me withdraw early from my current college to come home, work, do therapy, and start HRT. I am extremely happy. They are driving here in a couple days to help me move. I've always felt like I've been waiting, dormant, never truly living. For the first time, I feel alive. 

I just wanted to hear about all of your coming out early transitioning experiences. "
Anonymousgurle,asktransgender,What's the price difference between E sublingual pills and Injectables?,"Considering to convert myself from sublingual pill to injection method every week or so and all I have to do is tell my doctor. My E and T levels are the way they are supposed to be but I feel like injection method should be so much more convenient.

How much do you usually have to pay every month for a month supply of injectable E?"
zhurai,asktransgender,I was wondering (About myself),"This is probably going to be pretty long... I suppose.  [trying to determine what label I am]

The shortest thing/question I'm wondering to myself is if my gender=female, or gender=non binary (and what would that be) And also if I should go to a gender therapist, and about HRT.... Which is still long. oh well... 

I'll probably remove some of those sections later, but I just want to write everything down that I can think of that might be relevant first, because I've been meaning to write this for like.... 3-4 days I think?... yeah...

I will be doing this in bullet point form because it's easier for me to think it out.  I will try to group them up too though

Background info:

* I'm currently 24 (25 in about ... well.. 10 months) if that's relevant at all
* I'm a Catholic Christian (my parents are too). I won't expand too much on this but there was some sort of an internal issue about this for a bit until I just said *shrug* ehhh.  I'll probably get to this into another section
* I'm also diagnosed with several mental disorders (I won't be naming them - privacy reasons) (They are for the most part low impact so generally I look/behave ""normal"" ish I suppose~)
* In my childhood pictures it seems like I did play with toys normally 
* Through the whole of the life I can personally remember I like games.
* I mean I really like games. I also use the computer a lot, did programming, and... yeah I really like games '-' ... this part probably means something to people as a distinction if one was sexist in a way, but obviously /r/transgamers disproves that... so shrug. more random thoughts.  sorry.

Small part of history:

* Started ""Cross""-dressing starting around... middle school
* Went through about 3-4 purges... I think
* Tried to grow out my hair for... quite a long time

Parents (Early history)

* At first my parents (more so my mom) weren't so accepting about either dressing femininely nor long hair
* For a long time (until Community College) they wouldn't let me have longer hair, although eventually they let me do it

Labels + some history

* labels are weird to me, so I tended to bounce around them because I realized something after a certain point but then I'd go oh nvm that's now how it works...
* All I really know/knew about my identity is that it probably isn't ""male"". I'd sometimes be lazy and just wear tshirt/jeans/jacket go out wee, or sometimes want to wear dresses or skirts.
* first I labelled myself as crossdresser.... then androgynous (because I was like I'd either dress gender neutral or maybe feminine if I felt like it) 
* and then swapped between androgynous / bigender / genderfluid   (bounced between these because I was less sure about the androgynous part, and then thought it was bigender, but that also wasn't it because I don't have a female part of myself and a male part of myself ... they really don't feel like I satisfy what they actually mean in some way or another
* eventually I thought that I was agender (but preferred to randomly dress femininely. like I said above) + ""they"" pronoun... as well as I don't really get the concept of gender identity, I'm a human person first, not a human male or human female... at least in the way I viewed it at least.
* I thought this was the end of it, but at some point I tried to play an MMO (after quitting several games) ....and got semi addicted to it but that's besides the point~   I won't say the name of the MMO because it sucks. Really.
* .... I tried to present as female on there, and help people (although people just wanted to be carried everywhere... almost all the time which tired me out...) 
* .... I would also try to ask for female pronouns (and go like ""?"" whenever someone used he/him/etc pronouns)   ONLY in the game
* .... turns out I actually liked it and preferred it though this idea of semi ""roleplaying""/simulating it for myself (probably also ""in real life"" too)
* .... that said I think I'm okay with female and they pronouns, and begrudgingly accept male pronouns because I'm not that picky about it
* the pronoun thing as well as those tests (""if you had a button that will change you completely to female  would you press it?"" / etc) made me consider that maybe I could label myself as ""female"" instead of some nonbinary gender

People

* I have told my parents, brother, some cousins, some other relatives, some people at my church about parts of these
* some of them about only the crossdressing, some about the agender, and some about the transgender part
* ... this reminds me: I should update them... when I figure this out ._.
* Interestingly even though some of these people that I've told are Christian, were completely accepting of me, which is nice, and after reading several of these posts made me grateful I am in a good household (although my fallback for those that don't would be just to try to split the connection with them abruptly though...)

Therapist

* I'm not entirely sure if I can go to the therapist, as I'm currently self employed + have social security benefits and other things
* However I do have my dad's benefits still so I could probably use that (since it's better)
* But I would probably have to pay, and I'm pretty poor atm so I don't really know the benefits of actually doing it (other than having the option to start HRT once my income allows..... which other than living expenses/savings I'd probably rather put money into games/clothes/etc first...)
* I am subscribed to a voice therapy thing... been busy with a lot of things so I haven't gotten time but I do want my voice a lot higher (it's really really low atm -___-)


!!!!! MY MAIN QUESTIONS  !!!!!

* Question: I'm guessing that I'm Transgender (MTF) then given the above? I don't even know still 100% (other than I'm like pretty sure it's ""Not Male"", but that doesn't mean much yet if one agrees to there being nonbinary gender identities...
* Question: Is there a benefit to going to the therapist? I'm not sure if it's worth the money atm? Do I need to get a letter from them for HRT (Southern California.  I can't give more direct location info than that atm from this post.  LA's close but too far from most of the bigger/known gender therapists I have searched up online)

* Question: For those that identify as non-gendered/agendered/androgynous/whatever: as the US law currently doesn't seem like they take it into account... [especially considering they barely even consider transgenders...]
* do you transition from M-&gt;F or F-&gt;M, 
* or do you generally go with what you were assigned?
* this question is somewhat important to me, as I do have feelings of probably transitioning (in some way either without HRT, with HRT, or HRT+SRS) and maybe still changing the gender marker to female.    because if not then this would possibly be one of the bigger indicators that my identity is female (I just don't think/care about it as much but it's still important? idk)

sorry for rambling I suppose... it's pretty late and I think I've spent an hour typing this out that I don't really want continue (can't think of much anywho)... rather go sleep or something -_-''
I might wake up later, or come back later and might do some edits and reply to other people's replies but... yeah..."
loki1717,asktransgender,What is a typical progestin dosage?,"I know the research for the benefits of progesterone/progestins for transgender women are limited, and largely non-conclusive. However, I've decided I'd like to speak to my endo about starting me on a progestin. I'm not certain if he's has ever used progestins in his HRT regimen, so wanted to have some additional information for him, if possible.

So, what dosages are common? I'm looking at either oral, or possibly topical (gel), I think. "

Shootmeimcrazy,asktransgender,"Idk what I can call this to have anyone read it, but I could really use some advice...","Hey everyone... I'm a regular poster on trans subs on a different account (nonbinary mtf here) but I needed to make this with a throwaway so please don't hate me. This is kinda NSFW actually due to possible triggers (self-harm, dark thoughts) being straightforward about what's going on can do that but here goes-


So... some things have been on my mind more and more lately and within the past week have been drastically affecting my life. I'm at a point where I can't function. For some background info, I was taking Prozac, made me worse so I stopped last week. I've been smoking weed pretty regularly, and I'm going to a therapist who I'm not sure is helping. Im currently failing classes at a commuter college, and probably close to losing my job. Thankfully I live with my parents but my mom's threatening to kick me out unless I turn things around. Somehow everything Im dealing with being my fault. 


Anyways onto...  idk... a rant/cry for help thing- My dysphoria has gotten worse and worse throughout the past couple months even though I'm on HRT (helped loads at first though), as a consequence my anxiety and depression have sky rocketed too. I've been struggling for weeks with everything getting worse and worse, my smoking mj increasingly to cope... Everything been getting out of hand, until I stopped feeling. Recently, I've gotten to the point where I don't feel anything besides the occasional panic attack or crazy dysphoria overwhelm. I'm completely numb emotionally, apathetic to all my responsibilities, and don't respond to emotional triggers like my parents misgendering me or yelling at me. I cut myself last night for the first time in over a year, after of course telling myself not to for a few days. My history with depression and lack of hope for the future is nothing new, I've been pretty cynical and pessimistic for a few years but this is significantly worse than it even used to be. 


None of this is why I feel like I'm going crazy, that's all just baggage I've dealt with for a while... What's making me think I'm going crazy is that while I was holding my kitchen knife I visualized myself slashing my arm open down to the wrist from the inside of my elbow and was *very* tempted,  which would have effectively killed me if I didn't get it to the hospital in time. I didn't but I cut myself a little after struggling with that image for what seemed like hours. I've also been thinking that I wish I was in the psych ward and that I could just abandon society and my hope for a normal future. I feel like I'm going crazy because I'm a rather high functioning individual, I'm well informed and usually quite rational, but I've been struggling with existential problems for years and Im no closer to solving them or being free from the pain that being concious of my problems brings, and now I'm contending with my trans identity and my internalized transphobia. I'm at war with myself, and I'm losing. I have no idea how to get better and I don't even want to - except that I want to be a scientist...or find some way to die without it being my fault. 

I've been wondering if I have some sort of condition because I almost seem obsessed with being miserable. I don't actively try to be miserable it's just that I always end up so. The first time I started to get severely depressed I was in highschool, and it's happened every year since 2012. I've graduated, life has changed, but I keep ending up depressed or anxious or dealing with something that makes it so I can't use my intellect to my full potential, or work as hard as I should be able to without getting really overwhelmed. 

Am I crazy? 

Edit(s): for clarity and additional relevant info because I haven't slept in a day. 

Tl Dr: I have no fuckin clue how to sum this up quickly maybe someone will help you in the comments if anyone replies. "

headintheclouds19,asktransgender,Does this count as gender dysphoria?,"I've looked at a couple of websites and seen a few varying definitions of this thing called gender dysphoria, and I'm wondering if I have it.

Basically since I was ~15 I've consciously envied girls. Women were always displayed in society as powerful sexy figures who could get whatever they want from men. At first I just envied their ability to get sex whenever they want. As I got older I would sometimes go online and pretend to be a girl, because I loved the attention I would get from guys. (I'm bi) Within the last few years there's been a girly part of me that has been getting harder and harder to repress, and over the last few months I've been having really bad self esteem issues. I've been hating on my body because I wish instead of a tall broad shouldered dude body, I had a smaller, smoother female body. 

However, I **DON'T:**

* Believe I was born in the wrong body. This is a personal preference/desire that I've acquired over time.

* Have physical discomfort/phantom pains for genitalia/body parts I wish I had



What do you guys think? Am I just an attention whore with bad self esteem? Or is there like, treatment for these emotions?"

SeanaTG,asktransgender,SRS recovery timeline?,"Good news is the day before yesterday, I recieved a call from CAMH  stating I was now approved for gender reassignment surgery funding, paid for by the province.Hurray! It'll be a few more weeks wait for the funding letter to arrive from Ontario Ministry of Health, but then I can schedule my surgery. Best news I have heard all year, ALMOST.

Some changes this past year however in terms of employment. For the last several years I have been a single stay at home mom to an autistic little boy. However one minor complication, is my work. The last couple years I have worked from my home as an electrologist ( helping all the other transgirls lose their beards) . Last month, I started working out of a clinic here in town, and my schedule has filled up fast!

Electrology is fairly physically demanding. It requires me to sit  in very rigid positions for some fairly lengthly positions, up to a couple hours at a time, rinse and repeat for up to 6-7 hours a day. Obviously I will need to arranage for recovery time beyond the 11 days spent in montreal, but the question is how much? Another30 days? 45 days? While it is possible for me to ""add in "" working hours after the fact if I feel I am capable, booking more time off if I am NOT capable is somewhat more difficult as it means calling back clients and cancelling sessions already booked. So it's in my best interest to be somewhat  liberal with my time off estimates then add in working hours if I feel more capable.

I'm wondering about others recovery experiences, how physically capable they felt t various time frames? Does anyone have any input they can share?

Feminizing,asktransgender,Been off diy for a month but still experiencing changes?,"More of a huh, interesting than alarm but I went on diy meds (100 mg spiro, 1mg estrogen) for almost 3 months before stopping mid January because it was an unnecessary risk.  Since then I've been trying to slowly muck through the BS to get properly diagnosed and covered (and tbh probably just waiting for the next mental breakdown to order online and finish what I started)

Rambling aside, the question is:  Why am I still changing?  I'm about 90% sure my skin has gotten softer and although that is difficult to state with any certainly there is no way my breasts haven't been developing.  I've gone from manboobs to almost making it to an A cup.  Not that I'm sad about that but shouldn't this stop when I stopped HRT?

I've been on hormones for almost 4 years now and still look mostly male asides from having a femme face.  One after another after another I've seen people transition fine and move on with their lives but I haven't been able to due to my sheer large bone structure.  I often wondered why I stood out so much amongst my friends and the genetic results seem to add up: I am 84% more neanderthal than the rest of the population.  I have the gigantic long head (that makes long hair make me look like Warf), very robust bone structure that makes me look larger than the vast majority of people even though I'm average height (6 feet).  I tower over everybody.  My face is huge and sticks out.  I have a large ring size. (something like 12 or 13....something crazy)  I never thought myself to be large but since puberty I definitely am and I went through puberty very quickly and changed dramatically.

georgemitch,asktransgender,I'd rather be transgender than be gender fluid. Do you agree with me?," At least transgender people are sure what they want to become and can do surgery and take hormones to fix their problems. But for gender fluid people there's nothing they can do. Sure they are happy on the days when they feel comfortable with being their born sex, but what about the other days when they want to become the opposite gender? Theres nothing you can do except crossdressing, and unless your face and body figure are very gender neutral (99% of people aren't), you can't pass. They have to spend half of their lives in dysphoria knowing that there is no solution to their problem.

Also being transgender, you can just tell everyone you've decided to change sex and then present as target gender for the rest of your life, but showing up as female one day and then back to male the next day will certainly confuse and scare people.

To be born as the wrong sex certainly sucks, but not knowing what sex you want to be sucks even more. ""Switching between genders"" is making me so tired. I wish I was just transgender."

Ash_Robin,asktransgender,Detransitioning?!?,I am considering detransitioning - socially or just killing myself in general because my family keeps using me as a scapegoat for all the problems that they experience. Like I know what it feels like to be a girl growing up to be told that her actions affect everyone else and that she should act in a way that benfits males. Like my brother can go fuck himself if he cant deal with me going to school as myself like we dont even go to the same school. Also I cook and clean for him also I comprimized that I would wear male pjs and male cloths to work (who gives cause cloths dont have gender). But no this is not good enough its so ennoying. He tells my mom he is failing out of school because of me transitioning even though he is out drinking and smoking pot everyday. I honestly dont know what to do. He is never home or wants to talk and I just want to get through university. I will go to work and be like what ever come home and be calmed down a bit. But if anyone has advice to handle this b/s please share I have been trying my best to be strong throughout this whole thing but 2 months of getting complaints from my family has me wore thin.
NeverSeriousGirl,asktransgender,Anyone partially transitioned as an end point?,"My apologies, this back story is a lot longer than I intended. 

I'm married, no kids, on hormones for 4 years, have had great results and I'm fully passable in public but I'm not full time and I'm not sure I ever will be. I have a great job that I really don't want to fuck up and really don't feel the need to dress myself as a woman to be accepted by society. My dysphoria has always been related to my body and while I love women's clothes when it comes down to it I'm a jeans and t-shirt girl. Or if I want to be fancy a sweater or cute top and some cute shoes. I'm not into dresses or skirts or heels but I can really rock them on occasion. I often confuse people in public when I'm not dressed fully one way or the other. The one thing I do really like is wearing makeup and not wearing makeup on a daily basis is somewhat dysphoric because I hate looking male. That is the only downside that I have trouble with. So I usually have on light mascara and at least some BB cream but men are clueless and women don't really care or don't ask.
 
We take a few girls trips several times a year where I get to be me 24/7. And of course I slip out of my boy clothes the minute I get home. I'm 5'9"" in flats, 140lb's and wear a 34C bra but I'm getting breast implants later this year and want to be in the 34DD range. Now a good sports bra and loose shirt hides my boobs for the most part. I also have a girlie butt but the shirts hide that. After the implants it's going to be obvious but I've really gotten to the point where I don't really care. I like to dress as a woman but that is not nearly as important as seeing my body with the right shapes. I'm not sure now to handle the questions about my breasts but any advise is welcome. 

So here I am, really happy with life and where I am. Just wondering if anyone else has been able to make something like this work long term. Tell me your story!

UndeniablyEmms,asktransgender,"15 months and still flat chested, is there any hope for me?","So a bit of back story. I've been self medicating since November 2014 and as far as i know from frequent blood tests my estrogen levels have never been at the recommended levels (although T has been since about 5 months or so).

There has been a small bit of development that began after about 2 months,  but nothing substantial that it would require a bra, and i have noticed other changes like fat distribution, softer face etc so i know that stuff is happening. I know ymmv and genetics are a factor so i'm not expecting D cups, A cups would be nice. I am also aware that 15 months is by no means transition over, changes go on for years. it just feels like because nothing has happened in the last 6 months or so that that is it for me and i won't get any more changes.

It makes me really dysphoric, is it possible that when i finally get my levels sorted out it will help?

(btw i used to be on 0.2mg patches until 1 month ago when i swapped to 6mg progynova, not had blood test yet so i don't know if my levels have increased.
also my AA was cypro til september then i changed to spiro because of depression.)"

I chickened out and didn't go, because the thought of telling a stranger that I am transgender was just so scary. Now I feel even worse, and have just been lying in bed crying for a few hours. How do all of you deal with the day to day? I'm pre-HRT (again mostly due to fear) and I'm also not out to everyone yet (you might be beginning to see a pattern). My work ethic is gone, my motivation is gone, I've been feeling suicidal again. I just can't imagine living the rest of my life like this, but I don't think I'll ever be brave enough to do anything to help myself.

I hope this isn't to whiny, I just don't know what to do with myself :( . I want to feel better, but I don't know what to do? Advice, suggestions, or internet hugs are all appreciated."

singletracks,asktransgender,travel to Dubai?,"My 16 year old daughter is transgender and we want to visit family in Dubai next November.  I hear there can be difficulties with travel to Dubai.  Does anyone know if we'll have any problems entering?

She's undergoing hormone treatment (hasn't had GRS) and her name change will be final next week.  Her preferred name and gender will match her ticket and passport by the time we go.  Her presentation is still relatively masculine/gender neutral and I'm worried that, if she doesn't appear more feminine by the time we go, we may encounter problems when we try to enter the country.  

Has anyone traveled to Dubai or know of anyone who has?  And if so, what problems do you anticipate we'll encounter?  We already have tickets and she's incredibly excited to go to Dubai so, while traveling somewhere else is potentially an option, it's just really low on the list.  "

gendervssex,asktransgender,Fetish or sign of being a transsexual? or brain washing?,"I need to be brutally honest and I need brutally honest feedback.

I'm 25 and I masturbate daily to being a woman and being taken as one. 

My girlfriend doesn't know this. She is hot (120 pounds 5'7 etc..) but quite frankly I orgasm way harder and intensely, when thinking about this than anything she and I do together. Sometimes I'm not even interested in her and can't get aroused. yet if I think about being a girl and being taken I can get severely aroused in no time. 

her and I watch porn and I like the kind where the girl uses a strap on, on the guy... and secretly I watch porn where the woman sissifies of feminizes the male transforming them into a woman. 

Does this make me a transsexual? OR is Porn brain washing me?

BrooklynIsMyStation,asktransgender,Friend is gender questioning; a few questions on what I can do to be a good friend,"Hi! It's recently become apparent to me that a very dear friend of mine is questioning her gender. She hasn't come out, as such; but she's talked about how she's okay for people to use a variety of pronouns, and written on her Tumblr directly on the subject.

So, I don't want to lapse into bad psychoanalysis, but it seems like she's sometimes been having a tough time of it, emotionally, recently. She doesn't talk about it much, but I think this is probably a part of it. I really want to tell her that I support and accept her and would like to be there to listen if she ever needs it; but at the same time, I know that questioning your gender can be really confusing, and I can tell that it's not something she's very comfortable talking about, even obliquely. I'm hesitant to charge into a subject she hasn't broached.

I don't want to imply there's a catch-all answer to these things; but I thought it would be good to ask some people who've maybe gone through some similar things what they'd want me to do in their position. I'd like to be a good friend; how do you think I can do it?

(Sidenote: I won't see her in real life for a few weeks. If I should say something, do you think that it's better to say it immediately through a less personal digital medium, or later in person?)

Thanks!"

imlostinmyhead,asktransgender,Funny male-fail leading to anxiety,"So I've been kinda trying to do voice training, and after reading a comment yesterday that someone was talking about how the resonance of your voice matters more than the direct pitch, I decided to practice all day. 

Later on a funny situation arose at the drive thru for dinner, where the guy on the headset ma'am'd me in the conversation. I'm still in the closet, this was insanely humorous to my girlfriend (who does not know I consider myself trans), as she likes to point out that I'm more feminine than her. Seriously though don't know how she didn't comment on my voice sounding different. According to the app I was using my voice was on average 40db higher than my normal male speaking voice.

I've expressed concerns on here before about her reaction to coming out, specifically regarding a period of mildly buzzed reflection on my life and kinda brought up the idea with her responding with something along the lines of ""please don't I don't like girls."" Plus, she's been recently suggesting that she wishes I was more masculine, but I'm not sure if that's because I just shaved my beard off and she's missing that, wanting a traditional romance since valentine's day is coming up, or because she's... I don't know. 

So what started off as a kinda-win for me turned into rekindling my anxiety over getting started on this train and coming out to my girlfriend. On the plus side, I think the dude freaked out and gave me a ton of extra condiments when he realized that I don't exactly look like a woman once I got up to the window. Hah.

TL;DR: Voice training fools the blind, but causes fear of the unknown."

Well, I've tried E for a month and my breasts have been growing fast and I'm scared shitless. My fam and friends think I am gay and feminine and my friends (who are like my fam but are pretty conservative) support me 100% of that. My breasts show a little bit through shirts now and I'm growing super insecure and scared ppl will start outting me as trans. i have been close with the same group of people since childhood and we're pretty much in it for life and i'm in no position to get up and make new friends as i dont have much family other than these people. I present as an andro-feminine guy day-to-day. I've done laser, am in the female range of weight, grew hair out, wear mixed gender clothing and present quite feminine. HRT is sort've the last step for me to transition but this is really going to force me to come out as trans and not just genderfluid... I'm having the biggest dysphoria of my life because i know once breasts grow more, i'm never going to be able to just be a ""feminine guy"" (which is sort've my comfort place like when i meet conservative people or work place, etc.).

does anyone just take spironolactone / T-blockers and not take estrogen forever? can that like be a thing? T blockers have really helped reduce muscularity in the upper body. i'm not happy with what i am currently and i keep viewing myself as this monster when i get more fem bcos when i wear a t-shirt my shoulders/upper back bulge making me look very masc. i have this idea that being a  6' tall muscular transwoman will NEVER pass especially being asian because hardly any asian girls are ever over 5'10 and nonetheless have this much muscular definition... training everyday is the one of the few things in life that keeps me sane and on top of life. am i just making excuses to delay transition? has anyone ever gone through this confusion of being scared of getting too muscular but being addicted to exercise? 

TLDR i'm really confused if i can go on with breast development, should i stop estrogen until i'm more straight-forward with what i want? Can i just continue spironolactone for another year or so? Have other people experienced this much dysphoria in their first month of breast development? Are there any other tall, fitness-loving transwomen with similar experiences?

2choice,asktransgender,Really confused about my gender.. I don't know if i'm Trans or a messed up Cis,"So.. Well i'm 24 and was born male, and somewhat recently i started to really question my gender seriously.

Many times i look in the mirror i try to picture how i would look if i was a woman.
I got dressed twice, and it felt nice for a while, like a strange kind of nice that is hard to describe, and there are parts that looked good, like feminine, but then i started to feel like i was kinda ugly, because or hair that was in places it wasn't supposed to, and the face didn't really looked female, and a took it off, kinda panicked a little when the lipstick wouldn't go kkk.
The thing is that i don't feel ""trapped"" in a mans body, i don't feel like i am a woman, but many many times i think i want to be one, and if i had a choice to go back and change my gender i would, even with bad things like menstruation, that seemed really bad.
I don't really feel like my body is disgusting or something like that, it just feel like it is kinda indifferent.
Also whenever i play a game i can choose the gender of the character, or i can make a team consisting of some characters, i choose the female ones, even when there is little difference (like old Pokemon), but i don't really know if this is relevant.
I'm also not very feminine, or at least i don't go with what the society consider female-like things, like i don't like shopping or things like that..

Well.. those are the things i remembered and tried to describe, i'm not really that good in putting my ideas in words and English is my second language so sorry for any annoying and wrong writing but i can try to answer or clarify if is necessary.
Also this is the first time i put my toughs on-line for completely random people to see.. And it still sound kinda crazy to me.. but things are getting hard to figure out on my own.

So I am a cis female in high school. I'm in band and one of my close band friend is transitioning male to female. Let's call them Beth. So Beth dresses male and wears baggy clothes at school.

I saw multiple posts on this subreddit, r/MtF and the like. So in my head (and in this post), I'm already calling her female pronouns. I know she is having issues with coming out and feeling accepted. So what do I do? I want Beth to know that her true friends will accept her and if someone doesn't, it's their loss.

DarkLeach7,asktransgender,"[rant] How should I deal with my stepdad, who while doesn't oppose my transition thinks that it shouldn't be at the top of my priority list, but rather the bottom? [rant]","First off let me say I don't *hate* my stepdad, we've always just had a priority disconnect between the two of us. I was really depressed in high school (was pre-transition),  so I didn't want to go to post-secondary school. My goal after high school was to combat my depression and find out why I was so depressed. (I had been in therapy for over a year at that point and I still am, with the same therapist). TL;DR that led to me coming out as trans and deciding to transition (which by the way has extremely helped with my depression, especially once I started HRT). (almost) everyone that I came out to was extremely supportive, but once I told my stepdad that I wanted to transition he started getting verbally offensive about how transition takes time and how I should start school and that because transition takes a lot of time, that I should start school sooner rather than later because that school is harder to start when you're older and you'll feel out of place, etc etc. (this was before I had a job, which he didn't want me having either, saying I should focus only on school). I have my reasons for not wanting to go to college, because how much high school depressed me, and with the consistent ""it's necessary for you to succeed in life"" stuff and my depression just wasn't healthy for my psyche. My stepdad eventually ""saw things my way"" and got off my case. But now I'm always expected to jump to responsibility whenever something needs attention and he always Makes me feel like shit whenever I don't ""jump to attention"". He even said to me ""I wouldn't be so hard on you if you went to school like I want you too"". I talked to him the other day because he seems to be the only one in my house that uses my old pronouns and name more often, he said it's not some passive aggressive thing and that he'd try to consciously do it more, but from what I heard from my brother what my stepdad ""may have said behind my back"" when I was taking out the trash makes me beg to differ. I feel like my stepdad is jealous that I'm not going to college right away and he has told me that ""he wishes he had the opportunity to go to school that i do"" or ""you don't see the opportunity you're wasting."". which I feel is related to that transitioning is what I'm focusing on as my main priority and not school. I've tried many many times to say why transitioning is so important to me and how much better I'll be once I take the years to do this, but it seems to go in one ear and out the other when it comes to talking to him. He's not opposed to my transition, but at the same time he said it's what should be on the least of my priorities. I'm in a comfy spot, I have a job, I pay a bit of weekly rent to my stepdad, I have a therapist that I get to visit weekly that's absolutely wonderful and supportive, and I'm on HRT (only my mom and sister know, he doesn't) and haven't felt better in my life, but my stepdad still thinks that I'm ""wasting a opportunity"".
TL;DR my stepdad thinks that I should focus on more aspects about my life other than my identity and he comes off like I'm being extremely ""selfish and self centered""

Have any of you experienced anything similar in your lives?

I'm not that big on social justice activism. My trans friends in real life are though. They're the type of people where you have to agree with them on everything or else, basically. Problem is I don't agree with them on a lot of issues. A good example is a lot of them believe a guy/girl who is attracted to women would be transphobic if they didn't want to date a trans woman with a penis. I disagree with them big time on that because I think people are entitled to their preferences but I'm scared to speak up every time they talk about it. There's a lot of other issues I disagree with as well. A lot of them seem to genuinely hate cisgender people. I don't understand that.

I don't want to get dragged into activism for issues I don't even agree with but I'm scared of being alone. It seems like every trans person in my city is tied up with this sort of extremist thinking and activism. I just want a trans friend who is chill like me :/

Wergle. 

So, my 6 months is coming up! hip-hip hooray! It's been a hell of a ride. Sometimes though, this imposter syndrome is impossible to shake. Knotted stomach, the feeling that I'm lying to everyone, about everything. Including myself.

The other day I sat down with a cup of coffee and wrote a list. A ""6 Month HRT Checklist"" I called it. I wanted to document the pros and cons of my transition since I started, the effect HRT had on my overall life.

There were 4 cons, total. Compared to the three pages of pros that I still add to when I remember something else. All my friends tell me I seem so much happier. My emotions are fixed, my libido feels more under my control, my body is changing in a way that has allowed me to stand in front of the mirror and just look at myself, feeling neutral or pretty satisfied, for the first time in my adult life.

But none of that matters to my Imposter Syndrome. It's not all the time and when it's gone, I am SO SO HAPPY. I feel wonderful and feminine and free. But then it kicks in, and suddenly I doubt I'm trans at all. Why would I be? I'm not trans, I'm a guy, I've been lying to everyone. When I feel THAT way, I'm... miserable. Sad. confused and scared and lonely. I start living in my own head, thinking in circles until I just want to curl up in a ball.

I need to know I'm doing good by keeping going. I need to know if I stay determined (Undertale? anyone? okay.) that I can beat this thing. 

I want that happy me back. The one when I'm sure I'm a girl. That me, I want them back. Sadly I can't afford a decent therapist, and my health-center counsellor I was seeing has quit her job. freh. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get past this? I KNOW I'm trans, hell I spent SIX YEARS debating whether or not I would go on HRT. it ruined two longterm relationships in that time, provided me with an intense amount of stress at work, and mirrors started making me irrationally angry. I couldn't look at my body before; I can now. I don't want to ever give that up."

Thanks for all your answers, either I am really bad at telling you what I really meant or it's simply a bad idea.

------------------------------------------------

Edit 2:
Well, you all wrote so much more so I guess I'll edit once more.

To clarify what I meant: Yes, currently it is a sexual thing for me. I completely agree with you all that being trans is completely different to crossdressing - again my apologies in case I wasn't clear with that. But I do want to see what it is like if it's not a sexual thing - I feel good in women's clothes, but I wasn't able, nor did I dare too try dressing for a longer period of time (which again, isn't the same for me as being trans). I have the chance to try that out now, and I am currently looking for someone to help me with that. I think /u/burset225 described it pretty well. I probably won't bring crossdressing as a topic into the relationship between my friend and me, since that friendship is far more important than getting help with dressing. Thanks again for all your imput.


------------------------------------------------


Hi all,

first of all, let me specify my titel: I am sometimes cd'ing, and a friend of mine is about one and a half years into her transitioning. She doesn't know about me cd'ing, and I thought about her helping me cd.

So, full story:An old friend of mine started transitioning like 1 1/2 years ago - even though she moved away, we still meet like once or twice a month and know each other pretty well. I always had some interest in crossdressing, but I mainly do it because of some sort of sexual desire. Since I'll have the flat for myself in about 2 months, I thought about trying out being a girl for a week...probably just to realize that fantasy != real life, but that's a thing I always wanted to experience.

My gf knows about me dressing for sexual pleasure, but she doesn't want to know anything about it (which is completely ok!), other than that - no one knows about my passion for cd. I thought about hitting up my friend and asking her to visit me and ""help"" me cd'ing so I can pass...but I don't know how she would react regarding all I did so far was sexualizing feminine clothes.

So, r/asktransgender, how would you react? My biggest fear is (which is kinda pathetic regarding what she went through before transitioning) that she thinks about me as some sort of fetishist who is simply into the whole ""chicks with dicks"" stuff (of which she had enough)."
Thatnewgirlrachel,asktransgender,(mtf) really super tiny steps to take when you're just now climbing out of denial?,"So about 24 hours ago now I said to myself ""yes, I think I'm transgender"". I'm now looking for small ways to sort of get comfortable with thinking of myself as a woman because right now I do feel like it fits me better than man, it's also just rather terrifying :/

I'm asking because I've known my best friends for ages and we kind of have no boundaries, so if I did something at all noticeable (e.g. Shave legs, paint toenails) they would discover it and ask questions I'm not up for answering yet."
srs_girl,asktransgender,Representation of transmen and transwomen,"Hi there, cis girl here. I'm going to try my best to word this in a respectful way. I've noticed recently that more public figures are coming out as trans, Caitlyn of course, and also just today Jordan Raskpoulos (an Aussie comedian) have come out as transwomen, which is awesome because it shows that they feel safe to do so in our society that is slowly becoming more accepting.

I've noticed that seemingly more transwomen are coming out than men. Do you think there is a real discrepancy between representation from trans men and women or is that something I'm imagining? I also feel like the discourse surrounding Caitlyns transition, Jordan's, Laverne Cox and other transwomen is predominantly respectful and informed, yet say in the case of (pretty much the only famous transman I can think of) chaz bono people still seem to think it's ok to make jokes about his gender in the public realm. 

Why do you think more prominent women have had the courage to come out as trans than men? Now this is where I'm worried about offending, but do you think it has a relation to transwomen being socialised/treated as men and therefore having male privilege pre-transition? As in, do you think society is more willing to accept a transwomans experience as valid because on some level, people see them as a 'man', and are more likely to respect their experience. Also due to their pre-transition appearance and social stance as perceived male, does a transwoman have a kind of male privilege that imbues her with the confidence to come out in the first place?

I know being trans does absolutely not come with 'privilege', this is where I'm worried I might offend someone. Transwomen are women, full stop and do not have male privilege. However, I think it might be interesting to consider the ramifications of male privilege and what happens to that when someone transitions."

chaucer345,asktransgender,Can words used to put us down be reclaimed? (Trigger warning for use of those words),"Hey folks.

So, this has been bouncing around in the back of my head for a while, but I feel as though it's hard to talk about.

We get a lot of hate in our community, a *lot* of hate, and as per usual folks that hate us have developed words to insult us.

But... I wonder if we as a community might be able to gain a sense of identity by turning them against our persecutors.

Like... I dunno it's going to sound weird, but ""trap"" is such a nice word. Think of playing around with that ""Ha ha! It's a trap! Now the woman you love understands your cultural upbringing better!"" ""Ha ha! It's a trap! This girl loves you enough to talk with you about things that are decently personal to her!""

Sorry, it's just such a rich one liner. I get that the idea is that people are saying I'm trying to trick them into something bad, but it's just kind of fascinating in it's potential verbal use.

Tranny is a bit more standard, but still interesting. Like the n-word in the black community, it can be a semi-affectionate way for members of the community to greet each other in a way that almost mocks our oppressors.

I don't know I just think they're interesting. Maybe we're not developed enough as a community to entertain such notions, but I think there could be a way to make the language of the oppressors work for us instead.

Alitagraham,asktransgender,Telling an almost non-verbal autistic sibling about being trans? Do I or do I not?,"I am planning to try to start hrt in the next 6 months or so. I'm most certainly concerned about my little sister though, who is autistic and is almost non-verbal (she talks some but it's usually repeated phrases or very delayed speech). I am not sure if I should take some time to try and explain being trans to her. She would probably understand it if I explained it to her like a 10 year old would need it explained to them. I would feel bad excluding her but at the same time I wonder if she even needs a verbal explanation or preface."
Mecaterpillar,asktransgender,How concerned should I be about a change in hormone levels after been on HRT for years?,"So a couple weeks ago I went to my endocrinologist for my usual 6 month visit.  I'm MtF and I have been on HRT for about 5.5 years now.  I had notice that starting a year ago, my testosterone levels had been going up slightly from roughly 66 ng/dL 18 months ago to then 88 a year ago to 110 six months ago.  The estradiol level had always been fairly high (roughly between 300 and 800 pg/mL) though.  The test results for my February 1st test came in and the testosterone levels were at 318 ng/dL and the estradiol levels were at 55.5 pg/mL.  My doctor said to have my levels retested in a month (so roughly March 1st).  I was worried enough about these anomalous results that I paid to have blood tests done on my own accord.  That was on Friday and I just got back the results. The testosterone levels were at 392 and the estradiol at 58.7.  That confirms the levels from before weren't just an odd test result.  So I'm kind of worried about this.  I don't know much about what could be causing this or how likely any possibility is but I know enough to make me worried about the worst possibilities.  I'm thinking of scheduling an appointment with another experienced endocrinologist to have a look at it.  Am I overreacting?  Like really, how worried should I be about this?  What would be a reasonable course of action here?

UPDATE:
I had an appointment (2 days after I made this post) with a new endocrinologist who has plenty of experience treating transgender patients.  He upped my dosage of spironolactone to 200mg per day and I'll need to get my blood retested in a month.  He didn't think it was anything to be too concerned about but he did find it mysterious that my levels would change so much after having been on the same dosage for about 5 years.  I feel like I'll have him be my endocrinologist from now on and drop my old one as he didn't have much experience treating transgender patients.  Hopefully my new endo will be able to figure it out/ treat me."

Fairlady31,asktransgender,How do I stop comparing myself to other people in transition?,"Okay, so this has become a big problem for me recently. I'll explain.

So when I'm out in public and I see a trans woman who I feel superior to appearance wise (this is bad, I know), i'll subconsciously judge that person a little bit even though I know it's wrong. I'll think, ""she needs to shave"" or ""she needs to pluck those eyebrows"" or ""she's a drag queen"". I know this is totally wrong. I'm studying women's studies in college and I still do this. I know that people have different identities (gender and otherwise), and I think that's great. But I always compare myself to them, and it only results in negative thoughts. On the flip side, If I see a transwoman that's way prettier/further along in transition than me, I get depressed and self conscious. I feel like i'm not as good as them even though I know everybody has different experiences and journeys throughout life.  

I almost feel like part of this stems from my brothers/father. Whenever they see an attractive woman on T.V, they say ""oh she's so hot, I would love to [expletive] her so hard"". This makes me think that this is how all men see women, and as someone so early in transition, it makes me feel like when people see me all they see is a walking freak show. I've complained about their rude discourse, only to have my mom tell me to ""get thicker skin"". I feel like this kind of misogyny should have no place in my house and is rubbing off on me. 

Anyways, back to the point, how do I retrain my brain to not compare myself to others in transition so much? and are my complaints justified? "

Does anybody have any experience? I know this is a kind of odd post, but has anyone who transitioned in their early 20s just taking hormones noticed great and your desired results with breast growth? Did your breasts stop growing after a time? Has anyone had an orchiectomy soon/before transitioning in their early 20s and noticed increased breast growth? Have you not noticed any differences?

Also there's been a debate on whether or not it's harder to achieve and sustain an erection after an orchiectomy vs just taking anti-androgens. Can anybody put that debate to rest as well?

CassieComplicated,asktransgender,I think that I'm MtF but I don't know why!?,"So all of my life I've had thoughts, on and off, that I would rather be a girl.  Not some overpowering need to be the opposite gender. Not until recently did I even think that I disliked my male body.
When I graduated college and moved out on my own I had thoughts that I'd like to be a girl but that the transition would be too hard on me and my family, especially my grandfather who has given me so much in my life.  I figured that I could be a man, and a damn good one too, at least until he died. 
Thoughts put aside, decision to be a man made, I entered my first real relationship since the beginning of high school, it didn't work out. We dated for 5 months, and I put my entire emotional being into that relationship.  I was devastated.  Then about a month later, I was able to reconnect with the woman who would become my wife. She filled a void in me.  For the last three years I've been so happy to have her in my life. 
I also, wore her clothes, sometimes. Not because I felt I needed to be a woman, but I did enjoy trying to secretly slip on her shoes, which in all honesty were much too small for me. I would secretly wear her tights and yoga pants because I liked the way they made my legs look. But for the most part I was just happy pretending for a few moments then moving on with what is the greatest chapter in my life. 
Now, only a few months after getting married to the woman of my dreams.  I was finally able to slip on a couple pairs of her shoes, uncomfortable as anything I've ever worn, but I REALLY liked the way they made me feel.  I got so excited, that I ran to a consignment shop and purchased a pair that would actually fit me. And I LOVED it. I felt feminine and excited. I love the sound they make when I walk. Then one night, I asked myself why am I doing this? What do I want from this?  Is it just to wear heels? The answer came almost immediately, that I wanted more. I wanted to wear skirts and tights and nice blouses and jackets. But I wanted to do those things with a woman's body. I imagined my body only with more curves and I liked what I saw. 
Days later, my wife found my shoes.  I, in a fear that she would think I was cheating, told her they were mine and that I liked to wear heels, and would maybe like to wear more. 
She laughed at the idea, at first, then realized I was serious. She was nearly instantly supportive of the idea. What difference did it make if I wore women's clothes. Actually, she said we could go shopping for some shoes that weren't so ugly, and she was excited to do it. 
Then the next night, when asked, I told her that I might want to have a woman's body as well. This she didn't take well. It's been two weeks and she has been, depressed, angry, accepting and everywhere in between several times. 
My thoughts verge on that I'm scared of what it would mean if I wanted to be a woman. Would this be the end of my marriage? Would I lose my job? Would she be able to love me if I was a woman? She doesn't know, sometimes she thinks she can and others she just wants to hit me and tell me to man up. 
As time goes by, and I try letting myself be a woman, in my mind and wear some women's clothing. I find that my dysphoria for my body is growing. I want to look at my legs and arms and see female parts instead of hair muscular man parts (not that I'm very muscular.) When I'm dressed up and I look in the mirror and my face and hair break the illusion of femininity that I feel when I look down it hurts and feels wrong to look at a man.  
This is all compounded because I cannot, when asked directly, say why I want to be a woman. Yes, I feel that I would be more comfortable in my daily routine if I had a woman's body. However, I find it difficult to imagine being seen as a woman. And sometimes, I think it's all frivolous and I'm being stupidly selfish wanting to change and disrupt what I otherwise find to be a great life and marriage. 
I think I need confirmation that I'm not making a whimsical choice that will ruin my marriage and possibly my life.  I've started to see a therapist, but weekly sessions seem so far apart and I hate having to wait!"

I had only once received any indication that my uncle might not identify as a man. Once, when talking with my mom about trans issues a few years ago, she told me that a therapist had once ""manipulated"" my uncle into believing that she was trans. I disagreed with the larger, somewhat transphobic argument that my mom was making at the time, but I believed her about my uncle--my mom said what she said with such certainty, that I just assumed that it was true.

I hadn't really thought of that conversation since. But last night, I was thinking of my uncle particularly strongly, and decided to google her. After looking through a few results, I found some posts on an online depression support forum. In one of them, titled just ""Out :d"" and posted about 4 months before she died, she introduced her friends on the forum to Rachel (her adopted female name) and told them about her pride at having finally attended a small social gathering as herself. 

I was shocked, yet it also sort of made sense. I started looking around to find more about Rachel and found some pictures of her at trans social events. She looked happy and present in a way my Uncle Rick never really had.

I also found forum posts about her struggle telling her son about it, and her intent only to come out to people who she felt were ready to hear it. She was clearly scared, and also worried about hurting friends who were in vulnerable places themselves. I remember that in the months before her death, I was dealing with my own mental health issues, and I can't shake the feeling that if I'd been more mentally together myself, maybe she would have felt like she could have reached out to me.

But I also know that this is really not about me--me, a cis woman who has never had to deal with people denying her gender identity. It's about Rachel, this beautiful woman whom I never got to met, this beautiful woman who only really got to live for a few months (and even then only in semi-secrecy). 

Whatever pain I'm feeling has to be so miniscule in comparison to what she felt--yet, it really does hurt. And I don't know how to mourn someone I never had the privilege to know.

I'm struggling as to what to do now. I've been talking to some friends, who are supportive, and I'm going to talk with my therapist about it when I see him tomorrow. I know I should probably also talk to my mom, but right now I feel this repressed anger at her about her own reaction, and I don't know how to do it.

Part of me wants to tell the world about Rachel, so that she can at least live posthumously, but maybe that's not right. The people she wanted to tell knew. I guess that should be enough. It doesn't really seem right to out someone else, even after their death. It's probably a selfish impulse.

Anyway, I guess this isn't much of a question, and I again apologize if this is the wrong place. I'm also sorry if it seems self-indulgent and rambling. I'm just struggling to process this and to know what (if anything) is the right thing to do next. Any comment of support, even just to say hi, would be appreciated :) Thanks so, so much for reading."
GenderLoopholes,asktransgender,"When you came out to your parents/family, were you *completely* open and honest?","I'm starting to feel that I am leaning more towards 'agender, but wants hormones,' but I feel that they would probably not understand that or why I would want to change my body in the first place.  I also don't want to tell them about every doubt I have or all the different emotions I have regarding stuff about my body, as I feel they may look at it me being wishy-washy or unable to make my own decisions regarding myself.  For context I am already out to my mom as mtf, as that was what I was tentatively thinking at the time.  However, I feel it may be an easier concept for them (though I haven't told my dad at all yet. . . might do that tomorrow).

So, did you tell your parents/family all of your inner thoughts, emotions, and doubts when you came out?  Did you ever pick a social label that you knew you would probably shed later on in transition, as it didn't fit?  (I get that this disclosure probably varied greatly on how close you were to your parents and their knowledge of trans issues.)"
leydigcellhate,asktransgender,Struggling with surgical decisions! Orchi then GRS or just GRS and hope things line up?,"Hello all,

tl;dr: Orchi apt. in a month, but I can LIKELY make GRS work in 2 years time (not 100% sure on that). Do I hope for the best and go GRS only, or do I have orchi as a safety net incase its much longer before GRS? 

I am struggling with making a decision about my surgical options; time is ticking on an apt. I have for an Orchi consult in march (procedure to be covered by insurance). I made the apt. in September with the thought that I would not get GRS for many years. The Orchi was to act as a ""Band-Aid"" for my severe dysphoria until GRS was feasible. However, I have recently found time in my schedule in December 2017 for the procedure and have figured out a budget that would allow me to be able to fund it by then. The problem is, I can't seem to put all my eggs in one basket and just assume GRS will work out and throw away my orchi option. 

I really don't know what to do... or how to approach this issue. I keep going back and fourth on the issue. One day I want to cancel the apt for the consult, and assume GRS will work in 2017. The next day, I think that I'll do the orchi as a safety net, just in case things fall through...

Advice? Thoughts or opinions?

I have brought it up to my therapist, but I guess self harm is a bigger issue to be discussing during our 1 hr together than is the rapidly approaching consult! :'(

throwawayfrowork,asktransgender,I dreamt I was on HRT,"Hi everybody. Long time lurker. I've posted on a few other various accounts. too.

Anyway, I've been going back and forth about who I am for years. Late 2014 to mid 2015 ish I was most sure I found the answer of who I am. I dreamt then I had GRS, except it was my toes that I lost. It was done on an impulse in my dream too. I was more sure then about who I am at that time. '

Anyway, fast forward to summer 15 and later and I kinda just fall off the wagon for a while. I stop wanting to ""dress up."" I stop doing things like painting my nails and shaving and a lot of other things. I just had no desire to anymore. I wasn't sad about it. I tried to here and there and it just didn't feel right. I just could't put the effort in so I stopped. I wasn't ad about it. I wasn't disappointed. 

More time goes by until recently. I started to try to ""dress up and what not more.I went shopping again for clothes. I still feel kinda blah and uninterested about it. Not like how i used to.

Then out of left field one night, I had a dream where I went on HRT. I remember seeing myself in the mirror and holding pills in my hand. My girlfriend said I looked beautiful. 

I've considered transitioning in the past, but again, it went a way for such a good amount of time this caught me off guard. It's got me more confused than not.

TL;DR - Was more sure about my trans identity a year ago. It slowly faded to be sure about a cis identity. Then I recently had a dream where I was HRT and now I'm confused again.

NFK_Otter,asktransgender,Nervous / afraid to start transitioning,"Hello, I don't ever really post so I apologize if the formatting is wrong, and this isn't even much of a question but I feel the need to say something and I don't know where I should say it.  I know I want to transition, (MtF) but I've been procrastinating on beginning due to my anxiety issues, and in turn waiting for as long as I have is making my anxiety feel worse. I'm 21 now and I've known I wanted to transition since my early teens, but never really brought myself up to trying to get it started until recently, and now I'm afraid that I waited too long, and I'm mad at myself for allowing myself to get older without doing anything about my gender discomfort. I've always had relatively feminine physical features, in fact when I'm dressed up as a woman I've been told some people were surprised I'm not a cis girl, but I feel this year in particular I've been looking more like a man than I ever have before, I'm not sure if I'm over analyzing myself but these masculine features of mine are driving me crazy. I can't look myself in the mirror without getting depressed and feeling like I somehow fucked up.

I came out to my best friend and my mom, everyone I know online knows I am (or at least trying to be) trans. My mom seems to be having a hard time with it, even though she says she's supportive, and I know she's trying her best, but the fact that she's having a hard time makes it hard for me too. I came out to my ex as well during the time we were together, he seemed ok and supportive with it, but ultimately I know it's the reason why he broke up with me. That experience has made me very nervous about dating again, and I've been declining a lot of potential dates because I'm afraid the same thing will happen to me again. I'm really afraid to come out to other friends and family out of fear for being rejected, I've been making myself seem ""normal"" in order to keep on everyone's good side, but when I dislike myself as much as I do, I know I can't keep living my life the way others want to see it. 

I'm rambling but what I guess I want to ask is, how do I begin? I want to see a therapist so I can talk my feelings out and hopefully get on the right track as soon as possible, but the anxiety I feel from knowing I'll have to come out has made me keep to myself, I also don't know exactly where I should go or how I should go about finding a good therapist / psychiatrist/ whatever. Does anyone have any good advice for someone who desperately wants to start transitioning but is shy / nervous about it and doesn't know where to start? I live in Connecticut if anyone around here knows where I could go for this.

ImMarina,asktransgender,[NSFW] How to diminish erection pain?,"Hi everyone :)
So uh... yeah... I'm barely 1 year on HRT and T blockers, low dose, but enough to have made me not want to ""use"" my penis so often. Now i'm not very heavy on the genital disforia, or at least I can still do things with it for now, however every time I have an erection the ""harder"" it gets the more painful it is. It feels like the muscle is trying to stretch itself out beyond what it can take.

I honestly want to try to do something about this because of mine and my wife's intimacy until I can afford GRS, but have I gone and ruined it? Is it too late? Or is there some sort of exercises or something I can do to alleviate the pain?

Thanks!"
LolisMakeLifeWorthy,asktransgender,Is it wrong to feel like you fit into some of the worst stereotypes of a man and toxic masculinity? And feel like you don't deserve to call yourself a woman?,"One thing I've struggled with feeling once I became accepting of and attached to the idea I really could be a woman, and not just gender queer or a man who defies gender stereotypes.

When I made my first thread here, I talked more like a cisgender man trying to learn and admit problems with trying to be a good ally and guilt, rather than a transgender person. But seeing people accept me and respond in a way that implied I might myself be trans, made me drop the facade and accept the questioning, likely transwoman side of myself, realizing it seemingly wouldn't be a problem, even for me.

But I still struggle with feeling like a big joke for calling myself trans. Some things that gender critical radical feminists or ""TERFs"" say, I've internalized. I feel like a gross autogynephillic person, and everything wrong with ""natal males"" because of the things that some TERFs have said. I feel like a hypersexual fetishist with lots of kinks other people find problematic. And worse yet, some things that some transgender people say about gender really bothers me, and some of the things that some TERFs say about gender makes sense to me.

Like many TERFs, I'm not comfortable with a lot of the so called realities of gender set before me by society, realities or common wisdom that a lot of transgender people agree with. Some transpeople do seem like we're promoting gender roles, gender stereotypes, and psuedoscientific sexism. And it makes me feel uncomfortable, and more like a sleeper agent and a false flag than a real, true transperson. 

While I'm becoming more and more attached to the girl label and euphoric at the idea of being seen as a cute woman. The people who talk about men and women not being so different, and interalizing and learning gender roles and stereotypes, that should be deconstructed, and leading a way to a world where gender is abolished, sounds like a utopia. 

Worse yet, again, I feel like I have some personality traits that people find horribly masculine in the worst ways.

I'm a stereotypical anime nerd and semi-shut in. I don't totally shut myself in. But I'm also scared and want to give up and shut myself in many times and become discouraged socially. Some people make the outside world seem like a scary place full of rejection and embarrassment. 

I spend a lot of my life in escapism because of what I fear and don't accept about the real world. I spend much of my freetime with video games and anime and hobbies that comfort me and are unreal and escapist, because they feel better and more ideal than the real world. 

I haven't dated someone in years. I'm afraid no one would love me. And I'm afraid of romantic and sexual relationships. I'm the stereotype of the male anime otaku shut in who admires ""waifus"" and ""hasbandos"" all day. And gets lost in video games and all kinds of escapism because reality is unsatisfying.

I'm a very sexual person and a fetishist. I have lots of fetishes and many people find horrible and problematic. I recently got banned from a subreddit I was hoping to use for emotional support and self expression because I defended and tried to educate someone about a kink I have, I don't think I'm going to be unbanned.

I've sexualized and fantasized about crossdressers, androgynous people, and transgender people for years. I have lots and lots and lots of fetishes, many of them to do with defying gender norms of some kind.

I don't feel like your typical woman or transwoman. And I fear that I would bring shame and harm to the trans community just by identifying as transgender. Like some kind of trans-Hitler. Who would only hurt transpeople or any cause or identity I touch by association.

Is it normal or common to feel this way? Is this just my low self esteem talking?"

throwaway88778899,asktransgender,"Yet another ""Am I Trans?""","Sorry guys, you probably get this question quite a lot, and my situation probably isn't as unique or needing of special attention as I imagine, but I can't just decide this for myself.

I'd like to try and format this in the most straightforward and factual form:

* I'm 26 years old, male. 
* Very feminine figure relative to your average man (skinny, small shoulder breadth, long lithe legs, boyish face)
* I have a girlfriend, who's quite conservative and would almost certainly not accept the idea of me not being a man. I love her, honestly. I will have wasted a lot of her time (3 years we've been dating) if I decide to transition, not to mention the emotional impact that this would have on a person as fragile as she is (very depressive and anxious). She would try to take it well, but I know it would destroy her, even though she's perfectly capable of finding a better man. (Not sure if relevant: This is a long distance relationship).
* I've had these feelings in one form or another since I was 16 at least, when I began experimenting with homosexuality (cross-dressing by probably a year after that). Even going back to the first sexual thoughts I would have (probably around 12 years old, if that's relevant) I remember being fixated on the clothing, shoes, feminine figure of the women, not really concerned with what I'd ""do to them"".
* These feelings have never permeated my daily life, until now. I've always been fine with being a male in everyday life, I just thought it was a fun fetish to dress up like a girl and ""pass"".
* I've never felt love for a male, only lust for the male sexual organ. I don't even know what love for a man would feel like.
* Starting relatively recently, probably about three months ago, this feeling has gradually become ever more frequent. In the past, I'd spend probably literally 99% of my time perfectly content with being a man in everyday life. In the last week however I've spent about $400 total in girls clothes, shoes, makeup, hotel rooms, etc., seemingly obsessed with pushing myself to the limits of my femininity.
* In addition to the above point, I've become more and more fixated on being with other transgirls, whereas I was previously not at all attracted to them, and only sexually interested in manly top men. Admittedly, in these cases I've been more receptive to the idea of ""loving"" people of this group, but really it's too soon to tell. It's closer to sympathy and curiosity.

Sorry if that's hard to follow; I just don't want to pollute your advice with too much of my own narrative about all this, only with the relevant facts as far as I can determine them. I have my own theories as to what's casuing this, but at this point I can't progress because I'm afraid of the consequences if I'm wrong, not only to me but to my girlfriend.

I don't know what to do, but a lot of my dysphoria stems from this (perhaps I am just being stupid and blaming the wrong things, and what bugs me about is just it looking like a boy part, and not that it is too anything).

n8_da_g8,asktransgender,Both of my parents are 100% supportive of me :D,"Hello everyone, not too long ago I posted about how I came out to my dad and that received quite a bit of attention for how that story was (in a great way), here's a link to that
https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/45ildm/i_came_out_to_my_father_today_and_the_results_were/

So, I wasn't planning on coming out to my mom so soon but this is what happened. After preparing myself in my dorm room to go out to eat and study. I leave and get my finger caught on a door and cut it really bad (oops) After trying to get the bleeding to stop and failing I call my dad and ask for help (like bandaids, which I had none for some reason)

He says okay he'll be here soon, and since he was out and about when I called him, he told me my mom was coming too. I was like ""f**k"", I was literally in 100% girl mode, I was wearing a dress, leggings, a girls jacket, fingernail polish and makeup (not too much), but I kinda said screw it and waited for them without changing. I was more worried about coming out then my wound at the time to be honest.

So they come, my dad patches up my finger (I had nothing in my dorm) and I tried making sure my mom couldn't see my fingers but see saw them, but didn't say anything. And after awhile of going to a store and getting some things, I tell my dad to park somewhere because I have to talk to mom about something serious.

So telling her I was transgendered was way more easy this time then telling my dad. After a minute of my mom saying ""You can tell me anything, I won't judge you"" I said ""I'm transgendered""

It was quiet for about 5 seconds, and then my mom started to cry, not because she was mad or disapointed, but because she was so proud of me for telling her this. She told me how proud she was for being with me all these years and how she always knew I was special (not in a bad way for clarification)

Something that really hit me was that we usually walk around the city we live in and go to stores and she said ""I'm proud to walk around with you and I'll still be proud to walk around with you, no matter what you decide to do with your life"" and I cried so much because that was amazing to hear.

So well like I said in the last post, not everyone has the same situation but you should come out to your parents, it's an amazing first step to take and I cannot believe (I MUST stress this) that both of my parents support me all the way."

Seriously, though, a lot of nonbinary people have dysphoria. Some don't, yes. But many do. And our dysphoria is not any less valid or ""less intense""  than that of binary trans people.

Also, nonbinary or genderqueer is not some sort of mid-point or ""not trans enough to be actually trans"" stage. Yes, some people think they're genderqueer before acknowledging they're actually male/female, but that does not make the rest of us nonbinary folk half-transgender or some such, in much the same way that being bisexual does not make one half-gay.

In kindergarten I was so jealous of the girls that could grow out their hair and play dress up.  I'm sure my parents knew what was up, and as hardcore mormons they tried their best to keep me from coming out as anything but straight, including a regular buzz cut.  Later in elementary school I hated myself for wanting to be a girl, I would sit on my own on the playground daydreaming about how my life could be different.  My level of self hatred got to the point where I tried to kill myself... In the fifth grade.  My parents never found out, and even though I dropped not so subtle hints everywhere, including a blatant note I hid under the couch that said ""I want to be a girl,"" my parents refused to even consider the possibility that I wasn't straight.  I remember that more than once I prayed literally for hours that god would let me be a girl for just one day and I would never ask for anything ever again.  I swore that I would devote my life to god at 12 years old if for just 24 hours I could get my only desire.

At the end of elementary school I remember one particularly intense Sunday school lesson on the evils of homosexuality.  At that moment I decided that from that point forward I would not allow myself to want to be anything but a man, and it almost worked, except that I wanted to want to be a man.  Fast forward four years and several suicide attempts to last year, the end of my junior year of highschool.  I couldn't even remember why I was depressed at this point, I had successfully blocked all of the shit about wanting to be a girl out, and instead replaced it with just wanting to be dead.  At this point I had discovered reddit, and thanks to my failing grades and apathy towards everything, I spent most of my days on reddit which led me to discover that the Mormon church is complete bullshit, and the subreddit /r/transtimelines.

I would browse transtimelines for hours each day, looking at each of the posts multiple times, and then it just clicked one day.  Just like in the movies all of my past experiences rushed back and thought something like ""oh fuck, I'm transgender, aren't I?""  The rest of the day was spent just playing mario 64, but I didn't get a single star, I was just laying on my floor holding down the analog stick while wondering why the fuck it had to be me.

I've had a year to come to terms with this, I'm no longer suicidal, I'm actually not crushingly depressed for the first time in my life, but I still don't know what the fuck I'm doing.  I go through cycles of thinking I could live the rest of my life as a man, and not being able to think of anything but transitioning.  I haven't come out to my parents (well I did tell my mom, but she didn't believe me which at this point I'm okay with).  Just at this point what the fuck is happening with me?

I'm sorry if none of this makes sense, I'm typing this up on my phone at midnight."
Razy_Liver,asktransgender,Ex-gf wants to get back together and said she is ok if i transition,"My ex and i got back together after a 3 year relationship (i'm 18) and i remember telling her about trans toughts at 16 years of age. After i was being physically abused by her, she broke up with me and left me to the dogs (she knew i suffered from depression and i was on meds). months after i started taking xanex and this really stabilized my mood and made me a more colder, resolute and calm person so i did not miss her or love her anymore.

She started texting me and calling me crying a while back, claiming she cries everyday that aren't together anymore. Now she wants to get back together but i'm confused (gender wise) and i have everything in motion to start using blockers. I told her of my confusion and she was kind of okay with it. At the time she was drunk and she said she would still love me if i become a girl (or she said she would attempt to have a relationship.) Now i don't buy this at all, but i practically grew up with this person and she telling me she would love me as a female provoked actual feelings of love and I started to cry (don't cry often anymore). I'm still gonna start blockers because i get happier the feminine i look and act (using this a diagnostic criteria to determine if i'm trans or not). Despite my plans i haven't disclosed this to her

well i'm awfully confused and I DO NOT want to hurt her emotionally and i've let the gender thing out on the table. What should I make of her behaviour?"
Elika_Ryan,asktransgender,Is there a trend of people being the most afraid to tell their fathers? Does anyone have advice on this?,"I feel like at this point my fear of my dad finding out or coming out to him is the only thing holding me back.

My dad is.. unpredictable. Not the violent kind but in that he pretends to be very open emotionally but keeps his real feelings and opinions pretty close to his chest.

There are two opinions I juggle with him. On one side he says that all he really wants is for me to be happy. On the other is the realization that he has a lot of expectation because he expects me to always do my absolute best.

When it comes to transgender issues I'm not sure what to think. Last time I saw him he made fun of my brother for accidentally wearing a girls sock quite a bit and he made a joke to my girlfriend about how he is glad his son isn't the one wearing makeup..

At the same time he is fairly okay with most things so long as they stay away from him and I'm afraid that will be the reaction I get. I'm very close with him and I have little other family as my mom died 9 years ago. I don't want him to be disgusted by me or something like that.

TLDR

I'm scared of my dad's potentially unpredictable reaction and would love advice on coming out to fathers and to single parents maybe as well."
mrtrollstein,asktransgender,How do I go about coming out to my two (11 and 8) brothers?,"I finally got up the courage to start coming out to people other than the therapist back at home (I'm at university).

Anyway, I told most of my friends and both my sisters, and I've only gotten supportive responses. I have not yet come out to my parents, but I am 99% sure my mother at least will not be supportive. She is your typical Roman Catholic, super conservative, homophobic (but denies it) person. Homosexuality is not to be mentioned in my house. The only argument she's ever given against it is ""What they do is gross."" Gender identity is so far off the radar that it's probably ""just a theory, like evolution."" (ironic how she's right, but only by accidental misunderstanding of the wording)

She's not going to be on board, and I'm ok with that. If she tries to kick me out (which I honestly doubt), it's fine with me. But what do I do about my two younger brothers? She's not going to want me to tell them anything. It's more than likely she will take active measures to prevent me from doing so.

Even if that wasn't a problem, how do I come out to an 8 year old kid? I'm garbage at this, please help...

On an unrelated note, is this euphoria I'm feeling normal? Despite that I'm only out to around 10 people, and my therapist doesn't even know that I've actually made my choice (he only ever knew I was questioning), I feel like I'm floating."
confusedwaffles,asktransgender,Should I consider transitioning?,"Ok. I'm just going to start typing and see what comes out. Sorry in advance if this is a bit all over the place.

I'm 18. I live in southwestern Ontario. And I was born male. Although for quite a while, when thinking about myself, I don't really think of myself as male. I also have a lot of problems. I don't have a job at the moment (although I'm in 3 bands), I have no plans for the future, and I just feel stuck. I'm also severely depressed, been so for probably 5 years, but was diagnosed a bit over a year ago. In addition to the depression, I also have some general anxiety, possibly OCD, and lately have been having a lot of dysphoric thoughts and feelings about my gender. 

I've always been a guy, but I've never felt strongly tied to my gender. Even though I'm not the most masculine looking person, you can still tell I'm a guy. I've never (publicly) tried to look feminine, other than curling my eyelashes a couple times (a girl at school once asked me if I wore eyeliner and it made me happy)

I've never been into ""guy stuff"". My dad died when I was 9, so I never really had a male role model. That being said, I also never really gravitated towards ""girl stuff"" either, although I never had the opportunity I guess. My only real interest is music. 

Today I was feeling so low that I just slept all day, and when I was awake I was just thinking about how unsatisfied I am with myself (along with a lot of other stuff). So I realized that these feelings and thoughts have been present for a long time, I've just been repressing and ignoring them. And they're just growing stronger. Today I imagined myself as female (not the first time) and I felt just really satisfied and happy. I smiled. Then I opened my eyes and fell back into reality.

I hate my name. I hate my body. And I fucking hate feeling like this. I just have no sense of self, no identity. I feel empty and uncomfortable in my own body. I don't know what to do next. 

I know this is a big thing, and I'm not just jumping into things, thinking that dealing with these feelings will fix all of my problems. I don't know what to think.

Even if I do eventually get things figured out, I don't know how transitioning would affect my relationships with family, friends, bandmates, etc. I just need help, I'm caught in a fucking whirlwind of confusion and doubt.

So, should I even remotely consider transitioning? Who should I talk to about this? How do I talk to my family? I have so many questions, but I'm feeling really overwhelmed, so I'll just leave this post as is for now. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading."
t-girlrachel89,asktransgender,Mood Swings,"I have been on full HRT for a couple months now. I was warned about the mood swings and crying that comes with estrogen and how something can seem worse than it really is. The funny thing is although I have some of the effects like crying a little more, I am usually less mood-swingy and a little more level-headed, don't seem to have quite as much anxiety as often(its far from a cure, but I'll take what I can get). I still get upset things and can blow them a little out-of-proportion too, and I get killer chocolate cravings. Even though HRT isn't magic that solves every problem in my life, everything was much worse pre-HRT. The mood swings were extremely bad, I would more often express unhappy emotions through rage and have much more limited ability to process positive emotions. The anxiety issues were much worse and I was more prone to ending up in the ""black hole."" While I was expecting either wild mood swings like some of my friends have or pure bliss, it has been more subtle then that. I think it has given me relief I need to be a little more patient with my transition.I'm a little surprised by this, it definitely agrees with me, but its also more subtle than I expected. "
SuperDesk75,asktransgender,"Did you pick a new name for yourself pretty hastily, and then regret not being more careful/thorough about finding the right one?","I just took the mental plunge to find a new name last week, and I almost immediately landed on one that I think I really like. I'm inclined to just run with it, but then...shouldn't I spend way too much time narrowing down a list and obsessing over the choice for a while??

The alternate view is - this one jumped out at me straight away, and I've only found a smattering of other options that are even close. So...DUH?"
Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,"I felt ugly and miserable pre-HRT, and now I feel I'm gradually becoming attractive, and oh my god it's wonderful!","From age 12 to 32, I was obese, and between the ages of 19 and 32, there are very few pictures of me, because I refused to allow anyone to take any, and I didn't want to take any myself.  I hated seeing my reflection in the mirror, because I just didn't want to be reminded of what I looked like.  When I would take a shower, I would try to not look down, because I hated the sight of my own body.

That has pretty much changed now.  I've lost more than 100lbs, so I'm now skinnier than 65% of all people my age and height, and every time I see my reflection in a mirror now, I'm happy with what I see.  Actually, I feel like flirting with myself in the mirror.

I'm still a 33 year old virgin (I thought that if I had sex with a woman, that I would be doing a tremendous disservice to her, given my profound ugliness), but I'm okay with that now, because I'm much more comfortable with my appearance.

Now, people are telling me that I'm attractive.  Things like ""you have a cute face"" and ""you have nice boobs"", and it's great! Far from being disgusted by my own appearance, I'm taking dozens of selfies a day.  Today I thought I looked particularly nice, so I got like 7-8 outfits out of my closet and just started taking selfies.  The change is so profound that it makes me dizzy.  My residual self-image is still mostly that of a miserable and obese man (that's why it makes me so happy to see myself in the mirror).  I feel like I've died and gone to heaven, and I can't believe my good fortune.

Has anyone else experienced this sort of switch? Going from feeling like you're very ugly pre-HRT, to suddenly seeing the hormones working, seeing yourself as the gender you identify with, and being enamored with your appearance?

JocelynWonderland,asktransgender,Officially one year~,"Just wanted to make this post more so cause I've been looking forward to it for a very long time. 

I know the changes aren't really all that much, but I feel like looking at that picture that I'm really seeing two different people. I've never been the most active member of the community but years ago when I was repressing and just getting into the thought of transitioning, the people here were a huge help. 

So thank you all, from the very bottom of my heart. After repressing for so long I really needed a kick in the ass to get going and now between here and the help of some friends and loved ones, I make my first major milestone. 

Here's to many more years, hopefully.

katie_tucker91,asktransgender,Advice needed,"So I'm a preeverything trans girl who lives in a small town in the middle of America. I work as a man at a liquor store, and I live with my mom and my room mate.

Basicly I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. My desire to start hormones and go full time is stronger than almost any feeling I've ever had in my life. But I'm running into a few issues with the concept of how I will be paid, or more importantly how I'm going to move out if I'm not getting paid. Because no way my work will keep me on if I'm openly trans. And I only have a month to move out. I'm also getting close to my one year mark at my job which is an accomplishment I have yet to achieve but have been working on for awhile to make my resume better. 


So this leaves me feeling like I need to wait till the one year mark (June) and find a new job right? But I'm scared I may fail at another job, but be stuck with my newly acquired bills. 


So I guess I'm asking, how do I go full time, and still be financially stable?"

x-52,asktransgender,Should I accept a psychiatrist not letting me start HRT?,"Psychiatrist said I was too fucked up to start HRT, and said I had to wait a minimum of 6 months during which time I'm expected to get my life in order. I'm not satisfied with that and I'm not going to be able to improve while hormones are being withheld, when I wouldn't have sought them in the first place unless I felt I was ready. I was really trying to make a positive change in my life, and had hope for a better future and the will to work towards it, knowing it would be worth it. Apparently this was not enough. 

Everyone essentially expects me to just deal with this or fuck off. I thought I should ask people who don't conveniently never have to go through this to make sure of what my options are before I kill myself. Am I being unreasonable in not wanting to wait to start? Should I accept someone else's assessment over my own judgement? Is starting hormones that dangerous? Etc?

After thinking through deeply, I have laid down a several plans on how to move forward after finally accepting myself as a transgirl. 

As I'm 25 this year and I plan not to come out anytime soon, but wouldn't want my body to continue masculine any further, I'm thinking of starting T blockers, but not sure if it's too late now? I have late puberty at age of 15-16. 

I'm planning on skipping Estrogen first as I'm worried that the breast development may be too fast and I can't hide it, as I need to push my career further to be able to get out of my conservative / abusive country before I am able to be fully out. 

Any advice? 

Thanks everyone!


--------------------------

EDIT: UPDATED VIA COMMENTS


Thanks everyone for all the comments!! Sorry can't reply to all individually :( :(
I get the point now that it's never too late to start HRT. But need some advice/experience if anyone have gone for T-Blockers only for prolonged period (more than 2 years?), without taking Estrogen?


If I were to decide to transition, I was planning to start with T-Blockers first to prevent anymore masculinity changes to my body (since I have a late puberty and I think it's still able to ""block"" really tiny bits, just in case...).


But am really not sure on the long term effects to my body, if I live without Estrogen and T for prolonged period.


What should I do? :( I really wish I can push-backward the Estrogen as a last resort (to take together) as I want to stabilize my career first, so that I am able to migrate out of my country before starting the full-transition."
Genderqueertrans,asktransgender,Does having stress really mess your hormonal levels up ?

Can anyone tell me something about this ? "
Ayra45,asktransgender,I just got out of a psychiatric hospital.,"This is more or less me sharing/venting but in a neutral sort of way.  And giving info on what you may expect as a trans person if you happen to end up in this situation.  And also letting people know I'm alive.  I did post saying I was suicidal and then disappear for a week and its not like I'm well know but I've come back to see a couple pm's so I thought I'd just say hi, I'm alive, and this is what went down.  

___
Anywho.  The story begins how you'd expect.  I locked myself in the bathroom.  And made some poor decisions.  I texted my therapist since I was afraid I would end up severely injured and not. . ya know.  She called EMS and the ambulance showed up and took me away!  *super spooky music*

Obviously it depends on where you live and what your area is like 'trans acceptance wise', but I live in Idaho, and this went relatively well.  Nobody seemed surprised or shocked or judgemental of the fact I was trans. The paramedics were very kind and used my preferred name once I mentioned it.  

I got to the hospital and I became very anxious because I know they had me change into these wax paper sort of gown things.  And of course being where I'm at I'm presenting male but I'm ya know, wearing girl stuff.  And they were aware I was trans.  

The staff ended up being all female.  I don't know if that was intentional.  Maybe?  Anyways, so far nothing crazy, no rude comments, no silliness.  Just really professional people handling somebody who wanted to hurt themselves.  

Ok, disclaimer here.  This was about when what I took started kicking in.  Basically it was to the point where I would turn my head to look the other way and I'd take like a good 3 seconds to refocus my vision, I was pretty solidly out of it.  

There was a point I vaguely remember when the nurse had me give a urine sample and at the time she complimented my underwear saying it was cute rofl.  So that was nice of her.  I think I kinda mumbled at her but I hope she knows I meant thanks.  

Annd then I fell asleep while they treated me and stuff, and then they drove me out to the psych hospital.  

It was a nice clean place. At first they put me in whats called the observation room in the male unit.  Basically I got my own room while they all had 3 to a room.  Suck it, I get my own room!  But at this point I was basically out of it still so I slept like 80% of the first day and stayed in my room.  They gave me my clothes back.  But they took my shoelaces.  I bet they horde shoelaces and one day when the price of shoelaces tops out their plan of world domination will be complete.  Or everybody wears crocs.  I mean neither option is good. 

Day 2 rolls around and I venture out to get food but basically stay in my room.  My family finds out where I'm at and visit.  Its pretty quiet.  I'm avoiding the other patients like the plague because I'm super anxious and bad at social stuff and also my bra shows through my shirt which isn't a big deal at home but in a male unit with mentally unstable people I'm fucking on edge here.  

Day 3, early morning, the charge nurse comes in and tells me she wants to move me to the female side if thats okay with me.  She tells me she doesn't want me to be uncomfortable so she would have me in the Observation room on that side I'd be able to do meals and groups with the ladies though.  

Yes, please yes. Almost immediately I'm so much calmer.  So much less stress. I can go to groups and interact and everybody is really nice and friendly and accepting and everybody including patients use the right pronouns.  One older patient called me a slut and a whore and not to take thomas from her but I appreciated it because its still female pronouns so whatevs.  

And that went on about until I was discharged.  I made some friends and everybody was quite nice.  I feel a bit better now, at least I'm not actively planning my own demise.  Life is somewhat steadier than it was.  

I mean I'm not magically better.  I hate that my family feels that way now.  And I keep saying I feel better because I don't want to go back, I mean its not bad but its not good either.  Its limbo.  Not the fun kind with flexible people and steel drums, the weird vaguely frustrating kind.  

I suppose I'm a little better.  I guess thats something.  And I'm glad I'm alive at least for now.  I guess I'm just taking it day by day.  I dunno.  I'm gonna be a whore just like that old lady said here and ask for internet hugs lol. 

I hope you all are doing okay yourselves &lt;3  I should really sleep so I'll just leave this here lol.  Night!

TLDR: Idaho isn't quite so bad, I'm not quite so bad I suppose, and life goes on. "

So far, work's the only place that doesn't know. I don't think I have time to find another job, and New York State has no protections for trans folk. I don't know what to do."
clud,asktransgender,Dealing with the limbo pre-everything?,"I've been having gender dysphoria for a long time but it's only recently that I started to be able to identify it. I'm 20 and assigned male but have honestly felt more like a female for a lot of my life. I've got an appointment this Friday to see my GP for a referral and that should hopefully get things moving. The problem I'm having is that nhs wait times for GICs are probably at least a year and a half just for a first appointment. Waiting that long feels agonising but right now it's the best option for me unfortunately. I'm still experimenting a bit with this newly identified part of myself and that's great. However, the idea that I'm going to be stuck for so long without any change feels really difficult at the moment. I am essentially just going to be in waiting list limbo. I'm trying to find an approach that isn't a sort of 'grit my teeth and just get through it' because sure while the end point does matter to me, I'd rather not make the journey there feel like hell. I plan on coming out before I get to the GIC but it's going to take me some time (and a shed load of courage).


So my question for all of you is, what little things can I try to help with the dysphoria and to help make my days feel a bit smoother, whether directly related to the dysphoria or just great for soothing in general? I'm seriously interested in what people have tried, even if was completely random or didn't really work.

Oorlogstijd,asktransgender,Cis heterosexual man with transgender loved one?,"Hey everyone! Lovely subreddit you have here. I hoped to use it to get some advice. I also want to warn readers that I'm a bit of a Orang Utang in a porcelain shop when I talk about this subject. Feel free to correct me, I'd appreciate that, but please keep in mind that I'm here with the best intentions...

TLDR version: I would love to talk about how a heterosexual, cisgendered man can deal with a loved one being trans (while I got to know him as a her). Just hear some experiences, perspectives and/or advice. Are there other places I can go to educate myself?

Context:
Someone very dear to me is trans. He (trans man but fine with fem body) told me about this in the past, when we were in a relationship. I handled that as wrong as I could. Years later, we're still very close (no longer a couple) and I try to be the best friend I can be. Recently however, we started having fights because of my stupidity and crudeness around the subject. I ask him questions, but I approach subjects so poorly that my ignorance hurts him (because we're so close, spent years growing up together). I get angry about stuff, I don't understand most of it, and everytime I stumble about something that's very important to him, it hits him like a train. Like I said, I feel like King Kong in the big city, accidentally crushing everything I touch, whenever we talk about this subject.

The main thing I fail to express is that I don't want to lose -her-. The girl I fell in love with once. Tough, tomboyish, all things I adored about her. Was she the same person as he is now? Or did I lose one of my closest friends? Did I spend the best years of my life with a lie? Or is it the same person, just with a number of different complicated titles now? I feel like he went somewhere I can't follow him. I don't know how. And on top of that, he's seeing a lot of people from LHBT communities, and I don't know if I can ever fit in there because I feel like I'm 'part of the enemy team'.

I've tried a lot of times to look up more information, but I feel the 'LHBT community' is confusing and intimidating for a hetero cisgendered person. It's basically a wall of a million different titles and terms, representing 'clubs' which even have their own flags. I understand the need to feel part of like minded people, but it also creates exclusivity and walls for outsiders. There's also the fact that a lot of people in these communities are very angry and frustrated and sometimes channel this on cisgendered people (terms like ""down with the cis-tem"" spring to mind) which makes me realise I've come to the wrong neighborhood. And all this adds to the growing cliff between my friend and me. I fail to understand him properly and I feel more and more alienated when I try to understand."
Evo32,asktransgender,Advice needed!,"Hi! So I was told to post this here coming from /r/lgbt - any advice is appreciated!

First of all, I’m a male in my mid 20’s. Since my teens I’ve known somethings been wrong and I just didn’t really bother with it, I’ve pretty much been unhappy with myself my whole life, I just assumed it was something to add to the pile. A few months ago I read a story on a mans transformation and journey to becoming a female, and it resonated with me in so many ways… Since then I’ve been reading more about other peoples journeys and researching help/guidance with this sort of thing, but it’s all a bit overwhelming. I can’t reach out to family as I don’t have any. The one thing I’m sure of is that I am a woman, it’s who I am I’ve repressed it for all this time. I’m not attracted to males (Does this make me a lesbian?), and I would just like some guidance before I embark on this journey to find myself and be who I am inside…

Thanks for reading, and please, any advice is welcomed"

ss-captain,asktransgender,Transition because of gender roles?,"Hi, so I created an account to specifically ask this question because it's eating me alive. 

I'm just turned 17 MtF and a couple days ago i met another MtF and FtM at an lgbt meeting and we kinda chatted and had similar interests so we hanged out some more afterwards and i know both of them transitioned because of ""gender roles"". I reacted normally to it (i myself had severe body dysphoria since I was a child), but when I talked about it to my other friend she said she hated people like that, that they weren't really trans and only make people think that trans people transition because of their likes, hobbies and so on. I mean she was clearly distressed and hateful about it (""they are as bad as cis people"", ""impostors"" etc.). So even though I used to think kinda along those lines (that they gave other trans people bad rep) they actually seemed very kind of...rational about it? I mean if  people can transition because they have different in intensity body dysphoria or because they want a different body (body euphoria?), why can't people transition because being in a different body would make their life better for social reasons? I mean society won’t change overnight and everyone only has one life to live. We didn't go into too much detail yet, but as far as i understood MtF was really really feminine before transition both in mannerism, the kind of things she liked and appearance (though people still could see she was male) and her life pretty much was hell (humiliation+harassment) because of it even in a gay setting (gay men told her she was like a woman - traditionally feminine mannerisms and hobbies with which she apparently was absolutely fine with, but obvs. other people were not). And the FtM  wasn't as masculine though liked masculine things and stuff and says he feels really more comfortable like he is now because now people more often assume things about him that are true + he doesn't feel he doesn't fit in society. Like I don't know anything else about them but they both told me they don’t have body dysphoria (we talked about it some) and maybe if society wasn't like it is now they wouldn't transition but it is how it is and they're happier now in their bodies and could live normal/better lives. I realize it was probably much harder for them than my generalization but they specifically said they both don’t fit the “it’s about the wrong body/different gender identity” narrative and stated their reasons for transition as social. I guess I’m so unbelievably excited about it because It’s the first time that I met people who talked about it fairly openly (I know there are other people like that).

I want to say that I know there are effeminate men and butch women, i think it's absolutely normal, but they do get a lot of shit/have a lot of drawbacks that depends on how feminine/masculine they are and so how visible they are to other people, where they live etc. So I assume it's not for everyone/not everyone can live happy lives like that.

 Basically what i got from our conversation was that they transitioned because society's expectations, norms and everything else that relates to gender as social construct(=gender roles, but also expectations and assumptions etc. about each gender) made them feel mental anguish and sometimes people would threaten them physically, but they didn't have a problem with their own bodies as such (only what society ascribes to them) and they didn't particulary want different bodies for themselves, only for how society would react to them as people if they had different bodies. Like how extremely gnc male became just an ordinary straight woman and so got an ordinary life without constant harassment and a somewhat gnc female with lots and lots of masculine coded interests, hobbies etc. now became just a guy who doesn't have to validate his interests to anyone and feels okay in his body as well.

Like I personally suffered through severe body dysphoria (not anymore!) but I keep thinking if I just wanted to do all those things women are allowed to do (or rather expected to do and so punished if they don't) and men aren’t and I would not have wanted to be incredibly effeminate male because it’s super hard in our society and not for the reasons that have to do with the body would it have been wrong for me to transition if I understood the consequences? I’m so hung up on this please tell me what you think. 


Edit to add something because I think there was a misunderstanding:

If social dysphoria - severe discomfort  from being perceived as wrong gender aka not matching your gender identity, I'm positively sure that's not what they meant - just that people were treating them badly because their expression and interests didn't match what society think is acceptable for their sex, but when they transitioned it became exactly the opposite - it was what socially acceptable for the sex they transitioned to and so they now have better lives.

Alliesmith94,asktransgender,Any Last Minute Advice or Words words of encouragement before coming out to Girlfriend of three years.,"Hi everyone, 

After a long period of questioning, and ultimately acceptance that I fall somewhere on the Trans spectrum (right now I mostly just crossdress, but I have the desire to go further and am still figuring out how much further), I've come to a point where I would like to be upfront with my fantastic partner of 3 years, whom I live with about it. 

I've seen a gender therapist a couple of times and came up with a plan for telling here, I'm just super nervous and scared. So any last minute advice or words of encouragement would be much appreciated. 

She is quite progressive, and even said once early on in our relationship that she would be fine if I wore women's clothes just would be bummed we weren't the same size. She's also jokingly tried to put her bra's on me, but I denied it for fear of outing my self (this was before I had accepted this part of me) On the other hand she's also said some things things that show a lack of awareness about the transcommunity like ""what the heck is a pansexual?"" etc. So ultimately I don't thing her response will be worst case scenario (although I am prepared for that), but I do think it will be certainly a challenging conversation. 

Any last minute words of advice or moral support? I just can't keep this from her any longer but I'm terrified of the conversation. "
HelpSeeker02,asktransgender,"My girlfriend came out to me as trans, i don't know what to do and need advice (PS: long text)","(I'm going to start this by apologizing for my English, it's not my first language, also it’s my first time on reddit, I've already posted this on another trend, but a friend suggested me to try it in this one also)


So, I’m a 23yo heterosexual men and my girlfriend is 25 (respecting her requests, I’m going to refer to her as he from now on), we’ve been together for the last 3 years and we live together for the last 1. I can say for sure that this has been the happiest years of my whole life. I’ve fallen in love for his kind nature and femininity, his way of smiling at me and how he would cuddle against my chest when we watch movies or go to the theatre, everything about him is perfect to me. I know I want to marry him and already am saving for a ring. But about 2 weeks ago, I arrived at home and he was just there sitting on the couch looking really worried and anxious, it got me really nervous, he said we needed to talk. That day he told me he is a transsexual man and feels like this since her later teens, way before we started to date. But he was in denial since his parents are religious and conservatives, but he doesn’t want to be in denial anymore and be who he is, he also said that he wants to start transitioning since he hates his body and being seeing as a women. But he also said that I’m the first person he really loved and that he can’t imagine himself without me and asked me to please give him a chance with this new identity and to try to be with her through this. All I do was hug him and tell him that it would all be okay.

Now I must say that I’ve always considered myself an open minded person, but I could never imagine myself in a relationship with another men. Now guys, I must say that this whole thing kicked me hard! How can the most feminine girl I know turn out to be a men? She never had any masculine traits (except maybe her liking of video games). The next few days from her coming out, she started to be public about it to everyone we know. I was feeling numb, like in a hallucination I couldn’t wake up from, everything was tasteless and I couldn’t find joy in the things I used to. I had to cope with my coworkers looks and whispers, my dad started to rush me to end things and throwing homophobic jokes. But about a week ago the numbness faded and now I’m angry, like really angry, I feel cheated and robbed of 3 years of my life, and I feel like a bastard for feeling this way because I know it’s not something my partner choose, and I try my hardest to not let it out on him, but he feels my depression and anger and cries and apologizes all the time. I feel like my whole world have crumpled and I still try to be supportive and caring for him, even though all this happened, I still love him so much. I’m also going to help him to come out to his parents.

I love him and I don’t want to break up with him. I’m in love with his personality, his noble stance on everything, his way being caring and loving with everything and everyone, but how will this work? I don’t know if I can just suddenly feel attracted to a men. Sex is a big thing for me, how will I be able to have sex without the women figure? I’ve also always wanted to have kids, this is impossible after his transition, and I do want kids badly. Has anyone had similar experiences? I really need advice"
Reallifeorfantasy25,asktransgender,"Currently in a lesbian relationship but have always seen myself as a man, worried about the future?","I have always self identified as ftm and have been out to a few of my friends and family as such but have not started any transitioning beyond just wearing men's clothes. I have been dating my current gf, who is a lesbian, for 6 months and she knows that I'm trans, I told her that early in the relationship and she was completely accepting of that and fine with it but did reiterate that at this point in her life she's a lesbian and doesn't see that changing anytime soon. We both agreed that we were happy in our lesbian relationship and that was the end of it.

I have, so far, not had a problem with having a lesbian relationship with her and don't generally feel anymore dysphoria than I previously did in my life. Maybe even a little less than before as I don't have the same compartmented life where I was a man in my romantic relationships but a girl in every other aspect of life. I still see myself internally as a male but it doesn't hinder my relationship with myself or with her.

The main reason I'm coming here is that I'm worried one day I'll wake up and won't be ok with it and will want/need to transition to be happy. We've had jokey conversations where I've said if I woke up with a penis, would you still date me? And she's said yes, she loves me and would eventually adjust but that's obviously not the situation that would happen so I don't put a lot of stock in that. On one hand I feel like I'd be happy continuing to live my life in this lesbian relationship with her and building a life together. On the other hand I worry that one day I'll want to transition and still be with her and she won't want to. But that could be years and years away or never.

Obvious answer is to talk to her about it but I don't know how necessarily and feel like I don't want to bring unnecessary hypotheticals into our relationship so early on and maybe derail a good thing. We're both crazy about each other and see this being a long term kind of thing, at 25 and 27 I think we're old enough to be realistic about the trajectory of our relationship and wouldn't waste each other's time if we weren't serious or didn't see real long term potential. 

Has anyone else been in this situation or not transitioning for a partner, are you Happy with that choice, are they? Any advice would be appreciated."
Fairlady31,asktransgender,Got attached to a chaser (who seemed nice/respectful) who then blocked me on all social media and abandoned me for no reason.,"Okay, so I started seeing this really nice attractive guy who was roughly my age (19). Met him on tinder. Told him I was looking for a relationship and wasn't looking for sex or anything, and he seemed to be supportive of that. We chilled 3 times, he didn't push anything on me. He was actually pretty respectful to be honest, and all our dates basically went the same way. He would pick me up in his car and we'd smoke weed and drive around and he'd pick me up food/starbucks. He actually seemed nice, that's what bugs me about this whole thing. On the first date we started holding hands/kissing, but we stopped there. Same with the second and third dates; we would just drive around, smoke, talk, eat and cuddle/make out together. He never pushed anything on me and I seriously thought I was starting to love him. We were in kind of a weird relationship; he had just broken up with his girlfriend and said he just wanted things to be natural between us. Because he didn't push the sex thing on me, I didn't push a committed relationship on him.

I seriously thought I was the luckiest girl in the world. Not only did he like me for me, but he was respectful and didn't force things on me. I really got attached to him, we texted eachother nonstop, trust built and I thought we were slowly building a good relationship together.

Then shortly after our third date he just stops texting me completely. Deletes/blocks me on all social media, won't reply to my texts/messages, and deletes all the messages we sent to eachother on tinder.

I can't believe I was tricked into liking someone that didn't care about me or my feelings at all. I'm totally hurting now. The sad thing is I still like him and would come crawling back if he called me today.

I guess this proves that not all chasers are perverted weirdos. Some, like this guy was, are more sneaky. I bet he was trying to slowly groom me for sex and when he realized I have self-respect took off. I don't know, does anyone have any insights into this? Not all chasers have to be perverts, right?

chd29,asktransgender,My Experience with Awful Doctors and Medically Transitioning,"(In my 20s and in the US)

[several years ago] I went to a therapist seeking a letter for hormones as my goal since I didn't know of any informed consent clinics around. I wanted to medically transition properly since I was already self-medicating (with estradiol). I thought the whole experience was bullshit. I didn't need to make up my mind because I was already set on transitioning. She tried to get me to dress super fem even though I wasn’t comfortable at the time. I don’t particularly like talking about trans issues so it felt like all the sessions leading up the letter was just me trying to appease her through her gatekeeping shit. It was also quite expensive so I got my letter and never saw her again.

I go to Doctor #1 (an endocrinologist) with letter in hand. I was referred to Doctor #1 by the therapist. They see a lot of transgender people and for some reason they don’t accept insurance for transgender-related appointments but they do if the visit is for other reasons. So I paid an absurdly expensive fee out-of-pocket even though I already had insurance. She doesn’t hesitate to prescribe me estradiol but I argue with her about progesterone. She claims it’s not needed but ends up prescribing it to me. I ask around and find that other private practices accept my insurance without issue (which I find to be true later on) so I never see Doctor #1 again.

At this point I felt wronged so I just self-medicated again. Nothing crazy, in fact, I was just kept myself on the same dose Doctor #1 had prescribed. Eventually I see another doctor, Doctor #2. No problems with insurance. I tell her the story and that I’ve been self-medicating early on and find that she has hang-ups about me self-medicating in the past. From this point on she considers me untrustworthy (that’s what I get for being honest). I get prescribed estradiol pills for some time but eventually I want to try injections to see if there is any increased feminization. She is reluctant but OKs it. I get a 40mg/1ml vial with prescription but because she finds me untrustworthy she has me keep the vial there. I get injections at the practice and they refuse to help me get syringes/needles and teach me to do it on my own properly. It’s either keep going back there to get injections or go back to pills. The nurse later informs me that the doctor is not allowed to keep my vial there and I get to take it home. At some point I go back to estradiol pills because I hate the situation I’m in (Doctor #2 isn’t willing to work with me any further).

I move to another area so I don’t see Doctor #2 again. I go back to self-medicating but after some time I hesitantly decide to see my school’s clinic. They do a lot of referrals here to affiliated doctors in the surrounding area. Here’s Doctor #3 - the initial visit goes fine. On the form they list 3 options for sex “Male, Female, Transgender” – I think the wording is weird but whatever I guess. Since the referral is 4 months away (yes it takes that long…soonest one available) I end up going back to the clinic because I’m running low on estradiol I bought online. I have to argue with Doctor #3 to just get estradiol, she says prescribing that in my circumstance is something not normally done at the clinic and that I have a referral already. I state that my estradiol is running low and that my referral is months off. It’d be better to get it more legitimately and it would save me money because I already have insurance. She goes to speak with her medical director in private claiming its protocol. Afterward she comes back and writes me a prescription for estradiol pills but specifically states that I am not to come back to the clinic for another estradiol prescription and to see the doctor I was referred to. She also accuses me of forcing her to practice medicine in a specific way. I find it maddening that I’m treated this way – if a diabetic comes in and is running low on insulin, do they just get turned away? In the same way a raging diabetic’s physical condition will worsen without insulin so too will my mental health without estradiol.
I missed my referral appointment. They don’t have robocall, text, or e-mail reminders so I simply forgot (the school clinic itself did have these reminders). The appointment was months off from scheduling but I don’t know how common it is for practices to have automated reminders and it was ultimately my responsibility so I can’t really fault them. Rescheduling would be months away yet again. I also tried calling a place that specifically treats transgender people thinking maybe I’d get barely adequate treatment but an appointment there would be months away too. It’s always just endless waiting.

I move to another area again and am no longer insured. So I’m back to self-medicating as it’s cheaper than paying for insurance all year and getting griefed by doctors. Obamacare isn’t any cheaper I’ve found. I’m going to try to see if I get free insurance through a local healthcare system but I don’t know if they’ll even accept me. I am just left feeling crushed by the healthcare system. What do you guys think? Is my experience common? Is my perspective malformed? "

Quiinton,asktransgender,Has anyone in Canada gotten through the sea of documents involved with a name change?,"Hi everyone! I am 17, FTM, and going to university next year (already accepted to my program) - but I'm really worried because I want to be able to work in the labs in a few years without professors being confused about who I am. So I figured I'd just change my name now to avoid confusion and go to university as male even if I don't pass all the time, or haven't gotten on HRT yet (more bureaucratic silliness with me not being 18, CHEO having a year long waitlist for an initial appointment, etc). 

But - I'm so confused about changing my name in Canada. It looks like I can do it with a form, but then there's a whole sea of trying to change my passport (which is dual US/Canadian so that's a whole different ball game), SIN (since I've gotten a few scholarships and the university needs my SIN to be able to credit them to my account), driver's license, OHIP card, birth certificate... and all of them need multiple signatures, notes, paperwork, documents, supporting documents, etc. And the pressure's on - I did pretty well in my last year of school, and deans of the faculty have been emailing, professors have been calling, etc. trying to get me (under my current name and gender!) to come and visit and see if I would like to work with them. So I'd like to get this done ASAP. 

Has anyone successfully changed their name in Canada/Ontario and gotten through this mess and can give me a timeline on how they did it? Does it even matter if I change my name on some of these things? I just don't want to end up stuck with not enough documentation to change this, or time expired to change that, etc. Thanks!

**EDIT:** Well, looks like I might be SOL after all - I need to have bottom surgery in order to change my sex marker on my birth certificate (as I was born in the US in a state which requires this), which I have no intention of doing, so I don't think I'll be able to change everything over anyway. I'll probably just see where I can get with a name change."
SmurfsAreTasty,asktransgender,The pronouns are killing me. How do some of you deal with it?,"For those of you not completely out to the world, how do you deal with the pronouns? 

Is it as noticeable when someone does it to you, as it is to me? 

Can you just let it roll off your back, or do you let it simmer in you for a while?

Do you correct people?

When you correct people, what are their reactions?
_______

My rant:

I had a few problems with them before HRT. I didn't have too many problems with pronouns right before HRT though. But now....it hurts. I've noticeably changed and I feel as though some people are doing it to reassure themselves that ""Yes. That is indeed what I thought."" I can go an entire day without someone using the wrong pronoun towards me, but then I decide to go out and get something to eat and walking back into my apartment, someone says ""Hey guy! Buddy! Do you have a cigarette?!"".....Fuuuuuuck you. 

I'll admit. I'm very defensive. A past like mine will do that to a person. But I'm also hyper-intuitive. Meaning that the smallest thing of body language, inflections in voice, tone of voice, I pick up on more than I want to. Which is why I never really listened to how people said pronouns until recently. The ""HARD"" pronouns as I like to call them, seem like people emphasize the word just to have some reassurance of who they are talking to. It's beyond frustrating.

I work in customer service at a job that is just not worth it. I've come to the conclusion that in order for me to progress with transition, I have to cut this out of my life. Some customers are wonderful and use no pronouns at all. Others almost go out of their way.

I also understand there is a politeness aspect of it. I was always the same way. Sir or Ma'm to whomever I needed to. I was never taught to do it. I just grew up that way by watching people on TV and in movies do it. But as I began to discover myself, that habit quickly died. 

Pronouns will always irritate me when thrown out wrong.

RejectionLetter,asktransgender,What are changes like on a teenager?,"I'm a 16 year old MtF transgender girl, and have been on hormones for two weeks now. My skin has gotten so much softer (it was soft to begin with, though), and my nipples are already softening and they hurt whenever I touch them.

psylockebutfatntrans,asktransgender,"Nurse came back to high five me for being trans after doctors appointment, insanity ensues...","tl;dr: Nurse meets trans unicorn, uses hand motions to ask why it still has a horn and how it works. Unicorn doesn't know if nurse should be put down or reconditioned.

So I was meeting a new doctor, who happened to have a med student with her. She asked about my last pap smear and I explained why I haven't had one. No biggie. She listened and even helped set me up with an endo per my request. They exit to take care of some paper work. Smooth sailing so far.

A minute later I hear a knock and the student comes back in. She gives the high five motion and goes into an excited rant/spiel about not knowing. She was saying I was beautiful and she never would have been able to tell or anything. I can handle that no biggie. 

The problem arose when she introduced hand motions. She said she was surprised i,""Still have it. How does that work?"" She proceeded to grab her crotch and make a penis like motion and I'm floored.

My jaw drops, and I'm utterly horrified. She doesn't even stop to take a breath and is going on about how lucky I was. She said she knew of someone who was transitioning ftm and that they were,""going to get a penis"" complete with another crotch grab. She never really understood why he would want that. And so on and so on.

She was so damn happy the entire time and I was horrified and embarassed. I gave her the damn high five and left in a daze. 

I'm so confused now. On the one hand she is clearly excited to help trans individuals, and on the other she is completely ignorant and without tact. I didn't mention this to my doctor because I don't know what to do. Right now I'm thinking on my follow up next week I'll talk directly to the student and explain that it was not cool in the least. What would you do?

Also, when I was getting my labs, the guy was so confused about the M indicator on my paper work and had to ask. He wasn't rude so much as it was incredibly embarassing. Just was sort of a wreck of a day.

Bonus suggestion: What were your best and or worst experiences with doctors offices?"

lanadara-coco,asktransgender,Help. Breast growth issue.,"Any help or information will be greatly appreciated.

I began HRT two years ago, at 22 years old. Smoke cigarettes moderately. I am 6' tall and weigh around 135 lbs. So I am kind of underweight. But what kills me, more and more as time goes on is my complete lack of breasts. In the first six or eight months I had a very very slight increase in breast tissue. And I mean very slight. Hardly noticable, but when only compared to how it was before transition, where you could feel my breast plate by touching my skin... since then, for more and than a year now, there has not been ANY growth what so ever. I had switched to estradiol injections after a year and noticed that other things had progressed faster like skin softening.

Why this does not make sense to me, is that I've seen transgender girls who are as skinny as me, I have seen transgender girls who smoke, transgender women who are far older than me, and every one of them have grown A or B cups within one year. As for genetics, my mother and sister are well endowed in breast size.

It is killing me. Everyday I grow more and more hateful of this fact. My anxiety and depression skyrockets whenever I see my chest, or whenever I see breasts, or cleavage, especially on trans girls. I feel like this transition is an utter failure. I do not feel like a woman without breasts. I think about detransitioning all the time now, because I feel like a joke. To you this may seem insignificant, since you have had the privilege to be able to have breasts yourself, but you should understand that transition is not a materialistic endeavor... I just want to know why this is happening to me, so I can do something about it. My physician says it's because of my weight, but that's seriously a crock of shit. "

questionblahblah,asktransgender,"Incredibly scared of the possibility of being trans and cannot stop obsessing, would truly love and appreciate any insight","Hello, I am a straight female in her early 20s. I actually made another [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3um6by/terrified_that_im_trans_and_cant_stop_obsessing/?) a month or so ago, where I basically talk about having OCD since being a young age and my most recent OCD fear of being trans. But I'm still super scared, and I feel addicted to the reassurance that I *am* a girl. This fear started a few months ago when I saw something on TV about a trans woman, and then BOOM the thought, ""What if I am trans"" popped into my head, coupled with intense anxiety. Ever since then I've been crying and scared that I'm not female like I've always thought I was. What scares me the most are the intrusive images and thoughts I have been getting ever since this fear began a few months ago. I'm scared that because of these, I no longer have the right to call myself female. To make things worse, I feel like my OCD has gotten to the point where I can't even tell the difference between the two any more. 

Here are (once again) the reasons why I think it is just OCD:

* I always knew I wanted to be and happily saw my future as a bride, wife, mom, pregnant, etc., and never as a dad, husband, or anything like that. 
* In my fantasies I've always been a female and enjoyed playing up and emphasizing my femininity in them. 
* I've been misgendered as a teen before, and I remember being very offended, unhappy and annoyed, and cried home because of it. 
* I used to daydream about a character when I was younger. This character would go on all sorts of adventures, and do all sorts of things. A couple of years ago I realized that this character I always daydreamed about was merely a projection of who I wanted to be. This character is also a female.
* I had terrible acne a year ago, and read that testosterone is used sometimes to clear acne. As soon as I read that I was like, ""Nopenopenopenopenope!""
* I've always felt extremely lucky and proud to be female, despite all the things that are objectively bad about it. 
* I've also felt that if I had the choice to be reborn, I'd still choose to be a girl. In fact I'd choose to be a princess or a queen lol.
* 95% of the time I've played any game in my life, I'd choose a female character. 
* I tried experimenting with male behaviors and clothing since this fear began, and there was always a mental disconnect, as if I was putting up an act. Basically, it didn't feel natural to me.
* I remember reading about ""penis envy"" in a psychology textbook before this fear began and thinking, ""no....just. no,"" simply because I couldn't relate at all. 
* I feel like some of my facial features are somewhat masculine, and would honestly get surgery on those features to feminize them if I could afford it. 
* I also had an OCD fear of losing my female body parts to cancer a couple of years before (hypochondria over breast and ovarian cancer basically). 
* I also feel like I've always just fit in with womanhood more.
* Ever since this fear started, I've had nightmares about me as a male, and was always relieved to wake up and see that I was still a girl.
* I remember being genuinely surprised when I learned that guys like being guys. Manhood, while attractive (since I ID as straight), always looked so boring to me. I honestly always thought that men only tolerated it, and that everyone would be a woman if they could.
* I feel like ""at home"" when I think about being female in the future. I feel a disconnect when I try to picture myself as a guy, and I don't feel any pleasure from it. It also takes a lot of mental gymnastics and energy for me to even think of myself as a guy, whereas imagining myself as a girl is natural.
* I was super distressed during puberty when I started growing body hair and my mom bought me deodorant, because I thought I was turning into a man since I've only ever seen men use deodorant (I know, silly). I was super happy when I grew breasts and got my period though.
* The thought of getting male societal benefits while being female holds a lot of pleasure for me, and I find myself thinking about it a lot.
* I feel super proud and happy whenever someone compliments any physical or mental aspect of me as ""feminine"". Like if someone tells me that I move in a very graceful, feminine way, I feel super happy.
* The thought of having a male body or being seen as male has always had one of the following reactions from me: intense anxiety, apathy, or a feeling of, ""I'm glad I'm not a guy, whew"".
* I feel most like *me* when looking and feeling feminine (based on clothes showing my feminine figure, hair , makeup, being shaved etc.)
* I don't want a manly body. I don't want a manly jaw. I don't want muscular arms on myself. I don't want excessive facial or body hair on me. I don't want a penis. 
* I've seen female friends taking pride in being associated with male characteristics, but me not being able to relate. Like, my thought process was, ""I'm a girl, why would I want to be 'one of the guys?'""

Here is why I'm afraid it may *not* be OCD:

* I've always held the opinion that no one chooses to be gay/bi/lesbian/trans, so I've always actively tried to be open-minded about people from all walks of life. Therefore, whenever I see someone post something transphobic or homophobic online, I get offended. But it's like, if I'm not a target of someone's insult, why would I feel offended? Is it normal to be offended by seeing ignorance on *behalf* of someone?
* I've struggled with my physical appearance for as long as I can recall. What scares me the most is that I remember thinking I was getting fat when my thighs/hips were growing in during puberty. Those feelings of being fat went away when I learned that it is actually a normal part of female development (to which my subsequent reaction was, wow really? Yay I'm becoming more womanly!!) and when I actually bought clothes that fit me better (for the longest time I wore undergarments and pants that were too small so I always felt uncomfortable which made me feel fat), and now I'd take it as a huge compliment if someone said I was curvy. But now I'm *terrified* that thinking my thighs were too fat was a sign of being trans. What scares me even more is that I've seen posts by FtM individuals saying how they struggled their entire lives with feeling fat or not feminine enough, but now they realize that it was all due to gender dysphoria, and how ""feeling fat"" went away when they got binders, etc. Even now, sometimes I'll look at my body and feel like I look disproportional, like I look too much like a pear or something, and I'll wish I had more slender lithe thighs or something, and that my boobs are too small and saggy. Sometimes I feel like I look too ugly too be loved (but this is way less due to my feelings towards my body, and more due to not being flirted with or whatever when I go out), but I've seen FtM people say this too then realizing it was a part of their dysphoria. This is actually the aspect that causes me to go into a panic attack, even though I've seen cis women say the same. So what is the difference between general body concerns and dysphoria?
* Remember how I mentioned earlier in the post that I wanted to feminize my face more because I feel like some of my features look too guyish for my liking? Well, sometimes I'll see a beautiful woman who does in fact have some of those same ""guyish"" or androgynous features (and I see sooooo many men and women praise these same women for their beauty too), then I'll feel proud to look like the way I do, and I'll feel glad I have those same features too. But does accepting the way you look after seeing objectively gorgeous women with features some would describe as masculine mean you are trans?  

I'm at the point where I feel exhausted, and now I'm *terrified* that the only way these concerns/thoughts will ever go away is by transitioning, which I do not want to do. But what if I'm only trying to convince myself that I want to be female. So is this just OCD, or am I trans? How do you know for sure if you are? I feel so sad and stuck, so any advice or help would be appreciated. I truly hope nothing I said was offensive.

EDIT: Wasn't sure how to modify the title."

Tacocat9118,asktransgender,"My ex-girlfriend said she thinks she could be transgender ""later""... Any insight? Please read.","Hey all! So I'm a little nervous about posting this, and actually posted something similar over at r/actuallesbians, but here's the story (ugh sorry it's long!) 

My now-ex, 23F lesbian, and I, 24F, bisexual broke up a couple of weeks ago. We'll call my ex Sarah. We'd almost been dating a year, about 6 months of this long distance, but the long-distance wasn't particularly hard. We saw each other about every month, Skyped a lot, and were very much in love (or at least I thought?). I'm in my last year of undergrad, and she just started her first year of med school. I had been planning to move to a larger city closer to her med school, and we talked about our future together enough that I was pretty blindsided by the end. 

Out of the blue, Sarah called me and said that she thought we were too incompatible, that I was too negative with her, and that she wanted to break up. She told me that I was very negative to talk to, particularly about stress with school, and that I should be better about handling my anxiety. She said she didn't think this ""negativity"" would be something she wanted in a long-term partner. The reason I put negativity in quotes, is because yeah, I think I can be a bummer, sometimes, but I've recently started going to therapy to help this. AND I've also spoken to a couple of my best friends, and family, and they were pretty shocked that that was Sarah's reasoning. So it's not like this was ALL I ever talked about. 

On the similar negativity note, Sarah would always judge people we knew pretty quickly. Like oh our friend from work was dumb, or how could she possibly think she's funny because she's not. Or how her new med school ""friends"" were all anxious about studying, and not good enough to be in med school, etc. Just a lot of really mean things to say about other people, and of course I guess I should have seen she would eventually judge me as well. 

I guess the reason I am posting in this in the transgender subreddit is from our second more amicable breakup conversation, where some of these messages from her came up:
""i even wondered if maybe in a few years or 10 or 20 i would realize i was transgender... so yeah a lot of identity questioning""

""i've wondered if that's why my inclination is to lash out about others, like if i have anger about who i am as a person""

""i almost felt like the way we interacted didn't really feel like a lesbian relationship anymore, and i'm not sure if it was because our dynamic made me feel like i had to fill a certain role, or if it was actually something about me""

""and that i think it's more indicative of issues i have with myself than actual things about you"" 

And this was the cute, not so confusing / heartbreaking one: 
""it just made me think things like i wish i were bigger and stronger so i could pick you up (and you wouldn't be nervous about it lol), i like the idea of you being the pretty one and if i'm also a girl with long hair, make up, etc. that changes how people see us""

Another interesting thing she said was that she didn't feel like she knew herself, she'd never really been able to picture a long term relationship (with anyone), and wasn't sure if she was capable of being with someone long term.

I guess how much, if at all, did you feel judgement towards yourself or other people, coming from a place of internal phobia? Part of me feels like she is not okay with who she is (yet), and is projecting all of her negativity and judgement about herself onto me (and other people). Is this just a unique thing to her, or does any of that resonate on the path of coming to terms to being transgender? I would love any insight on this particularly. 

So I guess, at the end of all of this, I know the break-up was the right thing, for various other reasons. BUT I'm really internally struggling because I feel like I don't know how to go about getting over someone who maybe is questioning their identity, because it makes me question if what we had was real or not. 

Does any of this, at all, resonate with how any of you feel? And I'm not trying to be rude, at all, and PLEASE correct me if I've said something offensive. I'm simply trying to understand and mend my broken heart a bit, haha. Thank you for any input you could provide! "
kirito1342,asktransgender,I have a plan to tell parents,"So if you read my previous post I think my dad knows I'm trans I told my brother and I think he told my dad. So I locked myself in my room for a couple days. So now I am able to leave my room and my dad acts like nothing ever happened.

I want to tell my parents I'm trans so I can start hrt. So I'm planning on leaving a note. I was drawing pictures of marceline from adventure time lol I'm kinda a nerd but idc. Well there's a song that she sung called ""I'm just your problem"".

It's makes me think of what my parents will think on how I'm not perfect and I'm just their problem. It's scary how similar the song is talking on how ""I'm not even a person, am i?""

But I really thought lately and screw it I'm ripping of the bandage off. I'm thinking on having art I drew of a marceline with quotes around it saying how I'm not perfect or made from sugar from the song lol.

So I can put on it something saying I was trans. I leave it out in the open for my parents to see."

MichelaRiccarda,asktransgender,An odd thing.....,"So the other day when I was in full on office level girl mode, I was walking toward a restaurant.  Another lady, that was at least my mothers age, was walking to the same door.  We started to arrive at the front door at almost the same time.  I was a little closer so I move to get to the door first so I could get the door for her, as I otherwise always do.  She sped up and verbally insisted on her getting the door for ME!?!  There was second door just inside which I got for her, and inside at the front she again insisted that I be helped first.  I know that if I had been in guy mode she would not have given me such deference.  I think it was because I was dressed business nice(as opposed to casual) and perceived as a lady(as opposed to trans).  It felt a little weird, but nice too.

tatsmazzers,asktransgender,Not quite the usual autogynephilia question,"So I'm not sure how to phrase this question without revealing my sexuality which is approximately 70% fetish, 30% attraction to other human beings. I fear judgement and I don't want to scare away responses.



Basically before I came out to myself I had very few FEFs (female embodiment fantasies, Julia Serano speak for AGP). Like I would have them but it would always be in the context of my unrelated fetish so I never picked up on it as a possible tell. The rest of the time my fantasies were either more fetish or man has man sex with women he finds attractive (the latter of which always felt forced, fancy that).



Then I came out to myself and I could finally see the FEFs for what they were and I stopped doing the man sex fantasy thing cos not a man. And then I danced merrily into the sunset as a woman in tune with her sexual wants and desires.



EXCEPT here I am six months down the line with more doubts than ever and the only time I properly believe I’m trans is when I fantasise about having the sort of female body I want (most of the time, again unrelated fetish) or having straight sex with men I find attractive (which is new!). The rest of the time is patchy, when I’m around people who make me feel comfortable and validated I can lose the doubts for a while but the rest of the time I’m a man running away from their problems. I will continue to transition regardless, this is my whole life now and I was suicidal before I came out but the doubt is so so painful.



Also I think I’m bi because I’ve only ever felt physical attraction to women (this literally happens to me like once a month so small sample size) but I mostly get off on the idea of sex with guys. Idk why actual corporeal guys don’t do anything for me at the moment.



~~~~~



ANYWAY this turned into a rant which I guess means I needed to write it. My actual (**TL;DR**) question is, did anyone start getting more FEFs *after* they realised they were trans? And are they validating for other people like they are for me? All I seem to read are folk worried they mean it’s just a fetish a la Blanchard.



Edit: now I'm the arsehole who edits their post to complain about downvotes. I assume it's the crappy title. I'm sorry, I wrote it before I figured out exactly what I was asking. Which is maybe not how you're meant to do these things but I'm in a bad place and I need folk to talk to."
kaoruneve,asktransgender,"Still doubting, but maybe coming out helps? Advice on re-labeling yourself?","In short: it has been now about a year since I acknowledged more explicitly to myself that there was something I had to clarify about my gender identity, and I'm considering the idea that coming out as genderfluid could help. However I'm worried that the ""label"" I choose is going to change again the more I clarify myself, causing even more confusion and problems in practice. 
**Did anyone change their gender identification openly multiple time? Any story? Any advice?**

Some context:

I'm asking this question because while on one side I'm not sure that coming out would be ideal – rationalizing as: ""why should I if I haven't settled on one identity yet?"" – on the other side I find myself thinking about it rather often (once a day at least). So not having many people to have this chat with, I hope to get any opinion that isn't coming from inside my brain.

Clarifying myself is almost the top thought every day since about 1-2 years ago. I mean, I work and do stuff as usual, but I found myself that now all my free time gets into that. For example, my Facebook stream in the past months has been a rather constant stream of links and discussions on LGBT rights, feminism and trans* matters.

I'm relatively sure that the people I know would be accepting (to various degrees) since most of the people I know are open minded and liberal, even extremely so in some cases. I have in mind a few people that might not be okay, but they aren't close and I feel it wouldn't be a big problem if they walked away.

I'm almost certain that in my current job that wouldn't be an issue, since there's a big LGBT group, internal policies to support diversity, and even more recently one person came out as a trans woman with everyone cheering for her. Future jobs of course who knows... even if, I used to work in certain industries that are not very... known to be accepting.

I'm not 100% sure about my parents. I have the feeling that they will accept it even if they will have trouble in understanding what it means. I'm guessing my mother will try to get some books to understand if that happens.

I'm fearing this a bit because even if I'd come out, I wouldn't likely go around or post photos of myself in anything too feminine or show much of that side (or maybe I think that and I will change idea? Not sure). So people would be ""WTF? Nothing really changed!"". So yeah, I feel I could be perceived as *fake* there.

I'm also fearing that identifying as genderfluid would almost harm the term ""genderfluid"" given I don't think I show or I'll be expressing both sides in public. I won't be a ""typical"" genderfluid individual as many I read and follow around which post male or female selfies alternating depending on the day.

I'm also fearing, probably more than anything, that I could go ""back"" to be just cis-male after these years of exploration. Which would be perceived even worse by everyone I guess. And again a fraud in any group that uses that label. This seems to me as the worst possible scenario of all.

And since my brain likes guilt-tripping me, I feel even bad in asking this here since from what I read I'm almost in an ideal scenario for coming out, so I feel stupid. Plus I worry it might offend someone. *Yeah... when mother nature distributed guilt instead of a pinch of it I fell into the cauldron...*

Thanks in advance for any story or advice you might have. "

chaucer345,asktransgender,[NSFW] Any advice on how to decide if you want SRS or not?,"Hey all,

So I'm kind of in a weird spot right now. I'm super happy being a girl and with how hormone therapy has gone for me and all that good stuff, but I'm torn on whether I'll eventually want SRS. 

It's weird I mean, it makes me nervous, but I want it, but I'm worried and I don't like hate what's down there as much as a lot of ladies seem to do, but sometimes I feel super frustrated that I can't get penetrated... It goes on, bouncing back and forth. 

Normally this is the kind of thing that I'd talk out with a counselor, but I really can't afford one right now. 

It just feels like I managed to embrace so much and overcome so many doubts about being a girl, but this is being a roadblock for me. I know I don't need surgery to be a girl, but I kind of want it, but I also am super nervous because vaginas are treated so much less as ""things"" for lack of a better word in a lot of culture.

You know what I mean it's easy for people to imagine dicks doing stuff, but vaginas are seen as so passive and I know that's bogus, but I feel like it's seeped into my brain in a weird way.

Does any of this make sense?"

Amethyst_Julie,asktransgender,Is it potentially good to masturbate Pre-HRT every so often?,"I've never been big on masturbating, because obviously, I dont like having a penis. Thing is; not knowing when I'm going to have a wet dream sucks. I am only able to wash my panties every so often, because I have to wear them secretly. Now having a wet dream and ejaculating in them is gross and ruins them. This means I cant wear them over night without fearing a wet dream and taking them off. Masturbating sort of eliminates this issue. I dont like it, and I dont like the feel of it, but do you think that's acceptable? Just so I dont jizz in my panties?"
genderdyslexic,asktransgender,Analyze This,"    Ok, so I am just becoming aware that Trans is really a real thing.  I haven't come across anyone with the same narrative and it seems to be kind of like at a 180 degree angle from the more common trans narratives. but I have heard tell from a lot of people who seem to have a lot of experience that there are a lot of common themes in trans narratives, so I am wondering if anyone who has heard this type of narrative before and what you think of it.  Please be brutally honest and try to rip it to shreds if you can.

     So, I never remember any dysphoria as a child.  I was always a boy, always wanted to be a boy, liked being a boy, playing with guns and balls etc.  I started getting interested in girls when I was about 5 or 6 and I was fascinated by them and just stared a lot at them and really liked their pretty hair and dresses and wanted to just touch them and kind of investigate them.  I kind of vaguely remember getting yelled at or recieving some kind of disapproval for this at school but can't realy piece it together, but generally was left with the impression that I could look but not touch and boy and girls were supposed to be separate and that I was not supposed to be like a girl, girls were gross etc., but there was no way any of that was going to overcome he overpowering fascination I had with them.  

     So basically I would just get crushes on girls and never feel like I could do anything about it because they were off limits so I would just fantasize about the girl I had a crush on and it would last for a year or two and then I would develop a new crush but never have the nerve to say anything or interact with them because that was off limits and forbidden.

      But other than that in grammar school it was pretty much okay, I had my group of boys I was friends with a and we did boy things. but already by like age 7 or 8 there was something wrong because I started acting out trying to be the class clown in order to gain approval of my peers so even though I didn't really feel bad yet or really notice anything wrong something was wrong because I was having to seek approval for myself.  

     So by the time we become like 10 years, I notice the girls start getting sexually aggressive and this girl I have a crush on comes up to me with her friends and says they want to go sit by my two friends and it seems purposely implying not me, (and I'm thinking, you stupid bitch do you know how long I have had a crush on you) but I just say ok whatever, I don't care.  and even then it seems like my friends are treating me different and not accepting me and like walking away from me.

     Then the next year I get sent to a new school and no one will accept me for what I am.  no one likes me and avoids me like the plague.  no girls will talk to me, no boys want to accept me.  I am forced to just gang up with other people I don't like and consider losers just in order to protect myself.  So this gives me a lot of anxiety because no one is accepting me as who I am and the anxiety just keeps building and building.  

     And when I am about 12 or so I discover pornography and masturbation and obviously I really like it.  And I start fantasizing sexually and first it me as the man having sex with a woman and at first it was just the female nudity that got me off, and then I would get more and more frustrated that I couldn't get a real woman and that progressed into fantasy of me dominating and humiliating women and then the idea occurred to me that it would feel really good if I was the woman and was the one being dominated and humilated so I started fantasizing a lot about myslelf as a woman and that is still how I am today, proably about 70% imagining myself as the woman, 30% as the man.  

     And then that kind of led naturally to crossdressing because especially like panties, lingerie etc.  I also liked dresses makeup etc, but panties and lingerie a lot more.  and it  has alays just been a masturbatory fantasy.  Once I ejaculate I have no more desire to be a woman.  If I was wearing a dress in a non-sexually aroused state, I would not feel like a woman, I wold just feel like myself in a dress.

     And naturally I don't blame myself for anyof this, I get angry at the world for not treating me how I want to be treated.  The world doesn't treat me lke the dominant male that I feel like and want to be, they seem to be telling me, no you are not dominant you are submissive like a woman and we will not accept you unless you act like that.  So I am basically like fuck you world, you don't decide who I am.  I will go to war with you before I submit to that.  The thought really never occurs to me that there maybe there is some reason that everyone treats me like that or that I might be being dishonest, but that is how everyone was reacting to me.  I never had any dysphoric feelings whatsoever or even knew what that was.  (this was still the 1980's)

     So that pretty much goes on like that until I get out of high school when I am about 19, and I start using a lot of marijuana, alcohol, lsd. and this one day I have a nervous breakdown kind of experience. where this thought pops into my head that everyone knows about the crossdressing and seemingly out of the blue this part of my mind that I am no longer in control of just starts thinking ""I wear panties""  like I obsessively want to get this off my chest and tell every person I meet this information but then my rational mind is like, no way, that is none of their business that would be too embarrassing, no one can know about that.  So the only people I ever tell are my parents and my shrinks.  but I keep having this unbearable anxiety about this for years even until this day (I am 40 now).  My parents and the shrinks don't know what to do with me, one of them wants to lock me up, so I stop going to shrinks for many years.  So this anxiety is like a tangible thing, I feel like I am wearing panties even when I am not.  I almost want to call these feelings dysphoria, but from the common description of dysphoria that I hear from trans people this is almost like the negative image of dysphoria.  I am not disgusted with my body, I am disgusted with my mind and the way I think people are unjustly judging my body.  

     So I stop crossdressing because what had been just a fun pleasurable activity for me before had now just become a fucked up nightmare.  And I pretty much just became an alcoholic to relieve the anxiety for twenty years.  I did not feel comfortable in my own skin.  I went to class or work only when forced to and spent most of my waking hours drinking and playing video games.  I could not stand to be around men at all, I was so uncomfortable in my own skin and I was a little bit more comfortable around women but not much.  I had a couple girlfriends over the years but was mostly just alone.  

     When I was about 35, I eventually met a girl that wanted to have kids so we had to kids. So finally just before I turn 40 something almost magical starts to happen, I still don't even know what it was.  The anxiety starts going away a little by itself.  I never thought I would be able to stop drinking, but I just gradually stop drinking.  The best I can understand is that I learned to have compassion for myself through my kids somehow and that just started opening up new pathways etc.

     But so at this point I still have this resentment problem where I think the world doesn't treat me the way I want and I have by now developed this really crusty overly masculine personality where I just attack and berate anyone who doesn't treat me in the way I thnk I should be treated.  But I feel like I am really closed off creatively and I ust don't know what to do and things had been gong ok not great with my career but now they are not gong right at all.  but I'm feeling a lot better and less anxiety so I start reading a lot and I learn about Yin and Yang and the Tao and Carl Jung and different philosophies.  So now I kind of think like outward superficial personality that everyone sees on the surface is very masculine but that is really only 30% of me.  The introverted maybe unconscious aspect of my personality people perceive as feminine and that forms the larger 70% of my personality.  I never really perceived it as feminine myself.  I just felt that it was me, I never really bothered to label it as anything.  And so now my sexual fantasies have changed also  where I don't as much picture myself as woman (maybe 10% of the time) as much as I picture myself as myself a male crossdresser or transgender having sex with men maybe 60%, or myself as a CIS man having sex with a transgender or a crossdresser maybe 30% of the time. 

      So now I feel like I really want to express this ""feminine"" side more and that I have been suppressing it for a long time.  I don't really think I want to wear a dress in public, because 1.  I don't think I would be pretty and 2. I would just be me in a dress, like a Halloween costume.  I don't really feel like a woman.  It just seems really fetishy.  I think sometimes I would like to wear panties, but really once I ejaculate that thought goes away and they would probably just be less comfortable than boxers.  I do think they are pretty but just not on my body it just doesn't look right.  

     I feel like it would be exciting to have sex with a man while dressed as a woman and be dominated and humiliated by a man but When I try to relate with a man that way it just feels goofy and the energy feels wrong.  I cannot look at their face, their is no attraction or emotional connection like with a woman.  I think I could probably do it a glory hole or something where it was totally anonymous and I wouldn't have to see their face.  So can anyone make any sense out of this or have heard or experienced anything similar, lol

let’s say your brain is put in a robot body that isn’t explicitly gendered female.

I've never done anything like crossdressing before except once briefly but I took it off after like a minute because it didn't feel right, in part because of how hairy I was.

Now it's something I'm thinking more and more about. I like the idea of dressing as a woman, having breasts etc(though not a vagina)) and of being a woman. What should I do? What kind of questions should I ask myself?

I have a partner and I'm 95% they would be supportive and be happy to stay with me. But this is something I feel I can't discuss with them right now. It's the only thing I feel I cn't talk to them about, in part because I'm afraid of how they might react, plus maybe this is just be being, I don't know - fetishy? It's not just about sex, though.

I don't look in the mirror and think 'ugh I hate this body', it's more I look in it and think 'I could never look like a woman'.

I’ve known her for quite some time online, and I know that she doesn’t get out of the house much. I recently learned that she is MtF, and that didn't really do much to change my opinion of her - I've always been pro LGBTQ+ rights, I did everything I could to assure her this would not affect our friendship, etcetera. However, she told me she experiences severe dysphoria, such that she can’t leave the house, and she can’t get a job or go to school as a result. Her family cannot afford HRT at this point in time, she had to stop it shortly after she started, so she feels stuck, and I’m worried about her.

I want her to feel some sense of progress in her life, but I’m not sure how to encourage that, especially since, while we’ve been close for years, it’s not like I see her on a daily basis. We live on opposite sides of the country, and I’m not exactly rolling in money myself. I was looking at ways she could change her financial situation so she could resume HRT, but that’s tricky given the dysphoria she feels outside the house - I looked at some internet jobs, but that’s a whole mess of confusion.

I was just wondering if anyone has dealt with a similar situation, either in their life or a friends, and how they approached it. I want to do everything I possibly can to protect and help my friend, but I feel like there’s nothing I can do - is there anyplace I can direct her to to help her out, or some advice I should be giving her, or something? Anything y’all can say would be sincerely appreciated."

overgirl,asktransgender,Should i stop taking hormones?,"Background: i`m 20, MtF and i have been on hormones for 3 and a half months. i stared a week before i turned 20. i still live with my parents and have money saved up for emergency use(getting kicked out). 

Problem: i dont have any friends that are helping me through this and my family life sucks. i could go into details but that's not what this is really about. Truth is that while hormones have made me happier they have also given me massive doubt. I don't feel like there's going to be a happy ending and everyone seems to be reinforcing this. I cant see myself past as anything but a freak and my parents never shut up about the horrible nightmare my life is going to become. My emotions are everywhere right now and i have been feeling very unstable. There seems to be a correlation between the amount of hope i have for transition and my depression levels. for example when i have a positive outlook on and i think that one day i will pass i get really happy. My therapist says my eyes light up. Problem is i`m a pessimist who usually has a bleak outlook on life.

Question: should i stop taking hormones in an attempt to clear my head. I feel really confused currently and with the massive push back from everyone in my life i feel like taking a break might be a good idea. i cant put enough emphasis on the fact that i am really really confused and scared.

Risk of stopping: my chances of suicide do however go up if i stop taking hormones. This is because i made a promise to myself when i put a gun to my head that i would try to transition before i pulled the trigger. So if i stop i might loose all hope and end up determining that i failed and suicide is the only option. 

Risk of not stopping: however there is also a risk if i decide not to stop hormones. My confusion and doubt may grow to suicidal levels that might put me over the edge. There would also be the fear that i made the wrong decision and never gave being a man a fair chance.

What do i do?

confused_amytg,asktransgender,Can a MtF be a chaser? NSFW,"Background - 31 MtF on hormones for 14 months. Horrible disphoria and depression my entire life.  Never had a relationship before.

A friend joked and said I was a chaser... I'm scared he's right.

Sexually I like penis, but I find males repulsive.

But I can't help but wonder if I'm attracted for the wrong reasons... And that feeling sickens me, I don't want to fetishize another trans person.

Randamirin,asktransgender,Breasts and spiro?,"I don't know much about the chemical interactions and reactions involved in HRT.

I am currently only on spiro 100mg, starting hrt this Thursday.

But the other day I did let myself think about it, and I thought about how I probably wouldn't mind being a man or woman either way. I thought about how much of a toll this transition has taken on me and how much more damage it might do if I keep it going. I thought about how much easier life would probably be if I just didn't do it. I also thought about how much I've learned about myself, others and gender.  I've come to the conclusion that I'm genderqueer, not trans.

So after 14 months of HRT I'm thinking it's time to stop that and resume my life kinda inbetween genders, albeit in a male body; sorta like a less extreme Noel Fielding.

I ask for any advice anyone might have for this. How do I tell my friends ""yeah btw I'm actually not trans anymore so d/w about it?"" (Especially my support friend who has been helping me with this from the start!?). What changes from HRT will be reversed? I like some things, like how it made my hips a little bit wider, it's a nice feminizing touch.

Henchman24RIP,asktransgender,"If you hadn't had any contact with an ex since long before your transition, would you contact them again?","Through Facebooks ""memories"" feature, I somehow discovered that an ex of mine unblocked me on Facebook at some point. We certainly had a complicated relationship, but we had been in the process of getting back together when her Dad throw a wrench in the process. 

She lives all the way across the country, so it's not like I'm looking to rekindle things (though I have to say she's gotten even more ridiculously hot in the 6 years since we've been apart). 

I just think it might be interesting to know her reaction, and to blow her mind a little. 

Difficulty: She was raised a Jehova's Witness, and that's what led to our separation. She wasn't homophobic at all, but trans people obviously never came up.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? What did you do?"
cuddlebunnychewtoy,asktransgender,"Preventing erections via chemical means. Already on high spiro - supplemental antiandrogens or topical anesthetics, maybe? Has anyone tried it?","Hi there. This post is kind of long, so here's a tl;dr: I'm already on a high spiro dose, but I want to do anything safe I can find to prevent erections 100% forever, or at least make them more difficult. I would love to hear from people with non-spiro chemical experience about how their erectile function has changed, especially if spiro didn't affect it much.

A bit of background: I'm 23, XY, non-binary, been on feminizing hormones for about 1.5 years at this point. I don't get spontaneous erections at all any more, but I don't find it any harder to become erect during sexual activity or sexual thoughts. I really, really want that to change. I'm already on 200mg/day spiro, which is the maximum my provider will prescribe. I'm an extremely sexual person, but I'm fundamentally submissive and only interested in receiving; I see my penis and its arousal as a very frustrating, unpleasant, and dysphoric distraction to my sexual pleasure and identity.

So, I'm sort of desperate to figure out how to make erections completely impossible (or at least as close to it as I can), especially during sex. I am a huge fan of chastity cages, but they freak out / turn off a lot of people who are otherwise completely fine with me being trans. Also, I don't really want to wear one all the time, so I'm trying to find any other avenue that might be open to me.

I just found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/2ssbpm/how_to_stop_erections/cnsu9dn) describing some of the chemicals used in chemical castration, which sounds great (""you will totally lose your erectile function""), but I'm wary of trusting a single post I found online, one written unclearly and in not-so-great English. Has anyone tried these chemicals? Do they have a more pronounced erection-preventing effect than spiro alone? I really want to hear more about this method, but I don't want to just buy lots of illegal chemicals online without hearing more than one opinion.

There's also a post on [this thread](https://www.susans.org/forums/index.php?topic=82953.0):
&gt;I once gave the advice to my then MTF girlfriend to put some local oral anaesthetica on her d*ck before sex, one of those you can get at the pharmacy without a prescription if your teeth hurt or you have an infection in your mouth. She was amazed as after about 10 minutes, she could not feel anything there for about an hour and as far as I remember, she also told me no erections whatsoever so sex was kind of relaxing for her that time (I just went down to her breasts and kept away from the risky parts until she came). Of course, don't use that stuff too often, read the instructions first, don't use too much of it and first try it somewhere else as some people are allergic to it. Oh, and if you put a condom on first, the numbing effect stays longer.
Has anyone tried that? What product, exactly, do you think this person might be talking about? Something like [this](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/anbesol-oral-anesthetic-gel/ID=prod1464109-product)? Seems like it might be worth a try, 

Any feedback at all about your experience with chemicals/erectile dysfunction would be *so* appreciated. This is causing me so much stress recently. The dysphoria of erections was one of things that most helped me realized I'm trans, and I was so hopeful when I heard that spiro could inhibit penile arousal. But my brain just seems to be wired in such a way that it doesn't do much, or maybe I just got my hopes up too high. Thanks for reading."

Older_Wiser2,asktransgender,MtF: When was your first time? A good day / bad day,"When was the first time you looked in the mirror and saw yourself in a different way? Today I got cleaned up and looked in the mirror. And I saw, for the first time, a woman. Although I don't present female the reflection was me as a woman - my features have started changing and, more importantly for me, my psyche has changed. My goal has been to feminize my inner being - and today I've accomplished that goal!!! Woohoo!!! 

But, I guess I need to take the good with some bad -- I'm on vacation in the Bahamas and went to the beach. At this point it's not really appropriate for me to take my shirt off (boobs are too big) but I really wanted to enjoy the sun and beach. So ---- I found an isolated spot, took my top off, and started enjoying the sun. Then - an older couple decided to plant their beach chairs very close to me. I could hear them talking a bit and then heard ""I told you he was a man"" --- So I sat up, looked over, and there she was with her cellphone taking a video of me. As those who may have read my other posts - I'm not shy about confronting people and this was no exception. My choices were to put my shirt back on and ignore them, leave, or -- confront them -- and I did -- I left my shirt off and walked right up to the lady and said now that I'm closer maybe she could get a better picture. Her husband chuckled a bit and I then walked off.... Ah well ........ I'll just go with the good day I had earlier ... ~Joelle "
quitetentatively,asktransgender,Did your desire to get face surgery increase or decrease after a year or two on hormones?,"I've been on MTF HRT for just under four months now, and I think about FFS every day. I'm turning 25 this week. The things that I most want to change about my face are things that are not really going to change very much on HRT: the height and squareness of my jaw, my nose, and perhaps my brow ridge.

My traditional attitude to a big decision like this would be to do the responsible thing, wait 18-24 months for the hormones to work, and then consider FFS, but part of me is sorely tempted to just go through with it at the 6 or 8 month mark, simply because I want it so badly (and because that sort of overcautious tendency to put things off is kinda what landed me in this position in the first place). However, I worry that it could end up being a waste of money to do so, that I might feel differently about it in a couple years if I just leave it alone.

So, I'm interested in hearing the experiences of trans women and men who wanted face surgery quite intensely when they were in the first few months of hormone therapy. If this is you, did you find yourself becoming more desperate to get it done as time went on, or did it seem less urgent and easier to deal with? Did you end up eventually getting it done, or did you decide you didn't need it after all? If you eventually did end up going through with it, do you wish you'd done it earlier?"

After its done, how did dysphoria disappear? Did it just happen to disappear suddenly or was it a process?

Are you happy now? 

How did the whole thing go? 

Did your voice change? Or did you have to practice a bit?

And a question to MtF individuals here, now honestly I can't imagine myself at one point go and lay in a surgery bed, and wake up without my balls or my penis. So... How did that feel? And how does a vagina compare to a penis when you masturbate or when you have sex in your experience? (assuming you had sex both when you were men and after you became women) 

Similarly, FtM individuals here, how did it feel waking up with a penis and a pair of testicles? And similar to the question above, how does a penis compare to a vagina when you masturbate or have sex? (assuming you did both) in your experience

Ignorant_hominid,asktransgender,How does somebody feel like a boy or girl?,"The obligatory I don't mean to offend but I am ignorant of - well everything and unless I ask I will never learn.
To begin, let me share about me.  I am a male.  This I know because I have a penis (simple but I am trying to let you know where I am starting from).  I am heterosexual because I am aroused by the female form.  I love and support all my fellow beings and truly believe that you just need to be you.
I am truly curious about all the ""not me's"" out there.  I know me - I understand me.  I am boring - to me.  My question revolves around this: I am failing to grasp the concept of gender identity.  Intellectually, I know the words.  A transgender person does not feel like the boy or girl others think they are (a little oversimplifying I know but i think the point is there).  The failure is that I don't think I have ever had a gender based thought.  I've seen the posts that say ""Imagine you woke up with a woman's body . . ."" and that does nothing to further the explanation for me. To me that means I am still me (for better or worse), but I have different genitals to maneuver life with.  So i deal with menstruation and menopause instead of awkward erections and blue balls.  I still have to work, pay bills, mow the grass and take care of my daily life.

So I have read through this and edited/discarded/rewrote way to much and obviously I am struggling with forming my confusion into some coherence.  And it is my confusion.  I am trying to understand something I cannot experience and having to rely on others to describe what I cannot understand.  
So, I guess when it comes down to it, what I really want to know (and am having trouble finding out) is how does a person feel like a boy or feel like a girl?  I think if I can understand this I can grasp gender dysphoria - or at least begin on the path.  if you answer, thank you for trying to remove a little ignorance in this world.  If you need to hate on me for asking what is (I am sure to a lot of people) a basic question, cool.  I still love you.  

Edit 1: Thanks for the replies.  It seems my real issue isn't understanding the dysphoria issue.  That I grasp.  It is the gender expectations - It seems as if people expect to be treated different based on whether they are boy or girl.  So someone who is a girl wants to be thought of and treated like a girl.  A person who is a boy wants to be thought and treated like a boy.  

Edit 2: Again, thanks for the patience and explanations. My lack of understanding is from my lack of social clues.  I am that guy that never picked up the social aspect and it turns out this is why I didn't understand that particular part.  For the record I'm more Asocial than antisocial.  Just don't get it and don't see the need for it (for me - I know there are opposite people out there that live and die by their social interactions).  Again, thank every one for their help and honesty."

I saw something regarding this awhile ago and asked my straight cis guy friend what his thoughts were on it. And he said he didnt think he'd be able to be sexually attracted to a trans woman if she hadnt undergone genital surgery, but that he wouldnt judge her just that its not what hes attracted to.

SwellAsDanielle,asktransgender,How long did you stay in therapy?,"I just had a very odd session with my therapist.  He moved several states away and we've been doing phone sessions for well over a year.  It always seems like we manage to have a lot to talk about even when things are uneventful, but today it was just super short as I had nothing I felt I needed advice on.  It just made me wonder how much and how longer I need to see or talk to a therapist for, if things are going smoothly for me.  In the past I've felt that sometimes Ive been exaggerating my stress in order to talk about but tonight I just had nothing.  Transition is a crazy part of life and especially since I'm less than two months into medical transition I feel that it should be good to have someone listen to me, but I sort of feel like I'm wasting money.

Obviously one of the first steps would be coming out to my parents but of course that can't be easy. To start there is my general relationship with them, it isn't bad but kind of distant I guess. I try to keep most things about myself a secret and always use a facade. Then there is also that I am the youngest and most ""normal"" child (my two older siblings have mental issues) so they never spoke to me about a lot of things such as sex. Also, they are not accepting people at all. They believe people who are depressed and/or those that go to therapy are crazy, people who talk about emotions are crazy, stuff like that. However I don't know how they feel about trans folk, I know they hate Caitlyn Jenner but that might just be because they find her to be a shitty person. 


The issue is I am fairly sure that I am depressed, have some kind of anxiety disorder, and need multiple types of therapy. So yeah, I don't really know what I should do."
asktgthroughaway,asktransgender,I just don't know if I can do this anymore (Tw: suicide and verbal abuse) (NSFW) (rant~ish),"(posting this on a through away do to a couple of reasons but I will probably respond for a little) 

Where to begin, well I am 17 and I am trans* (mtf), I have always known even if I didn't know the word, I knew.   Always had trouble making friends and even worse at keeping them. About 6 months ago I came out to my mom and it didn't go well^TM, she basically totally didn't understand nor want to. She told me she will always love me but I how she doesn't believe me (like it is more complicated than that but that's the short of it) and she if totally convinced I just need to ""find someone to make me complete"" and ""You just need to grow up"", these comments made me even more sad and upset like no matter what I do I will always trapped in this body and nobody will ever see me in a different light and how I will always be lying to everyone to see because I WILL NEVER BE HAPPY and how I will just be showing them this facade. 

I will always be trapped by the feeling of wrongness, of walking around with this body I hate and this stupid thing between my legs that every single day I think more and more about getting rid of myself. Everyday I worry about how hard all of this will be for me, it has always been me against the world and this may just one of the challenges I cant face by myself. I am not scared of not passing, I am scared of the journey, I am scared of my mom, I am scared of loosing the only few ""friends"" I have ever had (and no I don't think they will except me 2 of them were telling me about the gender fluid ""tranny"" in their class and how they don't agree (not out to them)). I am scared of the world how the way people see trans* people, I am scared that it wont help and I will just as miserable as before. 

Everyday I go to a school where I have to change in the boys locker were the call me all kinds of ""lovely"" gay slurs (I have never told anyone I was gay, trans* or anything) just because I walk the way I walk and dress the way I want. When I was picked on when I was little, I pushed it aside telling myself ""they only have power if I give it to them"" but I just don't know anymore... I play games by myself most of the time, and some random thing will remind me of all of times I have been picked on and how I just cant anymore. I have told my mom all of this and she has told me to ""man up"" (even after coming out) and how she tells me tough shit. Yells at me for acting ""girly"" and tells me that she has way more to be depressed about.

I wake up every morning HOPING the day will be different but no everyday something reminds that I am 6 foot with big feet and A FUCKING DICK or someone will tell me that I am x gay slur and how I am awful in this way. I have no one to talk to and the people I have I feel guilty (including Reddit again sorry if i am wasting your time). I have been talking to a therapist but my mom makes that awful every time by crying and making me feel guilty or yelling at me and telling me that you should have never told me or how it is her fault. The therapist is one of the only people I have ever met who have been nice to me with out questions (I guess that is his job but it feels different (also yes he is a gender therapist)), he is only one to call me by my preferred name and pronouns. That is one of the only things I cling to every week.

I am tired. I am super under weight BY A LOT because I have 0 interest in eating. I don't get any sleep with maybe 3 hours if I am lucky. I have basically no friends. I have Reddit and my cat. I just don't know anymore I thought I could do this I thought ""you'll be fine, you will transition everything will be a ok"" but its not because no matter how much I want to be happy and comfortable it will always be at a price to someone else, someone else will always be there telling me I wrong I am a freak I am just crazy. 

I could kill myself, but to what end, I will have caused as much sadness as I do now I will be wasting some other space. Or I could move on with this thing between my legs and these toxic people around and cling to little things all while trying to appease other people. I just don't know..

I have always tried to apply myself and figure things out, but I just cant I NEED HELP. Sometimes being by myself 99% of the time isn't always a good thing sometimes I wish I could text a friend and say ""hey I am feeling sad can we talk"". No I have people who tell me I am wrong or I am awful. 

I don't actually think I will kill myself but I probably reach some other self destructive point (drugs or something). 
I guess my question rests on HOW? How do I do this so many things feel like there is no hope, I take hormones then what have people judge for buying things I want to buy living the way I WAS MEANT TO. I am crying as I wright this feeling so empty, feeling like I drowning in the sea of my own creation. 

If anyone has had something similar happen/happening and has any advice it would be helpful. 

TL DR: Rude AF ""loved ones"" coupled with extreme dysphoria and genital dysphoria making my life seem like it needs to end. Got any advice?

sleepingredwood,asktransgender,Estrogen only Hrt?,"
I got my first endo appointment today at the San Diego family health center. It went well enough and stuff, but I have a few concerns about the hormone regimen.

Appears they aren't actually going to be testing my t levels, and that they normally only prescribe spironolactone for people with excessive body hair and or male pattern baldness(neither of which I really have) So basically I might be going estrogen only.

I mean I'm pretty freaked out by some of spiro's side effects, but that still doesn't seem to seem to sit right with me. For several reasons.

1.I recently turned eighteen so while most of puberty's already happened I'm afraid more of it might happen If I still have T in my system.

2. I'm paranoid about it slowing down the speed of my transition.


Has anyone here been on an estrogen only Hrt regimen? Did you still see results within a reasonable timeframe? 

The doctor reassured me I'd be able to request spironolactone if I really wanted it, but I figure these are questions still worth asking anyways."

tweekytrap,asktransgender,"4yrs Full Time, MtF, Considering detransiton, but I don't want to look ""male."" Should I go for it?","So, a little strung out right now, so excuse the weirdness of my formatting.

I'm 23 and been full time for 4 years.  I've gotten an orchi, to mitigate the health problems associated with long term HRT, I pass flawlessly (without makeup), get laid at my leisure (and get paid to do it too), and have a wonderfully supportive partner. 

This all started after my orchi, like 8 months ago.  I started to realize an intense shift in my psyche - I wasn't really dysphoric anymore...  I never really liked testicles, visually, and hated ejaculation (which I think is specifically from sex abuse as a child).  When I'd have sex with men, I was getting more dominant, I started to like receiving oral sex - I even topped a few times (for fun, not work).

I don't really want to be seen as female.  I don't like the whole concept, I think it's disingenuous.  I was raised male, but never associated with their archetypes.  It might sound TERFy, but I never was, and never will be, a woman.  Visually though, it'd be impossible to see me as male at this point.  I would have to make a conscious and medical effort to transition back.

I totally dig some dudes, but their aesthetic isn't for me.  Like, I'm a punk girl, but couldn't do emo or goth.  it's kind of hot, but it's not my style, get me?  

I would never feel comfortable with having a beard or being muscly, but I can't seem to shake the idea that I don't feel comfortable being perceived a totally femme.  My interests physically seem to align with feminine physiology and style, but simultaneously, I feel like I'm definitely masculine in a way I'm not expressing being wholly femme.  

Though, I do like being tall (I'm 5'6"" and may like a couple extra) and physically fit (totally love being strong [in a svelte way]).  I like having androgynous breasts, like no implants, 36B on my frame is ideal, they're a touch too big at 36C.  I don't really care about having tits or not, it's not specifically arousing or of preference.  I rarely wear  makeup or bra as-is.

So, she's feeling all awful, and her head is a mess. And so now, she has this nagging question. She thinks she doesn't deserve to be a woman. She's not feminine enough. Or she simply isn't good enough for it. And that just makes her feel guilty, making her feel even worse... Spiralling...

oscoxa,asktransgender,[mtf] Should I correct people if I'm not ready for Boymode fail?,"Just wondering what asktg thinks I should do when acquaintances gender me female even when I'm presenting fully male.  For the record, I've been on hormones +2 years and have shoulder length hair but wear men's clothes and use my 100% male voice (my female voice is horrible).  I'm only out as trans within my trans circle of friends.  Usually this isn't much of a problem except for the fact that I'm meeting a lot of people for the first time through new hobbies.

I feel like I would be lying if I were to tell people who gender me female that I'm 'actually a guy', but I also feel very bad in not saying anything and furthering their confusion as I clearly present male.  I feel like I confuse them even more as they may be waiting for me to correct them.  Some have gotten so far as to not gender me at all.

I would like to know other's opinions on this, especially if you've been in this situation before."
SolidSpruceTop,asktransgender,My only good friend said she has to distance herself from me if I transition,"So earlier I was in a call with my best friend, who I'll just call ""M."" I was kind of hoping she'd bring up the topic of me being transgender, and she did, since earlier I was so excited to have my eyebrows done. She's a Jehova's Witness in Puerto Rico, so being one is a big deal and rather strict. Well, many view transgenderism as bad, not surprising. M said that she has been asked if she knew transgender people, and she can't lie. She says it'd be really bad religeously to be besties with a trans, I understand where she's coming from, as I live in a very strict household, and i understand she's been that religous since forever, but it still hurts me so much. It hurt her too. She was sobbing on the phone repeating how sorry she is, because this can put a wedge between us. I'm so broken over this. I don't know who's fault it is. Maybe it's fine for knowing how attached she is and knowing that being selfish like this will hurt her. But it's her fault for not wanting to sacrifice looking perfect or having to lie once. i told her she can always refer to me as I am now, Collin, but she says that she can see who I am and she can't lie to herself. I don't know what to do. I'm just going to hurt more people by being like this, but I dont want to hurt myself! Right now I'm just hating myself more for being so selfish and hurting her when I know it is..."

echoicx,asktransgender,Questioning my sexuality and gender,"Throwaway just to get some feelings out and I'm on mobile so please excuse my editing.

I'm a 20yo male and I've been questioning my gender for a long time now. I feel like a fairly girly person but only sometimes. Other times I can't tell if it's actually me if I was raised to behave as man. I even have trouble talking to other guys online because it makes me a bit anxious. I constantly wish I was a girl but is it because of the convenience of being a woman at that time or is it because I really am supposed to be a woman.

Then there's my sexuality. I know one thing for certain and its that I love girls. But the kind of stuff in into largely relate to me wanting to be a girl. Mostly I fantasize about being a girl doing really sexual things with mostly other guys. But as of right now I don't feel like I'm attracted to men, only if I was a man.

I've been struggling with this for many years now and I guess it's time I need to talk about it to anyone."

KrisEtKris,asktransgender,I broke someone's heart today.,"Today, as of February 3rd, I no longer am in a relationship. We just broke up and I am in such a mess. And I also feel like an asshole for making this decision when I shouldn't be.

We met in the cafe and we fell in love on the day we first met. I wanted to be honest with her so I came out as trans and she definitely deserved to know that because I am on hormones. She was accepting and polite and we soon became couples. However, she had someone that she never told me about until later the day, that she already has someone. Although, she never met this person in real life, she likes him just as much as she liked me. I stayed calm and told her we would figure this out later but I just felt very wrong although we continued to be together for like a month.

Few weeks later, I took my medicine right in front of her for some reason and she grieved and told me ""I wish you just stay as it is."" This happened several times and it saddened me a lot. I thought of detransitioning just for her but I realized that would be wrong of me to do so. 

This continued for several days until I realized this just isn't working. She needs a man. And I am becoming a woman which would be against of what she's used to, whom she really likes. 

So I made what seems to be one of the hardest decision of my life; breaking up with her. I wrote a heartfelt and a long letter and sent her this.

*""(her name), I came to a realization that this isn't working. No I don't have anyone else and I really am not planning to. The reason why I think this is because I don't think I am ready for this yet. I am going through a life changing experience. I need some time to be myself, learn to adjust myself with all the changes that I am going through. It's never about you. It's about me. If we were to continue, it's eventually not going to end well. You will eventually have to break someone's heart and it'd be too excruciating for me to handle. And I am also extremely afraid of how you will react when you see me as a changed person and have to go through a huge amount of pain on deciding whether to stay with me or not and I honestly don't think I can manage to see you being hurt in the future because of that. You've been one of the best person in my life. Nothing can ever change that. You haven't bothered me, annoyed me or made me angry. It's all about me and it's all my fault. And I apologize from the bottom of my heart.*

*I'd love to be your friend but I am not very sure you will want that. You can hate me and curse me and just forget everything about me now it's your decision to make. But I won't because I respect you and honor you. And if you want me to, I can just leave out of your life. You won't ever see me again. But I will be the same me, with boring, quiet and dorky personality with little to no friends, just magnificent changes on my outlook.*

*Thank you for everything. I won't ever forget every moment we spent as one. You deserve better person for sure. You deserve someone who you really like.""*

This immediately led us to a big heartbreak and I've been crying ever since. What made me sadder is that she was so nice about this whole thing. And I am slowly started to think that maybe I made a mistake.

I just feel like a jerk for doing this. This relationship could have lasted longer but I quit it because I thought it would be best for both of us. 

But then again, I am not sure.. Did I do the right thing?  Was I being a jerk?"
TheRealFlop,asktransgender,"I'm going to be homeless on the 15th, I haven't eaten in two days, and my new (state provided) insurance is refusing to pay for my estrogen. I feel like I'm sinking.","I tried to kill myself a few weeks ago. I won't get into details, but the low tensile strength of the rope means I'm alive to write this right now. I feel lost, hopeless, and I'm having a hell of a hard time finding reasons not to try again.

I've set snares in the hopes of catching a squirrel or rabbit, and I'm walking in the woods near my house nearly every day looking for edible mushrooms, but we haven't had any rain recently, so that's not doing much. The last thing I ate was hummus spread on a tortilla at my friend's parents' house on Sunday night. i'm so, so very hungry, and I don't see any options. On top of that, I'll be taking the last dose of estrogen that I possess tomorrow morning, and I can only hope that my insurance will change their minds after they get my appeal. I don't know what to do, and I feel hopeless, beaten down, and utterly broken. 

Edit: So, bunch of things have happened. I found $2 on the ground in a parking lot and bought beans and rice, which is pretty much the most delicious thing I've ever put in my mouth. Also, /u/structured_spirits was very kind in sending me some money for food. My pharmacist went to bat for me in regards to my insurance, and she was able to essentially browbeat them into accepting that they had to pay for it under California state law, so I now have estrogen. A very good friend offered to let me stay with him at his house, which is about 150 miles away, but if I collect enough cans I might be able to scrounge the gas money to get there. Thank you all so much for being so kind. I was coming on here to vent, maybe get some advice, but you people have been so wonderful. I love you all so much.

Edit 2: A few people have asked for a paypal. It's Victorialovesyou630@gmail.com. I'd like to stress that I am not trying to get people to send me money, and I am most likely not going to starve to death. If you feel a pressing need to send me money, both I and my tummy thank you, but it might not be a matter of life and death right now."
BruceKing101,asktransgender,Do i have gender identity issues?,"In my head for about the past 2 years i have wanted to be female.

throwuhway78,asktransgender,Do these dreams mean I'm not really trans?,"[content warning for a little graphic violence?]

I know the title sounds silly, but bear with me. For the last 4 months or so I haven't thought of myself as a man. Not really sure of my exact label yet, but something like non-binary or transfeminine or trans woman. Anyway, over the last couple of days, I've been dealing with pretty serious doubt. I always am dealing with doubt, but it's been especially bad. 

Well, two nights ago, I had a dream that I woke up one day and all the muscle on my arms was gone-- just skin and bone. I've been losing some muscle since I stopped lifting weights, and I sometimes question if that's what I really want. The other dream was last night. I had a dream that I had cut off the head of my penis and that I kept it in a bag. But then I started to regret it and became a little terrified that the head of my penis was detached.

What could these dreams mean? I've been planning to stay fit as I transition, and I've never seriously considered SRS, so what's the deal? Is it just nerves, or do y'all think maybe I'm not trans and am tricking myself into thinking I am?"

I've been ok with being a man, but I think I might be happier living as a woman. It's difficult to admit because for such a long time I've felt like a freak. More recently my thoughts go to transitioning but I also like the male life I have now. I feel torn, it's almost like there are two people inside me.

dra6000,asktransgender,A Bit (Very) Confused,"So... a friend of mine recommended I see this place after it helped her, so here I am.

I guess it started years ago when i would start to selecting female avatars and story routes in choose your own adventure stories. I've also been very curious as to what being female would feel like, but thing is, every time I had imagined being female... no imagined isn't even the right word. I fantasized about it, thinking I might enjoy it.

Ok, so moving forward to a year ago, I did some hypnosis that would make me female. 
*sidenote*
Just before I go on, I'd like to give some basics on hypnosis. Hypnosis can only affect you if you're completely willing to be affected by it and cannot force you to do something you don't want to do.
*sidenote*
It was a... different experience. I didn't know what to think of it at first. Afterwards the effects wore off I began to question my gender (and sexual orientation). It swung back and forth between gender fluid and female for the better part of a year before I ruled out gender fluid. The final question I had to ask myself and I still can't really answer was this: what's the difference between a feminine male and a masculine female? Should I just be a feminine male irl and not be female? I THINk I'm female, though maybe I should avoid all the trouble and roll along with the gender I was born with.

I came out to my parents (still in school btw) a while back during some drama where my mom asked me the person I wanted to be. Truth be told, I'm not happy with myself in general. I don't really LIKE the person I am. I'm ok with it I guess. I'd like to be more emotional at times and actually have feelings towards things as well as liking clothing styles, which I feel like myself as a male can really comfortably do.

Finally, my parents. Their responses were ""I don't want to care"" and ""You're making a mistake, but this is a mistake you'll have to make and maybe 20 years from now, you'll see that you made a mistake"". Also, they seem to resist me wanting to change who I am to who I want to be because I was happy before, and maybe... and maybe they're right. Am I just wishing for some fairy-tale dream that won't come true?

mrfishinajar,asktransgender,Depression intensified on HRT,"Almost three months ago, I started HRT, estrogen and anti-androgens. I knew I'd be in for mood swings and stuff, but sadly it's mostly just made me feel depressed more often. 

The thing is, I was depressed before, but it wasn't very often. It also wasn't too strong; the thing is, before I didn't really feel much emotion at all, and now I feel like the HRT has unlocked my emotions... and that there's mostly depression there. 

Now I was allowed to start HRT without my endocrinologist checking my hormone levels first, so my dose could possibly be a bit too high (I'm having another blood test in a week). Might this be the cause ?

I'm just worried because I've been feeling terrible much more often, and trading dysphoria for suicidal thoughts... I don't know how to feel about that. It doesn't help that I've seen barely any physical changes, too. Most people say they suddenly feel much better when they finally start HRT, which also makes it worrying.

What are your thoughts on this ? Is it normal near the beginning of HRT ? "

*First of all, I know about /r/transvoice. I just can't seem to get much in the way of replies there, so I am posting both here and there.*

I think I'm really starting to get the hang of this. It's still hard to keep it going for a long time, and I usually choke in front of people, but I keep talking to myself like an idiot and I think I'm getting a feel for it.

I find that when I lose it and i need to find it again, I go into chest voice, let myself crack up into... Whatever it is that is very quiet and doesn't work, and then kind of move my tongue back and get the sound into my mouth, which increases the volume significantly. After speaking like that for a while, I usually slip back down into the quiet voice... Which I don't think is falsetto bud I don't know what to call it.

I guess I'd say it's like I'm narrowing the passage near the top of my throat to get that volume and tone. But that's just what it feels like, I dunno. It's easiest to maintain the sound when making ""Ah"" and ""Eh"" vowel sounds.

In the US the surgeons are great but not here in Europe . They are paid to operate 3 hours and not a minute more . 3 hours to make a decent innie from my outie . I don't know . Can't I tell something to insurance so that they will have to pay for Chettawut or Suporn ? Or is that demanding for unnecesarry luxury ? 
Paying for it by myself is not possible . No one of 20 years old normally has 10-15k . I certainly don't have that . Does Chettawut give loans ? or Suporn ? I could get SRS covered by insurance but then I guess it only applies for surgeons within my country and not anywhere else . I also read about a certain doctor Djiznovic in Serbia who does a great job . Does that one give out loans ? 

I want to have bottom surgery as soon as WPATH tolerates it ( minimum a year , so another 11 months to go ) but I don't want to regret my surgeon for a money case . I want to have the surgeon I have most confidence in and that is Chettawut or Suporn . 

What about forcing my insurance to pay for the Chonburri flap method ? Can't I tell them that only that method can save my life ? Can I also force them to pay my hotel and flights ? 

I really really really am very DYSPHORIC about my balls . I want those bitches be taken away ASAP . 

Anyone a smart plan to have SRS at 20 ? Well 21 by that time actually . "
e-nnui,asktransgender,I can't find anyone to prescribe me hormones.,"So I live in South Texas and I've been talking to my general practitioner since I was 15 about being transgender, and was eventually made aware that my parent's insurance plan didn't cover trans healthcare for people under the age of 18. I was initially pretty beaten up about it, but time passed and I called my insurance provider the day after my 18th birthday (I would've called the day of but it was on a weekend). I had already been seeing a gender therapist regularly and had bloodwork done for my preliminary hormone levels to be sent over to an endocrinologist or other specialist when I could find one. But therein lies my problem: I can't find one. 

I've talked to my general practitioner for a while, and he doesn't have any referrals to give and is insistent that there aren't any available in town. I refused to believe so given how big of a city I live in, and looked into my insurance directory calling up every endocrinologist down the list, but to no avail. They all say that they don't ""do those types of hormones"". So I talk to my therapist about this, and she's just as doubtful about what my GP has told me. After looking around in her notes, she's able to locate an endocrinologist in my network that she says she knows will prescribe hormones, so I'm elated. I finally call them this morning to set an appointment, and again, I hear a crushing ""We don't do those types of hormones here."".

I don't know what the deal is with this city and my insurance network. What makes it all the more frustrating are the only doctors I can seem to find that definitively prescribe hormones are out of my insurance network. I'm kind of at the end of my rope. I've already had to move back in with my parents recently because I lost my job, and have had no luck trying to find another one. I graduated from high school three semesters early and still haven't managed to enroll in college. I haven't even managed to obtain a driver's license yet. All of these things are stacking up on me, and I know that if I deal with the heaviest, I'll absolutely be able to conquer the rest of them. But at this point, dealing with it seems to be out of my hands.

Well, if anyone has any advice that they can give me, i'm all ears. Thanks for your support. 

tl;dr - No hormones through Aetna in San Antonio."
learnvsassume,asktransgender,Need advice for my child and myself.,"Hello everyone.

My child is 13 and recently told me she thinks she might be transgender.

When she came out as pansexual a few years ago it made so much sense. It fit her in a way that we never doubted and she never doubted.

This time it just doesn't seem to make sense. Some of you may already be thinking  ""you just don't want her to be trans"".

Again, my child is just as unsure. So I will try to post the facts as I know them. We are researching local therapists and she has supportive friends. For now she has switched to her gender neutral middle name but has no issues with girl pronouns or boy pronouns. Her father, my ex, does not know. My husband does and told our child that whatever path is chosen we will support.

However, there are lots of questions that our child has that I want to answer without improperly guiding her one way or the other.

For this post, as she is still ok with girl pronouns I will try to use our child as a neutral and she or he as appropriate.

First, there were no signs. I swear, I've thought long and hard about it. We always allowed her to pick her own clothes and dress (to a point, nothing naughty) how she wanted. While jeans and tshirts were the choices when playing outside, she always chose female clothes for everything else. 

She liked looking pretty, buying pretty dresses, having her hair done. Boy or girl toys, she had access to all and still liked her barbies and ponies as much as her dinosaurs.

We travelled last summer and her grand parents gave her money to go on a shopping spree while in Europe. Everything she chose was feminine. Even a ""Ooh lala"" mid driff shirt. She does her nails and dyes her hair. Just yesterday she switched into a very form fitting flattering tshirt and jeans combo with her hair piled around her shoulders. 

Her career choice is scientist, she LOVES volleyball and riding horses. She draws anime and adores K pop and enjoys most other music.

After telling me she thinks she is transgender I asked her what led her to that and she shrugged.

I told her how as a kid I had friends that thought they were transgender, two were and transitioned later (though I lost touch pre facebook) and one realized she was gender fluid and is happy with girl parts but has different gender roles in the different parts of their life.

Also, as a young girl, I thought I wanted to be a boy. Periods were HORRIBLE and boobs sucked. Not other girls boobs, those were pretty, mine sucked.

My daughter is having a horrible puberty. She shot up in height really fast, grew in breast size really fast and has painful painful periods. We plan to start her on the pill if she chooses.

How can she figure out if she is truly transgender or going through severe penis / boy envy like I did? How can I advise without sounding like I'm placing my thoughts on her? I feel like this are valid concerns but I want to support my child and do what it takes for them to be happy.

If I had known of transgender people and options at her age I may very well have thought I was one, but the hating being a girl and wanting to be a boy faded for me. I think women are hot but sex with a man is what does it for me. 

If she wants to live as a boy for now, we will do so and help him. I believe trans people absolutely. It makes sense that the brain doesn't always match the body.  The trauma of medical transition is not something one does without second thought unless you know it is right. However, she flip flops on that idea. I asked her about that and she said no. then yes. then no.

She does not pee standing up or want to. There was never a ""i'm a boy"" statement as a younger child or aversion to anything girly. 

We had an event to go to for her sport where you dress up or down as you want. I told her she could dress however she wanted and she dressed up to the nines in a beautiful pink dress and had my best friend style her hair. She was literally the belle of the ball and had a blast. There was no shyness or issues. She is often very happy with her femininity , more than I was at her age.

My husband and I feel at this point we should just let her be her or him as our child feels but again, when guidance is asked for we don't want to not be able to help.

The plan is to also bring her father and stepmother into the loop when she/he is ready but they are super super super religious and barely coping with the pansexual part.

I know there is no one definitive way to say someone is or isn't trans by looking at markers, but again, for people we know that transitioned we never doubted. It was like, that makes so much sense. With our child, I just don't see it. 

Whoever he/she is, I will always love and support them. If that includes helping him transition, then we will do that to have a smiling happy person. Thoughts?

Please know I've ready through many posts, books, articles, blogs, and more. We've read stuff from parental perspectives and child perspectives. Our goal is to learn and not judge.

Lastly, when I asked her what trans was she seemed unsure of the actual definitions and variations and I don't want to steer her wrong there as well.

Overall I don't think she/he needs to prove who they are to anyone. My advice thus far has been to dress and act as is most comfortable and we will address our child by said neutral middle name. Overtime our child will figure it out and we will be there.

 Thank you for listening. I'm willing to answer almost any questions and I just ask that no one be mean. "
allie-the-cat,asktransgender,Self-identifying as a trans woman,"I'm Lucky to live in a place  where trans people are protected by the human rights act. Now, when I'm applying for jobs, a lot of places encourage various minorities to self-identify. If they don't list trans people explicitly, should I mention it anyway?"
Something_To_Believe,asktransgender,Dealing with the fear of not passing.,"Appearance has always been extremely important to me, to the point of obsession.  Though of course there is no amounts of clothes or makeup that will make my completely happy with how i look.  I feel like the main thing that is holding me back from transitioning, other than having to remove everyone from my life (not their fault mostly, i would just have to), is the fear that i wouldn't pass or i'd be ugly.  

I know i shouldn't let it bother me, much less stop me doing possibly the only thing that would fix what my life is becoming, but my fear just seems to rule me. Always has to be honest.

So for anyone that had the same issues, did they fade into the background once you had a body you felt comfortable in?  Or are they still there in the foreground.  

This is probably a petty thing to be asking about but i'm not exactly a strong person so i don't think i could deal with feeling like everyone knew."
CeciliaMemorabilia,asktransgender,So presenting but still getting called by old pronouns should I correct them or not care?,"Tbh I know I don't pass atm so I don't mind entirely but I go by my preferred name now and people call by that but not proper pronouns, I've been just not caring about pronouns for a while and its like odd seeing them as the preferred, I do like it but when people use them I'm surprised and lose track of what were talking about for a moment being like wow ok cool. But other than that brief second of oh wow! It relitivly doesn't bother me. But I do have a slight inclination to perffered pronouns over not preferred but not by much. At least not now. Should I care? I view myself as mostly trans leaning fem but overall nonbinary. 

Sorry I rambled a bit I lose track of what I'm saying sometimes."
EdWood24,asktransgender,I know I'm going to kill myself.,"Killing myself seems so inevitable in my situation that it has stopped being a question of if and is now a question of how or when. Probably not any time soon but most likley before I'm 21, it seems so inevitable. My odds have gotten much higher since I figured out that I'm trans; I always thought that if I were to discover the root of my problems than I would be able to solve them but I had always assumed it would be something like being lonely or upset by my parent's marriage, now that I know toe true cause it has only gotten worse because I know that trying to help myself will only cause everyone else misery and make me feel guilty for the pain of everyone else. Suicide at this point seems more likely than transition; I know that I sound like a melodramatic attention grabber but I genuinely feel that I will soon be out of reasons to go on living. "

AidMyMind,asktransgender,I need some help figuring myself out. Can you help?,"Hi. I dunno how to exactly type this and it might be very long in all honesty, really no clue I'm just going to be typing off the top of my head. Sorry for bad writing skills, not my strongest point. Anyways, hi, you can call me B. Currently I'm a 16 year old guy struggling to figure out what to do with myself. I'm halfway through my junior year of highschool and going strong.. I'm just incredibly confused. 

**Kinda a description of me:** Ever since I was little I didn't really fit the guy stereotype, I guess. I've always had a liking to girls clothing and accessories, lifestyles, etc. I've never liked sports but played them for years on end and still do a bit to keep in touch with some of the friends I've made through sports as friendship is such a huge deal to me. I used to be a pretty big kid, height and stature wise, for my age back then (9-13?) I was 5'8 at age 10 but haven't really grown since and I'm okay with that as I've learned to sort've like this height, but regardless. I've never exactly had masculine features aside from my height and a bit of my face as most guys have, my hands are generally small and my feet are pretty small too, I have ""girlie shoulders"" and from what I've been told, a nice butt and legs. (sorry 4tmi idk) It's strange as my sister is a lot more ""manly"" than I am, and fits more of the male stereotypes than I do and I can't help to think that we should've been born, well, as each other. I used to be lactose intolerant, but grew out of it at age 2 but before then as a substitute for dairy milk, I drank soy milk. I never really acquired a liking for the taste of dairy milk so I continued drinking soy milk. I later learned from research that soy milk produces estrogen mimicing hormones in men if you don't have much estrogen and I feel as I consumed soy milk for a good 10-12 years, that might have happened to me? I've always been a quiet kid with lots of friends and I guess a bit effeminate, and because of that I just feel like I'm an inbetweener and don't fit in.

**Dilemma:** I've had 4 girlfriends from the time I entered 6th grade till now and I suppose I still do like girls somewhat, but I've started to get an attraction to some guys too and it's just really strange for me, is that normal?  Is being gay exactly bad? I've always been told it is. I'm a long shot from the dominating stereotype that men in America are made to believe is right and when I think about maybe a girl I fancy, I get a weird pit in my stomach as I can't fill the role that I was ""born to be."" I've been crossdressing for a long time, maybe 7-8 years now, and I've acquired items such as short skirts, tights and leggings for myself and honestly, I enjoy wearing them and I think they look incredibly pretty. I guess it's a hobby although I do like to take pictures and show them to online friends I have made that have an interest in those kind of things, but anyways. I always wondered, ""why can't I do that"" or ""why can't I be that""? A lot of the time when I see a girl wearing something of that sort, which is a lot, I always ask myself ""why can't I wear that without being shunned?"" I'm just afraid and don't know what I'm really looking for. I can't talk to anyone in person about my turmoil as I'm from a very religious Christian family and any slip up of this information I'm currently writing, would **most likely** (99.9%) leave me on the streets, disowned. I don't really know where to go to exactly, but here, this is my first post ever on reddit btw. 

**My few questions:** Sorry for a lot of backstory but I suppose the question I really want to figure out for myself is.. Is this just a phase? I ask myself that a lot, I've always liked female oriented things from the get-go and there's only a few things that ""guys usually do"" that I enjoy doing. Am I just a confused crossdresser or am I really feeling that I am transsexual, **a lot of the time** I hope it's the first of the two. I'm afraid of being left alone and if I were to come out as transexual, or even bisexual, I'd be shunned and abandoned by my friends and family. It's not because they're evil and want to slay everyone who isn't ""normal"", it's just how they were raised and I don't blame them. Or maybe I'm just outraged by stereotypes, or maybe how my childhood had gone. In my family as the son, I had to preform all the chores, everything, lift all the groceries, packages, and do all the ""manly"" things with my Dad and I don't mind helping with housework from time to time as that's what children should do to help out their parents, it's just, my sister wasn't ever made to do anything. 

My parents explanation for it was that, well, **""shes a girl.""** This outraged me so much and I always viewed being a girl at this age at least, a blessing. My skewed view on how girls are is based on the girls that are in my life, have been in my life or that I have heard about. The stereotypes that I understand girls have is that, 1. They have to be perfect and strive for perfection of beauty and in society you're looked down on if you don't? 2. You have to take care of them and do the duties that they ""can't preform"". 3. As the man, you have to be the dominating one in the relationship and ""wear the pants"". I feel like this is incredibly wrong, but every girl that I know and talk to just fit into this. They're pretty, dainty, get to wear pretty clothing and sit around while the guy does most of the responsibilities in the relationships. Meanwhile, the guy stereotypes that have been somewhat imposed on me is that, 1. I can't have emotions, I'm just not allowed because I'm a guy. 2. If something is wrong or you have issues with someone, fight it out? Which I find incredibly dumb. 3. To be a proper guy, you can't like feminine things. I feel the stereotypes may be what's been driving me to hate being a guy. Perhaps I'm just jealous of the female stereotypes? 

I've always been a quiet and submissive guy and really I'm the ""girl"" of my close guy friend group, the small one that they put their arms around and let me just sleep on them, I dunno. I suppose as a whole, I just don't like being a guy and having to follow male stereotypes or else I'll be looked on as a ""gay fag"" and be shunned. If I had the choice, I wish I could be be born female, but I feel that becoming a female from a male is such a risky endeavor. Jeez this turned into a rant, although I suppose I really am just typing off the top of my head. Anyways, thank you for your time if you do read this, if anyone can sympathize or help me It'd be much appreciated, any advice is a blessing.

**TL;DR:** I'm a 16 year old guy who is struggling with gender identity and feel that I don't fit in with the guy stereotype. I like to crossdress and I don't know if my feelings for wanting to sometimes be a girl is just a phase, a reaction to me not fitting in male stereotypes, or is it me honestly just wanting to be a girl. Anyways, thank you, any help is appreciated."

isleeplikeacat,asktransgender,Today I was denied healthcare. It sucks.,"After my voice surgery, I took an appointment at the Speech &amp; Language Therapy of a famous university hospital. The delay was 4 months, but hey, I bit the bullet because they're good, right?

I was told my consult at to be at the beginning of the university spring semester, and though why not? There must be a good reason for that, like a change of staff, and they want to make sure I'm seen by the same therapist. I had a few privacy concerns, but I was told in writing it would be perfectly anonymous.

So there I went, and today I filled all the forms, including those with weird questions like when I started identifying as female (I'm sorry I don't think it has anything to do with speech therapy)

All the forms were filled even those authorizing students to assist in my therapy, except the one form where I allowed them to videotape me and use the recordings for education and research, and waived all liability. After waiting about an hour, the therapist came back to me and told me there was a problem with the forms - I needed to sign this one.

I explained my privacy concerns and that even with the HIPAA, I didn't want video of me to be kept after a session. I explained they could tape as much as they wanted during the session, to help with therapy, but not keep the recordings. So I would not sign, but give them my verbal authorization provided that they delete the recording afterwards. Like we're all adults, and don't do something I don't want, even if I can't control what you do with the videos once I've left the facility, and you've got my trust to proceed. It's ok, right?

The therapist came back to me 5 minutes later, telling me that her supervisor instructions were strict: since it was a university hospital, they had to take the recordings for ""educational purposes"". I declined again, and I was told they couldn't offer me therapy - even if I paid.

Now I'm going to a mall to change my mind, because this made me sad. Yeah I'm stupid I need to buy sttuff when I feel down. On my way, I realized that it's all very clear: we are there to provide them interesting case studies, that they can play with during the semester, then show our recordings to other students if we've been scientifically interesting. Just like animals.

I'm sorry but I'm not a research animal. I just won't consent to this. I'm posting here to let you know, in case a similar situation happens to you. DO NOT GO TO A UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL. If you have a consultation planned long in advance, have a spare plan with a private practice. Even if they tell you repetitively on the phone and by email that they have privacy protection, that they won't keep your name, they are lying and expecting you'll have no other option but agree at the last minute.

We are not zoo animals. We should not be denied healthcare for refusing to be videotaped."

zauraz,asktransgender,Constant doubts.,"Hi

I have posted twice on this page first about how I felt and that i might be trans and the second that i constantly have doubts. To be honest from the beginning i felt that I wanted to be female and was 75% sure that I might be transgender but since coming out to my mother I started regretting these thoughts and doubting that I actually want to be female. I feel a bit guilty as it feels like ""this is just a phase, you are making people worry without reason"". This has worsened and now i nearly constantly doubts myself about what I want and if I really might be transgender. I am going to a psycholog which I have 100% decided to not call of as I believe it will help but I still feel i don't want to because ""I might not be trans"" or ""It is a waste of time"". I know I constantly question my gender identity and have wanted to be female but taking these first steps have created a huge doubt about the whole thing. I feel like i just want to somehow drop it all and don't want to have anything to do with it as the doubt is nearly painful. 

Have anyone had a similar experience or a way to cope with it...?"

Usually (sometimes the feelings go) I feel like I'd rather be female, but I don't often feel strong dysphoria and I can't seem to figure out why I feel like this (if that matters). The fact that I could possibly be trans and that I'm not sure are both killing me, so my question is if I could potentially, somehow find out 100% for certain? Or does it always stay like this?"

This brings me to my question, what advice would you like to give to any of those audiences, but most importantly to those who are questioning or are just beginning their identities? 

As a secondary question, what information do you think is super important but not nearly often enough given in relation to those who are outside the gender binary? 

Thank you all in advance!! "
[deleted],asktransgender,"If you had to prove that conversion therapy didn't work on transgenderism, how would you do it?","I'm doing some research and I've hit a bump in trying to disprove the idea that gender identity can be changed by conversion therapy. There's plenty of research into gay conversion therapy which shows that it fails, but I haven't seen any on done on changing gender identity. Does anyone who happens to study trans issues have some useful evidence or arguments I can use?

Edit: I guess I'll add a little more background. I'm really into debate. The sort of debate I like most is debate in transphobic spaces. I really like the challenge of changing someone's mind who believes in transphobic things, I really feel like I accomplished something when I succeed, and I've had [lots of success](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/442la1/if_you_had_to_prove_that_conversion_therapy_didnt/czn4xq8) doing this.

FollowMoralOrders,asktransgender,I finally wrote the most AMAZING coming out letter! [Several relevant questions inside],"So I've written probably 8 or 9 of these while trying to come out on Facebook whenever Ive felt up to it, and while all the others didn't impress me and eventually were scrapped, this one was the best I could have hoped for. The big shebang, so to speak. If you want to skip to the questions they're at the bottom. 

It was a beautifully articulated 5 short paragraphs. It flowed out of my head like *words the one true Naomi* would say. It had everything I needed... Shame, individuality, self love, hurt, resilience, and finally pride in announcing who I was. It was thorough, eloquent, strong, attention grabbing, it flowed well and it was not too long. So after editing it a few dozen times and spending a lot of time on it I was about to hit ""post""  on fb when I lost connection and instinctively refreshed the page by pulling down with my thumb. Yes... I was on my phone... And in an instant it was gone... 

2.5 hours of beautiful hand picked eloquence straight from the GODS... and then SATAN AND HADES SWIPED IT BETTER THAN SWIPER HIMSELF. 

I have no words �� it's been an hour and I'm still upset about it. 

**Actual questions: 

Did you make a coming out letter? How many? 

Did the delivery go well? 

Was there any mishaps in writing/editing/sending it? 

What kind of responses did you receive?

Did you include any informative links or articles relevant to the way you presented it?**

throwatransawayday,asktransgender,"I continue to be stuck in a loop, how do I proceed in life?","Every day is living hell, okay, no, that's an exaggeration. But I guess, lack of communicating how I feel does stack up in the longer run?

Continuing, living as trans person who is hasn't started transitioning yet, is like falling. Time is falling. A day gone by is a day aged in with the wrong hormones. A week gone past is a week of shaving the little facial hair you have, but next week has more facial hair in store for you, so don't worry.

At the end of every day I imagine many people clear their minds and go to bed, sleep 8-12 hours of sleep or whatever is the norm and wake up to eat a shitty breakfast. 

At the end of my days I clear my mind from Star Wars, from music and from interactions with friends. Left is just me and the fact that I have done nothing. Everything is a distraction whether I want it or not, and the longer time passes, the more I hate the distractions rather than being distracted itself. Life is less enjoyable when you know Clone Wars season 6 is time spent falling.

I don't have the motivation or the courage to come out to my family. If I knew I could proceed with treatment, I'd probably do it because it's what my doctor requires, swallow it like a gross medicine. But I can't contact the doctor because I am not out yet. I'd need to make a phone call and there is no safe place or time. Furthermore I did make a call once and it went wrong and I have some kind of anxiety(as far as I know, I don't have anxiety) specifically related to making this kind of phone call because of a minor mistake. That first phonecall took all my might and it was a letdown, and who knows when I get an opportunity to call in peace and quiet again? 

So, to sum up, I hate my life and I would come out if it was to take concrete and tangible step forward in my transition, but I can't get to that point because I am not out yet.

I am not one to say that I hate myself or my life, it's a bit too much of admitting defeat for my taste, but I'll let it slide this once. I've been noticing that I've been acting more defeated than I usually do in other aspects of living.  "

CharlieThePaperLady,asktransgender,"Why do I need a second evaluation for GRS if I ""passed the test"" with the first evaluation for HRT? I'll have to do this this coming spring and it's stressing me out!","So yeah, I got my HRT letter in 5 or 6 meetings something like three quarters of a year ago (lol isn't this sentence beautiful), my psy was extremely comprehensive and everything went very well :)

The meetings were all about filling up what seemed like ""pre-defined questions"". Like, she didn't have a chart or anything, but I could sense that, you know, she had to ask if I had ever tried wearing girl's clothes, or what was my relationship to male and female pronouns, etc.

But now that I have to get a GRS letter from her and then another psy, I'm getting stressed out because I have NO IDEA what or even WHY they'll ask. For HRT it's previsible and basic ""are you trans stuff"". But now that we all know I'm trans, what's it going to be? Do I reach some required level of ""transness"" in order to get approved for GRS? Or is it like ""holy fuck I hate my downstairs and I cry everytime I see it""? Because that doesn't happen to me, I'm kind of fine with what I have I guess, and I can use it, but I'd change for the right part asap if I had the chance, you know?

I guess I'm stressing over how I have NO WAY to know what to expect (I tend get uncomfortable when I don't know how ""big things"" in my life are going to be. I mean, I'm down for unexpected things, but on that order of importance? The anxiety is way too real)

So yeah, /endrant

acheyshakey,asktransgender,Do all men want to be women?,"So, I've been transitioning for about two years now.
And it's been a pretty intense battle since day one. 

Gaslighting, dismissal, discrimination, snarling, blah blah blah. 

Before I came out I identified as a gay male and had a pretty blurred perspective on the world and didn't function well.

When I was little and talked about gender issues with my peers/family, I distinctly remember other AMABs saying, ""Yeah, we all feel shafted, but don't be a f*g."" (Or, something to that effect.)

Since I've been transitioning, pretty much every single male I've encountered has essentially repeated this sentiment. They've told me about their own gender issues, they've battled it out with me for the feminine space in the room, they've made exaggerated attempts to neg me and make me feel bad about the way I look. I've had forty year old men cross their arms, swish quickly to the left very femininely and go ""HMPH!"" I've seen males pout at me. Dudes at my acupuncture clinic have been openly aggressive and snarly with me in a very feminine way. 

My neighbor has obsessively watched my transition and has been measuring my progress. Male workers in places like Rite Aid have been awful. I even feel like there have been men (and women, but that's not for this post) who have actively sabotaged me and I feel like it's coming from a place of pain.

I know that you could say it's homophobia, transphobia, misunderstanding, or just a general hatred for anything different, but I really feel like I'm experiencing something more than that. It's like every male had this belief that you *couldn't* and seeing all these people come out and do it is blowing their minds and making them question their own gender.

I definitely knew there were a lot of men who were not being open about their internal issues, but I didn't realize it was this many. I definitely didn't think it was *every male.* But now I am seriously considering the option that Y is just the recombinant gene and eventually all males will return home to femininity. 

For me, I didn't experience transition as something optional. And I've experienced it very physically. 

There was no secondary, put it on the backburner and get married and have kids and don't worry about it because I guess God didn't have that in the cards for me, option.

Do you think there are way more trans women than we could ever imagine? 
Do you think all men would be women if they could?
Do you think this is a diversion tactic? (Oh, yeah, everyone feels that way, but no one does it.)
Do you think feminine men who dislike the effects of testosterone on the skin and hair are confusing that for being a WOMAN?
(My dad is constantly commenting on my skin and my hair and has said he thought he was a girl for a while, but I really think he doesn't realize that feeling like you should have a vagina and not wanting to go bald are two very different things.)

It's kind of overwhelming, actually. 


This has been such a fucking battle. Yay visibility backlash, yay being poor and not being able to afford housing in some hip, accepting neighborhood.



EDIT: I'm calling them ""men"" in the title because they are AMAB folk that are expressing this to me verbally and nonverbally, but do not identify as anything other than men at the point at which I'm encountering them.
So, AKA, do all AMAB folk really want to be/feel like women?

KrisEtKris,asktransgender,A dysphoric thought.,"While I was taking my E, for some reason, I watched a video about puberty. The video was an explanation of how a boy becoming a man and a girl becoming a woman.

While I was looking at how female are being matured during puberty, it got me so jealous. The exploding amount of estrogen spreading through their whole body and eventually make them become a beautiful woman while for me when I was going through the puberty, being dominated by poisonous testosterone and dropping my voice deeper than the core of the earth.

It just feels surreal and unfair. I did not want this life and I will have to rely on the medicine for the rest of my life in order for me to be ""me"".

mynameisaddie,asktransgender,Am I trans? (with a twist),"This is probably going to be long, and may not make much sense. I'll do my best to explain my thoughts. 

So, from the time I started to grow any facial hair, I hated it. I hated it being there, and I started to shave basically the second any started appearing. 

I noticed a discomfort with my genitalia, that started to get worse as time went on. 

Then I discovered that being trans is a thing. I figured ""that sounds like me!"". I started wearing women's clothes, started going by another name (Addie) in accepting circles, and it was great. I wanted HRT, I wanted surgery, the whole nine yards. I was really excited to become the girl I felt like.

I started seeing a therapist, and it's been a huge help. He's really helped me see the things that are contributing to my depression.  Until I started HRT, I asked for an antidepressant (Lexapro). 

That's where the problems started. The first week was hell. I was constantly exhausted, and I was too tired to be dysphoric about anything. I have energy again, but the lack of dysphoria has remained. 

I still don't feel like a dude, but I don't feel like a woman like I did before. I just feel like me. 

I don't know what to do. Do I go off the Lexapro and see what happens? Is it possible that thinking I was trans was caused by depression, and the Lexapro cleared that up? 

I know you guys can't provide medical advice, and I'll definitely bring this up with the aforementioned therapist, but I was wondering if anyone had some input."

I plan on beginning my transition when I go to University so I won't have to deal with their disapproval and I can live my own life, but I'm scared that I'm fucking up my body but not starting HRT or at least puberty blockers. I haven't finished puberty yet and I'm just now starting to notice coarse facial hair. I'm afraid if I wait I will end up looking too masculine and not be able to pass.

anita_kumar,asktransgender,GID or thoughts encircling or enfesting me?,"I felt I was better female in my third grade ( a day may be), then tried some women clothes, things in 7 th grade during which I came aware of transgender from newspaper until I didn't even no computers. I continued crossdressing till. My 10 th grade (age16) then I again learned of crossdressers and thought of I be a trans came in again but strongly. Then now college somehow I am at extensive dysphoria like after learning HRT,GID etc.. so I went to a therapist My therapist doesn't know GID or never read DSM. He heard me and asked my sexual orientation whic I replied it as bisexual with a doubt. He didn't tell anything about me but after three sitting called my mom and spoke which made her cry but I don't know what he told. My mom then after a session told me ( forcibly asked her) that therapist said it's just the thought of trans infesting his mind and asked to stop letting such thoughts near me. He also said doing so will bring myself (male) normal. My dysphoria was oscillating always and never steady minded. Second therapst opinion is on its way but no surity of him being dsm knowledge. All I can hope is some help.my current therpist says to continue my studies and if I was trans my dysphoria will kick my fem side out. So till that don't think trans and do daily work. 

For better infor:
Dysphoria wasn't constant it kind of went and came back greater in years.  
I was attracted to females for kind of period then to males.
Masturbation was extensive and found useless after I did it. 
Life was hard to be seen but I enjoyed a lot
Had love had friends (mostly male) .
Crossdressing and much things aroused me. 
Physical appearance isn't masculine (except face).

gfthrowawayat,asktransgender,"I think I'm genderfluid, and I don't know what to do about it","Since about three years ago, I've thought I was FtM. I've used a male name and male pronouns with friends and teachers (not out to my parents), presented masculinely (including binding and packing), etc. Like half the time, it makes me happier. 

But, every couple of months, it switches. I still like my masculine name and pronouns, but I desperately want my Elsa hair back, I want to wear my old dresses and pushup bras and Peggy Carter makeup and looking in the mirror and seeing someone so masculine feels wrong, and binding feels wrong, and it all just feels wrong. And I've started noticing changes in my breasts as a result of binding as much as I do, and sometimes it's like ""fuck yes die motherfuckers die"", but then it shifts and I feel devastated because I'm ruining them, because I had perfectly good breasts and I'm making them gross and saggy. 

I don't know what to do. When I'm dysphoric, I'm dysphoric as hell, and I just want to take a kitchen knife and cut off my breasts and fashion a dick out of them and sew it on to me myself (that sounds a little more extreme typing it out than it did in my head.) I want to shave my head and grow a beard and have a booming voice like all the other men in my family. And then, all of a sudden, I want to grow my hair back out and braid it and wear lipstick and play up my breasts and embrace my tiny waist and wide hips instead of hiding all of it, I want to be not just female but feminine (still lowkey want a dick though), and binding and presenting masculinely is nearly as uncomfortable for me during these times as not binding and presenting femininely is when I'm identifying masculinely.

I don't know what to do. Either I pursue transition and deal with the dysphoria when I'm identifying female, or I don't transition and deal with the dysphoria when I'm identifying male. They both suck. Neither option is good. How can I in good conscience get top surgery knowing for the rest of my life I'm going to be going through phases where I regret it? Same with HRT? My desire for bottom surgery is the only thing that *doesn't* change, but I'd have to go through everything else to get to that and still probably wouldn't be able to afford it.

And I feel like I'm so entrenched in being FtM now. Like I'm out to basically everyone but my parents. And tbh I knew within a couple months of first experimenting that my dysphoria wasn't permanent, that sometimes it switched, and I brought it up with a friend who said ""hey maybe you're genderfluid"", but I shrugged it off as conflating gender identity and gender roles. I was like ""I experience dysphoria as a result of my female body that is alleviated by minimizing and compensating and making my body more like a male body. Therefore, I am FtM transgender. Just cause sometimes I want to wear dresses doesn't negate my dysphoria, it's just me buying into gender roles. I can be a guy who wears dresses."" But the longer it goes on, the more I realize it's physical dysphoria both ways. That I'm not just a guy who sometimes wants to wear dresses. That making my body more male sometimes makes me uncomfortable in the same way and to the same extent as having a female body does at other times. And it's like, great, I've unlocked some mystery in my identity, I can finally put a word on it, my friend was right three years ago, but what the fuck am I supposed to do with this information? How do I deal with this?

I've experimented with androgyny, thinking maybe that would help even it out, and it did... in the sense that it just makes me uncomfortable about everything all the time, instead of just about some things half of the time. It all sucks. Everything just sucks. What the fuck am I supposed to do. I can't fucking win. It all just is the worst."

That being said, everyone I've ran into recognizes me instantly even though I haven't seen them for a little over three years and I've been on hrt for about half of that time, It's just really making me feel horrible, because I still see my *""old""* self in the mirror (due to the fact that I see myself everyday), and makes me think  that they all see me this way as well.

kitten_parade,asktransgender,Transition: phase two,"Has anybody else thought that they were done with transitioning, only to find themselves back in the thick of it?

I live in the UK, and transitioned about 6 years ago (back when the GIC waiting list was measured in months, not years). Before I transitioned I was really depressed (suicidal at times), and ragingly dysphoric. Over the next few years I had some therapy, HRT, group voice sessions, about 100 hours of electrolysis and finally SRS. I reached the point of no longer being depressed or dysphoric - I was comfortable with myself, and if people didn't like me it was their problem. Success!

 The electrolysis didn't really work very well, so I still had facial hair but it wasn't too visible, so I didn't care. My voice didn't pass very well (especially on the phone), but it was just part of who I am. I felt that I was done with transitioning, and lived happily.

During that time I was a student, and I recently graduated, got a job and moved to a much larger city. It's amazing here, there are so many more resources, like electrologists who use modern equipment and can do flash instead of blend, and a speech therapist who is a specialist in transgender voice work. i also have way more money now that I have a proper job.

Suddenly I am no longer satisfied with having stubble by the end of the day, or a voice that makes telemarketers misgender me. Suddenly I'm back in the thick of transitioning, after all this time. I've had 2 electrolysis appointments and a speech therapy appointment this weekend (along with about 8 hours of travelling to and from). I don't know how many months I can keep it up for, but I feel so alive - like I'm back on that quest again!

Has anybody else been there and done that?"

Is it easier that I have started at 20 and not at 35 or 40 or doesn't that make any difference in the "" recovery "" ?

Kacie38,asktransgender,Appreciating Dysphoria? and Getting rid of Doubt?,"I guess this is kind of a two part question.  We tend to think of dysphoria as being negative but in a sense maybe dysphoria is actually helpful to us because it gives us an indication something is wrong.  For example, I know and accept that I would feel more comfortable being and living fulltime as a woman. But sometimes during moments I don't feel as dysphoric I feel more depressed and have doubts about transitioning.  This is mostly society based but when I think about how much easier and not to mention less expensive not transitioning would be, its depressing because I don't have anything to look forward to.  Right now I just go to work come, come home, relax go to bed, rinse and repeat.  At this point, even if I mixed things up and have one of those guys nights if I had guy friends to hang out with, just living that normal guy life would cause the dysphoria to really kick into over drive.  I'm not sure how I did it years ago, just denial I guess but denial is just not an option I feel.

On the opposite end, when I am feeling dysphoria but don't have doubt, its like it kind of helps me keep sight of my goal.  That's not to say that we can't feel dysphoria during our moments of doubt but.  I know we have a lot of questions on here like, ""Am I transgender"" which I know that I am its just that it seems I have society based moments of doubt.

Does this make any sense or has any of you experienced this or do you disagree?

Also, to those of you that have been on hrt and once you start seeing results, however small, does that reduce your doubt to help you feel that you are doing the right thing?"

windlep7,asktransgender,Sometimes I can't see how it's worth the struggle. [TW].,"Sometimes I wonder what's the point of going through so much stress and anxiety, when I could just drink something that would make it all end forever.

The reason I'm still alive now is because a) it would kill my parents and b) there are still things I want to experience. But I fear this won't always be enough.  I'm not even out to anyone yet, but after reading about all the horrible things people in here have to put up with, I fear I won't be able to deal with it. Not only that, I fear I won't have a reason to put up with it and it'll push me over the edge. 

Being disowned by family and friends, getting abuse, workplace discrimination.  I can totally understand why the suicide rate is so high, what I don't understand is why it isn't higher. What keeps people going in the face of adversity?  Does finally being your true self feel so good that all the bad stuff doesn't matter anymore?

My parents are unlikely to be supportive.  They say familial support protects against suicide.  My friends probably would be supportive but I don't really see them very often.  I feel like in order to succeed at being trans you need a lot of luck - lucky enough to have a supportive family, lucky enough to have either good genetics or money for FFS and lucky enough to have a nervous system that isn't overly anxious/concerned what people think. 

What I'm saying is please convince me that this isn't a death sentence?  "

Flappybird123,asktransgender,Am I a trans woman in denial?,"I feel indifferent towards my body. I don't hate it but I always want it to look as feminin as possible. I have a very feminin character but I would definitely not want to be an alphagirl. I guess I'm butch. I keep thinking about being a girl for years now but I've never been affected by these feelings so much as for the last 6 months. I had the feelings on and off before. Socially I don't really suffer that much from being male , it's rather that I feel so confused when I think about my face and the disconnection with my feelings. I also love guys but I don't want them to be gay. I could never see myself with a gay guy because I don't identify as gay. I love alphamales and I feel sad often that I wasn't born female. I wouldn't want an operation but I would be cool to look like a woman. It's scary and exciting both at the same time. I want to look like a girl but I don't want to look like a complete stranger with a new face and what not. I want to be an upgraded version of myself. Maybe look like a female relative or so. I don't think it's just a fantasy since I really feel a mismatch between how I feel and how I look and it leaves me with confusion. Sometimes I see a girl in the mirror while others say that they see a male. I could be imagining these things though. If a slow transformation without any pain involved was a possibility I would probably be happy to live as an upgraded version of myself with a penis. I'm not doing crossdressing or something in that style since I don't feel any need to do so. Hanging out with the girls and being one of them is something I always feel so much excitement about when thinking about it. I don't want to go through to much pain and I'm 23 which means that I already have to much luggage to carry with me anyway. I am a very sexual person as well. I watch Tgirl porn on Pornhub and I love the videos where I could pretend to be a submissive Tgirl. It feels weird imagining other people to refer to me with female pronouns and talking about me as a girl. Living as one full time sounds all fun to me though. Even the not so funny parts. Just wanted to share. Maybe I'm just gay in denial or maybe I'm trans in denial. Not so sure why this eats at me. "
purplepariahhood,asktransgender,Should I get tested for intersex/etc. conditions?,"I thought I finally put this fantasy to rest, just to have my parents keep suggesting I get tested. I know they're grasping at straws to try to explain my trans-ness, but they've been talking about my possibly having an intersex-ish condition in a way that makes me afraid they've actually been hiding something.

That wouldn't be enough to make me worried, but HRT gives another reason to think on it. HRT has been super creepily effective. Like...that famous timeline chart for effects? Make it days instead of months. I've been on a ""real dose"" (100mg Spiro, 4mg E) for exactly a week. I was on 50mg Spiro for 3 weeks before that. I also was on 2mg E for two weeks before my real dose started. I haven't had any blood tests for hormone levels yet.

The effects are almost happening too fast. My feet have already shrunk some. Face/body hair has slowed way down, some is changing colour, some is going away. Skin has changed. Scent has completely changed. Body fat has been shifting. I have breast buds.

Also, male puberty came slowly and partially for me, compared to the rest of my family's men. Compared to them...I've always had feminine hands/feet, a ton less body/face hair, no aggression, sensitive/soft/nice skin, pronounced hips/butt, super small balls, more feminine fat distribution.

Should I bother getting tested? (I'll ask my doctor too, but I wanted yalls opinion as well)"
PsychoSexualTossaway,asktransgender,"So I'm trans (probably), What do I do now?","Here's the thing, I'm 21 and was assigned male at birth and I've labored over the idea that I might be trans for months. As a precaution, I've considered what my personal margin of error would be, and it  seems to be diminishing regularly. With that said, my biggest issue is that I don't know what to do with this information. It's like I've hit a brick wall with the words ""Now what?"" painted artfully on the facade. My best friend is fairly supportive, if unsure of what to do (despite being far more help than she will ever know), my parents have inklings of the truth and seem receptive enough, and my sister has casually asked if I'm trans (though that was before I'd figured it out)! So again, now what?

 As a side note I have recently started seeing a therapist for depression (which, I think, may stem from dysphoria), but I can't seem to say what needs to be said. I just can't get it out. Any advice on how to do that would also be appreciated."
transthrowaway5000,asktransgender,Trying to work up the nerve to make a phone call...,"I came out to my family (as a very binary trans woman) last April. My mom has taken time to adapt but she has made her love and support for me clear. My dad... wrote me a horrible email, saying he had failed me as a father and providing me a long list of reasons why I'm not really trans, said the people I surround myself with are scum for ""influencing"" me into thinking that transitioning was ""okay"". 

I wrote him back but it was a bit of a fool's errand. We didn't speak or see each other for 7 months. I reached out again by email and went home for dinner two weeks later (I'm over 30, and more or less totally independent). We can be in the same room but he barely speaks to me. His discomfort around me is palpable. 

I disabled my old FB and made a new one for the people I was out to. It's grown more than I expected and I'm ready to turn the old one back on, put up a big coming out post (which is also HEYYY I'm over a year into transition and full time) and I need to call my dad fist.

Because of his unwillingness to communicate with me, there are some things he doesn't know - like the fact I changed my full name, last name included. I'm sure some of you will say I don't owe him anything, but I still feel obligated to tell him myself rather than let him read it on the internet randomly while he's drinking his coffee.

I don't expect the call to go well and I've been trying to work up the nerve all day. My stomach is in knots. He can do whatever he wants with the information, I just need to communicate it.

1) I sing a TON. Like when I'm home alone, playing games, etc. I sing about as much as a play guitar, which is a big chunk of what I do with my life. I don't plan on doing much professionally, and if I do it'll probably just be instrumental thankfully. I just feel like all I'll hear is a man singing and lose my emotions in music...

2) I think I have a plan to cover up my medium-man ugly hands by using gloves and lace. But my feet are a big issue. I'm a men's 10 1/2-11. Is it possible to find shoes that don't make my feet scream masculine?

3) I feel like I really need to come out to someone who knows me irl. The issue is, I have almost nobody irl. My sister is gray area tho, as I've told her some personal things and she really wants to be close with me. I need to poke around and see how she feels about trans. A problem though is I sometimes find myself resenting her because I feel jealous of her. She has the body I want, tall and slender. I mean, I am that, but not with nice hips and cute hands and feet and such. And I can't have those no matter what.

4) I'm so scared of pills... I can hardly take things like Advil due to its size. Are there any small pills? Or what all options I have? I also am really scared of doctors especially needles... Do I really need blood taken from my arm even if I'm starting with small doses?

sweetcrutons,asktransgender,HRT in the Netherlands,"Hi, I have made plans to move to Amsterdam late this year and have been gathering information on things to do to make that happen. I should have my diagnosis and recipes for HRT drugs in Finland before that, but if anyone has knowledge/experience in having a diagnosis/recipe from another country works in the NL I'd be happy to hear about it. Also, how much are the drugs in NL? I've understood that you have to pay them fully by yourself, what are the prices for example Spiro and E? Any other information would also be appriciated (are there Dutch forums for transfolk etc?)"

kirito1342,asktransgender,"Is there something wrong with me, am I not transgender? If so should I transition?","I am a 15 m bi, I can't stop thinking about it, being transgender. I have seen a therapist and they said I did have gender dysphoria and as soon as I tell my parents then I can start hrt. 

Butzzzz every day I think about it, changing and having my dream life. But I'm pretty masculine I like excersizing I like video games I like some guy stuff. Also I saw a video on how hormones will change everything from the way you act and see life.

But I don't want that I don't want to not like video games. I like how I see life. But what if the change is for the better. I just don't know no one does. 

Also I feel male sometimes I feel that I'm not a female at all. But then I just switch to female over time or just in a instant. I made this post after I was feeling male but I was watching a anime lol. This girl acts a lot like me and I wish I was her. Then in that second I saw her I felt female.

This happens a lot when I see a girl I like or acts or looks like a girl me I feel feminine and I get so excited thinking on how I will be and basicly I feel soo happy telling myself that I was female and I'm going to have my dream life.

Then later I feel male and I think that my dream will never happen and I'm not deppresed or anything I just feel that I shouldn't change. But I also think that I have been wanting this I want to be a girl I want to have that life style I want to have my dream.Is this right I want to be 10000% sure I want to change before I tell my parents.

 But what if I want to be a girl for another reason, like trying to have a different experience out of life. My dad has not put me in a school and I'm homeschooled, I have not talked to my friends in a month because we talk over Xbox and my membership that lets me talk to them expired and my parents won't buy me another one I still txt them but it's not the same as talking. So while I have been alone I have felt a lot more feminine so maybe it's because I'm alone. But I have had girl friends maybe I miss that feeling being with a girl that's why I want to be one.

Then again I have been like this ever since I was a kid then I suppressed it always thinking how it would be fantasizing but not in front of others until about 4 or 5 months ago the feeling of REALLY wanting to be a girl came back.

So should I transition or is it not worth it I can live as male it's not like I'm going to die. I know where I'm going and how I will be as male but female, I would have to adjust. I kinda know I'm trans but am I REALLY TRULY trans. Will me feeling male change will my opions change? Man this is so much to think about, man I guess that's life. Also I think it's weird I like girls and I want to be one. Is it just me being a pervert that wants me to be female lol I though about that but I have been wanting to be female since I was a kid and I didn't have sex drive and hormones then.

Ps if your wondering what my dream life is it is me as a girl with my girlfriend in a house with white walls and grey floor and we will both be playing video games."

##Some tips for working on your voice:

* Stay out of falsetto! Falsetto is only useful in finding your head voice, it's not a very good place to go for finding a voice to speak in. Falsetto is the vocal range above your normal vocal range, and you should feel a ""break"" in your voice as you transition from your normal vocal range up into falsetto
* Work on your resonance! You should feel no vibrations in your chest when speaking. The target you're looking for is your ""head voice""
* To find your head voice, try pushing your larynx (the thing your adam's apple is attached to) up as far as you can, and attempt to ""throw"" your voice out of the top of your throat instead of your chest. You should feel vibrations in your mouth, teeth, upper throat and maybe even your nose when you're doing it correctly
* Once you get your head voice, take your guy voice up into head voice and you should get something that starts to sound female.
* Talk to yourself in your female voice when no one else is around, so you can build up muscle memory

##How to rate others' voices

If you don't know the vocabulary to describe what someone is doing wrong, feel free to simply state how close you think they are to passing. Please be honest and respectful, and don't tell someone they pass when you know they don't so that they don't end up using the wrong voice techniques. There's nothing worse than building confidence in a non-passing voice and then realizing it doesn't pass later on and you wasted your time.

If you are going to post your own voice clip, please help others with their voices as well! The best way to make this a useful thread is for everyone to pitch in :)

kaitlincutie,asktransgender,How To Get Started (MtF),"So, making the change is something I've dreamed about and thought about for a long time but never thought I'd be in a position to actually make the steps, but long story short I think I'm gonna be going for it. To put it simply I'm wanting to do HRT but at the moment no surgery or anything. Just looking for tips, tricks and any helping hand on getting started from complete scratch."
VincentVanNope,asktransgender,Most surprising change on hormones?,"If you've been on hormones, what was the change(s) you didn't expect, things they either didn't warn you about or you didn't think would happen to you? I've been on testosterone since September, and more and more recently I've noticed my eyebrows are getting thicker. like really thick. Like thick like my dad's crazy eyebrows. It just didn't occur to me for some reason that that would happen."
misscharlotteG,asktransgender,NSFW Masterbation and penis pain.,"So since starting HRT I've masterbated a lot less (like I used to do it at least once a day and now its more like once a week. Recently I've noticed some pains typically when I orgasm, a sort of throbbing, stabbing pain that sometimes lasts a while afterwards.

Presumably a little more 'exercise' down there would limit such pain?

Also things are dry down there, would lubrication help?

UPDATE: Been 'exercising' once a day since then and using some lube too and it is sooo much better. No pain at all. Plus orgasms are their own reward."
Lilstephanie,asktransgender,Transgender Restroom,"Ok so I'm at the airport(California) and I hear one guy say to the other,""they've got a transgender restroom.""  The other guy says,""what?"".  ""Yeah a restroom for he/she's"".  So the other guy says how can you tell its for trannys?""  ""It has a picture of a person split in half with a dress on one side and a man suit on the other.""   They were both obviously conservative assholes because they went on to say shit like what's the world coming to.  One guy said to the other,""men are men and women are women...that's a fact and it can't be changed"".  Basically inferring that Trans is invalid or not a real thing.  I was glad to hear about the new restroom but these jerks pissed me off.  No I didn't go up to them and say,"" you guys are assholes.""  But I felt like it.  Would you have said something?  I was chicken.  "
sacredblasphemies,asktransgender,What to do if you're bald?,"I started losing my hair in, like, high school. By the time I was 21, I had a hairline like Patrick Stewart.

I've always wanted to transition and live as female, but I'm concerned that that would mean I have to live the rest of my life wearing a wig. 

Additionally, at puberty, my head got larger. I feel like that would be hard to hide without a good wig. 

What do you bald MTF ladies do?"
fungus-mungus,asktransgender,Does smoking affect HRT?,I plan to start hormones soon (21/MTF) and I'm curious if chemicals like nicotine or THC affect hormone replacement therapy in any negative way. I'm dead set on hormones but I also really don't want to give up my daily habits. Any advice?
weirdestjourneyever,asktransgender,"To those who have been on Spirolactone, what was your starting dose? Did it have any weird side effects?","I've got on Spirolactone as a t-blocker without prescription (my country doesn't need it) and I've started on 100 mg/daily. I'm still in puberty (extremely late bloomer, thank goodness), 5'5'', weighing 102 pounds or so, so I'm being careful about the dosage but I would really want to up it to 200 mg, since http://tarasresources.net/transition.htm says the maximum dosage would be 400 mg/day.

At what dosage did you start? Right now even just having been a week on 100mg I'm experiencing dryness and flakiness on some small spots of skin. Might be from not hydrating enough (Which I've been trying to solve but I've never had a habit of drinking water), but it was enough to worry me. Also, did you get a doctor's recommendation for it or just trusted your gut/advice?

EDIT: Is hyperkalemia a real danger, common-ish too?"
Uynia,asktransgender,Simple and complex resources to convince my parents?,"My mom is loving and is trying hard to understand, but is still confused and against it. I feel she just needs a bit of a push so she can be really supportive. I showed her articles and videos, but she wants something that would put it in simpler terms.

My dad is...a whole nother ballpark. He's in a happy mood most of the time, but when I remind him of my condition he gets angry and dismissive (never abusive, thankfully). I feel like he is just confused. He grew up in a ""hillbilly"" town in the Dominican Republic (his words not mine), so many of his views are conservative. He and my mom were thinking about getting me testosterone boosters to ""help me change my mind"" but thankfully I think I managed to convince them that wasn't a good idea. Now they are looking for a therapist, but I'm scared stiff that my dad will manage to find the most ignorant therapist around that will make me take testosterone boosters. 

My father will probably ignore anything that isn't scientific since he's a doctor (and has quite the ego), and my mom just wants simpler articles (preferably ones that explain my translesbianism). Could you guys provide me with resources that are both easy to read for my mom, and big wordy for my dad?"
veloci-nap-tor,asktransgender,Has anyone else simply forgotten how to do their old voice over time?,"I saw someone post a vocaroo in the thread about restrooms where they changed their voice.

clownbabyyy,asktransgender,Cis person looking for clarification on gender/sex distinctions,"I am a cis person curious about trans. Please correct/address any assumptions I make in the following post, as I'm looking for clarification. The statements I make are based on my perceptions of trans, and I only mean them as fact as far as my knowledge. They are malleable opinions and in only trying to understand. Thanks!

I've been taught that gender is separate from sex. When a person's gender identity is not consistent with their biological sex, this makes them trans gendered (if a bio male identifies as a woman, etc). This brings me to my questions. 

If we recognize that sex is different than gender, one is biological and the other social, how and why do trans-identifying people want to transition? It seems that would perpetuate the idea that still associatI am a cis person curious about trans.

I've been taught that gender is separate from sex. When a person's gender identity is not consistent with their biological sex, this makes them trans gendered (if a bio male identifies as a woman, etc). This brings me to my questions. 

If we recognize that sex is different than gender, one is biological and the other social, how and why do trans-identifying people want to transition? Let me elaborate, and this only comes from personal experience and interactions. Trans people I've known want to be/become a different sex based on the gender they identify with. Bio males who identify as women want to transition to female, bio females who identify as men want to transition to male. But, since sex is different than gender, why is this? e sex as gender? Let me elaborate, and this only comes from personal experience and interactions. Trans people I've known want to be/become a different sex based on the gender they identify with. Bio males who identify as women want to transition to female, bio females who identify as men want to transition to male. But, since sex is different than gender, why is this? Why is there a need to change sex based on gender if the two are separate?

Also, regarding those who do not intend to transition: if a trans person identifies as a man or woman, and they do not intend to change sex, what do they base their gender identity on? A bio male that identifies as a woman and does not want to be female, for example. What is she identifying with? Is it the gender roles as assigned by gender binary? The desire to be more feminine? Certainly being a woman reaches beyond the desire to wear certain clothes and adhere to gender stereotypes, etc.

Please input helpful comments and clarifications. I'm not here to argue my opinions or prove anything. Thanks. "
Coribelle,asktransgender,There goes mom!,"Finally sat down and came out to my mom. It involved a lot less yelling and crying than I expected, but the content of the conversation was about what I'd expected. 

I tried to give her my letter, but she refused to read it, so I read it out loud. My stepdad was there too, so it ended up being a lot less personal than I had wanted. They ignored everything I said in my letter and mostly wanted me to prove to them that I was trans. When I told them about dressing when I was younger, about the depression, and the other things I felt growing up, they basically just accused me of making it up or misinterpreting my own experiences somehow? According to them, if I felt that way at such a young age I would have told them because I wouldn't have known it's a thing you should lie about. Also, since my frontal lobe doesn't stop developing until I'm 25 I can't possibly be sure about this decision, and my confusion could be reversed if they gave me testosterone instead of estrogen like I wanted. 

My stepdad really just wanted to argue about whether or not you choose to be ""gay"" and kept trying to steer the discussion in that direction. He mostly said that gay people have DNA damaged by mankinds sin and that it's a choice because some people stop being gay. And, yeah, of course he sees trans people as ""gay"". Sigh. Luckily, I was able to keep him from getting too riled up. 

My mom seemed angry that I hadn't told her and couldn't understand why I'd stay in the closet (and when I tried to explain that they can't really understand the pressure on LGBT youth to stay closeted, my stepdad just said 'how do you know').

 Then she told me I could live with them and go to religious (aka corrective) therapy to ""figure things out"" or she would kick me out and cut me off of everything from family insurance to my own bank account. I told her I loved her and that I'd stay with my dad until I could find a permanent place of my own.

Then I told them I was done with the conversation and left to clear out the few things I own. 

Before I left I came out to my stepsister. She was so fucking cool about it. We've never been super close, but we hugged and cried. Oddly, this was the first time I cried in all of this. I'm going to miss her a lot. Then my other stepsister called and said if I ever needed a place to stay that her place is open. 

Finally, I went to my Nana's and came out to her as I was packing my things. She was very chill about everything and said she'd talk to my mom. I was so blown away by the outpouring of love and support from my stepsisters and grandma. I've been crying nonstop since then. They don't all necessarily understand or support my transition, but they support *me*, as myself. My mom says that she loves me, and I think she does in her own way, but this, *this* is true love. 

My things are gone. My house is gone. My mom is gone. But I'm happier and more at peace than I've ever been. I just want to come out to everyone and finally jump on the E-train! 

So, yeah, that's where I'm at. I hope somebody can find something to take away from my emotional ramblings. 

I love you dudes so much. Thanks for your help and support and general radical-ness. Stay frosty /r/asktransgender!"

genderben,asktransgender,Transitioning in the UK when in a relationship - Please share your experiences!,"Hello everyone! The reason for this thread is not because of having any issues - I'm actually in the final year of my PhD, writing a thesis about non-binary gender identities. Sometimes I get asked to give talks, and I'm giving one on Monday which considers being in a relationship with a trans person who is accessing gender affirming medical services. 

I can draw upon the academic literature (very limited!), and my own experiences, but it would be lovely to be able to discuss a wider range of lived experiences. So in particular - 

* were there any particular difficulties you had to overcome? Were these due to, or tackled with, your partner?
* if you were giving tips to the partner of a trans person on how to be supportive, what would you say?
* in what ways did you most need support (either as a person transitioning, or as the partner of someone who is/was?)

Thanks! "
HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,It still really bothers me that I get aroused by the thought of being a girl.,"I'm aroused by girls themselves, and of course the dreaded term autogynephilia. It just feels like, if the only reason I'm transitioning is because it turns me on, its not enough justification.  Agh, I dunno. 

I know what people say, that women can feel sexy when they see themselves, and women never have to desire being themselves because they already are, but still, something about being turned on by the transformation itself, it just bothers me. Like, why can't I just be happy, not *aroused*?  "
TheLetter10,asktransgender,How many attempts did it take you to finally transition?,"I'm currently on my fourth attempt.

My first attempt I was full time for two years (I was 27 then) minus HRT and stopped because my wife threatened to leave me.

Now I'm 32, not even anywhere close to being where I was then, my wife has left me due to depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia issues. Obviously I'm very upset about it and will be sad for a long time but at the same time I feel free a little bit that I might actually do it this time.

How many tries did it take you?"

bellsprout69,asktransgender,What are the less talked about/common things that you hate about your assigned gender?,"See title. I guess I'll go first. 

I'm MtF, and one thing about presenting male that gets to me is when every fucking guy in a room feels the need to stand up and shake your hand when you first come in and are introduced. I always awkwardly avoid it by turning to talk to someone else or, if I have a bowl of popcorn--this happens frequently actually--,by shoving it there face and offering some. 

So, what do you guys/gals hate? "

CherieAntoinette,asktransgender,Can anyone help me with MTF wardrobe necessities?,"Hello I was wondering if someone could help me find a base for wardrobe necessities. I will be starting HRT within the next month or so and need some help figuring out what I should have to start out with. I love skirts, dresses, and heels and have a little bit of those to start.

b7d,asktransgender,I'm so tired of hating this.,"I've tried to fight it. I'm so tired of absolutely abhoring myself for even wanting to be a girl in the first place. I've cut myself off from relationships and being open to love because I hate myself so much I feel people don't deserve to have to tolerate me. I hold myself as the lowest of the low, equal to an animal. I abuse my body in every way I can, I push my body to extreme limits, I never do anything to build any good reputation or anything good associated with my name. Everything I do is under a ""live fast, die young"" mentality and all is very obviously based upon the absolute hate I have for myself. 

I'm so tired of hating it. I'm so tired of not being able to be happy because I can't get over the notion that I want to be a girl and that's okay. I'm tired of beating myself up for something I've never even had control of in the first place. And I'm tired of feeling like I'm letting everyone down by even entertaining the notion of wanting to actually be happy and content in life.

captainersatz,asktransgender,"What do you think of words like ""transgenderism"" and ""transgenders""?","How I learned about this stuff was that trans/transgender is an adjective, therefore terms like transgenders is not grammatically correct and people should instead be saying transgender *people*. Sort of like saying someone is gay, as opposed to saying someone is ""a gay"". It's also nice to not be reduced to literally the word transgender as a noun, and adding an -ism to the end of it just sounds icky. 

It didn't use to bother me that much, but nowadays it bothers me more and I try to gently correct people who say transgenderism/transgenders/a transgender/etc, but I actually see a lot of it being used by people in the community.

So I've had a hard time understanding how these things affect people. I've never dissed the trigger warnings - but I will admit to having been flippant about them.

But rape... rape is triggering. Rape affects me every single time it comes up. In a deep, soul rendering way.

I guess I've never been ""raped"" in the traditional sense. But I was violently molested by a much older girl. Worse, perhaps, than the physical aspect was the fact that she threatened to tell my parents that I wanted her to do it.

When my parent's found out it changed the way they saw me - and I could see it. I've, for the most part, gotten past it. But it shakes me every time.

So.. I know this ends up not being a question.. But trigger warnings serve a purpose people. They really do. Because sometimes when things are already rough the last thing you need to to be smacked in the face with the thing that hits you the hardest.

p4r3nth3t1c4l,asktransgender,Will normal testosterone production resume after stopping HRT after several years?,"Hi! So, I started HRT just about five years ago. I didn't (and still don't) have access to decent healthcare so I ended up buying spiro and E online.

For a number of reasons, I am considering stopping HRT. This is primarily for health concerns (I have health anxiety and not being able to monitor aspects of my health while being on HRT is really fucking with me), but also partially because my identity has simply evolved over time (I'm agender, and have a (to me, anyway) surprising amount of dysphoria concerning having breasts).

Anyway: what I would like to know is if I stop taking HRT, will I return to a ""normal"" level of testosterone production? I have heard that one may end up underproducing or overproducing T after having been on anti-androgens for a while, and I am especially concerned about the possibility of the former, due to its ramifications on the health of my bones.

KimH2,asktransgender,How to handle an unaccepting parent?,"I originally told my parents back in July '15 and I've been arguing on and off with my dad ever since about it. 

He's been opposed to transitioning since day 1, any examples I give him of how I feel, childhood experiences etc. are ""lies or misinterpretations to 'fit my narrative'"", he's convinced if I had told him sooner he could have talked me out of it....

My mom has sworn up and down that ""he's trying, he's just having a hard time""

After the first couple months of arguing I explained that eventually accepting this is a prerequisite for our relationship to continue, I can't have a toxic person in my life dead naming me and misgendering me in perpetuity.

I recently reintroduced myself to my friends and family as Kim and shortly there after I get a message from him ""I can **never** accept this, you will **always** be my son, you will **always** be [old name].""

we fought again, me explaining again why that's a serious issue with already explained serious consequences him saying ""That's just how he feels and I should have to accept how he feels""

I fell like I'm going to have to cut him out of my life but at the same time I think that's what he wants me to do... the way he words everything ""you're threatening to throw me out of your life *I'm* not doing that to you""

It seems like since everyone in the family aside from him (and somewhat my mom) have been able to accept this without issue he realizes if he severs our relationship because I'm trans he looks like an asshole but if he forces me to do it then I become the villain instead... ""He said he was trying, he said he still loved you and you cut ties anyway"".

I REALLY hate this because my forehead is already quite big and now it's, little by little, only getting bigger (though I apparently still pass because my long hair covers the M shape okay-y, but still..) The thing is that I still have to wait months for HRT and nobody I've been to wanted to prescribe finasteride/propecia. (For the record: I've been to 3 physicians and 1 dermatologist over the last couple of months; none of them wanted to prescribe fina, one physician didn't even know it exists).

Does anyone know if it's common to not prescribe fina to someone who's 18? I personally don't get this at all. Especially because these doctors I've visited didn't explain WHY they didn't want to prescribe it. 
It's not forever and it feels like these people don't understand how horrible it is for a girl to suffer from hair loss besides already having a fuckin' male body...

Any thoughts on this? What should I do?


It's just so frustrating that I'm not able to get my E and T-blockers yet, while the balding and masculinisation things continue.

Genderqueertrans,asktransgender,How fake is this story ?!,"Former Transgender Tells His Story

In his own words, this is the story of Darrell, an African-American former transgender. PFOX raised funds for his reversal surgery:
As a boy, I began to feel same sex attractions at age 13. I acted out with older kids and then became involved with older homosexuals and bisexual men. When I moved away from home, I encountered a man who I thought was a woman. He introduced me to other “men” like him, who befriended me. We spent lots of time together. I asked them how they got that way. So one of them introduced me to a downtown doctor, who evaluated me and gave me my first shot of estrogen so I could start looking like a woman too. At that point I became afraid. But my friends were there to help me. The doctor left me with my own estrogen and steroid pills and refills. I was on my way to becoming a woman just like my transgender friends.

As a result of the estrogen, I became physically developed as a woman, even though I was not one. The hair on my body and face started to shed. A month passed by. I became scared at what I saw in the mirror. Nonetheless, I was happy with what I was seeing.

Along with the physical changes, my personality changed. I became very arrogant. Even though my breasts had enlarged, I wanted more. So my transgender friends introduced me to an attractive man who owned an extremely large and beautiful house on a hill. He took me into his basement and told me to lie down on a table.

He massaged my breasts. Then he injected my breast with silicone gel and began to pump up the breast. I saw my breasts increase in size right before my eyes. He asked me to let him know when to stop. I was breathing very fast with fear. But in less than two hours it was over. I began to realize that this is commonly how transgendered men get their breasts – through unauthorized silicone injections. Sometimes they get together for what is called a “pumping party” and inject each other.

But I was pleased with my new breasts. I thought I looked attractive and was reinforced by the compliments of my transgendered circle of friends.

However, as the years went by, I became depressed. I was never able to be happy or find true love. I was in love with a guy that I thought was the best thing that had ever happened to me. But he was abusive. Despite the abuse, there was almost nothing I would not have done for him. But it was all for nothing because he left me for someone younger.

In the homosexual and transgender life, youth is very important. As a result, I was obsessed with my body and personal appearance. Acceptance by others in this lifestyle requires a good body and good looks.

In order to be part of the transgender crowd, men must meet certain criteria. We have to have more dominate female features; in other words, look more like a woman than she actually does. So we had to have bigger breasts, more shapely hips, flawless complexion, etc. In order to keep up, I had to buy the most expensive creams, take a regiment of hormone pills, do my makeup in the mirror for hours, etc.
It took me a long time to fix myself up and keep up with the beauty regiment, especially since I was not a woman. So although I looked better than most of the women out there, it was all a charade because I was not even a woman to begin with and it took so long for me to look like one. Going to a bar or party as a woman was hard work. The performance was an everyday lie.

But the praise from the others in my crowd of transgender friends kept me going. I was the center of attention and felt important. When younger transgenders joined us, I took more hormone estrogen pills to look more physically female, even though the increased dosage made me physically ill.

One time I saw myself from a side mirror and was frightened because I thought it was someone else. At one point, I was so depressed and lonely that I went to the public rail system wanting to be rescued, even if it meant going to jail. I carried half a gallon of whiskey and was sobbing on the public bench. It was raining that night and I urinated on myself over and over again. I was drunk. I felt sorry for myself because no one else was. After many letdowns like this, I wanted to change my life.

No one reached out to me, so I turned to Christ and stopped taking hormones. Slowly I began to look like the gender of my birth. I went back to calling myself by my male name, the one my parents gave me and that I had abandoned all those years when I was trying to make believe I was a female. I began to see that I was a new creature in Christ. I began to like myself and associate with people who were Christians. They loved me unconditionally and I didn’t have to always look “beautiful” to be with them.

Eventually, no one could tell I had been a female for all those years – except for one thing. I still had my breasts. So now I was a man with female breasts. What had once given me so much pride was now a source of agony for me. I did not have the money to pay a surgeon and hospital operating room to remove the silicone from my breasts. Of course, the procedure was not covered by insurance. I didn’t know where to turn for financial assistance, because I felt no one would understand how I got into this mess and instead tell me I deserved it. But I knew God did not want me to live like this. He had made me complete in His love and He would complete me now.

I heard about PFOX, Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays &amp; Gays, a non-profit organization that had raised funds for the reversal surgery of another former transgender. PFOX agreed to raise funds for my surgery, anesthesia, and operating room. They found a Catholic plastic surgeon to perform the operation at a reduced rate. A Christian woman financed the operation. Who would believe that people could be so kind to make such contributions for someone like me?

There was a lot of anticipation and anxiety waiting for the day of my reversal surgery. I thought that day would never arrive, and when it did, I was scared. At one point I began to think I did not deserve it.

After the surgery was over, I looked down to see the final results and I never looked down again. Now I could do the things I had always wanted: go to the gym, meet people, try on clothes without fearing that someone would walk in on me, and become more physically active. I began to experience a confidence I had never had before.

Today I am ready for the Lord to move me to another level so that He will continue to work in my life. Jesus changed both my body and soul. I have been changed to be unchangeable. Not in a million years did I ever think I would be giving this testimony. Take it from me, regardless of what you have done or who you did it with, when God is in you, your life will never be the same. Jesus Christ is the best thing that happened to me. He is more beautiful than any woman I could ever try to be.

riahsimone,asktransgender,Starting a Trans and Gender-Nonconforming Tailor Shop?,"Hi Asktrans,

I am part of a group of teenagers doing a weekend startup accelerator, and the idea we are pitching is a custom tailor shop that is inclusive to all gender identities, and caters to an individual's own style, as opposed to pop fashion trends. We are in the process of getting support from a few local companies, so that we could have material and startup costs subsidized so that we can offer low cost clothing options to lower income individuals.

If everyone could take a couple seconds and respond to the following questions, that would be great.

1.) How often do you buy clothes for yourself per year?  
2.) How much do you spend on clothes per month?
3.) Would you consider shopping in an online tailor store? 
4.) How relevant do you think having personally fit clothes is to trans and gender-queer people? (regardless of clothing style?)"

ryannefromTX,asktransgender,"So where are all these 6'3"" broad-shouldered, narrow-hipped giant cis women the internet keeps telling me about?","I mean... when someone worries that they're never going to pass because they're super tall, super man-shaped, with no hips and a 50"" rib cage, someone on here inevitably pops up to say ""Don't worry!  There are super tall cis women with broad shoulders too!""

So how come I've never met any?

I mean... between work and just, you know, leaving the house, I've seen an awful lot of women.  I went to Sweet Tomatoes for a lunch break the other day, and there were tons of women there.  And I was at least a head taller than even the butchest, ugliest one.  I go to the lesbian bar fairly frequently, and that's ALL women.  There was only one woman there even *closely* approaching my build, and I talked to her, and it turned out she was trans too.

I mean... there are 8 billion people in the world, so I'm sure somewhere there's, like, 3 or 4 cis women who look like barrel-chested lumberjacks.  But for a trans person who desperately wants to pass and just be treated like a normal woman wherever I go, d'you think people are going to look at me and think, ""Wow, that must be an extremely rare outlier cisgender women with an unfortunate endocrine condition or something!"" or are they gonna think ""That's obviously a man wearing lipstick and eyeliner and I don't know who he's fooling.""

I'm tired of having to spend two hours shaving my face and arms just to leave the house.  Yes, I know laser treatment exists and if I magically had an infinite amount of money, I wouldn't have to ever shave again.  I'd still have the dead-giveaway male waist-to-hip ratio, and there's, unfortunately, no such thing as Body Feminization Surgery yet.  I'm tired of having to cake makeup on my face just to go to the store.  Yes, I know women wear makeup to the store.  Thing is, a woman can choose NOT to wear makeup to the store, and she still looks like a woman.

At least when I'm in guy mode, people just don't notice I'm there at all.  People noticing I'm there and then staring at me or snarking at me is just so much worse and I can't imagine that transitioning when I can't pass and virtually asking for piles of abuse to be heaped upon me is going to make me any less suicidal.

I want to have a couple of surgeries to fix my dysphoria. 2 that I definately want to get in the near future are FFS &amp; VFS. 

The thing is, i'm working with professionals in my state who say that FFS will probably mandatorily be covered by my insurance in a year or two. I don't want to drop 30k on my face, then have my insurance say ""you can get it now!"" That'd be a slaip in the... *preferably pretty* face. :/

One thing we know is that VFS is not and will not be covered any time in the near future, and it's something that I really want. I'm a musician who passes on a daily basis, *except* when I'm singing. I would really like, even if I don't fully pass, to not be so blatantly male with my barritone voice. If I can raise it 30hz, i'd be happy.

Then there is the problem of intubation. If I get VFS, wait a year, then get FFS, I'm afraid the breathing tube will break my stitches. Is there much truth to this fear? I've heard surgeons can use child size tubes to the same effect.

katiecakesss,asktransgender,Joining the national guard?,"I'm about to graduate high school and I need to get away from my family. I don't currently live in the US but my family is moving to Kansas in four months.

I don't have much of a way to pay for college or the move. I can't get a job here.

At first I was set on joining the Army to get all of my insurance, college funding, housing, and moving out of the way (knowing that the ban will most certainly be lifted this year) but I backed out. Even if I'm allowed in the Army, I'm still surrounded by people who will most likely be ignorant, unsupportive, and misunderstanding regarding my transition. Joining may even delay it. Every Army person (that I know) has been very homophobic, one even said they've ""lowered their standards"" by repealing DADT. I'm putting myself in a conservative and highly disciplined environment which I would rather not be a part of.

Every time I mention the military around trans communities as a way to get out, I'm told it's the worst thing I could possibly do if I wish to transition.

Still, I need a way to pay for college. And a dorm. And insurance. And food and gas and a phone bill. A post 9/11 GI Bill would get the biggest two out of the way.

I told my father I honestly didn't want to join the Army and that I was only using it as a way to move out and pay for college and get health insurance. I said I didn't like the military ""environment"". He told me I could still join the National Guard or the Reserves, which belongs to the state. I wouldn't have to be a ""soldier"", I would just have to show up to training exercises twice (?) a month and provide relief to wherever there is a riot or a natural disaster in the state. So I'm not around these guys 24/7 as I would be in the Army.

He said I can change my state of residence to the state I want to live in, and they'll put me there. He said I'll get a post 9/11 GI Bill which will pay for college and a housing stipend in the process.

Is this true? Is this a good idea? And most importantly, how's the situation for trans people going to be once they lift the ban? Does the state decide if they want to allow us in or not?"
NinjaUnicorn_17,asktransgender,Is my mother's therapist giving my mother grief counseling?,"My mother has been seeing a therapist for some of her mental health issues (bipolar, depression, anxiety) for several years, long before I had even begun to realize that I am transgender. He's been immensely helpful with her. When I came out to my mom, she started discussing it with her therapist, as she is needed to figure out how to process everything.

Now, my issue is with some of the advice my mom's therapist has been giving her. He is not a gender therapist, but he claims to have some experience with trans issues. I try to talk with my mom about  how her therapist is helping her, and all he has ever told her each session is to just take it one day at a time. I understand that this is a big change and will take some time for my mom to adjust, but this advice just rubs me the wrong way for some reason. 

When I was 12, my grandfather died. My mom told me that with grief, you just have to take it one day at a time, so I guess part of me has just always associated this advice with grief? Also, my mom did once describe that the process of accepting this that she and my dad are going through as ""grieving the loss of their son"". 

Honestly, I feel somewhat hurt. I haven't died, I will always be the same person, I'm just going to look different and have a different name.  I am starting with a gender therapist soon, and I would hope that at some point he can meet with my parents. My mom is going to start taking my sisters to her therapist because they are processing this as well but I would prefer they speak with the gender therapist. Should I be concerned about this advice my mom is getting from her therapist or am I just crazy?

TLDR: Mother receives what appears to be grief counseling from counselor. I know it's normal but I still feel weird about it."
artieee123,asktransgender,"How can I know that I'm transgender, and if not, what else?","Hello there. I've made this post with the purpose of making two questions, so I'll go for it.
First of all is that I'm not sure of what I am. If transgender or anything else. Sometimes I feel femenine and when it happens it is alright, I change my clothes to female ones and whatsoever. I feel good and I really like that, but the feeling can dissappear, and when it does, I feel pretty anxious/depressed because it's gone, and I want the feeling come back, but usually unsucessful. I have those shifts basically all the day, and I do not know what to do.


Second thing that I'd like to ask is what's the meaning of being a female/male? I cannot define the concept really well, in fact, I barely can define those concepts. What does it mean to be a female? And a male? I've tried, probably not enough, and I couldn't make any conclusion.

Pd: I was born male."
MaybeAngela,asktransgender,Blood Test Results???,"So I have a pretty good physician whom I trust but I would like to get some feed back about my three month blood test results. 

I had been taking 4mg Estrofem (sublingually) and 200mg Spiro. Both meds where split up in AM and PM doses. 2mg Estrofem and 100mg Spiro in the AM and then again twelve hours later in the PM. My blood was drawn at 11:00 AM and I had skipped my AM dose of ""E"", so my last dose of ""E"" was fifteen hours before my blood was drawn. 

Total ""T"" was 25 ng/dL and ""Estradiol"" was 42 pg/mL. Given that my last dose of ""E"" was 14-15 hours before my blood was drawn does this low of ""E"" seem reasonable? We switched my meds from those listed previously to 200 mg Spiro per day split up AM and PM, and 20 mg Estradiol Valerate IM every two weeks. She said to make a follow up appointment in three months to check my blood work again. How many days after my injection should I be getting my blood drawn? "
Kurzzi,asktransgender,How to start changing voice?,"Aside from surgery, how should I go about changing my voice to be more feminine? Currently I am pre everything but I really want to be able to talk to my friends online without having to hide behind a cheap voice changing program. I've done some research and I haven't found any professionals for voice feminization within my area.

Since i am a little kid, i wanted to be a woman. Wanted to be a called a woman. I am always a woman in my dreams, and whenever i fantasize, like, what would i change and who would i be, i am a girl. But i am not sure if this is what being born the wrong gender is. I am not sure how i feel, i don't know what i want, how to feel.

I am a bi guy and i am reletively happy. I have depression, it comes and goes. But other then that, i don't have issues with myself. I am confident etc. 

But i always find myself wishing, wish to start over as a girl. Born as a girl. I don't know.. I don't know anything. I never let myself think about this before. I just don't know. "

Lucycynthiathrowaway,asktransgender,I told the guy I've been texting that I was trans - WHAT DO I DO?,"So I'm 18 and I'm a trans girl. I've been on hormone therapy for a few years now. For the past few weeks, I've been snap chatting this cis guy I met on tinder. We were both looking for NSA fun. Well, we arranged a time and date to meet up. I decided to tell him I'm trans. He thought I was joking and then appeared to lose interest in me. I was telling him how it doesn't matter that I have a dick because I usually tuck it with a gaffe and tape during sex. Then he asked to see a pic of my penis (which was weird) and then he changed his mind about seeing it. He kept changing his mind about continuing talking to me. He said he couldn't have sex with me because it would seem gay to him. I told him it wouldn't be gay because I'm a hetero girl, etc. 
He said there was no point in continuing to talk because we were only talking for sex, and now it was off the table. 

The reason I'm posting this is because he did keep changing his mind, which implies that a part of him is still interested and can see past the fact I'm trans. My question is, is there any way I can convince him to keep talking to me? How can I tip him over the edge of doubt and denial? Thanks. 

EDIT: I was thinking that when he asked to see my penis, he might be bi or curious/questioning :p"
LastDamnResort,asktransgender,Struggling knowing I don't pass all the time,"So I'm struggling. A lot.

I had Full FFS with one of the top guys for FFS in the world 6 weeks ago. I have spent 5 years on hormones. The kicker is that I got treatment at 17. It feels like a slap in the face that I'm worse off than someone in their 40s.

I pass generally now. And that's great. But when there's light shining down on my face, I'm still very disproportionate, my browline is still way over the top large.

I don't really know what to do. I have spent 12 years of my life desperate to fix the problem. I went through grueling surgery, and here I am. "

The day before at 6PM, leaving a 24 hour wait before previous dose and blood test? Or should I take it an hour before the test? If not, when? I'm just wondering."
alyzb,asktransgender,Becoming more comfortable with gender blurred features?,"Would love to hear some suggestions and techniques for getting myself more used to androgyny or gender blurring features?

I have features that are distinctly male, and I will likely be stuck with them a long time if not forever.

My body and appearance do not match my spirit. And that's something I want to come to better terms with. Instead of being disgusted with features that make it obvious im not cis female, Id like to work on finding these features about myself beautiful in their own way, beautiful because they're me.

I think I have a deep seated aversion to gender non conformance because of how I was raised and the culture I was raised in. 

So how do I work on changing my perspective? I know that I have the potential to be a gorgeous woman with a little work, and maybe I'll never pass but I want to be ok with that. 

I know there are and will be people out there who will find me absolutely stunning. I would most of all like to be one of those people.

Thanks!"

##Some tips for working on your voice:

* Stay out of falsetto! Falsetto is only useful in finding your head voice, it's not a very good place to go for finding a voice to speak in. Falsetto is the vocal range above your normal vocal range, and you should feel a ""break"" in your voice as you transition from your normal vocal range up into falsetto
* Work on your resonance! You should feel no vibrations in your chest when speaking. The target you're looking for is your ""head voice""
* To find your head voice, try pushing your larynx (the thing your adam's apple is attached to) up as far as you can, and attempt to ""throw"" your voice out of the top of your throat instead of your chest. You should feel vibrations in your mouth, teeth, upper throat and maybe even your nose when you're doing it correctly
* Once you get your head voice, take your guy voice up into head voice and you should get something that starts to sound female.
* Talk to yourself in your female voice when no one else is around, so you can build up muscle memory

##How to rate others' voices

If you don't know the vocabulary to describe what someone is doing wrong, feel free to simply state how close you think they are to passing. Please be honest and respectful, and don't tell someone they pass when you know they don't so that they don't end up using the wrong voice techniques. There's nothing worse than building confidence in a non-passing voice and then realizing it doesn't pass later on and you wasted your time.

If you are going to post your own voice clip, please help others with their voices as well! The best way to make this a useful thread is for everyone to pitch in :)

However, when I get close to going further I always think about my male self and I fear that I am intentionally forgetting about this side of me in order to transition. I love working out and being strong, I love getting my hands dirty, and I'm not very dysphoric about my body.

The problem is whenever I see women I either want to be them or get involved with them. I find myself looking at fitness models now and getting extremely jelouse of how they get to work out in those cute outfits. How do I move one without forgetting my masculinity?"
-Happy_Little_Trees-,asktransgender,"Hey there, I'm new here and need help fitting in! Mind lending a helping hand?","Hey there, I'm Chris!
Yesterday I decided (discovered perhaps?) that I am a transsexual. I suppose it's always just lurked deep down there, waiting for a chance to bubble to the top- and yesterday was the day when it popped.

Before I go on- allow me to tell you about myself. This is my first Reddit thread and I'm very new to Reddit, in general- so any tips would be awesome! I've been bisexual since I was 15 (18 now, or nearly so), but I was only 'active' in the community for about a month or so. Since then, it's been laid back. I've had a few Trans friends in the past, despicable, untrustworthy people, that shoved me deep into the closet. (Not because they were Trans, of course!)

Since then, I haven't desired to null over my feelings- what with school, military college and that whole process etc. But I found myself on vacation this week and it hit me that I was a girl. (Oh man, that sounds really weird saying it for the first time! Cringeworthy, nearly!)

I was lying in bed thinking about who I am and who I want to be and somehow the thought came in, and the more I thought about it, the more amicable it became.

I know very little about being Trans other than the fact that I want to be a girl. If you could all describe yourselves a bit- how you realized, your reaction, SRS and anything you think I should know, that'd be immensely helpful!

(Just so you all know- I'm still very deep in the closet and have no intention of ever coming out. Talk about that, too, if you'd like!)

Thanks all, it means a lot!"

n8_da_g8,asktransgender,"I came out to my father today, and the results were...","Amazing, I'm still in shock over how well this went. I planned on doing it today (I made a post about coming out earlier in the week) I called him and he was able to tell something was up, he asked and I simply couldn't tell him over the phone, he came to visit me at my college to give me some money and food.

After he came and we talked for a little bit he finally asked what was up. I pretty much broke into tears afterwards in fear of him disapproving of what I was going to say. As I was crying, I told him I didn't want him to ""disapprove"" of what I was going to tell him and he seemed very confused by what was going on. He said ""I'll always love you no matter what, you'll always be my son""

And after gathering my courage, 30 seconds later I said ""That's the problem, I don't see myself as your son, I don't see myself as a guy"" And then everything clicked together like a lock opening.

He wasn't even mad at all, he first asked me if I was interested in men, which I said no. Then I told him I didn't want him to kick me out of the house for coming out to him, to then he said ""I'll always love you no matter what"" and then he hugged me and I cried for like a minute straight.

He then asked me what I wanted to do, and I told him I wanted to transition, I wanted to live full time as a woman. I told him about a place that I needed help traveling to that can get me on hormones. He said he was going to  try his best and get me there.

I told him not to tell my mom yet, and he agreed not to as i wanted to tell her myself. Overall he was extremely supportive of what I told him, completely opposite of what I was expecting (I was expecting my life to end :/)

So yeah, I'm sure not everyone is in the same situation but if you're worrying about coming out to your parents and potentially ruining the relationship between yourself and your parents. I would go for it, I felt as if I had no other choice but to come out to my dad. I feel like I just knocked down a wall and I am extremely motivated now.

[deleted],asktransgender,Bovine Ovary Supplements in addition to HRT?,"I'm mtf and have been on hormones for about a year and a half. I talked to another trans sister recently who said she takes bovine ovary supplements instead of traditional hormones, which prompted me to search the internet, but I couldn't really find anything.

From what I gather, the main use of them is for breast growth, which would be great because, well, boobs are nice. They work by stimulating the pituitary gland as opposed to just adding more estrogen into the mix. I've also read about pueraria mirifica, which has phytoestrogens, but I'm not looking to throw more estrogen into the mix (my levels are fine).

I was just wondering if any other trans women out there had any experience of knowledge about them. They definitely don't seem to be one of those ""natural breast enhancement"" scams, and they're really cheap.

Edit: I'm looking for helpful comments from people who have experience with things like this..."
noelle91,asktransgender,"On cyproterone for about 3 weeks, any chance that I will be fertile again if I stop my AAs?","Me and my gf were discussing having kids right after I started HRT (prognyova and cyproterone) and genetic kids were desired. After 3 weeks, I checked the plumbing down there and all I got was a clear liquid.

So it's not really a big deal, but I'm willing to hold off on AAs for a few months as there has been anecdotal evidence of recovering fertility. To my knowledge, sperm takes 72 days to mature, so I'll wait till then at the very least.

jean_x,asktransgender,Help living as birth gender?,"Hey reddit,

This post is giving me a bit of anxiety because this is a very personal issue, as I'm sure many of you can relate. I have been wanting to experience life as the opposite gender as long as I can remember. Unfortunately I've never told a soul about this and enjoy my life as a seemly average male just enough. While I may have a overwhelmingly strong desire to be a female I don't have much desire to live outwardly as a trans individual for a multitude of reasons.

So with that quick synopsis I'd like to ask: Is there anyone else out there in the same boat? If so how do you cope? Therapy, confiding in others, medication? Is there anything out there in terms of treatments that has you excited? (short of downloading our brains into new bodies .. heh) 

Thanks everyone"

Alitagraham,asktransgender,Mom issues. Trying to explain trans things to her and she continues to divert from the topic every single time. How do I keep her on the topic and keep her listening to me explain it to her?,"So a little background: I have been on and off trying to explain my confusing mess that is my gender for about a two years now. I have begun to notice a pattern of her diverting the conversation to be about her every time. Its like she is scared so she doesn't want to talk about it? 
A few days ago she was dropping me off somewhere and in the car, we had a heated conversation about it. She basically tried to explain my reasons for buying clothes in the men's department by saying something to the extent of, ""oh I was looking for something for your stepdad and found a size small sweater misplaced in his sizing area. I liked the color and thought it was soft so I bought it and I really like it. I can see why you like men's clothes, the quality is so much better, etc.""
No, I explained this to you already, I think you were not listening or missed the boat. (and I just told her the whole ""you are missing the boat"").
I again tried to explain to her that I am not a woman and hope that it brought her to put two and two together. 
Instead she proceeded to state the absolute bullshit that made me so sick that day, ""You were born to me a girl and you will always be my daughter"" (actually I am still sick about it, serious nausea the whole day and occasional nausea the days following to the present).
At that point I told her no I am not again. She proceeded with ""no one is going to see you as anything but a woman""
At that point I held in some angry noise, grabbed my stuff, and slammed the car door shut. 

The weirdest thing about this whole thing is she is some how ok with my therapists referring my to a gender therapist. I wonder if she's thinking that I am confused and the gender therapist will somehow ""fix it"".

Note that I live with her. In the same house.

ryannefromTX,asktransgender,Why do I keep doing this to myself?,"So I went back (in girlmode) to the only lesbian bar in Dallas.  This is supposed THE queer-friendliest place in the metroplex and the one place I can go as myself, right?  And in the bathroom, on the way out, some girl goes, ""Aw shit, they let guys in here now?""

This is AFTER I go to Walmart to try clothes on, and the guy at the dressing rooms first tries to show me to the Men's dressing rooms before looking at me, shrugging, and opening the one gender-neutral dressing room.

And it was only a few weeks ago I got to hear some douchebro behind me snicker at me and go ""Is that a guy?""

I've only been doing girlmode on and off for, like, three months now.  I've only done it, like, 10 times total.  And every time I do it, I end up feeling miserable, either because I realize I'll never be able to fit in with cis women, or because someone says shit to me.  I mean, fuck, I can ALMOST tolerate when I'm walking by and people suddenly stop talking, look up and stare or pull their kids closer.  

I'm trans as hell.  I desperately want to be a woman.  But I don't know if I can handle being someone with a lumberjack build who is OBVIOUSLY AMAB and will always be seen by society as a man in makeup and ill-fitting clothes.

Really, every time I try to be a girl I end up miserable.  And if I can't be happy as a man and I can't be happy as a woman, that doesn't leave me many options.  Maybe I SHOULD die and hope for reincarnation."
Sannu91,asktransgender,My dad just doesn't get it and is making me doubt myself,"I had a talk with my dad again, about me being transgender and about SRS. He does't get why i can't just go back to living as a guy. He also says i'll be throwing my future away by getting SRS for ""temporary happyness"". He always compares my transition to material things, like him wanting a sports car, which would make him happy, but he can't afford it without a loan and "" risking his future"".

The talk ended when he told me i just wanted to show off, because of my long nails and red hair. He also said that i'm too tall (181cm) and that i don't have a feminine body and have small boobs. I just walked out at that point.

I'm supposed to get SRS this summer, but he's making medoubt again. Maybe i am deluding myself into thinking i'm transgender and maybe i should go back.

exhaustfans,asktransgender,Your thoughts on the 'T' in 'LGBT'?,"The initialism 'LGBT', consists of 3 terms for sexual identity, and 1 term used for gender identity.

My wife has tossed around the idea that the 'T', really should not be a part of this initialism.

You see, the idea is that people tend to confuse 'Transgender' issues, with 'Sexual Identity' issues.
Part of the reasoning for this might be because, we put all 4 of these terms together into one abbreviation.

Is the 'T' in 'LGBT', misplaced? Should these issues, be part of the same coin?"

My father took pride in passing down his name to a new generation.

My grandfather died before I was born, and my dad died when I was 13.

A while back, after he had passed, we had a housefire, and had I lost almost everything. Almost everything in my room was either damaged beyond repair, or buried in soot and lost. All I have left of my dad (in my possession, at least) is a weathered coat, a rusted revolver, and his name.

The one thing that hurts the most from being trans isn't even the dysphoria itself. It's just the thought of giving up this name; Losing a part of what I have left of my dad. 

It's not an androgynous name, nor can it be feminized. I've looked.

I'd bring this up with a therapist, but my mom won't stick to one. I've been to 3 so far.

Amethyst_Julie,asktransgender,Tucking.,"I have questions and potentially helpful tips on tucking. So you're a MtF transgender, but you havent had surgery, or potentially havent even started HRT yet (like me) if at all. Tucking your ding-dong will give you a more feminine look. I have a question first off; How exactly do I tuck the testes into the sockets and how to I pop them back out? I dont want to end up hurting myself. For the tip; what I've been doing (and would be more effective if I tucked the testes also) is really simple and pain-free (relatively). So I personally have a small penis, hoorah for me :D, and If you do too, or even if you dont, this might work for you :). Grab a pair of women's underwear. I would suggest something that has a bit of underwear underneath, so most thongs or g-strings wont work. I wear bikini-style, but boyshorts and other kinds like that will work. Now what you're gonna want to do is sort of bend over so that your 'ding dong' is pointing towards the ground. If you're fully erect, wait for it to die down. If you're semi-hard, push it down gently with your fingers and slide the panties on so that your penis is pulled back somewhat inbetween your legs. Now get a pair of spandex, tights, or shapewear that is tight in the crotch-area. Put those on, and do your best to get rid of the bulge. This works very well for me, and I would love to hear what works for you, and an answer to my question above would be lovely! :D (This method is also great cause I dont use any tape of any sorts) Good luck to all of you in your tucking experiences! &lt;3"

throwaway42zzz,asktransgender,(Bit NSFW &amp; probably TW) How do i stop being paralyzed with fear and feeling hopeless &amp; conflicted,"Throwaway because i'm a coward, i guess ; this is going to be a huge vent about my life, TW because of extreme depression i guess. That's probably not going to be funny to read, haven't slept in a long time and can't bring myself to go to sleep. Apologies for the pointless wall of text and if i unwillingly offend anyone here with a few things, I just needed to throw this out. **Question and TL;DR at the end**.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm extremely depressed, to the point that i constantly wish to die. Don't worry though, i won't do such a thing, at least in the near future. I don't want to destroy the few people that care about me. Yes, i should see a therapist ; but i can't even function enough to pick up the phone when someone calls me because of huge dysphoria &amp; social anxiety.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Some background here. This is probably going to be boring to read though, scroll down if you cba reading this. Anyway i'm MTF, 20, living in France where everything about transgender care is really far behind and the little people know is pretty much only the drag scene ; and FTM people are completely invisible here.

I've never been a masculine person. Never liked sports, not even working out. I've never been assertive in any way ; i was always following groups of ""friends"" until my second year in high school, as the silent and geeky piece of flesh that you'd even forget its existence.

My struggle with gender goes back as far as 7 years old. I don't remember much about what i was thinking about it at the time, but i was fascinated about the female body. I started looking about porn at that time, mostly without any male person involved. This wasn't even sexual i guess, i didn't start masturbating until i was 11 years old. I don't even know. I wasn't feeling particularly down at the time either.

Fast forward to middle school, where i was growing my hair (just out of random desire) ; i was getting gendered female most of the time and bullied for being that ""faggy egghead"" not doing anything but playing video games. I haven't been beaten or anything of the sort, but I remember being spit on after a sports class by the guys ; and my at the time """"""best friend"""""" who didn't want to get bullied with me. This is about when i started having thoughts like ""i wish i was a girl, they have it so easy"" (obviously now i know this is not true, that was just 13 years old me). Someone took my defense and alerted the teachers, and the bullying stopped. Anyway, month by month, this thought grew in my mind to the point where i was crying in bed wishing i would wake up as a girl. I prayed and i prayed, even though i'm an atheist. This wasn't constant though ; i was feeling highly apathetic most of the time but the direct thought of gender was actually pretty rare.

&amp;nbsp;

I remember noticing tiny breast buds during my puberty, and this freaked me out at first. I thought I wasn't a real guy and people would start noticing it because my breasts would grow. I shortly believed i was intersex (never tested it though) for this reason. But then, a few months after, i remember hearing about puberty blockers. I thought ""maybe i could do this?"" and then ""...but why would I?"" ""people would think i'm a freak if i tell anyone about this"". I don't remember exactly when this was ; i'm pretty sure it was actually when i started getting bullied in school.

In high school, I got friends, built myself a nice cis-straight-transmisogynistic mask, all went well ; i even got to have the first and only girlfriend i ever had... For 12 hours. I felt extremely lonely, so i put my depression on that. Thoughts about gender kept coming, although still sparsely ; i looked up transgender timelines on the internet a few times, and i admired them. I told myself that i'd never find the courage to do this if i was transgender, then ""oh wait i'm not! i just want to be a girl, that's it!""... Right.

&amp;nbsp;

I swore i'd never tell anyone about this ; i told myself this was the ultimate fail of the male-centered society and i should never ever get this out or i'd be made fun of for the rest of my life. I didn't even know about HRT and as a good french i thought the only option was to be on puberty blockers since teenage, get some breast augmentation and a little of make-up, and that passing was only for the extremely lucky. So i tried to brush this off. Got long phases of denial with short outbursts, finally accepting that i was ""a girl in a man's body"". Then sealing it deep again. **I never crossdressed**, and don't want to. There was this one time at a party where some guys found dresses and thought it'd be funny to try them out for fun. I held... 10 seconds. This remembered me that i'm just a man in a dress, and triggered a huge wave of dysphoria.

This cycle of denial lasted from middle of high school to last June. Until then, i always hated being gendered female. I wanted to tell them ""Can't you see i'm a guy?"", so **this is part of my reasons for doubting a little**. Anyway, as a huge player of MMOs and particularly FFXIV, i met a girl there that ultimately told me she was transgender but not planning to transition. She linked me to /r/transtimelines and this sub, and that's when i realized that this was all i wanted during all these years. Came out to closest friends, all went well. But my coming out with my family didn't go so well ; my father has ""no doubt about it, [i'm] not trans"" and my mother keeps telling me it's either her fault or some oedipus complex bullshit (yeah they're both psychologists), but then she helped me get into contact with my city's LGBT center, so there's that.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Okay, pointless wall of text ends here. Now to the actual question. This will still be a bit long, TL;DR below**

In France there is almost no such thing as informed consent clinics ; in fact there is not a single official law about HRT. Endocrinologists usually (read ""all but a very few"") ask for a letter from a psychiatrist, with none of them being specialized in gender (again non-AGP teachings about gender for therapists are non-existent in France). I contacted my city's LGBT center and they gave me the number of an endocrinologist much like informed consent clinics ; the thing is she's very far away from where i live and apparently only accepts stereotypical trans women, at least living part-time. I can't do this, though. I'm really scared of not passing ; i want to be a woman, not a man in a dress, and that's what dressing makes me feel like. (I do have decently high chances of passing with HRT but quite not without)

Now, i could go the ""usual"" way and go with a psychiatrist, i got the number of one who seems to have a decent history with trans people. The thing is I have to go abroad in a few months for a year, but this one asks for a 6-month long therapy and i don't want to wait until i return to start this.

&amp;nbsp;

As i said, i'm extremely afraid of being seen as a ""man in a dress"" ; that goes for my friends who already know me as well. I'm so scared they'll still view me as a man or a ""woman faking it"" that i can't bring myself to make this call. It all feels so hopeless. I'll never get my period, i'll never bear a child, i'll have to do some intense dysphoria-triggering voice training and some surgeries to be able to feel anything else than despair for once. Also with the fact that i might be delusional and regret it later. Never crossdressed, don't really feel it would be a good idea for me, and actually hated getting gendered female before i came out to myself. Can anyone relate to this?

&amp;nbsp;

I can't even get out of my bed to make myself something to eat, or pick up the phone when it rings. My flat is a fucking mess and i can barely walk in it ; the only thing i can do is playing female characters on MMORPGs. How can i find the courage to actually set things in motion?

This all feels hopeless. I don't know how much time i'll be able to keep myself living. Thank you for reading all of this if you did, i guess.

Why is it so unfair? Why do we have to suffer this bullshit? Why don't i exist as a girl? Why do i even exist in the first place?

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:** How do i stop being paralyzed with fear and feeling hopeless &amp; conflicted? No, seriously, at least please read the few paragraphs above about the question.

EDIT: Forgot to say that my dysphoria is almost exclusively about my body, but i do feel euphoria when imagining people referring to me as female."
scratchandthrowaway,asktransgender,Transfemme sexually attracted to binary-transfemale partner as an andro male; I don't want to hurt her... X-post from r/mypartneristrans/ [NSFW],"TW: Honest opinions about sexuality and a references to sex abuse

I love this girl. Let's call her ""X""

This may be as much about the conflicts of my own sexual identity as with her physical appearance. We've been together for about 6 months, we were poli before and went mono a few months ago. When we met, I was attracted to her as a girl. I get very involved intellectually and emotionally with someone if we hit it off at first.

At first, I was dating another girl and we were in an open relationship (we'd add others to the pile), but X wasn't attracted to this minor character, so we kept our relationship to cuddling and some fully clothed kinky. I started to want them more and more, eventually I couldn't ignore her. I got the go to see her as a separate relationship.

I was fascinated by her. Her mind and opinions and view of the world touched something in me. She made me smile and laugh like no one else. Our sardonia resonated and our shared history as wounded femmes made me feel whole, like I could finally relate to another human. We both liked getting high, literature, science,drinking and following politics. The relationship reminded me of relationships I've had with women far more than men.

~~[Shaking and crying while I write this.]~~

During this time, I had an HIV scare and we didn't have penetrative sex until several months later. She didn't feel totally comfortable with being the recipient, but oral sex from her was unlike with any other.

Sex has always been overwhelmingly traumatic for me. It's psychosomatically painful and despite being an adult now, I'm still haunted by being raped as a child. With her, I'm at peace and experience pleasure. She's the first person which I've had sex regularly with since getting my orchi, which made me feeling much-much freer. I've still never orgasmed during sex as an adult and I fear that if I do, I'd have a massive mental breakdown. I was almost able to orgasm during sex with her the other day and I keep ruminating on the concept that we were having, ""gay sex"" and so in lies the problem.

We tease each other verse, but generally until we're actually going at it, I'm the more feminine party. She's taller than me, her hands are larger and she has short hair. She's been on HRT for about a year (I've been full time for 4), but when I'm in the ecstacy of our intercourse, I can't help but seeing a masculine form - one to which I'm extremely attracted. She's said she loves the way I look at her when we're in the heat. She's even opened her boundaries and felt comfortable topping me. There's a chemistry here I can't put down.

Inhibition drops away and I feel a creature inside of me come to life. Something masculine and truer to self, hidden for so many years under the view of abuse. It wasn't male, but the fixation in bed that we were men, somehow seems to resound. I've been with other transgirls, several, some far more passing and other less so. With X, I feel that I'm bringing out something deeper than superficial physical engagement, something that I can't ignore

If you need a direct questing to answer, ""how can I sexually engage with a partner that I please, knowing that I'm seeing them as the person they wish to dissociate from?""

Though, I seek the thoughts of others as foil to my own. Comment as you please~

continuityOfficer,asktransgender,"So im pretty sure my parents know, but confrontation is hard... (alternate title: GAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!)","Lets start this by explaining something about me. I've always been bad at telling my parents what's wrong, I am horrible at confrontation at all really, its strange, because other then problems, and other then specifically my parents, I'm one of the more open-books I know, but the problem still stands, I cant talk to them about things. Most the times when I would get angry at something, I would end up leaving and pacing and hoping they would confront me, but rarely does that ever work...

The other way I deal with things however, is through an act of giving cryptic clues to what's wrong. I do them in overly cryptic ways as to make it seemingly impossible to guess, but the system of these clues is designed so that over time people will eventually find out simply by shear force or clues, or by me making a mistake and doing something more obvious then I intended. Well this is what I did with the whole me desperately wanting to be a girl thing.

About 4 or so months ago, I posted on this Sub-Reddit under a dump account /u/definingTrait, there I tacked whether I was trans, and soon after came to realization that yeah, I definitely am, and as time went on became more and more aware of how almost annoyingly obvious it is from my current perspective that I was given my actions (which to be fair, many of which I didn't really remember at the time).

At that point, I decided that what I needed to do was slowly expand the group of people that know I am trans. So first I told a close friend that goes to a different school, then I needed to tell the closest person to a friend at my school I had, and that is my sister. Problem was of course, that I suck, so I couldn't just tell her, and instead I had to do the cryptic thing. My hope was to have things expand so that my sister knew, we could talk about it in secret, she could help me, etc. But the problem came when she eventually figured it out.

When she did, she didnt want to say it out of fear that it was wrong, so worst case scenario happened and she asked me to just tell her because she knows what it is, but I (as stated previous) suck at confrontation, so despite my internal screaming to do it, my external body did not, and used my trademarked sarcasm to try and write it off.

So, at this point, my goal was the build up courage and create an appropriate time to tell her. But... then the real problem came.

She told my mum. This was about a month and a half ago now, and when she did, the real worst case scenario happened, because things where opening up WAY more quickly then I prepared for. My mum tried to confront me, but counter intuitively to my entire goal I would run away. I had not built up the emotional ability to do this at the moment, and my mum always choses the worst times, with no build up, she would just bring it up, things like 'so do you want is to buy you a new wardrobe' or 'do you want to change your name', which while I know is supportive is just done with horrible timing and no build up. 

This has put us in an incredibly awkward stalemate, where now she seems to have stopped completely thinking I don't want to talk about it, and me being the person that's horrible and confrontation that I am.

I am filled with fears of awkward moments, or of simple disputes, or of catching her ofguard in the wrong way. Despite her being supportive, I am incredibly of those 'oh, but dont do anything that COULD BE PERMANENT, because you MIGHT CHANGE YOUR MIND' things that I feel like i've seen hinted from in the couple of times shes brought things up, but at the same time, i'm probably just using something small to create an internal fear.

Point is, I really want to come out soon, I mean, I know the younger the better, and also, since despite my age im going to university next year, I would really REALLY love if I could have it so that the people there would have only ever known me as a girl or atleast as always being known as trans, rather then being naturally buckled down to my past-self. So by the end of the year, I want to be out to everyone, the world even. So I need to do my family soon. I have no idea what i'm going to do about my brothers and father, but right now I need to tell my mother, since she already knows, and I am getting increasingly frustrated.

Writing through text like I did this post is easier, so maybe its a good idea to email her and add explicidly that I am uncomfortable to talk about it IRL for now, and to keep it to the email, and also that im probably not going to respond to the email anywhere near immediately due to me probably having to build to courage again. But I don't know...

**TL:DR:** My mum knows im trans, I want to tell her, but since i'm horrible at confrontation I can't.

What do I do?"

goth_kitty,asktransgender,dating advice needed please :),"First off I'm a bi mtf chick. Been on hormones for two years and apparently have started passing.

So I recently decided to join okcupid and at first I was hidden to straight guys. Nothing much happened so I decided to change my profile so that straight guys could see it. I did have my trans status up there but took it off after I saw I was getting alot of views and even messages. I felt really uncomfortable that many guys knowing. 

Anyway the messages have flooded in, which is nice dont get me wrong and totally unexpected. However how do I proceed with the guys i would actually want to meet. I have never really dated before. Also I got a date tonight. I told him Im mtf but he says he doesnt mind. How can i be sure that the only reason he wants to see me isnt for the trans experiment phase while he is still at uni? 

I guess this could just be the date nerves kicking in but it is hella scary 

Edit - I will take your advice on board in the future. Thanks for responding. Date went well. We got on really well, so hopefully something comes out of it "

So after skimming people talked about resonance not being affected by the surgery. What exactly do they mean? Are there soundclip examples of with and without ""male"" resonance or any other helpful explanation, because I have not yet begun my mtf voice therapy so I don't know many terms.

Finally are there any good clips of fully transitioned mtf women who 1000% pass for cis women, mostly want audio for voice but video is ok, to serve as encouragement?

SuperDesk75,asktransgender,Is there a universal secret signal for acknowledging other trans/GNC people out in the wild?,"Whenever I see another trans/GNC person on the bus or something, I always feel like I want to catch their eye and give them a little...what - a wink and some finger guns? Something that communicates, ""Yeah I see your awesome self over there and we're in the club together! You go, girl/boy/other!""

I'm mostly kidding. But I guess, being so early in my own transition, I would love for another trans person to recognize me because nobody else does. Most people just gender me as a fashion-fwd stylish dude. (One of the problems with living in a very accepting and progressive area I suppose.) But does somebody who is more established in their transition even want to get clocked by other trans people? I would guess not.

motadoe,asktransgender,Do you prefer being stealth or out to people? (mostly concerning those who already pass)(extra interest regarding NB people),"Heyo! So, I'm 20 years old and started studying last fall. I've had HRT for over a year now, so I pass fairly easily, and while I RARELY (like almost never) get mistaken for a girl anymore, nobody ever questions my gender/sex. It was a very nice change of pace to not have to explain and defend myself all the time, and while I definitely feel uncomfortable being seen as girl, I weirdly also have my qualms with being seen as cis-guy. (I'm also still wondering whether I'm full on male or simply transmasculine.)

I really enjoy talking about the topic. I do see myself detached from cis dudes in some way. I again feel like I'm pretending a bit, pretty much, so I often have the urge to out myself and especially educate people on the topic. On the other hand, that might spread among students and not everybody is supportive. It sucks. And the Cisnormativity a lot of students express can be super annoying to me.


So, to people who also at least mostly pass - how do you handle this? Are you content being seen as cisgender? Is being trans something you put behind you, or is it still a big part of you? I'd also love to hear how non-binary people deal with this, as I might be transmac nonbinary. (shit's difficult man)"

isleeplikeacat,asktransgender,How do you go back to living? (post SRS and everything),"The last 12 months have been tough. My transition is over, except maybe some minor fixes. I pass, I don't raise any eyebrow. Nobody questions my gender, not even myself after SRS! But I find it difficult to go back to living normally after being concentrated on traveling to get surgery.

Dilation is eating a lot of my time, but it seems to be also putting a dent in my motivation. Like, I haven't had time to shave for 3 months (I did a leg yesterday, I have the other one to do!) or paint my nails for like 1 month and a half. I'm not super motivated at work, I just go there to get the money.

If I have some free time, I play with my cats and sip a tea. It's fun but not really productive. My transition is done and behind me, but I read this reddit to try to give a hand like how people helped me before.

I know about post surgery blues, and it seems to be a good case of it, but how do I break out of that?

My birthday is coming soon and I guess I also feel bad because of the time passing. Before I thought I wouldn't live to 40 due to how my health was following a bad accident, and I didn't care much. I spent years between hospitals and surgeries, recovering. I did drugs, alcohol and smoked, just to survive the physical and moral pain, in the hope of a better future. I did jobs I hated, to get the money I needed. Living 10 years of a good life, burning the candle on both ends, looked like a bright idea. Now it doesn't. I want to live, but I am uncertain on how.

The settlement left me just enough money to pay for my transition (on the cheap alas, but hey I won't complain) and move to north america. It's great, but it also created a big void in my life. I'm almost 40 and I'm just starting to live. I have the emotions and experience I had about 15 years ago, before life caught me. I'm not a responsible adult, I can barely take care of myself. Sucks to look like one. Sometimes I feel like I have been in jail for that long, and I'm lost in how the world has changed, while I haven't. 

Maybe now that I am given the opportunity of living in decent health and in my gender, something I didn't have before, I freak out? Because I haven't really lived before? I was hoping for a better future, and now I have my life in my hands I don't know what to do?

Also, my best friend is visiting and he's got a good and stable job. I don't. And it makes me feel bad. Not that I'm comparing, but I wish I had had that easy. Sometimes I think about the Matrix movie, and how one of the bad guys ask agent smith to have his memory fully erased to have a new life, and how ""ignorance is bliss"". I couldn't understand that before. Now I do, and that freaks me out.

TLDR: I feel like I've been left behind by life. How do I start living now?"

allUsernames-Taken,asktransgender,Gender neutral fashion advice,"Firstly, I'm sorry but I am not trans or questioning. This seems to be the most active subreddit for gender so I hope it won't be an inappropriate place to post this.
  
  &amp;nbsp;
  
  Some background, I am biologically female, small (&lt;1.55m), flat-chested, so I've been mistaken for a (young) boy when I cut my hair short. I consider myself genderfluid. I feel like a male, to agender/gender neutral, to female. I feel male or agender most of the time, and female on few occasions, so I have no desire to transition.
  
  &amp;nbsp;
  
  Being small and skinny, I tend to look a lot younger than my actual age. I've posted on r/twoxchromosomes before asking for advice on how to look older, but the advice I got were how to look older in female clothing (which was to be expected). Honestly, the thought of having to dress up in very feminine clothing, or having to use female style make up to look older makes me sick, unless I feel female that day.  
  
  &amp;nbsp;
  
  I've tried googling for agender/androgynous casual fashion but I don't find it to be very helpful. The 'helpful' fashion that comes up is exactly the kind I wear (T-shirts, jeans, those stuff), but gives me the original problem - it makes me look like a kid. The only androgynous fashion I know that makes me look more mature is formal wear, but I can't wear that daily. I also live in a country near the equator so it's kind of summer 24/7 all year so wearing any outerwear as fashion is out of the question. Outerwear seems to come out a lot in my google image results. My daily school wear is a t-shirt and non-denim long pants but it doesn't help with looking older.

  This problem is really frustrating :(

sgzqhqr,asktransgender,"Move Soon, Living in a Small City With a Lot of Rude Folks and Nothing to Do, or Finish Transitioning and Move in a Couple Years?","Hi All.

So, I'm going to be graduating college at the end of this calendar year and I'll probably get a job offer at the place I've been working at for these last few years.  I like the work, it pays fairly well, the organization is supportive of my transition, and I like my coworkers, but I don't like living here in this city.  Somehow word spread that I am trans at the college I attend.  (I actually wonder if maybe someone took a picture and posted it to social media -- because people I have never met/seen before whisper and gossip about me on my way to class or from across the room in class, sometimes even out and about in the city, and not very nice things either.  Yet, somehow, they know it would be 'impolite' to say things to my face.)  It is a small city, mostly college students and families; I don't have that many friends here; and there aren't all that many things to do.  All the cities around it, except for it's smaller sister city, are at least a half hour away and even more suburban.  However, the health coverage at my workplace is very good and I would be able to probably have a hysterectomy for free and then phalloplasty for very little money (I looked at their health plans and I estimate $3000 + travel and housing/food exp. during recovery.)  I have a doctor who is trans-friendly and a therapist I had previously seen who could write the ""permission slips"".  If it weren't for the fact that I could potentially finish transitioning and move on with my life for very low cost, I would definitely be looking at moving right after I graduate.  I estimate that it would be two calendar years -- so, the end of 2018 -- by the time I have recovered from phalloplasty and saved up enough to move out of state.  I'll be in my late twenties then, which I know isn't *that* old, but it feels like time is just passing me by.  What I want most is to have bottom surgery and just be able to move on with my life and go somewhere that people won't gossip about me all the time and stare at me all the time and laugh at me as they pass by for just existing.  (I had a situation happen like this in high school -- not for being trans, I looked like a 'normal girl' then, but kids are cruel  -- and, apart from me being depressed otherwise, it effected me enough that I just didn't really show up.  Sure, I'm an adult now, and somewhat stronger, but these people are acting like children and it is really wearing me down).  Somewhere where people will just know me as myself, with more people my age and more diversity and more things to do.  It's not that I'm not passing either -- it's the fault of whoever decided to spread news of my personal life to so many cruel young adults.  I can confidently say that things would be different if I moved.

Sometimes I think about pursuing a different career, too, but I feel like all my transition-related concerns have to be resolved before that; it is too stressful to deal with all these things at one time.  This might be a bonus, however, as I could take courses and chart a path toward a possible career change in the two years I am stuck in this town with not much to do and not a lot of people to hang out with. 

Have you ever been in this situation?  Where you had an opportunity to finish transitioning at a reasonable cost but it required you to stay in a place you can no longer stand?  What would you do?  I appreciate any advice you have.  Thanks."

I'm not sure how to make sections spoilered, so I will mark this NSFW and prematurely mention that there's sections which mentions others being transphobic, and that I have attempted / failed a form of mutilation. There's also a lot of information of my life, but nothing that reveals who I am, my security code, or identity of others (except possibly a psychologist?) and I'd like to also say that I'm not being disrespectful, but frustrated.  
  
I'd like to also excuse myself for any grammatical errors or wrong use of words, please keep that in mind if you find something weird to interpret.  
  
So a life story before we get to the actual thing.  
**TL;DR:** Life sucks, I'm wrong and sinful (gender), I live in constant despair and hide my feelings (in the closet), my psychologist was probably not convinced at all. I'm also a special snowflake Asperger.  
  
So let's start.  
  
**Childhood.**  
  
Everyone said I was the perfect stereotype baby, always quiet and gentle.  
When I grew up, I was the weird kid. A strange mix of Introvert and Extrovert, I were equal friends with the grownups as the age appropriate kids of both genders.  
  
Then it happened, I was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome. This gave me pretty much hell at school because the teachers kept going on with the ""retard"" route with me, I've grown insecure and felt that everything I did was pointless. Short things said, I felt extremely out of place and worthless at this early age of 12.  
  
Before then, I always felt and knew I was completely wrong but I never knew what. When I were 8, somewhere inbetween 1st and 2nd grade, I finally understood the concept of gender in full. Yes - I understood it physically and psychologically. This gave me an epiphany, the huge realization that the wrong thing with me was gender.  
  
I was curious and asked teachers about this, I was real subtle so I wasn't showing any signs but genuine curiosity.  
They were transphobic and homophobes. They said that anyone who isn't feeling like the right gender is a blasphemy and blablabla, and that it's completely wrong to be attracted to the same gender.  
My parents, not being transphobic and homophobes - but they still joke and rant about them, I was told thing by mother such as ""If they were to change gender, they would have to bury and mourn over their son, just to get a daughter."", my father was like ""I know this guy back in my workplace and he chopped his dick off, that idiot. Tries to be a girl.""  
  
So I learned that it's blasphemous, a sin, completely wrong, illegal. This didn't help me at all, so I had to learn to keep a mask on. I was quite depressed, which may have attracted more friends than usual - I had quite a few friends of both genders. I taught myself how to keep a mask on, with the support of friends - although they were all unaware of my problems.  
  
The fact I always felt wrong and continued to feel wrong, out of place, kept breaking my heart apart. Looking back what I said about Aspergers and how teachers gave me hell over it, it made me feel even more out of place and sinful.  
  
All these years because of this childhood, has made me play the role as a Male. One who always hanged out with male friends and played video games.  
  
**The hidden life.** 
  
Video games has helped me an extreme bunch, I've been allowed to isolate with myself with immersion and interactive stories. It became my favorite hobby. I took the next step, going online.  
I started to play online games such as Runescape, World of Warcraft and Neopets. I've gained far, far more friends than ever and I felt genuine comfort as they could be friends without actually knowing my gender. (Obvious due to the reddit username) everyone knew me as Robin, which coincidentally is unisex.  
  
Although I've started to lean more towards a ""dark side"", I felt despair as I realized that these friends might one day figure out who I am and being in the inbetween were not helpful. I slowly started to disappear, rather subtly, to slowly take on a new identity.  
This new identity, were a definitive female. There were no questioning about it, and I've kept that identity for what - 10-12 years? It's been so long that I've forgotten how long it has been. I felt this is the true me and I had to be carefully and social engineer so that I didn't have to share any obligatory pictures / address or avoid meetups, because otherwise I'd be found out.  
  
So now you know, I were the male in real life, female on the internet.  
The female name that I have is Luna, so if anyone on Reddit somehow recognizes me then uhh... Hi.  
  
**Dysphoria.**  
  
The dysphoria has grown so much that I've sometimes been thinking about taking the life. I decided to talk to one of my friends about this, they were transphobic and I lost a good friend. A day later the police came to the door and checked on me, asked about how I was and if everything is fine, that if I were thinking about taking my life.  
I realized what were going on, so I held my mask and played dumb, before mentioning a possible name and that it could just be one of the internet bullies. (example: SWATing), the police understood and left me alone, bullet dodged. Except... my mother snuck on to my computer and checked a few things while I was busy talking to the police and discovered ""I was playing a female"". She didn't ask me about this and let it go to obscurity.  
  
If you wonder, no, I'm not going to actually take my life because I feel there's still a chance of getting the help I need.  
  
My disphoria sometimes spiked so much that I actually just freaked out, an enrage of some sort, trying to rip my male genitalia with all my raw power. Alas, it didn't work and I was left with serious injury. It looked sponge-textured where the holes of the sponge were the red stripes. I held quiet about this and let it grow to health.  
This happened twice, once at 12, once at 16.  
  
I would actually try it more times, but as I became more smart and looked up information, I found out that ripping it off is in fact a really bad idea and it's required for a surgery to get the real thing... That made me stop it completely.  
  
**Out of the closet.**  

Skip ahead several years of internal dysphoria. I outed myself to my mother, at age of above 20. I told her everything, my life struggles, how I truly feel, how life sucks.  
She told my father and he has kinda changed - being a little more impulsive, more caring for me. He seems to understand, but is in the between of acceptance and denial.  
  
With help of parents, I told my doctor, who then got me to visit a psychologist 6 months later.  
This psychologist were understanding, asked me certain questions that helped him get the full picture. After agreeing to some things, he would get me a time at the national hospital.  
Unfortunately, he semi-left the work being there only a few hours a day. We still have our monthly checkup until the new psychologist takes over.  
  
**The visit to the GID Clinic.**  
  
Skip ahead a full year, I finally get a time with the national hospital (Gender Identity Disorder Clinic) and I get to talk to a professional. Yay!  
  
Then it happened : My brain, my mind, realized that this may have been all for nothing. I've been warned multiple times that Norway is one of the worst countries to get the help you need, both from news media and ironically here.  
  
This professional, weren't convinced. Said that Asperger makes this more complicated and requires longer time, meaning that I have a minimum of 3 years before diagnosis and another year for hormones from then on. What the fuck? You extend from the initial 1 year ""female role"" to three, with an additional year for hormones?  
  
I was pointed out that I didn't use makeup and didn't wear feminine. Lack of makeup, there's no excuse - I just didn't do it and that may have been an idea not to do... Wear feminine? I asked more about it and I was told about ""feminine clothing such as dresses, tunica, so on."", I looked at myself - wearing an unisex neutral-colored shirt, female Nirvana pants (that didn't quite fit), half-high heel boots... and figured, nope - that doesn't work either. I truly need the stereotype feminine clothing, when every female friend I know including coworkers, wears more unisex / neutral clothing with short hairstyles and I even have accidentally called some of them a guy by being polite ""Greetings Sir,"" opps, they at least had a laugh of it and nodded understandingly.  
My psychologist also did the whole ""Well I'm not too used to your kin, but if my boss was here, she'd make this far easier. As my boss would say, you need to be more feminine."", ""As my boss would say, you need to play the role of female."", ""as my boss-""... I BET YOUR SENPAI IS GOOD, STOP TAUNTING ME, if that truly were the case then why are they there and not her?  
  
I've also told them that I'm using my hard earned, precious money, that I've been saving on, are being used on expensive Laser so that I can permanently or semi-perma remove my beard and body hair. I told them how extremely painful it is, how many times the body has entered direct panic attacks from stress and pain alone, but I had to do it. I've been there three times now and the pain never got better.  
Nope, this wasn't impressive at all.  
  
I've told them I'm unable to raise the pitch of my voice, only to lower it. My reason was that I've been speaking in a high tone all my life subconsciously and that's why I can't raise it - I'm already at my limit.  
Not impressive, their excuse was that I didn't have an Apple / or that it wasn't visible at all.  
  
I told my lifestory, it wasn't enough. I didn't convince the psychologist. Now I got a new time in May or June.  
Why the hell wasn't this done back home? I live like half the country away god damnit, there was just a few questions that I answered and that was about it. I felt this entire trip was completely wasted.  
I made up my mind and gave them a very subtle ultimatum, in the form of this sentence : ""I don't know how long my sanity can hold. I've held my mask for so long, had this dysphoria for so long and my life just sucks. I don't enjoy it. I think my sanity has a limit of 3 years."" and they shrugged.  
  
The fact that they said the whole ""my boss would / say"" thing made me suspicious, combined with that Asperger were something that made it more complicated. I've said that my Asperger were completely irrelevant to my gender dysphoria. Now I'm suspicious of them : Even with the clothing, makeup and et cetera, would it do anything? My mind keeps going in a loop towards ""No"".  
  
The *only* thing they were actually agreeing with me on is that when they asked if I went to female toilets in public areas and I stated no. They said that I should improve on that, in which I replied that people WILL get aggressive and feel threatened with a possibility of violence if a male goes in a female toilet, transgender or not. It doesn't help that I'm not diagnosed yet so legal issues will bite me should problems rise.  
  
I have also stated that I can change to full-female at anytime, but I don't want to be identified as a Drag-queen which is completely different, that's something that people will remember stuck forever. The conversation ended with that I agreed I should just go fulltime regardless.  
  
*EDIT : I forgot to add this in.*  
They have also asked me to be completely independent to show that I'm capable of going through the process.  
I live with my parents, but that's my choice, because I've decided to stick to the family - what little of it actually remains. The social aid gave me this option to get my own place to live and they pay all the bills, I said no. I also went all the way to Oslo all by myself and I kept saying no to my parents to join with me. I'm capable of making my own choices.  
They said no and that I should live home, spite having an actual ten minutes argument. This offended me greatly.  
  
**Aftermath.**  
  
I'm going to be all ""screw it all"" and start to wear female clothing at all times. I don't care if my boss is transphobic and I get kicked off work or if I offend anyone. Makeup at all times when I meet others.  
Unfortunately I can't raise the pitch of my voice so I can't solve that issue.  
I have decently long hair, but I think I should make it more feminine. I've thought about using that Automatic Babyliss Curling Iron, but every store is sold on it.  
My beard used to grow very aggressively, a full beard in 3 days, but after Laser 3 times it now takes 6 days (1 day for the 5clock to be visible) and I have strange naked lines of no hairs, so with frequent shaving I can almost get away with facial hair not being present.  
  
**Questions.**
  
What should I do? What should I improve or do more of?  
Should I continue this hell, or should I just skip it and go for blackmarket hormones with my doctor to assist in dosages? Would this be a good option for the future should I get outright denied?  
How should I dress up? I like silk texture against my skin, I like to cover most of my body and I like neutral colored clothing, I absolutely dread and hate glitter clothing and those with logos / advertisements.  
How should I go on about my hair? Any advice on that? I like it straight or fluffy, but I plan on having it real long.  
As for makeup, how should I go on about that? I don't think powder is much of a good idea because I kinda touch my face a lot when nervous, which I am frequently.  
  
In general, what should I do, or what more should I do?  
And finally, should I break my hidden life by telling the truth and my life situation? It's been build on for 10-12 years."

------------------------------------------------------------------

I am going to share another story from a another male to female crosssdreamer  with you.  She (or he?) wants to remain anonymous, so I am going to call her Moon.

The moon has become a transgender symbol for me. It is masculine in the Germanic languages and feminine in the Latin once. Furthermore, its shifting phases/faces seems to indicate a more flexible approach to gender.

Moon has been experimenting with hormones, which have had a significant effect on how other people see her. The question is: Should she go all the way?

In this text ""autogynephilia"" [AGP] is used as a synonym for male to female crossdreaming (i.e. a man's arousal from imagining himself having a female body), and not necessarily for the autogynephilia theory per se.

Autogynephiliacs Love Estrogen

By Moon

So what happens when a guy who has spent pretty much his whole life fantasising about being a female takes female hormones? And what if that male person feels that they have always been more transsexual inclined, but feels that there is a driving force behind the feelings of wanting to be female which calls itself autogynephilia. How does he know what he is?

Is he a transsexual who would benefit from transition or a transsexual wanabee with some bizarre condition that mimics the symptoms that makes him feel he is a transsexual? Or is he someone who is making a big deal out of his own little perversion?

That person is me in a nutshell. I want to be as frank as I can be about my own experience with hormones and their effect on me. I have decided to publish this anonymously which is why I have asked Jack to publish this on his own blog. 

Before anyone asks I have been through the counselling process and have come away not really any the wiser as to what I am. My conclusion is that you have to help yourself find out who and what you are, no one is going to tell you. The last period of counselling allowed me to take hormones 'legally' for the first time. Before this I had tried using hormones on my own for short periods.

So why do I feel the need for hormones? Well, the desire for feminisation is very strong indeed and occupies my thoughts and causes me frustration when I face the reality of life. Crossdressing helps with creating a image of a female but it is rather limiting. There is a great need to make it more 'real'. 

 The sexual aspect has always evolved around being identified as a woman in my fantasies. The sexual component seems to be a way of making the fantasy real for a short time. After all there is perhaps no better emotional outlet to use if you can only takes things up to a point. The masturbation allows you to suspend the disbelief for a short while. I have always had the sexual component tied in with my gender thoughts ever since I was a small child. I have been masturbating from first memories too. So I'm not like others who say their sexuality reared its head in their teen years. 

After a few days of starting hormones I felt a great sense of relief, a positive sense of well being and the feeling that I was at last dealing with my problem. I was put on a low dose (Estraderm TTS 50 patches) which I was happy with, as the dose given was making me feel much better in myself. I felt more like me. My therapist told me I was feeling better as my thought patterns were now able to flow freely and be processed better with the introduction of estrogen into my system. It was a sign that my brain wiring was actually feminine. How true this is, is another matter.

The first year continued like this. I felt all round very happy. I felt in control. My fantasies still continued but without the bad feelings of guilt and shame I had always associated with them. I was able to masturbate when I wanted to and it was much more enjoyable too. Orgasm was a little harder to achieve but everything was better.

I was not actually transitioning in the gender role I was still me. I came to the conclusion that the need for a transition was not a priority and that I had found a way of being happy. Why did I need to turn my life upside down and start dressing full time as a female? The idea was there and I would have liked to, but I felt I had to be realistic with what could be achieved. 

From about a year in with hormones I started experiencing odd glances, side ways looks from people when I walked down the street. I began to feel self conscious, very much like what I felt in my teenage years. Why did I receive such looks from strangers? Was I simply imagining it? Was it paranoia? What this reaction made me realise was that I had perhaps started to loose the protective 'testosterone shield' which makes you deal and respond to stress better than females. I was still my everyday male self in my day to day life, although I had grown my hair a lot longer as I felt that the longer hair was more in tune with the person I felt inside.

Up to this point I always believed that to pass as a female I would have to spend an hour or so with make-up and fussing with presentation. I had spent years going to tranny clubs so there was always the association that to be taken as female you have to dress as one and wear makeup. I was still presenting as a male or perhaps as a more relaxed male with longish hair. So I was very surprised that in casual exchanges in shops or markets I was being called madame, or she. 

The first time this happened I could not get over how a person could take me as being a woman and I was presenting as a male. I made no attempt with adjusting my voice or anything like that as I was just being me. This type of situation started to occur more frequently and I made the note that it was non English people who were mistaking me for female. 

As time wore on I say about a half of communications with strangers resulted with them thinking I was female. Sometimes the word 'she, miss, madame' were not used but it would be something else that would give it away. Men would smile at me if I passed them on the street, or the verbal exchange may result in some sort of phrase such as 'Guys can multi-task too, you know', was one reply I had back from a chap who would only say something like this if he thought I was female.

I was just being myself. There was no change in my attitude or mannerisms, yet every now and then it would be made known to me that I was being taken as a female. These were always short exchanges, such as purchasing something in a shop or walking past someone wanting to do a street survey, or charity box holder. Close friends who had not seen me in a while but knew of what I was doing told me how girly I was starting to look. Yet I did not see this woman emerging from myself, she seemed invisible to myself but easily seen by others. I was still me, or was I? 

As I was growing my hair the lady hairdresser I had been going to for some time seemed to automatically give me a female hair style each time I visited. I enjoyed this and worked up to having the full works of hair coloring and highlights on each visit. She would ask me how my 'partner' was, so I guess she thought I had a boyfriend. My sexual attraction had always been for females.

I started to feel as if the train I was on was starting to run a little bit too fast for my liking.Yet I held on and continued as I felt very happy, if a little paranoid.

Orgasm became harder to achieve, but I was able to maintain my pleasure at the cliff edge before falling off, for as long as I wanted to. Sexual experience became much more of a whole body experience, rather than a penis thing. My nipples became a source of masturbation and could have easily replaced what pleasures I had known with my penis, but that still worked and gave me pleasure. 

I was experiencing I guess what I had always wanted to experience. I would also hide my penis away and simply masturbate using by nipples and caressing my body. I would pretend in my mind that I had a vagina and was really a woman, it was wonderful. I also experienced genuine feelings of wanting to be rid of my penis. I had not experienced this before and realised this was my brain's reaction to its sense of what my body was and should be now with the wash of estrogen's within me. Men also became a source of attraction and started to replace the AGP sexuality that I had always known. To really feel like a female - yet this forbidden pleasure that I had so wanted was somewhat scary. 

The thing I wanted and had fantasied about the most was actually happening to me. People were taking me as a female with no effort on my part (I was still dressing as a guy) and I was enjoying a sexuality that was 100 times better than pre hormones. But obtaining this prize did frighten me. I can't explain why or put into words why this was so.

So what did I do? I pulled the plug an stopped taking the hormones at around the two year mark.

A year later many physical and mental traits have remained. I don't get taken as a female day to day anymore. I do not see the difference between myself then and to the way I am now. But people's reaction and response have changed back. I do still get the odd look or second glance but it is not so often now. Part of me is sad at what I have lost, but I treasure the mental bits that have been left within me such as the exposure to a new form of sexuality beyond AGP which in part still remains.

So what about now? - Well I still want to be female and would like to start up again with the hormones, but the fear of the unknown frightens me. Would I be happy or would I be a regretter. So confusing and I still don't have any answers or know what to do."
astrocosm,asktransgender,Confused Male: Do I like women or do I want to BE a woman?,"I'm a guy in my 20s. This has been messing with my mind lately. Ever since I was a kid, I've loved the female body (probably because I saw my mom naked at a very early age - her body still arouses me - weird as that may sound) - I've loved the boobs, the curves, everything.

But lately, I've been getting this strange feeling that is difficult to understand. For example, I'll be watching straight porn and I'll see the girl in it, but anything that happens to the girl, it's as if I feel it in MY body. Like, if I see a girl taking her top off, as I'm watching it, I feel (physically) as if I'M the one who has boobs and I'M the one who's taking MY shirt off. 

It's weird. If the guy for example grabs her thigh, I'll feel something in MY thigh.
Even as far as when a girl is penetrated from behind, I feel something in my OWN ASS. (Even though I used to be able to enjoy the idea of ME penetrating a girl from behind... Again... confusion.)

Now, I admit, I've enjoyed the idea of actually being penetrated myself, but (if I happen to be bisexual), I can't understand for example while I'm watching porn, if I want to FUCK the girl I'm watching, or if I want to BE HER and GET FUCKED, or both..... I'm so confused. 

So this leads me to wonder, could it be that my fascination for the female body is actually that I want to HAVE it ??
I sometimes get turned on at the idea of having breasts - or even momentarily being a woman. But I suppose it's not necessarily a sign of ""trans"" related matters? because of the fact that it is only in terms of sexual AROUSAL? As opposed to ""feeling like I am a woman.""

It's very confusing... Has this happened to anyone?

As a side note, I'm currently going through a confusion about my orientation - can't determine if I'm a straight/gay/or bisexual guy, but that's maybe another topic.

Any help will be appreciated.
Thank you!"
Coribelle,asktransgender,"Well, they know now...","Came out to my dad by letter last night. I had originally planned to go to dinner with him and just let him read it after with me there to answer any questions, but last minute he altered plans and brought along his friend so they could drink. I had to put the letter on his bed before we went out to dinner. 

I talked to him this morning in person. He was devastated and confused. Things got a bit heated. I had to tell him about the depression and suicide. He told me that he felt ""embarrassed"" and that he ""couldn't see himself being around me as a girl"", but also that he loves me more than anything and will always be there for me. Overall, I have a lot of hope that he'll come around eventually. My dads a big softie and we both cried a lot. 

I just now got a call from my mom (they've been divorced for over a decade) in which she informed me that ""you're not gonna fucking sneak a fucking letter onto my pillow and leave me devastated. If you're gonna 'come put' and tell me what I already know you can do it to my fucking face"". So, yeah, real excited for that one. Also a little annoyed since in my letter I specifically asked my dad to let me tell her myself, but I understand that he was emotional and probably needed someone to talk to. I wish he would've used the PFLAG number I gave him. Bleh. 

That's how I feel now. 

Bleh. "
the-dog-the-dog,asktransgender,"I'm 21. I look and sound ""male"", but have a transfeminine identity and go by a female-sounding name. I'm traveling solo around Europe, staying at Airbnbs. How do I come out to my Airbnb hosts? Should I bother?","In the near future, I'm planning to travel a little around western Europe.  I also hope to visit some eastern countries as well this summer.  I'm here until August in an exchange program.

Based on how I look and act normally, I think I come across as a cis male.  I have to go out of my way to tell people I'm not male.  Even if I introduce myself as ""Maria"", which I have been doing for four months, I still get called ""he"" a lot.  

I'm thinking, if I put my preferred female name in my profile, I pretty much have to be up-front about my transness so that my hosts aren't surprised when ""Maria"" turns out to be (by all appearances) a young man.  The payoff would be that I can be honest around my hosts and do not have to hide who I am.  (Which you all know can be a pretty sad situation to be in.)

On the other hand, if I go stealth, I save myself the effort of explaining all this transgender business to people who have questions about it.  I also maybe lower the risk of being singled out for an anti-transgender hate crime (although I could still get perceived as gay, so there's always room for hate from that angle).

I'm leaning towards coming out, but it's just hard to figure out how to do it.  Should I put it in my profile description, or should I put it in my messages to prospective hosts?  Something like ""By the way, before I meet you, I think I should mention that I'm transgender.  If you met me in person, you would probably assume I was male.  I figure I should tell you this in advance to avoid any unpleasant surprises.  Will this be okay with you?""  One worry of mine related to this plan, however, is that I might chance upon a host who would specifically plan to commit some kind of horrible crime against me based on the fact that I am trans.  
 
Have any of you traveled in a situation like this?  What are your thoughts?

##Some tips for working on your voice:

* Stay out of falsetto! Falsetto is only useful in finding your head voice, it's not a very good place to go for finding a voice to speak in. Falsetto is the vocal range above your normal vocal range, and you should feel a ""break"" in your voice as you transition from your normal vocal range up into falsetto
* Work on your resonance! You should feel no vibrations in your chest when speaking. The target you're looking for is your ""head voice""
* To find your head voice, try pushing your larynx (the thing your adam's apple is attached to) up as far as you can, and attempt to ""throw"" your voice out of the top of your throat instead of your chest. You should feel vibrations in your mouth, teeth, upper throat and maybe even your nose when you're doing it correctly
* Once you get your head voice, take your guy voice up into head voice and you should get something that starts to sound female.
* Talk to yourself in your female voice when no one else is around, so you can build up muscle memory

##How to rate others' voices

If you don't know the vocabulary to describe what someone is doing wrong, feel free to simply state how close you think they are to passing. Please be honest and respectful, and don't tell someone they pass when you know they don't so that they don't end up using the wrong voice techniques. There's nothing worse than building confidence in a non-passing voice and then realizing it doesn't pass later on and you wasted your time.

If you are going to post your own voice clip, please help others with their voices as well! The best way to make this a useful thread is for everyone to pitch in :)

CharlieThePaperLady,asktransgender,Is the talk/rumours about shoe size getting smaller true?,"I was on my instagram the other day and I saw a contest pic about winning a pair of adidas shoes. Bear with me here, those shoes are gorgeous (fit to my taste lol)

So of course I fall in love with the pair and I start scouring the great adidas website labyrinth for them (seriously? A section for every fitness thing and then a section for every clothing thing under those? What?)

When I finally found them I found out they only have up to size 10. So I pull out their male female fitting chart (I only know my size in men's still, it'd be my fist pair of shoes at last. The start of a titanic collection I am sure), and behold, I'm half a size higher.

Sooooo any chance I can get my queenly shoes or am I stuck there?"
danisarah,asktransgender,What questions did your parents have when you came out?,"So after being on hormones for over a year (not out publicly) I finally came out to my parents and their initial reaction was one of love and support which I am ecstatic about. However, they said that they know almost nothing about transitioning or transgender people and that they have tons of questions that will probably be offensive. I can deal with that and I think it will be okay, but are there any good resources out there for situations like this, or can anyone here give examples of the questions that their parents had? I want to make sure to give good answers, we are in the Bible Belt and it is not exactly an area known for being LGBT friendly.

Further info- I am 24 MtF, self-supportive, and I live about 3 hours from my parents and am driving there tomorrow.

The__Paradox,asktransgender,Strange body hair changes,"I started noticing some thinning and lightening of body hair a bit after my 3rd month on HRT.

Also, I usually try to take spiro twice a day at 6 AM and 6 PM, but sometimes I find myself being inconsistent whenever I sleep too much. Could this be a contributing factor? I've also been really stressed out and been losing sleep due to school. I hate calculus.

edwardmightexist,asktransgender,I think I may be trans. Any thoughts?,"Hello, my name is Emma and I'm 16. This post is somewhat lengthy, but I'm going to try to cover some of the reasons why I'm questioning my gender identity. Please excuse any misuse of terminology. I'm still learning. I never imagined myself as a boy, or dreamed of being a boy. I've never been very aware of my body physically, and haven't really experienced severe body dysphoria. All of that being said, I do have a list of reasons why I think I may be trans: 1. I've always had a ""masculine"" air, and enjoy feeling strong and powerful. 2. During the onset of puberty, I displayed signs of aggression, depression, and discontent. I think it may have had something to do with gender because I started wearing/preferring more masculine clothing. 3. I've always wanted to be muscular. I looked at bodybuilders (male) and liked the idea of being big and buff. 4. Sometimes I forget what gender I am (only momentarily) and think of myself as a boy. 5. The thought of being a boy makes me feel happy. 6. Male thinking makes more sense to me, and sometimes I find it hard to relate to girls (despite this, the majority of my friends are female). 7. I used to stroke my chin and imagine having facial hair and masculine facial features. 8. I'm disgusted by the sight of my... lady parts. 9. I've had people call me sir, and I find that it gives me a boost of confidence. 10. I LOVE male clothing. 11. I've always been uncomfortable in changing room/locker room environments; I feel uncomfortable seeing other girls and I really don't want other girls to see me. 12. My family, especially my mom (she thinks I'm gay, and she's right), has always seen me as more masculine than my sister. I'm more of a big brother to my sister than a younger sister. She's 18 and I'm 16. With this in mind, I also have to consider the impact of my homophobic/transphobic family on my gender identity. Growing up, I distinctly remember the feeling of going through the motions of expected behavior. For example: ""Sit like a lady,"" ""that's a boy toy,"" ""boys like to be loud,"" ""girls are so pretty."" None of these were particularly damaging statements, but together they formed a secure, simple, yet probably false idea of who I should be and how I should fit into my gender role. However, I did love playing with dolls, a passion that was unprovoked by the stereotypes placed on me by adults. My point is that I didn't have a natural aptitude for being a girl, aside from the dolls. I'm worried about this just being a phase and being judged. If you've read this far, please tell me your opinion! Thank you so much, Emma."

_leira_,asktransgender,Question about Medicaid and transitioning,"My boyfriend recently came out as MtF. Despite this being a serious challenge with our relationship, I'm supportive of his transition. 

He's attending a university with free counseling, which he has had an orientation with and is waiting to attend his first actual therapy session. Before he even had his first appointment, they had him make an appointment with a doctor to discuss HRT. I don't doubt his gender dysphoria, but it seems like it would be wise to first conduct some therapy sessions prior to referring them for HRT. Then, after discussing the appt. with him and trying to get some specifics, he said that the doctor stated that she's not too familiar with the condition so she isn't comfortable giving many specifics beyond possible side effects that may happen in general. I tried encouraging him to seek a doctor and therapist specializing in this field in our city (we live in a larger city than where his university/doctor is located), but he insists that it's nearly impossible to get a specific doctor with Medicaid (Oregon Health Plan). 

My first question is whether it's normal and/or responsible for a therapist to encourage HRT prior to any therapy sessions with a patient? 

Second, do any of you have experience with seeking treatment through Medicaid and is it really as difficult as he seems to think it is? He has never seen a doctor under Medicaid so he has no personal experience with it, thus it leads me to believe he's just putting it off because this is easier.

Last, is there any real risk to seeking treatment from a doctor without a lot of experience in the field?

Thank you so much in advance for any advice any of you can give!"
TheGiratina,asktransgender,Would weight gain help?,"I'm really thin. As in, you can count most of my ribs up to my breast tissue. As in I have a thigh gap of over four centimetres, and that's when I'm pushing my legs all the way together.

I know people's bodies are different, and mine is no exception, but would weight gain feminize me at this point? I'm nineteen years and a month old, and have been on HRT for about seven months. My breasts feel nothing like fat or the breasts I'm touched prior. They feel almost hard and callous. I also have noticed little to no fat distribution, and I worry that it may be due to a lack of fat to begin with.

So would gaining weight help? If so, how do I do it healthily?"

Jake_313,asktransgender,I need help rejecting my MtF transsexual friend in the least hurtful way possible and preferable keep the friendship intact.,"I used to be friends with this guy when we were really young, not super close but we hung out a bit when we were about 13-14 but went to different high schools so we kinda just grew apart after that. I recently got a job at the same place she works and instantly recognized her unusual last name and at first assumed she was my friends sister or something since she looks way different and passes very well. I talked to her for a bit and she kinda told me her situation and that she transitioned like 4 years ago and that she wanted me to keep it on the DL at work since it isn't exactly common knowledge and honestly you unless you know you wouldn't be able to tell. 


We started hanging out more outside of work and grew pretty close. I really enjoy my time with her but recently she has started to get a little more consistently flirty which honestly I guess I kind of encouraged because I treat her like any other girl and I have a very flirty personality but then I realized a few things and am not interested in a romantic relationship with her. 


How do I let her down easy and preferably keep her as a friend without hurting her feelings? Honestly the MtF is the  main reason but I don't want her to know that because she has talked about her issues with insecurity about this before and I don't want her to be hurt or think that she is not able to pass as a girl because she total is.

BlazeDozer,asktransgender,What kind of effects would occur just taking blockers?,"My friend is genderfluid, and wanted to know what just taking blockers does. Does it just preserve you currently, or change your characteristics differently?"
[deleted],asktransgender,Been mulling over my current identity crisis. Came up with a sobering thought(Please read fully before posting).,"If you've done your research regarding transitioning and mental health, you will probably come across  some disturbing claims. Claims such as trans being a mental disorder. Claims that we suck at life, claims that we should all be killed. These claims will then go on, citing all the various mental disorders that conveniently co-occur with gender-dysphoria. And you know what? Those claims are accurate(cept the whole killing thing).

But guess what. Its not just us. Its EVERYONE. They say that someone in a male body with a feminine personality is just  deluded? I agree. However, that does not mean that the masculine personalities residing within male bodies is not just as deluded as we are!

Philosophy. Hinduism. Judaism. Catholicism.  Ancient and Modern Polytheism. Paganism. Every single religion, way of life, etc everything has one thing in common. And this physically hurt me to type out, but: EVERYONE IS BROKEN.

Continue reading for my explanation. Or close the tab. I don't care, either way I will have written this.

Personalities/souls/whatever you want to call what we really are. They are flawed. All of them. Usually to a large degree. The simple fact that we can sit back and self reflect on who and what we are opens us to amazing possibilities of problem solving and engineering. And yet, no matter what we do, we will never be as content as simpler life forms. For the trait of self actualization comes with a terrible price. The absence of a perfect form to strive for. There are no road maps. There are no guides. We like to pretend. Say we know how everything works, and how its supposed to really be. But there is no ""supposed to be"". Reality just... is. Its just there. We can do whatever we want to it. But it has no meaning beyond what we, sentient beings, assign to it. Which means there is no perfect personality to strive for so that we may have a perfect harmonious body and mind. Because perfect doesn't exist. We just made it up too feel bad about ourselves. And that's fucking terrifying.

TL:DR: Zkul's existential crisis, the post."
NaturalOxygen,asktransgender,"Have any people who don't really pass (mtf) decided to just live as a guy with ""gynocomastia"" and keep taking meds","warning: bad vibes

Hey this doubles up as a rant and a question

I started hormones a week before my 17th birthday. 17 months later, I'm 5'11.5, 140lbs, yet my body is huge, (I haven't met a single woman that comes close to my height. Most of them are petite here and between 5' and 5'8. I live in the south, I was probably better nourished with healthy meals than most people, it makes me wish I ate more junk  food growing up)

my skull is square, broad shoulders, men's size 12.5 feet from 13.5 (aka still no women's running tennis shoes that fit) and honestly my face looks like it's trying to be female with fat distribution but it looks like it's been plastered an STRETCHED  across a male skull which just makes me look baby faced and have a weird cheesy smile that looks creepy. Don't forgot a serious case of brow bone making my eyes sink deep into my skull. Also I've always been obsessed with selfies.

My breasts are wide set, I can stick 2 vertical fists between them. Despite this, I'm deeply insecure of my A cup breasts being seen so in the spring summer and fall (aka march through October because fuck the south, I wish I lived up north where it's cold and I could be fashionable AND hide tits) I've embraced the button down men's fashion (as seen at American eagle) which hides them well. Winter will be over soon and I dread switching back from winter to summer clothing.

My main question, has anyone just decided to become the guy with tits? How's it working out? I would need FFS to pass and I haven't even started university yet (I left high school and got a GED), my parents will pay for hormones but that's it. University is covered by a successful investment plan my parents chose.

I've become a major shut in out of fear of seeing my former conservative classmates around the neighborhood (in the past groups of boys including me would be roaming around the neighborhood in the summer would ""prank"" less popular classmates houses at night, banging on windows, ding dong ditching, screaming, harassment, ect,) 

I literally do nothing all day but smoke cigarettes and browse Reddit and soundcloud. I've stopped exercising as my motivation to keeping a treadmill schedule is gone, and I'm too scared to go outside to the local running trail that goes through the woods. My body is becoming skinnyfat to the extreme. I'm also terrified of going full time in university, changing my name, ect.

The summer after ninth grade, I was the first (white) kid to get into marijuana and drinking, I was also vocal about my newfound state of higher consciousness , making me ~the~ class druggie, i spent my 16th year of life hanging out with people who were mostly wannabe gangster low life's tbh. These people don't like me anymore because I look different now and have subconsciously picked up on it. This reputation as a trashy drug addict has stuck despite me no longer purchasing marijuana since I started transition (because clothing which btw nothing is long enough for my torso). I've been called a crackhead by a passing truck full of guys from school making me wonder what rumors of my supposed degeneracy have been made about me.

None of my few current friends knew me in high school which makes me feel better but I feel nothing but shame around former classmates so I avoid them. My best friends from high school (middle class boys of privilege) egged me on to steal a beer during which I also called a cashier a bitch about a month into hormones. They no longer answer my calls or texts after that and I feel I've become a joke to them and there good looks and sexual/social/academic achievements

I've discovered music festivals and hippie/liberal people and the people are a lot nicer, but I feel they notice I'm hiding something. I don't look my age, many question my claim that  I'm 18 and not younger but that's my true age. Many assume I'm emo. I wish I had the courage to go running and swimming and doing normal people activities that people don't wear shirts for. I want to take camping showers instead of covert deodorant baths. It's hot, everyone's sweating in the everlasting heat. But I always have to make sure my coney small wideset tits are hidden. So has anyone done this, and become the guy with tits and a bra? 

I can't quit hormones because I just know I was on the edge of teenage man and adult man development wise. Months ago, people told me I was a cute boy after secretly being on hormones for a few months. now they just act awkward cause hormones make me look weird as fuck and people walk on eggshells around me. My somewhat charismatic personality is the only thing keeping me afloat socially with a small number of people.

sorry that this is so incoherent, I just feel my life has seriously downgraded without even presenting female in public (and I'm only out to my 2 current closest friends and literally no other people know besides parents and cousins).

Also yes I've made bad decisions. Tbh being visibly trans is terrifying because I was ""cool"" in high school and it's like I've become tragedy porn about ""how the mighty have fallen"". In the beginning I was excited about transition because obviously every 17 yr old is an easy pass, right?

April 2013, I went no contact with my dysfunctional family. 
August 2013 I went full time
July 2015 I had SRS
January 2017....???

I don't think I can endure this anymore. I'm having chronic complications from SRS. Pain, UTIs. My gyn has no answers. (Trust me, I know all the tricks and hygiene when it comes to UTI management, the UTI won't die regardless) I'm seeing a urologist soon. My surgeons contact dismisses the pain as anxiety, which is not the case at all.  I'm simply not getting the support I need from the people who can provide it, I'm just brushed aside no matter how I insist. These doctors should know more than I by a mile, not a few inches. 

(Please, don't turn this post into ""this is why I'm scared for SRS."" Replies. It makes me feel way worse to be made an example of.)

I don't have familial support. I don't have medical support. I don't belong on this planet. If things don't improve within a year, I might just throw in the towel, my life has no future now. This pain is not worth it. My resiliency is exhausted. I should not have been born.

HonestlyJustHiding,asktransgender,"I'm trans*/gender-fluid/something not female, but my boyfriend doesn't know. How do I tell him?","Okay so I know the above is a mishmash of things but the truth is that I am biologically female but I have never once felt completely female. I want people to think of me as he or they when they meet me, but I am not against people who know me continuously calling me by my birth name or calling me she and her. I'm not sure if that's just because I'm unused to change or what, I'm still in the process of figuring this out. Problem is, my boyfriend (who is straight) does not know. In fact I'm almost completely in the closet except for my sister. I like him, and he likes me, but I am afraid that once he knows this about me he will stop liking me because I am not... ""female?"" And he, as a heterosexual man, only likes women? How do I bring this up to him in a way that might not out me completely in case this goes sour, but might give me an idea of his thoughts? Or should I just go in and tell him? He currently is fairly popular online and if he decided to slander me, hundreds of thousands of people would hear it. I am afraid of this power even though I know he is a nice person.

Slightly off topic but still related, I had a boyfriend in high school (still questioning then, too,) and in Psych we learnt about transgender people. So I asked him what if I were trans, what would he do, and he told me he'd break up with me because he's just not attracted to anything but female so there'd be no attraction. I am afraid this same thing will happen with my current boyfriend. I am flying to see him (long-distance) and it will be the first time we've spent a long time living together and I'm afraid things will go wrong especially if I do not tell him the truth or at least get an idea of his thoughts.

I suppose I am asking, have any of you ever been in this situation and what did you do? What do you advise me to do? Sorry if this is not the right place to do this question, this is my first time ever posting.

Many thanks everyone."
loathsomeQueer,asktransgender,Finally worked up the courage,"There's this place near where I live that has a trans peer support group every week. For a long time I have been wanting to go, but my social anxiety has inhibited me. Today I decided I was more lonely than scared. So I recited the Litany Against Fear from the novel Dune:

&gt;I must not fear.
&gt;Fear is the mind-killer.
&gt;Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
&gt;I will face my fear.
&gt;I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
&gt;And when it is gone I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
&gt;Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

As I first approached the building, I felt a pang of fear. Panic took over. I walked right past.

No matter. I circled around the block. This time I'll get it. Except I looked inside the window and saw faces. Panic again. Kept walking.

As I circled round for my third attempt, I stopped to meditate. Collecting my breath, I resolved to face my fear. I knew this was my last chance. Reciting the litany one last time, I walked right up the stairway.

I'm way too nervous ,... that's how I know . I barely saw any firmness in my breast tissue over the last two weeks . 
I'm also depressed . Nevertheless , I'm extremely happy with the bit of tissue I've got in two months of time on regular HRT . Just not with the mood swings and mental state . I need to be able to feminize further for my own health though. I can't return to pre-transition state body wise . Therefore I Googled a bit and e-mailed a few TS and Thai doctors recommending PM . They recommend 3000 mg but I would take 6000 mg . Toxicity and potential damage is something I take for granted as long as it will feminize me . I got to hear from one of the Thai TS women that this is equal to 4 mg of estrogen . 

Can someone give their input about this? 
I want to make the switch from regular hormone therapy to strong phytoestrogens in high amounts in other words . 

I could order it from Anteriolherbs . I would take 6000 mg all at a time once daily . I am on 3 mg E and 75 mg Spiro  since two months and wonder if this could replace it . 

Anyone who used Pueraria Mirifica in high dosage and did experience changes ? I merely want facial changes . It's very important to me that my face passes as female . I would be ok with small breasts ,... as long as the facial changes are pronounced . "

Lizasaurus2,asktransgender,"""You can always adopt.""","Hi everyone. My reproductive dysphoria is flaring up again and I'm really struggling. Every time I try and explain how I'm feeling and look for support I inevitably get the same response. ""If you want kids that bad then you can just adopt."" Every. Single. Time.

I don't want to adopt though. I don't want a surrogate either. Aside from the fact that I'd be uncomfortable with renting out someone else's body both surrogacy and adoption would present another problem. It would remind me of what I can't do. It would remind me that evolution has crafted my body to stick parts of myself I don't even want into someone and freaking squirt my genetic material into them so *they* can make the next generation. It would remind me that ultimately I'm supposed to be the male partner in reproduction.

More than anything I'd like to be the one who creates another human. Is it wrong that I want us to advance medicine and spend a lot of my own money so I can do this? Is it wrong that I want kids but I don't want to give a needy kid a home? Because the tone of a lot of the people who are supposed to be supporting me tell me I'm selfish and insane.

God, it hurts so much.

poorandtrans,asktransgender,"Please help - Can't take HRT, can't afford any other means of transitioning, disabled, family unhelpful","I'm a 22 years old, trans, disabled, and poor.

To start off, I can't take HRT.  I'm managing a chronic disability with a gene therapy pill and I don't remember the exact details but apparently this pill uses the same part of the cell that HRT does, so they'd effectively cancel each other out.  My health has noticeably improved on this new pill, so I don't want to stop taking it.

This wasn't an enormous issue for me at first.  I figured I could just start presenting femininely and there'd be no issue, but almost everything for doing that is way out of my price range.  I'm very poor.  I can't afford anything.  I can't afford SRS, electrolysis, anything.

I came out to my dad two years ago and he was helpful at first, even calling me my chosen name and using female pronouns, but he quit after about a month and seems to get visibly angry or frustrated when I ask him to help me buy women's clothes.  I'm not out to anyone else in my family--my dad is the only forward-thinking person in my family--the rest are all conservative christians who have already said shitty things about transgender people and gay people around me before.

I've been out for two years and my transition has not progressed an inch and it's starting to wear me down.  Every time my hand brushes against my facial hair I feel like harming myself or crying and I've done that too many times.  I have no one to turn to.

Someone please help me.  I'm not asking for money or donations, but can someone please direct me to people who can help me maybe finance at least electrolysis?  The rest of the stuff is probably way too much to ask for help with."

I am very skinny (34 chest, 28 waist, 33 hips) but with my proportions, height and flat body it's unlikely I could find dresses or suchlike that wouldn't look like a sheet draped over a hatstand. 

It'd also be a big, jarring change, I'd prefer to go through androgynous clothing to stuff that's more feminine rather than chucking my wardrobe and starting over.

I don't feel comfortable posting photos online, but if it matters my hair and eyes and eyes are dark brown, my skin is very pale and my veins are blue-green (that stuff will affect what colours will work for me).

I'm not looking for anything garish or flash, I'm a very shy and anxious person. Don't want to get stared at more than I already will.

I've been looking around online but there doesn't seem to be much about androgyny for men or transwomen.

I'm going on 1 year of being openly transgender. So far it's been great, my close family supports me and coming out has beaten down a terrible depression that lasted a hellish time of 3 years.

However, I just have one issue. I'm not prone to working out, but I've started working out to get a better masculine appearance. I'm actually underweight by 10 pounds for my height (and I'm really a tiny thing and have stopped growing), but I suppose our family has a gene for meaty legs. Any way I can try and slim this down?

I've been lurking here for almost a year and I've been growing my hair out for just as long. It's kinda looking Severus Snape-y at the moment and cause I'm in Australia it's gotten so hot as well that it's taking a lot of persistence to keep going. I've been struggling to really figure out if I'm MTF or just a gay guy that is super in touch with their feminine side and I feel like cutting it might help me decide, as superficial as that might be. I'm worried that once I cut it I'll hate how masculine it makes me look and I'll feel like crap growing it again for another 8 months. It just feels pointless to keep growing it while my body isn't changing. I've talked about transitioning to my psychiatrist but I'm only 17 so I've got to wait another year to start hormones. I'm really struggling to decide what to do. I see girls with gorgeous long hair that I've wanted for ages and I decide to just soldier on and keep growing it, but then I see myself in the mirror and my own hair looks like shit at this stage and I feel like I should cut it. 

Sorry for this random wall of information. I'm basically just wondering if anyone can relate? Have any of you ever had an epiphany while in the stages of cutting/growing your hair? "

Enter W. We just started dating. We were friends first - I only found out that she was trans after we got to know one another. Doesn't matter to me - I see her as a woman.

The problem is this - I don't know how to tell W about my cross-dressing.

 We're both pretty kinky and we're gearing up to discuss what we'd like to try together. But I know that some transwomen are understandably uncomfortable with cross-dressers in general and many people are uncomfortable with cross-dressing/feminization as a kink.

I wouldn't expect cross-dressing to be a part of our dynamic/scenes (we're poly) but I don't feel right keeping it from her. I wouldn't want her to find out from my other partner or some other way.

What's the best way to bring this up?  I understand that that W might have an issue with this and I really don't want to hurt her. However, I believe honesty is the best policy when it comes to relationships and kink dynamics. "

transthrowaway5000,asktransgender,guilt over my father's guilt.,"Things have been... contentious to say the least with my father since I came out early last year. We didn't speak for 7 months and what limited contact we had over email, he was extremely defensive and pathologizing everything, not listening to what I was actually saying.

His anger and sense of shame over my coming out as a trans woman was clear. When we do see each other now he barely speaks to me. But recently a family member told me something that spelled it out really clearly.

He asked about me, they said yes, we've been in touch, and she's really happy. Totally somber, he replied ""I'm the saddest I've ever been."" 

This is monumental for him to clearly express an emotion. From the rest of the conversation, it became clear he feels he failed me as a ""male role model"" and as a parent, and absolutely cannot see past his totally unfounded ideas about trans people. He thinks we're the product of broken homes, abuse, negligence, etc, and is blaming himself. He's grieving on an intense emotional level, one that he's probably never had to deal with, and that grief is being expressed through anger and silence.

I know it's not my responsibility and I can't just force him to understand. But hearing all this stuff so clearly, absent his normal anger or judgmental tone, just made me feel guilty for the way my transition has effected him. I love him and I want us to be a family. But I also have to live my life and do things for myself to be happy. 

I knew he wouldn't understand, and my fear of how he would react was a big reason I didn't transition a decade ago. There were other factors of course but fear of family rejection was huge. Maybe the solution is to just let more time pass but this is a terrible feeling.

mislabeledhuman,asktransgender,SRS recommendation letters. [Bowers],"How in depth do they need to be? Are there any bullet points I should make sure they hit? Here's what my therapist gave me.

&gt;This letter is to serve as documentation that my client, Natalie [Redacted], born [Redacted], has completed 1 hour of psychological evaluation with me at [Redacted] in fulfillment of the requirements for SRS.

&gt;Readiness Criteria

&gt;Over the course of evaluation, Ms. [Redacted] has demonstrated adequate knowledge of the benefits and potential risks of SRS, and has acknowledged that her decision to live as a woman has resulted in a significant reduction of personal distress surrounding gender identity.

&gt;Diagnostically, Ms. [Redacted] meets criteria for Gender Dysphoria. There appears to be an absence of problems related to substance abuse or any other psychological disorder. Given that Ms. [Redacted]'s insight and judgment seem to be within normal range, it seems likely that any prescribed medication will be taken in a responsible manner and that surgical aftercare instructions will be followed.

&gt;Summary

&gt;Natalie [Redacted] is a 30-year transgender female who has undergone hormone replacement therapy for 2.5 years, and hopes to eventually transition fully from male to female. There is no evidence of psychopathology or impaired judgment. Given the preceding report, I certify Natalie [Redacted] to be a fit candidate for SRS. Please feel free to contact me at [Redacted] if there are any further questions regarding this client.

plushycuddle,asktransgender,Scrotum pain on HRT (mtf) (possibly NSFW?),"I'm on HRT since 10 month, with increased estrogen gel dosage since a few month back.

Since a few weeks, I have pain in the scrotum area, as if nerves would be squeezed on shrinking balls. But since yesterday I have it really intensely, with crippling pain.

Today I went to the emergency doctor, which was really useless. She looked at my scrotum, excluded rupture and other testicular diseases. Said ""If you do that to yourself (taking hormones), you have to deal with it"" and gave me some painkillers (diclofenac), which are not doing their job really and are bad for my stomach already.

The pain is so bad, that I really want to get orchiectomy instead of suffering without knowing how when it's gonna end... But I wouldn't know how to get this going in Germany, the only emergency clinic in my town just didn't seem to care much...

(Sorry if there's any spelling errors or what not, I'm typing on my phone :P)

So I'm 19 right now and identify as female. Ever since I was younger I've always leaned towards the masculine side. I've always worn boys clothes, for as long as I can remember. When I was maybe 10/11, I would wear boxers and I felt very comfortable in them. When I reached 7th or 8th grade, I tried to start wearing female clothes. I never felt comfortable in girls underwear or shirts (I do usually wear girls jeans). When I was in 5th grade (elementary school) or maybe a little younger, I tried pushing for my parents to start calling me Joey after one of my favorite tv characters. 

Fast forward a few years and I've recently come out as gay. I always wear boys clothes. I got a haircut and feel ten times more comfortable with it. She/her pronouns sort of make me uncomfortable, but I get embarrassed when people say he/him infront of my friends. I really lean towards the name Nick. I've always been big into video games and I'll always make a male character, etc. 

Recently I've been introduced to the Trans community and I've been watching a lot of videos on transitions so now I'm sort of confused with everything. 

Any feedback would be highly appreciated. Thanks!

helpmestopmyselfpls,asktransgender,Passing is a trip,"So, I'm kinda pre-hrt. I've been on estrogen for about a month, and I have an appointment for my anti androgen next month. I haven't really noticed any changes beyond what appears to be a bit of muscle atrophy, but that's probably because I don't naturally have low testosterone. I still pass though. I'm real lucky I guess. I can get my nails done, get haircuts, just about anything a cis woman would do, without getting weird looks or questioned. Unless I wear something revealing, seeing that I'm flat and have some pretty well defined deltoids.

So my point of bringing this up is, I've been doing some thinking. I heard some MRA dude bro say that the sexes weren't equal and each had *very* different needs. Looking at hrt timelines, the science behind everything, I just don't find that to be true. Yes there are innate differences, but I don't think they're a big deal. Human beings have very little hardwiring at birth. You could say we're essentially blank slates. I can hear the TERF crowd, ""if the difference is so negligible, then you don't need to be a woman."" That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that mentally, cognitively, however you want to phrase it, there isn't some massive difference between the sexes. We can see correlations between brain masses and things alike, but there aren't any physiological, structural differences. Being female from a sexual point of few, is essentially hormonal and or reproductive. The fact we can change these things, for the most part, to me seems to evidence that the human sex binary that's most often interpreted, isn't so unique. In fact, I'm willing to take that to the extreme and say that people aren't unique in the same sense. That's why so many people look so similar, because there isn't that much to work with in a large population. Of course some people look drastically different, but odds are, they have a doppelganger somewhere. Being a person is your own experience, it doesn't make you less of an individual or anymore insignificant knowing these things. Because both are subjective and relative to context. In this context it's really just the grand scheme of it all, as if we were to be seen as groups from above, by another intelligent species, preferably with no bias. 

So, my question to everyone here is, do you feel there is a such a difference between men and women that they are not equals? I feel this is automatically barring average athletic *potential*."

When I brought it up over text, she didn't even respond to it. It was part of a bigger conversation and she just glazed right over it.  That's a small insignificant thing probably, but it worries me a bit. But anyway, 

all I ever do is wear pants and t shirts nowadays. Granted, women's pants and shirts, but still pants and shirts. I'd love it if I could help her with wedding planning like my mom is, but I don't want to impose, and I certainly haven't been asked if I'd like to help.  Part of me just gets super upset and wants to be like screw it I'm not even going to go, but I know that's an overreaction.   But I digress again. What I'm trying to say is this--

I want to present as female to her wedding.  I haven't ever presented as female in my life.  I haven't trained my voice yet, I wear androgynous clothing usually, and nobody in my extended family or family has ever seen me in anything but that.  Well I showed my mom a skirt once but she seemed weird about it so I haven't done anything since then.  I'm probably a little too subservient to others, but I really just want acceptance and openness from them.  

Anyway, I probably won't end up wearing a skirt or anything since I'd probably break down in anxious panic when I get weird stares from all the wedding goers that know I'm not female (I can pass from the front, but once I talk or am seen from any other angle, its clear that I'm ""male"" to strangers)

Yuuka5,asktransgender,(NSFW) (MTF) Masturbation makes me feel like i'm not legit during my MTF journey. I need advice,"I'm still relatively early in my transition phase, But something has been seriously bugging me recently to no end. Masturbation

Let me explain: I just feel so...masculine when i do it. Half the time i fantasize from a males perspective, i mean, i do have some from the female end (and that is what i'd appreciate most of the time) but unfortunately its not often and that bugs me. I don't return to my ""mostly feminine side"" until i'm done. Heck, i'd rather not masturbate all together sometimes. If its like: after school i'm fine with it as its a stress relief device but otherwise it feels like a chore, i just do it to get it over with. heck, looking at how estrogen seems to lower the sex drive, i can seriously welcome that attribute when i hopefully get on it sometime in the future.

Either way, currently masturbation just makes me feel like...i'm just not legit in my mtf phase i guess. It makes me feel horrible afterwords most of the time. I'm not sure if i should just ignore it or just accept it as a fact

any advice would appreciated."

&gt; After I received it yesterday, I notified various entities at [College] to change the wording on [College]'s State of Non-Discrimination (which appears in the Academic Affairs Notices) to include the following wording: race, color, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, gender identity or expression, genetic information, and veteran status.
&gt; 
&gt; With respect to background on this, the Civil Rights/Equity Team (of which I'm the Team Leader) recommended a change to this wording during a past meeting to include ""gender identity or expression.""  We were informed that 'gender identity or expression' was covered under the term 'sex' (as appears in the current wording).  However, the wording, as appears in italics above, was finalized and approved.  We were not made aware of it in time to change the Spring 2016 semester Academic Affairs Notices. Thus, going forward the Academic Affairs Notices as well as references to it throughout [College]'s website and other published documents/materials will include the correct wording.
&gt; 
&gt; And... if you are free sometime to meet, please let me know.  I am available most mornings in my office in [Campus Building]... as well as other times depending upon my schedule.
&gt; 
&gt; If you've any questions, please email.

**EVERYTHING WENT GREAT!** I went to meet with him, and it went really well! he was very open to everything I had to say, used the correct pronouns and name, all that good stuff. A new copy of the civil rights policy was sent out to every teacher and student at the school as a result of the meeting. However I do have a request, he (the civil rights coordinator) asked if I could provide him some more information about transgender issues to refer to teachers who don't understand, and to provide to other transgender students to if they are having a difficult time at the school. I have done my best research and compiled a good list of articles and websites for him, but if anyone has any other good ones I may have missed I would love to include them for him, especially any written from the point of view of trans students, or teachers of trans students.

I am so glad that this went well, and I am proud to have helped our community in some small way. Thank you all for the support you have given me, and for anything you can refer me to."
sgzqhqr,asktransgender,What Did You Do With Your Life When You Stopped Wanting To Kill Yourself?,"Hi All,

So, brief background: I have been chronically depressed since I was about 10 and had chronic thoughts of suicide, on and off, since about age 16.  Now, in my mid-twenties, after almost a year of transitioning, those thoughts feel far away from me.  Honestly, sometimes I can't believe I spent so long wanting, waiting, hoping to die.  But now I kind of don't know what I should do with myself and with my life.  I've never had any real long-term goals or aspirations before, I just kind of fell into wherever I ended up for the most part.  It's worked out okay, but I feel like it is time to make some plans for my life.  **If anyone out there had this same kind of experience, what did you decide to do with your life?  How did you come to that decision?**

I know a lot of people here still struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts and I don't want this question to sound like I am rubbing my contentment in anyone's face.  I posted this here instead of a different subreddit because we face different limitations and challenges in our life trajectories than cis people do, and I want to know what is possible for me, for us, as trans people.

Thanks everyone."
cherrifox,asktransgender,Were you already presenting as your preferred gender before starting HRT?,Just curious. I plan on going to an IC clinic in boymode and was wondering if that was odd.
BellaEllaElla,asktransgender,Is it possible that I am basically a hypochondriac and making myself believe that I have gender dysphoria?,"Sure, I wish I would have been born a woman. The thought of transitioning scares the crap out of me. I've already begin on HRT and seeing my nipples get bigger so quickly scared the crap out of me. Can I really go through with this? Am I forcing myself to think that I this way because I'm depressed and hope that this will lead me to happiness? How do I know if this is the sole reason I'm depressed?

I recently stopped being religious, I recently stopped keeping kosher (about 2 months already) and the reason simply being because I was tired of doing things for others rather than myself. I didn't like the expectations of me. I think gender wise was a factor as well.

I'm just worried that I'm reading too much into things. I know that if I am uncomfortable with my gender, or wish I was the other gender it most likely means I have GD, but I'm scared so much. I'm witnessing the power of HRT.

It could be my defense mechanism casting doubt like for everything else I do as well.

I've told  a lot of my friends about me, so I'd feel ridiculous changing things up in that regard. Maybe I do have GD, and I really do want to be a girl, but like I keep saying, transitioning is so scary. How do other people cope? Do they ever have doubt as well?

To make matters worse, I'm going to be seeing my parents and siblings tonight and I know that they're going to want to discuss this. they're not sold as it is, and since I'm feeling unstable, it only gives them more ammo, but what if they're wrong? What If I'm wrong?

Why is life so freaking hard and discouraging. I'd prefer to end it all if I could. That'd be the third option, but obviously that's not the best of the options. If only there was a save option :/
Maybe the reason I looked to HRT was for the risks of getting a blood clot and dying. Idk anymore. It's so irritating to be dealing with this and have so much homework to deal with at the same time."
Idonteventhrowaway_,asktransgender,Currently pretty much waiting to break,"Promised myself to not post on here again in fear of being annoying, yet here I am, needing a place to ramble while having trouble sleeping. I really have no clue where I'm even going with this post.

So, I wanna be a girl. Haven't told anyone because I'm a fucking pussy. I hate myself. I haven't experienced extreme happiness in months. There's emotions inside me waiting to comepletely destroy me mentally. I feel so much envy all the time, my self-esteem is so low. I really don't see the point of anything anymore. I get down so easily. Life could've been so much better, but nope. Of all the people, I had to be me. I wanna be a cute girl and lead a normal life instead of hiding myself and hating myself. I could look great right now, I could look right, but nope. Not only that, but I barely have a social life. I don't visit friends or anything because I just fail to see the point. Lastly, I just have so much doubt that these feelings aren't actually real. That I'm just making up some bullshit. I just can't be asked to deal with all of this and I hate it. 

I'm sorry. I had to say this somewhere."

n8_da_g8,asktransgender,Trying to combat dysphoria but its not working?,"Hello everyone, I've posted in the past but I am 19, mtf, pre-everything and here is my problem. Usually, I have gender dysphoria when I'm not dressing feminent or I just look awful in general. Today, I thought I looked really good, everything was on point, but I still have dysphoria, 

I don't know how to explain it, but maybe I feel this way because I look good if I was a girl but I'm not actually a girl to the public? I don't know, I thought I looked good today but I still feel awful, maybe it's because of a need/want to be the other gender?

Can someone relate? Or maybe explain these things I'm feeling?"
Jiyoonbyul,asktransgender,Trans Dreams,"So part of me feeling secure in my identity as a trans woman are the dreams I've been having. I know dreams are seemingly random and meaningless but these have been too vivid and too.. on the nose for me to ignore. 

Dream 1: I'm all dressed up in a really cute black dress. Im in my bathroom and I feel great. I go out on the town, and that's when the dream gets blurry. When I come back home I'm bawling and something has deeply hurt me emotionally. Dream over. 

This one is interesting to me because I have never gone out on the town in girl mode. I plan to get to that point but it was interesting how my brain played a potential scenario out for me. 

Dream 2: I'm going to a club and I get ID'd as usual. The bouncer looks at me. Looks at my ID. Looks at me. I swear to him that it's me and I say, ""I've.. lost a lot of weight."" He lets me in the club. Dream over. 

This is the nicest one by far. 

Dream 3: I've left a building in the city at night. Again, I'm in girl mode, which is interesting because I simply haven't done this in real life. Anyway, I find myself in an alleyway, and that's when a man and a woman stumble in front of me. The man has a gun and he approaches me, sticking the gun into the left side of my stomach. He fires the gun and he and the woman run off, I'm stumbling and assuming I'm dead. I run into another man with a gun and I ask him to put me out of my misery so I don't die slowly. Before I can finish asking him he shoots me in the head. Dream over. 

This one makes me a little nervous. Haha... ha.


So what are your thoughts? And did you have any dreams of this nature while you were pre-everything? "
rountree8,asktransgender,"Transitioning very fast, how fast(or slow) did you guys transition?"," So as the title say I'm transitioning fast. How fast? Well I think with in this month I'm going to start Hrt. Mostly do to my mom, I came out to her yesterday. She said she cared, but she seemed more interested in the shit ton of cheese we got from doing some charity work (they had a lot of cheese(like my fridge is full of cheese(oh yea she was supportive to))) But shes a nurse, so she has connections to people who can get me hormones. (hope its as simple as she makes it out to be) But I only decided to transition early last month. I'm already out of the closet (Luckily I've had no bad coming out experiences, everyone I've told has been 100% supportive) So how fast did you guy/gals transition?"
KrisEtKris,asktransgender,I partly pass. But Is it normal to be scared when people notice the difference in your looks and look at you weird?,"This has become my everyday struggle for me. I currently partly pass. During the winter break, the hormones did wonder for me and comparing the pic of me now and in the past, it looks so different.

A little while ago, two of my friends who I don't really talk to looked at me and told me, ""you look so different."" And most of the time, people just stare at me looking surprised.

Although I guess this is pretty positive to say the least, I am scared some of them might judge me because of my past or treat me like a weirdo...

Anyone with similar experience?"
_dEm,asktransgender,How does one find confidence as a trans* person?,"I had a bad incident with a woman doing my blood work today where she was asking me questions about being trans. I'm full time and I was still wearing my work ID with ""EMILY"" clearly printed on it. Most of her questions were okay and I happily fielded them, as she was legitimately unknowledgable and approaching it in a friendly and curious manner. A few were a bit too personal, but I tried to gently redirect (am I having bottom surgery, do I like men or women, etc...), but then she uttered this line:

""I never would have known you were a transgender! Had I not noticed your purse/nails I would have thought you were just another guy.""

I know this is just the reality of our society and part of the process we all go through, but how do you find the confidence to rise above it? How did you guys learn to find the confidence to be and feel okay? I feel like a fraud and I hate that this woman's comments, even as innocently misguided as they were, resound with how I feel?


TL;DR: I feel like crap, innocent comments from by-standards only further my insecurities -- How do I stop being a sad sack of crap and live my life?"
MishoftheHour,asktransgender,Running out of ideas of how to help figuring out if transition is the right thing for me.,I've been question transition for awhile now.

I feel depressed trying to figure it out I get sucidal thoughts on and off between meetings and its just like I try to think about it constantly and it just always comes back to this self doubt and worrying I'm doing t hi s because of my depression or because of attention even thou I'm scared to tell anyone. I don't know. And I'm spiralling down a bit now. I guess any ideas of how to figure this out would be wonderful I'm still going to do counseling but I just need ideas to help with doubt and try to work on thisboutside counseling.

I mean my mom likes my birth name and said I'll always be her son (and that really hurt, but yeah i see her side too, just makes it hurt more).

RaisaSol,asktransgender,I know this is probably a common thing.,"So lately I've been feeling very down about what I'm going to do in the future. I went from being feeling super happy (No dysphoria) ever since I started going part time, to feeling very depressed and nothing seems to make me happy right now. It's one of those moments where you feel ""Normal"" and start questioning things even though you already know better. Right now I'm just sitting here all dressed up in one of my favorite outfits (Trying to cheer myself up) and I just feel...numb, empty, and dysphoric but in a way I haven't felt it before. My dysphoria went 90% away when I went full time, so right now I just feel empty without anything even though I know I'm still Trans. I'm stressing out over getting an appointment at an IC clinic since I'm on a time crunch and things just feel a little overwhelming. Any advice on moving past all of this? I know I just need to push through this, but right now I'm just so down and depressed I barely feel like moving. "

Sometimes I'm almost okay with my body, sometimes having breasts doesn't seem like the worst thing in the universe. That's when I start to wonder how I would feel about being a girl if I had never opened this door. I was happy in my birth gender for basically my whole life, and now I'm unhappy knowing that part of my life was a lie. I want to be a man, but what if I change my mind (like I did about being genderqueer)?

emmafree,asktransgender,"Homeless, unemployed... Help???","Hi, so, I need help...

Basically, the story is this- I'm 25, about two years on HRT, I'm unemployed, and my partner and I are nearly homeless- we currently have a temporary place to stay, but the owner has been not-so-subtly hinting that he's gonna kick us out soon because his girlfriend is moving in.

My partner is unable to work due to medical issues, and I've been unable to get a job for the past two months- most places I apply never respond, and the few interviews I've gotten haven't called me back afterwards (and I'm worried it's because I'm pretty obviously trans)...

I've tried getting help through trans housing network, but the only people on there locally would only be able to give us a place to stay for a couple days. I've tried looking for places to stay elsewhere, but what few posts with rooms available everywhere I've looked have been either, again, only a couple days, or have been looking for roommates who can pay rent right away.

So, I'm pretty close to living out of my car, which would pretty much ensure that I'll never get a job if I can't get decent sleep and can't bathe. 

I know it's really unlikely... But does anybody here have a room they could spare for two homeless trans people? At least until I can get a job and save up money for a deposit and first-months rent on an apartment? We're more than willing to move (currently located in New Mexico), though it may take a couple weeks to save up the money to afford the gas, depending on where you are. (We've been surviving on what little money I can get from the plasma donation center.)"
alexander_lightning,asktransgender,Warning: a potentially awkward question,"... awkward enough I'm on a throwaway.

So here goes: Does having a phantom penis (as a biofemale) mean you're trans? [Warning: speak of genitals ahead].

because I have one. It's most ""there"" when I'm horny. When I'm turned on I feel like there should be a hard dick in my pants. And I've always masturbated imagining I had a penis. It can also be there when I'm completely ""flaccid"", so to speak. I've realized recently that's why I'm uncomfortable with pants that are tight fitting in the crotch, because they don't leave enough room for my non-existent junk.

Psychologically, my gender has been a big question mark for me for many years. I would just say I'm a genderqueer (or a tomboy or something) and leave it be, except for this one little problem...

goobygoober123,asktransgender,"im starting hrt at 16, what should i expect?",that`s my question
curiosa16,asktransgender,Told my therapist I've been questioning my gender,"Hello all, long time lurker here.

Finally told my therapist that I've been questioning my gender identity. I've been going with her for about a year and half  (during which I overcame depression, yay!). I told her what I've been feeling the past few years.

I've realized I don't identify with any men in my family. Not my brothers nor my father. And I have no intention of being like them. I have not the slightest intention of being a father. Or being another mexican ""machista"" (male chauvinism). Or having to be dominant towards another human being, not sexual nor in general.

The only person I've ever looked up to has been my mom. I'm a sensitive fuck, I can talk with her about anything, about who I am (although I've never brought up gender identity..... and prob never will), what I feel, how I deal with my emotions, she's a fucking saint. And I don't connect with men, I connect with emotional and sensitive individuals. I don't understand ""manliness"", and frankly just don't give a fuck.

Personally, I don't buy that shit about ""I've always felt like a woman"", not that I think you or anybody else shouldn't say it, but I mean I can't say that 'cause I have no fucking clue what being a woman feels like. I have the same no fucking clue what being a man feels like despite living as one for 25 years now. I only know what being 'me' has felt like (and it's been a roller coaster ride). 

And I want to be me, I want to be true to myself. I'm not sure what the next step is. I'm not totally convinced on transitioning, but I'm like ""If I'm unsure, then the only way to be sure is to try it out"".

Right now I can't make a drastic change since I still depend on my parents while I'm in college. But I'd like to know if you have any tips/baby steps I could start taking on this journey or anything I should talk with my therapist. Any advice is welcomed. Thanks :)"

I was wondering if it's somehow less confusing if you don't have that attraction in the first place.

[deleted],asktransgender,"Has anyone had any experience with facial team or MDM? So far, I've been going back and forth between the two.","So my GP gave me a list of recommendations (she is very active in the trans community and has been helping trans clients for a very long time.) and facial team was one of them. (I had already considered them prior to speaking with her about it.)  My therapist who also has many years of experience recommended MDM and told me that a few of her clients went to MDM with beautiful results.  She even asked me if I would like to speak with one of her clients. If she was open to the idea, my therapist would give her my email.

I've been going back and forth between the two.  The only thing is, although I've heard good things about facial team, their results seem less than spectacular.  I feel like a lot of the women on their site looks only slight less masculine than before.  Whereas, MDM seems to be much more aggressive and his clients look better but I've read a few (very few, like one or two) horror stories.  Although it's likely very much YMMV,  I feel like facial team is the safe bet but kinda a waste of money whereas MDM can actually make me look much better or worse.

I'll probably be using the virtual ffs to see what I might need but so far, I think I will need type III forehead, rhinoplasty, and chin work.  

The thing is, I can pass atm but those areas bug to no end.  In bad lighting, I can see my brow and nose stick out which makes me want to crawl under a rock (or wear a really big hat).

geniG,asktransgender,"Non-binary transmasculine, worried about what transition will mean for my future as an athlete. Anyone able to share their own experiences?","I started a martial art two years ago and it quickly became a huge part of my life. I'm an active competitor and have had some fairly good results, as well as building up an identity for myself as a female fighter in a sport where women are still a minority. I've also never felt *right* or like I belong anywhere or any time else.

I want to start low dose T and I may want top surgery and to increase to a higher dose in the future, but I'm really worried about what effect this might have on my future as an athlete. Partly that competing as a woman with slightly elevated T levels would be cheating but I don't want to feel like I need to increase to a higher dose than I'm comfortable with in order to be competitive in male divisions, and partly because I'm worried about not fitting in any more. I'm not scared of transphobia exactly, but there's a real sense of community among women in my sport and that's something I'd really miss if I no longer felt a part of it.

HypotheticalConfuse,asktransgender,What could a dream where you're another gender mean if you also change race?,"So, I had a dream about being a woman. The thing is, in this dream I looked *absolutely* nothing like how realistically could if I transitioned. I'm talking skinny white brunette, when I'm neither skinny nor white.

It was strange dream because I was excited to see ""my"" reflection. Then I tried to see if I could move this face I'm seeing because, is this really happening? 

Then, there was a flash of an image of dried blood over my/her eyelid. When I looked away from the mirror, I felt a pain around my mouth, which I had just tested, like something was off.

The dream ended around when (because it's a dream and they get weird) that I was suspecting the new appearance and other supposedly awesome things were part of some extraterrestrial or supernatural trap to keep me contained and pacified for some reason.

Any possible value or meaning, or does this fall under ""no one wants to hear you talk about your dreams?"" (Also, I see how some of it might have some pretty fucked up implications.)"
Eldarose,asktransgender,How can I be discrete about having laser hair removal?,"More questions :)

So I'm aiming to start a course of full face laser hair removal in a few month to start preparing myself for transition. This is sooner however than I would like to come out to the majority of my family, which I am planning to do around when I start HRT. So I have questions about how to discretely hide the fact I'm having laser hair treatment.

Firstly, if I have the treatment on a friday night, how much will the redness have gone by the tuesday when I go back to work. How well does concealer work? Would it be noticeable in a work environment? If someone does discover I'm wearing concealer and starts asking questions, what is a good excuse to deter attention? A rash perhaps. 

My next set of questions is about etiquette at the clinic. Are there any other reasons that guys get laser hair removal, or will I be pegged the moment I walk in and ask for full face? What level of discretion can I expect from an average clinic, e.g questions or glances. And if I do get questions or worst case scenario, someone recognises me, what is a good cover story? I genuinely hate shaving personally and can barely manage to shave once a week, so the idea of laser treatment is appealing while I present as male too. Would that excuse fly though?"

katy1989,asktransgender,Reverse social dysphoria and wanting to be the same person,"Hello,

I definitely have strong physical dysphoria and would much prefer the body of a woman. I love the idea of how HRT would change me physically. However I am scared of the other changes. 

I don't want to change as a person and I don't want the way that people treat me to change. I am very lucky that I have a lot of very good friends, mainly guys, and I would hate to lose any of them. I am out to most of them, and so far they have all been great and nothing has changed, even when they see me in girlmode. I'm terrified that HRT will mean that I become less interested in the things we have in common and/or, if I start to pass that they will feel they have less of a bond with me.

I know that sometimes people drift apart as time goes on anyway. And I know that everything in your life changes you as a person, in a way. But I am worried HRT will make radical changes that my friends, and I, won't be able to keep up with.

I keep having nightmares where a friend says ""you've changed"" and walks away. Not being me and/or losing my friends is a deal breaker :-(

How much has HRT changed the way you perceive the world, how you approach things, and what you identify with? Do you feel HRT is directly responsible for you drifting away from people?

Thanks :-)"

helpmepls5,asktransgender,"older male, are there others that don't do anything about it?","I'm male, 51 years old, married, with kids and unhappy with my self and my life about 50% of the time. 

I have realized with shock and horror that all my problems, all my self reflection, deals with my gender ultimately. I have been ashamed of liking anal, and having encounters with males and always saw myself as just being submissive Beta Male to regular Alpha males. Yet I am NOT gay, and I have no problem with gay people at all and support them fully.

I have hated how I look my entire life, I have done terrible destructive things to myself and to relationships around me. Watching Movies like ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" I loved the movie but was embarassed about my odd feelings seeing a man in a womans outfit. And I'd laugh with the guys and girls and shrug it off, but there was something there...

Now I realize after all this time my issue is one of identified gender. Once the light bulb came on, all I can do is read and read and read about this. And look for others and try to talk with people and figure this thing out.

Also... my marriage is not a great one, we look good on the outside to our friends and family but our relationship is hot and cold and many days I think about divorce, other days I'm completely happy. but its not bliss, its a LOT of work, more work than it should be IMO. and I give in to much and feel I don't get enough out of it these days. 

so...I'm at a cross roads. Part of me says ""Do this, fix what has been wrong your entire life! get on hormones, get the facial surgeries, go buy a dozen wigs, divorce now while you can!"" the other side of me says ""This is F$$king madness!!!, find a hobby, work harder, get some exercise"" 

I don't want to tell my wife because she will leave me. For Sure, no doubt in my mind. so I'm trying to figure out what to do, then just do it.

are there other older people here that are dealing with this? what is your story? How do you deal with it? "

kirito1342,asktransgender,15 m here and what do you think if my plan to tell my parents I'm trans,"So I'm a 15 m, I used to argue with myself if I was girl or guy. But after a fight with my dad after I was about to come out and he screamed at me 4 saying how I felt I was ready to do my own thing and I never was his masculine little boy. I didn't say I was trans he didn't let me get to that.

So after that day I stopped caring what my parents think and I realized I was trans and I was telling myself I wasn't because I didn't want my parents to look at me different and I realized I was a girl. So I got a therapist in secret and they thought I would be an amazing girl and they wanted me on estrogen as soon as I could because my voice is pretty deep and I have some facial hair. But my parents need to know. 

So this is where my plan starts. I got this calling card from the therapist that has lgbt stuff all over it (I got this therapist in secret). Also my dad (I think) found my bag of make up because it just all the sudden went missing after he went in there. Also my parents have seen me wear jewlery around the house. Also I walk, sit, and talk a bit femine. He knows I have been thinking about some stuff and wanted to see a therapist.

Also I think he knows I saw a therapist, I told him to drop me off to see some friends right next to the therapist building and he didn't ask anything about the friends. So I think if he sees the card he can put all of them together to tell I was trans. I think if I tell him upfront he would be quick to make a decision to kick me out or beat me.

But if he comes to the conclusion himself he can process it and think. Then when he is ready he can talk to me about it. I want to start HRT sometime within these next 2 months. So what do you think should I tell him upfront or let him see the card? Or is there any other ways that you all can think of?"
CountBale,asktransgender,"Recommendations for private doctors in London, UK?","Hello, I am a trans woman looking to start hrt.

transgirlchemist,asktransgender,why do cismale clients (or even nurses) treat MTF sex workers' genitalia so roughly?,"something that has always puzzled me as a trans sex worker is that cis male clients looooove to like paw my genitalia ridiculously roughly for my taste and it always hurts. they also assume that my foreskin retracts, and many ask questions like, ""why won't it retract?"" and attempt to retract it anyway against my protestations. 

then there was this one time I had to get a rape kit done (yay sex work) and the examination nurse in Manhasset North Shore was swabbing the area and in addition to her saying a bunch of transphobic things, when I told her ""please be gentle!"" she dug under my foreskin and continued swabbing for two to three more seconds even when I was yelping and screaming. 

I guess this might be ""ask a cis male"" but do most cis males have genitalia that aren't as sensitive? I always seem to get feedback with clients that I'm way too soft and gentle with theirs (also, I have mirror-touch synesthesia so it literally hurts me if I stimulate them at an intensity which would be way too rough for me). And why do cisgender people seem to assume that rough treatment of my genitalia is standard or OK? "

transblues,asktransgender,"Depressed, could use some advice","So I'm a 26 y/o trans person, was self-medding for a while but have since stopped due to running out of supplies(AA and syringes). I'm not suicidal, but I am incredibly depressed. I have hardly left my house in *months*, living with the parents again, playing video games, drinking and smoking pot in an attempt to escape this reality- but it's not working anymore. I have no desire to socialize or really even hook up with people because I'm just so tired of how alienated I feel even around people. Loneliness has just become part of my every day life, and I've become mostly numb to the world around me.


The only time I feel validated as a woman is when I'm hooking up with random strangers on the internet. I haven't dressed in weeks- I'm too sick of going to bars only to be treated as a weirdo with some kind of 'tranny bubble' around myself, I'd rather just play counterstrike and try to forget I exist. 

It just all feels so hopeless, I feel like I've been dead for years but have just been mindlessly inhabiting this shell because *what else am I gonna do?* I'm sick to death of trying, and all I feel I've really gotten out of trying is a greater disdain for people in general, and I'm disappointed in every friend/lover I've ever known. 

I'm so sick of feeling the judgmental eye from every person I meet, I'm so sick of the fake, patronizing conversations, people blowing smoke up my ass about 'how pretty I am'. 

I can't stand women anymore; I don't know where this comes from, I just see their effortless bodies, project how easy their life must be, and the accompanied ignorance/shallowness makes me feel frustrated and cynical. 

I can't stand seeing happiness in others (i.e., my sister who's getting married and seems *soo* happy all the time), I just want to be alone and stoned, and forget I exist. 

I'm not suicidal (mainly because I feel like I'm already dead), but the thought of taking my own life is one of the only things that comforts me at night, I'm not kidding when I say the thought helps me sleep. 

It's the one thing I have complete control over, it's the one thing that no one can make me feel bad about and the one thing that can end my existential suffering. Please don't point me to /r/suicidewatch, no one's listening there, they just want to make themselves feel better by offering advice, and my issues stem almost directly from my dysphoria so any advice they would give me would fall on deaf ears.

I'm not even bad looking and I feel this way- I have over 5000 followers on chaturbate, a neverendingly full mailbox on OkCupid, Grindr, etc., but at the same time I don't pass well enough to go to a grocery store and not be read as trans. 

I was seeing a therapist for a while, which honestly just made me feel worse than I did before. She pretty much reaffirmed that I would 'never pass' and that was a hard pill to swallow. I tried seeing an endocrinologist, but when I got there they had gotten my insurance information wrong and tried to reschedule, and I never wanted to go back because they charged me for a visit that I didn't attend, and didn't exactly make me feel welcome as a trans patient when there were people with ""legitimate"" issues. So I said fuck em, bought a bunch of vials, AA's and started self medding until I ran out a bit ago.

I'm sorry for the wall of text and my ramblings, thanks for reading and thanks also for any insight you might be able to give about my situation. "

mrfishinajar,asktransgender,DIY electrolysis questions,"I've seen that kits for electrolysis at home exist, and so I have a few questions about them.

First of all, there's no electrolysis centre near me, so going to one would be a pain; I wouldn't be able to go very often, so doing it at home would be much better for that.

Now, for more important things : I've have laser on my beard for about six sessions, and there aren't very many black hairs left, but, much to my dismay, I noticed that a lot of hairs have been growing back really pale, and so they won't be getting hit by the laser. Finishing the job on my own with electrolysis sounds like it would be a good idea.

Another thing is clearing the genital hair before the operation. Now, that won't be happening for a while, but if I could get a head start, it'd be great; I'll admit I wouldn't be terribly comfortable going to someone many times in order for them to zap my genitals. But, are home-kits even safe to use down there ?

Also, I have quite bad pain tolerance; with a home-kit, I'd be able to do little bits at a time, and stop once the pain gets too high. Plus I always get really stressed out when going to my laser appointments, which seems to make the pain even worse.

Finally, I'd be able to do pesky little zones like around my nipples without having to make a whole appointment for them or anything.

So, it sounds like it would be a good idea. The question is, do they work well enough ? Are they safe ? What kind of price does an ok/good one go for ? I don't want to launch myself into this without any advice from people who have actual experience with them."

I'm scared of being bullied and I really don't know what to do. If I could just magically become a girl instantly then I'd do it without regret but I'm not sure I can deal with this entire process.."
AnonymousAurele,asktransgender,The Biology of Sex - When Will Society Catch Up To Biologists?,"Greetings people of love!  [Here's an interesting article](http://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943) about the biology of sex, and our dependency on a limited view point of life that creates a simplistic sexual binary. 

Did you know:

*""That the two sexes are physically different is obvious, but at the start of life, it is not. Five weeks into development, a human embryo has the potential to form both male and female anatomy. Next to the developing kidneys, two bulges known as the gonadal ridges emerge alongside two pairs of ducts, one of which can form the uterus and Fallopian tubes, and the other the male internal genital plumbing: the epididymes, vas deferentia and seminal vesicles. At six weeks, the gonad switches on the developmental pathway to become an ovary or a testis. If a testis develops, it secretes testosterone, which supports the development of the male ducts. It also makes other hormones that force the presumptive uterus and Fallopian tubes to shrink away. If the gonad becomes an ovary, it makes oestrogen, and the lack of testosterone causes the male plumbing to wither. The sex hormones also dictate the development of the external genitalia, and they come into play once more at puberty, triggering the development of secondary sexual characteristics such as breasts or facial hair.""*

...and *""Changes to any of these processes can have dramatic effects on an individual's sex. Gene mutations affecting gonad development can result in a person with XY chromosomes developing typically female characteristics, whereas alterations in hormone signalling can cause XX individuals to develop along male lines.""*

""*Biologists may have been building a more nuanced view of sex, but society has yet to catch up. True, more than half a century of activism from members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community has softened social attitudes to sexual orientation and gender.*""

*""if the law requires that a person is male or female, should that sex be assigned by anatomy, hormones, cells or chromosomes, and what should be done if they clash?""*

Thankfully I have another acquaintance who is transitioning but they haven't tried to change their name yet, they've only recommended a doctor who can help me get started with hormones. 

I was also wondering how one goes about changing the information on a driver's license? Like what documents and such would be necessary to get that done? I believe I saw somewhere that, unfortunately, I can't get the sex changed on my birth certificate but I think I could fix everything else, if I knew how.  

Also if anyone is in my area and wanted help finding a doctor, I could recommend the one I was recommended. I haven't met with her yet but I've heard and seen nothing but great things about her.

I'll never be able to afford it with my salary, and my parents would never help me since they're devout Christians, who will probably freak out when I come out to them.  Also, I'm apparently starting to bald slightly, which is yet another problem. 

It seems like for transition to work you have to be lucky - lucky enough to be born with a somewhat feminine face, lucky enough to be born into a rich and accepting family or lucky enough to be capable of gaining a high earning job.  I am none of these things.

It just feels like my life is constantly filled with stumbling blocks.  The only reason I'm even considering transition over suicide is because my parents are still alive. Life is pointless and full of suffering but I don't want to devastate my parents.  They'll probably reject me anyway, so it comes a point when you just have to accept the game is rigged and you stop playing. "
FoxyCharm,asktransgender,Why Do I Want To Be A Girl When I Was Born A Boy?,"For a couple of years now i have wanted to be a girl. Like for example, i saw this beautiful transgender woman on YouTube, her name was Sofie Vissa and i looked at her body and i remember just wanting it. She had wide hips, big thighs, big breasts, big butt, long hair, she looked stunning. But, why do i want this? I always get confused if i am Cis or Trans! I struggle to explain what i am feeling to almost everybody! Must i be unhappy with my body or else i would not desire a female body? 

This is the video with Sofie in. Why do i wish i looked like she does in this video?

Zandrae,asktransgender,Binding troubles.,"After my psychiatrist determined that I am suffering from dysphoria, I purchased my first binders (I got two sizes so I could try both).

Alexisunderwater,asktransgender,"So people aren't afraid of Trans* people being in bathrooms, they're afraid that allowing us into bathrooms will promote predators. How can this be practically solved?","So I understand their argument. They're scared of the potential risk that a predator will abuse transgender protection laws. They don't have a realistic idea of the likehood that this situation will occur. They're scared. 

So people are stubborn and will go to great lengths to prevent increasing their own risk. Yes they know we're losing rights but in their mind its: ""My safety trumps your safety/freedom/rights"". So they're selfish but in their eyes it doesn't matter. 

Is there a middle ground? Is there a  way to lower their voices? How can you steer the conversation to allow them to fold and give us some rights rather than no rights? 

Lawmakers follow the voices and its hard to have rights as a minority. They don't know how to write laws that will allow the antitrans people  feel protected while giving us rights. 

What to do?

Edit:Typo

Edit 2:I guess we could also flip this and call us selfish for endangering ciswomen. But this reasoning, from either side, seams like a red haring. It all comes down to fear of the potential. 

So we should see if we can clarify potential into probability.

I don't think the data shows that assaults will go up if Trans* people are allowed to use the restroom. Though any data will be biased to how you define your criteria.

I imagine the easiest way is to see how many people could be assaulted, Trans of not. But with the huge discrepancy in population size the statistic will be biased towards ciswomen if we do total population sizes. If we do it per rate of 1000 Trans people to 1000 cispeople we'll be biased toward Trans people. 

Still no easy answer."

I have gone from needing to shave against the grain twice a day to barely needing to shave once a week.

As the saying goes ""your experience may vary""

I had a cis male asian roommate who shaved his face once a month...

My underarms, and nipples, happy trail are all pretty much done.

After my face is done I plan to do my entire thighs, genital, pubic area, bikini line etc etc

It is expensive. I am sure I have spent over 5k so far.

Uynia,asktransgender,How to convince my super-macho doctor dad to let me transition?,"I came out to my dad just now and it went ok I guess. He said that all the time I spent alone in the house and on the computer led to these feelings of gender dysphoria and that he would enroll me in a gym. He said to take a good look at myself and see that I was a man and that if I was meant to be a woman I'd have a vagina. He is also planning on taking me to a psychiatrist soon. Will the psychiatrist be able to prove to my dad that I have gender dysphoria? I'm planning on printing out some scientific reports and stuff on the issue so he can relate more since he's a doctor. 

But yeah, I expected worse and while I felt uncomfortable at first I began to speak with more and more certainty. He said he didn't blame me for my feelings and sounded more disappointed then mad, if he was mad at all. Though, near the end of the conversation when he said girls have boobs and I don't and I told him I'd get them after a few months of hormone therapy, he got flustered and ended the conversation saying that that's another thing entirely. Considering I told him earlier that I wanted to be a woman, I can't say I understand that logic, haha."

I think this has partly been a block in my thinking about if I even WANT surgery because I think about how expensive it is and it just seems impossible. So maybe it is less distressing to tell myself that I don't want it.

But I'm starting to be very curious about the “I don't deserve those surgeries anyway” theory. I think other trans people do. I think it relates to my feelings that other trans people have valid genders but my gender identity is invalid. I'm not trans enough. I'm not really a woman. And I don't deserve surgery.

alexvalewest,asktransgender,Question about HRT weight loss/gain + fat distribution (MTF),"I'm pre-HRT still, but I was wondering about weight distribution stuff because I'm probably a little bit of an outlier in terms of bodily structure.

I'm about 5'6"", and fluctuate between 105-110 pounds. I've always been significantly underweight and have had extreme difficulty in gaining weight (the most I've ever weighed myself at was 117 pounds). I've never been anorexic (have certainly been called it, though...), in fact, I've always thought of myself as eating more than the average.

I'm aware that I'm a bit underweight. I'm looking to get to around 120-125 sometime in the future. I've been (slowly) implementing changes to improve diet to aid this but nothing major yet.

So, point being, I was wondering how exactly MTF HRT will affect weight gain/loss. I've heard before (once) that it becomes easier to gain/harder to lose weight after starting HRT. Even personal experiences instead of just facts I would be interested to hear.

Follow-up question: would it be better for me to wait until I've been on HRT for a little bit to try to get to a healthy weight? I've been considering starting exercising a little bit in combination to the gains but I don't know if that's a good idea to do before or after I start HRT.."

Kawaii_Goddess,asktransgender,"I feel like I want to appear as a female, but still act in a masculine manner. Is this atypical or unusual?","**Preface:** I am aware of the fact that I am the only person who can determine if I am transgender. I will see a gender therapist in the near future when possible.

***

To keep it simple, I will say that my gender identity is split into three different parts.

**Internal Gender:** I never think much about my internal gender, and I do not experience much dysphoria in this regard. I don't actually know what it feels like to be a ""female"" or ""male,"" and I do not experience sensations of ""I should have a penis there"" or ""I should have a vagina there.""

**Appearence:** Appearance constitutes my external body and voice. The first mismatch occurs here.

    Masculine|--------1-----|---------2----|Feminine
                       Androgynous

I am at ""1"" and I would like to become ""2."" I am unsure of the underlying reasons as of right now, but I find that I would much prefer to appear as a female rather than as a male.

**Social Interaction:** Social interaction constitutes my pronouns and the way that I dress and act. This is where it all falls apart for me.

                  Tomboy|----2--------------|Feminine Female
    Masculine Male|----------1---------|Femboy

I don't want to change the way that I act at all. I would simply prefer to be referred to as female instead of male. This means that I would still dress in mostly male clothing, and I would still be into stereotypical male-dominated hobbies (cars, computer gaming, sports, etc.) I *do not* want to be a female to enjoy female-restricted items or fashion (makeup, dresses, skirts, and so on.) I have no desire for those.

If I were to flip from 1 to 2, I would be in the exact same spot as I currently am right now. Literally no difference.

Essentially, when I think about what I want to be, it's always ""I want to look like her,"" and *never* ""I want to be able to wear what she's wearing.""

***

When I break down who I want to be, it sounds completely absurd. ""I'm a male, who wants to appear as a female, who still dresses and acts in a masculine manner.""

Am I a strange case or is this common?"

I also heard a few times that she has fairly conservative viewpoints and that she isn't exactly the best symbol for the transgender community?

It hurt because of hrt and shrinkage, but pleasure outshined pain, finally.  Most of the time it hurts and takes away from the enjoyment and then I quit. 

My worry is that I actually liked it.  The actual ejaculation felt good. Even though it was very male. And the whole fantasy leading up to climax was imagining myself as the girl in a video.  So, these feelings of enjoying the ejaculation and hating my male body clash and confuse the shit out of me, as they always have.  But I'd avoided it for awhile by not masturbating.   

So my question is, How can I like a thing that comes from my male part that I hate so much?  

I know women ejaculate too...but, the fear then is that I won't be able to ejaculate the same after surgery.  I really worry I'm going to regret surgery, even though it feels like the only option for my happiness, personally. 

Its all related to my frustrations with autogynephilia, honestly. Its so easy to believe that I'm simply a perverted guy that gets off by imagining himself as a woman. Getting off in a male way isn't so bad, even though being a male is. "

And from the moment I realized I'm trans and needed to transition I was scared of the moment that's going to happen in a few hours time. I have had amazing support of friends, family, and my partners through this past year. 

But here I am. The last day of putting on dude clothes to go into work. I could still back out if I wanted as I have only told a few people who have to keep it confidential. But I'm not going to. This is who I am. And I couldn't be happier to have finally found her. 

There isn't so much a question here, as much as a message to those who are scared to start. Or who have just started and are facing the scary transition period. It gets better. It isn't always an easy road, I know mine hasn't been (even with the support I've had), but finally being able to be yourself is worth it. I am so glad I started this process because, even though I knew I could've lost everything (albeit unlikely), I'm happier now than I've ever been before.

Edit (update): I met with my team about an hour before I sent the email. I told them I was transgender and have spent the past year working towards today. I told them I was transitioning to female and starting Monday will be presenting female. I told them I wanted to talk to them as a team instead of just including them in the email blast as I felt it was important to do so. Give them a chance to talk about it, ask questions, and in general make sure that they could support me as if I have issues in my team, that would spread to others who may use that against me. I've since had three of them say if anybody gives me shit to let them know. One person on my team later sent me an email apologizing for a conversation we had 6+ months ago about Caitlyn Jenner. Needless to say, I work with a great group of people on my team. 

The second part was sending the email to the rest of the people under my VP and whom I regularly interact with. I sent that email and got a ton of really positive responses. Out of 100+ it went to, over 25 responded positively using my new name. It was pretty cool. Soon after we went to lunch (my team and I) and it was like nothing really changed. We'll see on Monday what it's like, but we were texting as a group tonight and one already used my new name in the group thread. So seems like it'll go really well all things considered :). I even had a trans guy message me providing support. I don't know if he is out or just doesn't hide it, but he transitioned at his last job and told me how nerve wracking it was for him. 

In any case it's been an awesome day. Tomorrow begins the makeover (hair cut, style, dye, piercings, etc), and Monday I'll be pretty different. I can't wait! So excited!!!!

This past week I've basically snapped. I simply can no longer give a crap about acting nice and friendly, putting on a smile, and tolerating people. I've just completely lost the will to be even remotely nice to anyone because of all the social and professional pressures I've had to push through for a year.

I work at fast food and I was feeling pretty crap today, and treating customers like crap as usual. Near the end of my shift, I parked my car in this parking lot where these teenage guys were sitting. Because they were sitting right there, they got snarky at me (nothing too bad).

I kind of lost my cool and went to town on them verbally, yelling and everything, I think I scared the shit out of 'em and now I'm just sitting here feeling like absolute shit because I had a go at a couple teenagers, I **really** lost me cool today...

So that's my rant! Thanks for letting me get this off my chest."

Kickintheteethtom,asktransgender,Is this transphobic?,"I'm in a women's and gender studies class, and our class textbook mentions trans issues but doesn't do it well. Some examples:
*Having a ""genderbender"" movie section and it has movies like ""Boys Don't Cry"" and ""Transamerica"" mixed in with ""Switch"" and ""Sorority Boys"" 

*In the chapter sections uses alternately ""trans people"" ""transgendered people"" and just ""transgendered"". ""trans people do X"" ""transgendered people do X"" and ""transgendered do X""

*A lot of the essays imply that being a lesbian is a choice. Most of the essays are not about lesbians, but in a passing thought the writer says something like ""some women choose lesbian lives so they can avoid men""

*One of the ""activism ideas"" is to ""be a gender traitor for a day!""

*At one point they wrote ""LGBTQ stands for Lesbian Gay Transgender and Queer"". This is probably a typo tho.

*Defining transgender as anyone who doesn't fit gender roles and even assigns the trans label to self-described tomboys.

*Strongly favors Radical Feminism. I know not all Radical Feminists are TWERFs but it still worries me. Even my professor says the book is a little extreme.

I don't want to say that the book is transphobic. I know that they probably mean well, there is an essay written by a trans women about her experiences in there. However, it was updated in October 2015, so I don't think it should be so insensitive. Am I just being nitpicky or is this actually transphobic? and if it is, is it possible to get this fixed?

CerealAndEstrogen,asktransgender,How do I get my mom to understand why I refer to my deadname as such in a kind and loving way?,"She sent me this text.

&gt;Look, I know that you see yourself a different way now. But when you were born, out of love and with great care, I selected those names for you. For you to call them a dead name is hurtful to me. I spend a great deal of time trying to understand you. You spend zero time trying to understand my feelings. I have always been your biggest cheerleader. I have loves you no matter what and I always will. But relationships depend upon two people caring about each others feelings.

I don't know how to get her to understand. I love my mom and don't want to hurt her, but I hate my dead name. I hate seeing it and hearing it. It cuts me inside to hear it.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this?"

defectiveMushroom,asktransgender,(possible TW? scientific genitals) Has anyone heard anything new about bio-engineered vagina transplants?,"so i read a while back about this experimental procedure that was performed on four teenage women to treat a reproductive development condition (MRKH, Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser Syndrome) that involved using cell samples taken from the patients' own bodies to grow new vaginas, which were then implanted more or less the same way as any other transplant would have been. i remember this story being all over the trans* forums for a while, but lately haven't heard of any new development, so i was wondering if anyone else had heard anything, or if anyone could point me in the right direction as far as getting information on this procedure, preferably from the source? i'm sure plenty of other people would be interested in hearing more about the potential near-future applications of this technology, and would want to start figuring out how to overcome any barriers as soon as possible."

[deleted],asktransgender,I don't know if I'm transgender,"Hi there. This nagging thought is driving me nuts. I've been thinking about this and nothing else for days now but I'm finding it odd because I've never questioned my gender identity before. Basically something's questioning whether or not I'm male although it makes no sense to me. I don't think I am but every single thought I've had all day is relating back to trans issues from the moment I wake up, literally every thought begins with whether or not I am one or being more aware of femininity and masculinity. Here're clues though from when I was younger. I never liked skirts and makeup - I cried when I had to put makeup on. I rejected bras till I had to wear them, and only wore a proper one when I wanted to. I refused to put on pads when I first got my period, probably in denial. But thought I looked sexy when I did. I have a banging body as a woman and so I never hated it. I looked in the mirror and crave femininity. That being said, these thoughts have been more comfortable with me and I've stopped looking in the mirror with men's clothes on for curves. I've also put men's clothes on and felt nothing. I don't know what's going on because I said I'd reluctantly accept my trans identity if I were and I just want some peace of mind. Oh and I've been obsessively taking every FTM quiz and found myself consistently coming up very feminine/cis female  Any help would be amazing. Thanks. "

a_question_of_self,asktransgender,So my mom found out today.,"So a bit of backstory here.  I've been talking to my psychiatrist and therapist about my gender this week and today after seeing my psychiatrist today she added gender dysphoria to my diagnosis.  Well since my mom works at the hospital I figured I'd see if she wanted to do lunch and chat for a bit.  Well during lunch she wanted to see my visit summary t see my new prescriptions.  Well I had no idea that the new diagnosis would be on it so I let her see it and low and behold she saw it. 


Now I have no idea what to do.  She said she was stunned and almost disgusted by it.  I wasn't prepared to tell her about it till at least this summer when I was more financially independent and on my own a bit better (I got laid off in November and she has been helping me pay my COBRA).


Point of reference my mom is one of those old school Catholics and Super Republicans (like she's probably going to be voting for Trump this November) and has already more or less told me before that if I were to ever come home in a dress or come out as gay she would more or less never talk to me again.


I'm really afraid of what she's going to do and I have no idea what to do or how to prepare for it."

I have a hard time gaining weight, and it's just impossible unless I start doing something such as weight lifting, and that's not something I want to do at all. 

My question is to anyone who has knowledge of MTF HRT or anyone who was ""underweight"" that has undergone HRT. Are the effects not as great as someone who is at a more stable weight? I know HRT has breast growth and fat distribution, but I don't know where my body will find the fat necessary to make those changes. "
AmIEdna,asktransgender,Can you be transgender and transition without having any dysphoria at all?,"So the title pretty much says it all. I don't really hate my male body, or have any sort of traumatic episodes or meltdowns or anything of that kind because of it. And there isn't even a constant burning sense of it feeling wrong to me or a sense of suffering, because of my male body.

I sometimes feel like maybe I'm alone in this thing, and maybe it means I'm just not transgender and maybe i am just crazy?! I even feel like if I were to transition with HRT and SRS, it would be an upgrade rather than an escape from suffering and dsyphoria. I thought your only meant to take hormones and get surgery to minimise dysphoria, but what if there is no dysporia there ti begin with?

I don't really know. I'm still working things out. Like, Does dsyphoria have to 100% part of the transgender experience or not?"

Obviously, nothing wrong with that, but did anyone else basically say ""fuck it"" and had a do or die attitude and just started by DIY'ing?

I've been on hormones over 6 months now, and approximately the first 4 I DIY'd it. Legit now though.

It was literally a ""do or die"" situation for me, and since I consider myself intelligent, wild and reckless, and feel no super real concern for any potential health risks or personal safety, I started HRT and never thought twice.

I finally went legit after scoring an appt, but took a while and I was like ""thank god I didn't wait to start!!""

My levels were checked and found to be spot on (the doc was super impressed and didn't try to lecture me or anything), so it worked out well for me I suppose, but just curious if there is anyone else out there that just went full throttle like me...

(Also, definitely not advocating DIY or anything. I literally just have zero concern for doing things the right way or being safe with it. But that only applies to me. I'm always overly concerned about others safety. So don't DIY, just say no, look both ways before crossing, etc. to anyone considering lol)"
randomthrowaway225,asktransgender,Relationships. One year later. Just felt the need to write/share.,"Posting this here, because, well, it seems the right place.  A bit of /relationships involved, but mostly because it’s a safe place to tell my story almost a year after it ended, last Valentine’s Day.  And because I’ve been pretty emo lately.  Apologies for the massive wall of text.

We met online in a game.  Not typical for me, but I was pretty blown away.  We became close over the course of a month or so, and those who knew her gave me warnings, general stuff “You’re just seeing her in a good mood right now.”, “She has some issues.”, generalized warnings.  Certainly I did see signs of her acting a bit oddly.  As we got closer, she kept hinting that I would come to hate her like everyone else, she was a horrible monster, and so on.  

Eventually she opened up and told me she was trans.  And possibly let down by me being underwhelmed.  Some things made more sense: constant anxieties, when she would get depressed, etc.  We got closer still, admitted feelings, all that fun mushy stuff.  Shortly after, someone outed her publicly on social media.  You can imagine this triggered some nasty stuff.  She had already had suicide attempts, and she was depressed and self-hating.  I remember the night this happened clearly.  I remember assuring her I’d come visit as soon as possible.  I stayed up with her until she fell asleep, then longer to go get my documents in order to get my passport expedited (She’s from the U.S., I’m from Canada).

I remember the first night at her place, she explained “I understand if you don’t want to sleep together, I can use the couch.”, and I’m thinking are you fucking nuts?  I’m nuts about this girl, I’ve wanted to hold her since the day I met her, talks of cuddling.  Suffice it to say she fell asleep in my arms and woke up that way too, it was fucking awesome.  There was some sexual foreplay, but nothing involving genitals, I didn’t want her to feel pressured in any way.  She had told me she was recently post-op (no, I didn’t ask), and she was still nervous/healing.  We even went to store to buy medical supplies.  

I learned a lot more about depression and dysphoria in that one week than I had experienced in my life before.  Trying to go out was very difficult, clothes shopping had her so distressed and anxious we went back to her place within ten minutes.   She was extremely afraid of any possible or perceived rejection.  Every person we passed “knew”.  It was difficult for me in the sense of “I care about her, I don’t want her to feel like this.”  As time to leave drew closer, she got more and more down.  When I left she was in tears for hours, for days after as well.  On one hand, it was overwhelming and felt good to have all that attention.  On the other hand, I knew it wasn’t normal behavior.

Not long after this, we met in New York for her birthday.  Her documents and such were in a state that she could not get a passport, and it shouldn’t have always been me travelling far to see her.  Which was cool, birthday, NYC, good stuff.  Lots of cuddling!  Got to do the whole gf wears bf’s hoodie, and it makes her look tiny!  Another sad parting, because she was going back home to be alone.  She had very few friends locally, family was not a thing at all.

During this time, she’s stopped spending a lot of time online in games, things are pretty great between us.  I fly out to spend three weeks with her for Christmas.  Great to spend time together, tons of just relaxing, cuddling and watching TV, a little foreplay.  She admits to not having had SRS yet, fearing I would’ve left her if she didn’t have a vagina.  Absolutely insane.  I’m nuts about this girl right, can’t she see that?  We try for more trips out, clothes shopping, anything, but most of the time it just sends her into a depressed/dysphoric state and we end up back home.  Fine by me, I’m not let down that we’re not out doing stuff.  At some point during the trip, I wake up in the middle of the night and she’s not in bed.  I find her sobbing on the couch.  She talks about some truly batshit insane crazy stuff.  I spend an hour or two just holding her and letting her talk.  I don’t really know what to do or to say to the stuff she’s saying, but I feel things are fine because she trusts me enough to share this stuff.

After this, we start making plans for SRS.  She wants to come live with me, she’s recently lost her job, I’ve helped her out a bit with rent month, but obviously I can’t afford two places, and we want to be together, etc.  I visit again for Valentine’s Day, before starting a new job.  The idea is to come live with me, she needs her passport, which requires an updated birth certificate (didn’t have the original, estranged from family basically), and the name change.  She already had her name change, but to get the other updated and get proper name and marker on passport required SRS.  

I’m sure some of you will tell me it could’ve been done differently, or to get the passport with a name / gender marker difference, or some other plan.  Which I would’ve been OK with, but she most definitely would not have been.  She never let anyone know about being trans, which is her choice, totally fine by me, but mostly, I didn’t want her to have to get her passport with the wrong information.  I had also seen how severely bad her dysphoria and depression was, on more occasions than I could count.  So, the plans was to get SRS.  I ended up going back to work (was finishing school at the time), because there was no way she could pay it on her own.

So, from February to June, no more trips.  I worked full time while going to school, putting in a lot of overtime.  She was not working, nor doing the online gaming thing, and very lonely.  I spent most nights up late with her, texting or on Skype, doing what I could.  She got crazy into dieting and weight loss, the start of her anorexia.  By the time we met up, before SRS, she had lost about 40 lbs in 3 months, via starving herself (minimal nutrition and water) and energy pills to have enough energy to go to the gym and work out.  She was virtually skin and bones when I saw her at the airport.  I had seen pictures, but she knew how to take flattering angles that didn’t make it look nearly as bad.

She was an absolute mess.  Her emotions were wildly all over the place, the smallest thing could set her off.  Thankfully we showed up early enough, and she had time to calm down.  I let her know in no uncertain terms, I could care less about the surgery, if she felt uncomfortable, wanted to change her mind, I loved her no matter what.  I wanted it to be her choice, not something she felt forced to do for me.  I was basically paying for the whole thing, and I kept making it clear she didn’t owe me for this.  I’d seen the way she constantly smoothed out her tights or skirt or jeans or whatever every time she stood up, her sheer hatred for herself.  I just wanted her to be happy, and I let her know I was proud of her no matter what.

She went through with the surgery, but sadly, there were complications.  This was due to her anorexia, the energy pills, etc, and necessitated a further surgery as well.  She was more depressed than I had ever seen her.  When we found out, she was only a week or two post SRS, in a hotel room.  She freaked out, she literally was unable to walk for more than ten or so minutes, constantly tired, and she was screaming, crying, punching herself in the head.  She threatened to call the police on me because I was telling her she couldn’t pack up and just walk out, and I was holding her against her will.  Where she wanted to go or what she wanted to do, I couldn’t understand, she had no money, no anything really, her plan was literally to walk down the street and maybe catch a ride with someone.  It worked out in the end, she calmed down, we got the necessary follow up surgery.  I took extra time off work to go back home with her and take care of her for the first week.  We celebrated our one year anniversary, which she had no idea was even coming around.  Once back home, with cats, things were much better.

Two months later, she came to live with me.  While we had the surgeon’s letter, she was still having difficulties getting the correct documents.  Had to end up driving across the border with every piece of identification and documentation they had, and she was let through.  

She was here for a little under 6 months, the maximum time allowed.  The first month was pretty good, moving in together, buying furniture, not long distance anymore.  After that, things simply started going down hill.  She would rarely want to go out, but didn’t want to stay at home.  I had moved to a larger, but cheaper apartment, so we could have our own space, but she spent the vast majority of her time sitting in the same room as I did (I worked from home).  Her depression and dysphoria mostly worsened.  On one hand, she had no issue walking around bottomless anymore.  On the other hand her crying was more extreme, her anorexia was a major issue.  She would talk about not wanting to end up in such a situation because of it again, but she wouldn’t eat much.  She’d say things like “Oh, my teeth hurt, I’ll just have this bowl of cereal for dinner.”  She would think I was angry at her for how much we were spending on food each week, when all I wanted was for her to eat.  Online gaming became her life.  She started yelling at me, being extremely rude and abusive.  I tried multiple ways of dealing with it, being super understanding, more neutral, or even just flat out realistic.  She did not like reality.  She had to return to the states in not long, because of the time frame and because of another required surgery.  I was doing my best not to fall apart under her constant verbal and emotional abuse, even if they came with apologies and “I don’t know why I’m like this”, because it was my job to make sure she could afford the next surgery, to make sure she could afford to rent a place when she got back to the states.

And return she did, we got the other minor surgery she needed, and I helped her get an apartment, as well as a car down payment.  Things were costing way, way more than ever anticipated.  Even once moved and settled, I ended up paying her rent and bills many times, as she was unable to find work.  She was constantly online, in games.  She had moved closer to me, so it was easier for me to visit, only a bus ride away.  There were plenty of visits, but things grew worse.

Her online gaming time was mostly spent with guys.  She would tell outrageous stories and lies on a constant basis.  Any group she was a part of had major issues and fell apart or reformed within half a year.  She was a pretty destructive force on anyone she came into contact with.

At this point, I am visiting her for a few days, and a mutual male friend is going to visit.  Someone she knows from the game, travelling across the country, meeting people.  But he wants to stay out there, because family problems, and hey, he’ll split rent (of her one room apartment).  Don’t worry, he’s totally gay.  I met the guy, seemed fine.  At this point, we start talking less, she’s always busy with “trying to get started in school” and looking for work.  Which seems kind of odd, since she’s online and in games all day.

Another guy begs her to leave me and come live with him.  She cuts that friend.  I’m a bit fed up of her not being able to come visit me at this point (she hasn’t done any of the work she needs to do to get her passport).  Visits to her are more difficult, because “my roommate pays half the rent, I can’t just kick him out.”  He eventually moves out, except on my next visit, I still see some of this guy’s stuff around, and during the trip, she’s called by a hotel, there’s a problem with her credit card and is someone using it to stay there?

At this point my mind is freaking out.  On the other hand, her apartment is a disaster zone, hasn’t been cleaned in months, deep cutting scars on her thighs, looks like the litter box hasn’t been cleaned in two months, and video game drama has her in tears or freaking out.  I don’t push the issue, because I’m honestly concerned what she’ll do if I even question her honesty, even though by this point I’ve caught her in tons of mostly harmless lies, as have others.

She spends even more time in game now.  The game has become her life.  It doesn’t hurt that she gets a ton of positive male attention.  She spins more stories about her, her history.  How she was making 100K a year before.  She doesn’t let on to almost anyone that she has a boyfriend, even though we play together, and she’ll occasionally blurt out private relationship stuff in front of others, leading them to all ask me “So, what’s the deal with you and her?” and she’s asking me not to tell people, it’s none of their business.  This is now really fucking awkward.  Guys are constantly hitting on her, which I get.  You have a gf who plays online games, you expect there to be throngs of guys around.  I didn’t want to deny her the validation of having guys into her, and I trusted her to make distinctions, even while she’d blatantly flirt in front of me, look at me and go “I know, but we need X person for Y thing in game, if I don’t treat them nice and flirt, they’re going to leave.”  On one hand, what the fuck? On the other hand, this is a girl with virtually no money who skips buying food to buy new headsets every few months to sound more feminine to people online.  My head is messed up, I can never tell if my fears/paranoia are justified, or if it’s just part of her issues.  Must be part of her issues, because who would go through all we’ve been together, for this.

We have a large falling out.  Almost break up.  Instead, we go on a road trip, at her suggestion, so she can finish getting the documents so she can get her passport.  Long drives, tons of bullshit legal crap, but the idea was to spend time together, away from game drama, life drama, just relax.  Instead, we get to a hotel and she plays all night, every night, for a week.  This is in between the bouts of sexual teasing and foreplay, intense depression due to the legal stuff (honestly, U.S. legal systems for this thing were a fucking epic nightmare).  While driving, she talks about suicide more, how she could just open the door and roll out.  Money planned for the trip goes wayyyyyyy overboard.  At two points, we end up sleeping in a car for an evening.

She moves from her city to another one about an hour and change away.  Gets roommates.  I’m no longer having to help out much financially, she has a part time job now and back in school.  The game still rules her life.  When I visit now, because she still hasn’t completed the passport form, it has to be in a hotel, because her roommates are female, and I can’t stay there.  Minus the fact that she constantly talks about the guys they bring over who are hitting on her.  How guys can’t be friends, they either want to fuck her or don’t care about her.  Some severely deep internalized transphobia.  She looks great, but she only wears jogging pants and hoodies when she goes out for the most part.

I come up for Valentine’s Day, last year.  My friend is giving me a lift.  I let her know I’ll be there in about an hour.  She tells me she has to finish up at work, and there will be some game stuff, but she’ll come by once that’s done.  It’s like, I just travelled 7 hours, the day before Valentine’s Day, and you’re prioritizing a video game?  My friend thinks this is fucked up too.  Instead of going to the hotel, drive by her apartment.  She’s said she’s at work.  But her car is at home.  Don’t say anything, go back to hotel.

She comes by later that night, she’s tired, we talk a bit, but she falls asleep.  I cannot sleep at all.  I spend two or three hours on my phone.  I go to unplug her phone and charge mine, and the lock screen comes on.  One of her admirers from the game.  With a way too personal message.  My head is now spinning.  What the fuck.  She’s always private with her phone, but I guess the password.  I feel like shit for looking, but I feel justified.  What do I find?  The gay roommate?  Sending him love messages, how she can’t stand being far apart, she just misses him so much.  Another guy who’s name I’d seen on her phone once or twice… “Honey, I’ll need 1800$ this month.” And inidications on how they should meet soon, neither of them will be alone this holiday.  Game admirer?  She’s asking him for thousands of dollars for a surgery, when he says he can’t really swing that much, she mentions how she’ll just ask me instead, and I watch the guy flip the fuck out because she’s told him that I physically abuse her and pay her for sex.  Trips he’s planning with her.  I don’t say anything, I’m freaking out.  She asks where her V Day gift is, right after I’ve seen her thanking another guy for sending her stuff.

I am now totally freaked out.  There is something absolutely fucked up with her beyond belief.  I can’t say a word.  I can’t let on that I know.  Who the hell knows what she’ll do or say if I’m in her vicinity when she finds out I know.  I haven’t lied to her ever, the idea makes me sick.  I fake my way through the next day.  I post to Reddit anonymously.  I wait until I get back home, the trip is hyper uneventuful, I actually left a day early under the pretense my friend could give me a ride back.

Once back, I e-mail her to let her know.  I literally am freaking out.  My whole world is crumbling around me, this girl I’ve given everything to for two and a half years has at least three boyfriends, maybe more.  She’s lying to everyone, telling the few people online who know both of us that I’m an abuser, that I hit her.  In the time we’ve been together, she’s broken or virtually destroyed four different groups.

She never apologized.  Talks about how I am cruel and abusive.  Extreme gas lighting.  This was a year ago.  Since then I only know a few things, seems she’s continued down on her path of self destruction.  People online who she’s crossed paths with have outed her multiple times, and mock her daily.  I’m OK with people hating her for lying, backstabbing them, wasting their time, and just being a total bitch to them.  Huge negative feels to anyone who says anything about her gender.  Groups of people asked me for all sorts of information on her, and despite being hurt and fucked up, I never gave anyone a single piece of ammunition.  

Because to a lot of people, she’s just an object of mockery.  And those who know, know the way to hurt her is through her appearance and gender.  It fucking disgusts me.  And none of them have had to be around her when she was nearly catatonic in a hospital.  Or have seen the actual cuts, or held her sobbing in their arms because she thought someone might have been looking at her funny.  Yet she is absolutely an awful person.

After that, during this last year, I spent a lot of time on this subreddit.  I wanted to understand stuff better.  And mostly what I found is, everyone I’ve encountered here, the stories I’ve read, the people I’ve talked to, have their issues, but genuinely seem to be good people.  I just happened to be with someone who had problems, really severe problems.  Her life doesn’t seem to have improved or stabilized, and she’ll probably always be like that.  And it just feels very sad in the end.  She was great to be with, funny, cute, driven, and at times she was an incredible girlfriend, I truly loved her beyond anything I’ve ever experienced.  But sadly, she’s also a shitty human being, the things she has done to me, to others, would blow people’s minds.  And in the end, she suffers for it too.  I still spend a lot of time worrying about her, even though I shouldn’t.  I don’t want her back, I just want her to not be the way she is, I don’t want her to have an unhappy ending.

buttercupchloee,asktransgender,[NSFW] Embarrassing sperm banking question.,"Okay, so I've made two deposits to freeze my sperm so far. I was told that I can't use lubricants, so I tried, and needless to say, the first time I got blisters halfway through, and had to throw in a last ditch effort and use saliva (gross, I know). I ended up with two scabs on my penis. I went in the following week, and the same thing happened... I ended up using my own saliva because it hurt so bad. 

Anyways, I'm worried that both those deposits are no good now, because that's what I'm reading online. The lab tech already froze and thawed my first sample and said everything looked great. I'm getting pretty anxious about this, as I've already invested $650 and two full weekends. Also, do you peeps know of any lube that I CAN use?

This has never really bothered me, i actually just assumed it was normal, like when you hear your own voice and it sounds super different from what you hear in your head. Lately I have been wondering if this is a form of dysphoria. I assumed I didn't suffer from any dysphoria because I've never really had any negative experiences with my gender or image, just a whole load of meh and not giving a shit how I look.

Scramswitch,asktransgender,How did you realize you were transgender?,"TL;DR: A coworker theorizes that without sexual stereotypes, the transgender wouldn't exist. Are they totally off base?

Quick disclaimer: I am not trans but wholly supportive, though I may be ignorant of non-offensive terminology...If I say something badly, please let me know so that I can fix myself.

So A coworker had a theory today that transgender people discover their gender identity because their personality matches global stereotypes for the opposite gender, i.e. a person with the physical gender of a man feels they are transgender because they more easily relate to women... have more effeminate mannerisms and thought processes... have priorities and interests more typically associated with women... et cetera. 

Not having personal experience with this, I was curious what differences made you realize you were transgender? 

Again, forgive me if I have said anything in a careless manner, I am merely hoping to understand better.

Why do I feel guilty? I simply can't understand it and at this point I'm thinking of just not transitioning ever just so I don't loose all the good things my parents do for me.

sasashimi,asktransgender,what's the best way to ask my therapist to stop referring to me as male when speaking about my experiences in the past,"i have some issues that i'm seeing a therapist for which are not related to me being trans. a lot of these issues involve my childhood, and it's been challenging for my therapist. in today's session, she had another therapist sit in with i suppose the aim of helping to make a breakthrough or whatever of some sort.

up until now (i've been seeing her for about a half year), she's been gendering me correctly. today, however, after a quick chat, i thought i heard the other therapist who was present refer to me as ""he"" (they were speaking in Dutch, which i don't understand very well yet), but couldn't be sure. however, my suspicion was all but confirmed when we were speaking about my ""present self"" vs my ""past self"". my regular therapist was getting lego-like people, and was choosing a woman and a little girl, when the other therapist interjected ""no - let's make it a little boy"". then, it started. as we were speaking about some very traumatic events in my childhood, i kept being asked ""how does *he* feel? how does the little boy feel? you should be kinder to the little boy"". i was processing so much that i just sort of went along with it, but it felt very wrong to me. after the session, i think i was able to figure out why it bothered me so much.. i mean i'd been forced to be a boy against my will since almost as long as i can remember, and i've worked hard to be my true self, but even my therapist, who is supposed to be helping me, doesn't see me as i know i am. 

the issue is, i feel like some real progress was made in that session, but in order to proceed, there needs to be a level of trust, and i'm just not sure that can happen now. i suppose even if i bring it up, i'll feel like they'll just be referring to me as female because i asked them to, not because the really believe it.. and of course, that'll make me feel judged. on the other hand, it's taken me a long time to get to this point with therapy and i *really* don't want to have to start again from scratch. ideas?? :("

Taliva,asktransgender,"Almost a month into HRT, still not experiencing relief from depression, is this normal?","So I'm current one month into restarting HRT, and haven't really gotten much relief emotionally yet. 

A couple of years ago I self medicated my own HRT for 6 months. I think I was taking 1-2 mg Estrodial sublingually and 100 mg. of Spironolactone. I was super excited at the time and started feeling less depressed about 3 days in. The relief was amazing, and though I didn't have a job at the time, those 6 months were my happiest in a long time. 

I got off of hormones because my now ex-girlfriend told me I was never going to find a job while transitioning (and here in TN, she  may have been right). This depresses me greatly, and has left me hurting and self-medicating through unhealthy means. I tried antidepressants but I have bad reactions to those and didn't stay on them for long. 

I found a job, and have waited until I was financially stable enough to get back on hormones. I'm also working on getting certified so I can be a needed skilled worker. I've started trying to take care of my body now. I went to the doctor almost a month ago, and have enough prescriptions for the next 6 months.

Unfortunately this time, relief isn't coming as quickly as last time. My doctor has me on 4 mg. of Estrodial and 200 mg. Spiro. I go in a couple of weeks to get blood work redone. 

I'm a bit more tired since starting HRT. The breasts that had budded my first time around have all but deflated. My once light golden body hair has returned to black fur I despise. Emotionally, I'm still very drained. 

I'm worried that something is still wrong. I'm not feeling any closer to my emotions, I'm still barely feeling anything at all. Am I expecting too much relief too quickly? I remember beiing so happy the first time, what if I get no release this time around?"

I'm trying to understand why I""m having such a hard time taking the first step to see a therapist. Maybe it's just pride. Maybe I view therapy as like a bad thing. Obviously it's not. Something is programmed inside me that is just resistance dominant. 

So I'm writing this in hopes in figuring that out. I find writing gets the gears going in my head to figure things out. Sometimes I ramble and get off tangent. But that's really the point of writing in that it's self discovery. 

At first I thought maybe I'm just a little phobic but I'm pretty open about my girly self and my desire for men. Although they think I'm joking. Some I think get it and don't care. Others in denial I think. I don't think it's a phobic thing. What is my resistance!!! Ugh ...

Money - there is the money factor. I have a pretty large pile of steaming credit debt.  I make good money so I hope to get it paid off by April but ugh. Kind of frustrating. That could be my hesitation but I don't think that's my resistance. 

Let's say I have the money and I'm good to even afford SRS right now. I'm all set. What is my resistance now? I don't think I can pass. Hmmm ... It's a lot more to it than that. Even if I think I can pass I still feel hesitant.  Being a girl is an unknown experience. That is what is bringing some of this anxiety. That's why I want to be born as a girl, why I think my life would have been easier, because I'd be raised with that experience. I'd know what to expect because I'd have someone there teaching me (presumably my mom).

Ok I get it. How do I fix that now? I mean there's gotta be some MtF tutorial or pamphlet some where? I already got the gay agenda that dropped on my lap to take over the world but not the MtF one.

That thought experiment kind of worked. I'm gonna post this maybe it'll help someone. Or not maybe this is annoying and weird. I dunno... Anyway much &lt;3 to you all *hugs*

I did a little thought experiment and I think it’s because being a girl is an unknown experience so that is causing some anxiety coupled with the thought that I could never pass as a girl."
Henchman24RIP,asktransgender,"How were you affected by transphobia, pre-transition?","I'm in the process of writing an article about the hidden cost of the new Republican war on transgender people. 

The fallout regarding bathrooms is visible and horrible, but I think we all know that there is another, more insidious effect of this battle. 

Transphobia deeply affected me throughout the years before I transitioned. It delayed my transition for a decade. During that decade I had two suicide attempts, one of which landed me in the ICU for three days. 

There are two events which really pushed me back at the time, and I had already seen an endo. 

A close friend of mine had been presented (by someone else) with a photo of Bailey Jay on Facebook. I think most of us would agree that Bailey Jay is gorgeous, but my friend was repulsed and made that very clear. 

Another friend, who worked in the fetish porn community as an actor, had remarked to me on more than one occasion ""Eww, *trannies* are gross."" I expected more from someone who worked in that sort of industry. (Ironically, his ex-wife is in a LOT of trans porn now)

These bathroom laws, and the open transphobia that they present, the transphobia that they encourage, will keep some of us down. We all know what the suicide rate is like, and it would be naive to think that this situation won't have an impact on that. 

I'd like to have more stories for this piece, that aren't from my perspective, but from a varied one. 

How did transphobia affect you pre-transition? Did it keep you from transition? Did it lead to depression and worse? If someone specifically had that effect on you, did you ever confront them?

The societal lack of acceptance is a big part of why I waited so long. I'd like to hear *your* stories. "

Princess_Catherine,asktransgender,"Just broke up with someone I still love because I have desires of a ""normal"" girl. Help please.","Hello. This afternoon, my girlfriend and I had a very difficult break up. Within the past couple of weeks I had become very apathetic towards her and my own identity as a girl, feeling pushed away from them, while at the same time feeling indifferent. The apathy towards her, however, was very worrying, and it led me to start wondering if it was a problem with the relationship.

I finally came to the conclusion that I needed to be with a man. It was important to experience certain parts of sex in a certain way, and I want to feel like the ""girl"" of the relationship (which is hard when you have two girls).

This in itself is ironic, however, because she didn't know I was trans until a couple months into the relationship, in which she found out, and welcomed me with open arms and kindness. She is also a perfect match for me in terms of personality. We work so well together, we get each other.

I love her as a person, but I'm not sure I'm physically attracted to her. I think she's beautiful, but I don't know if I find her beautiful to me. We both still love each other very much, and I know we would both be able to rebuild a strong relationship, and I want that more than the world, but at the same time, I feel conflicted about it all. I'm not sure if my desire to be with a guy as a girl is more important than this bond we had so carefully fostered.

Maybe I need more time to know for sure. I need advise or personal stories if anyone has any.

oscoxa,asktransgender,[mtf] How do I move forward when I'm stuck in transition?,"I feel like such shit right now.  Nothing in my life seems to be working.  I'm forever in this holding pattern where I see my trans friends go through with transition and for me, well I can't seem to get past the coming out part.  I'm not out to work, most of my friends, my family, hell even my roommates.  For years I have kept separate social spheres that I've made sure to never mingle- I have different identities for my workplace, my family, my non-out friends, and my trans friends.  It is super depressing to have to constantly juggle these different aspects of my life.  The stress of everything all is really getting to my health and emotional sanity.  

I've been knowing I was trans since 2010 when I first joined my college campus trans group for students.  Now it's 2016 and many of my trans friends I first met have already finished their transitions and moved on with their lives.  Even friends I met last year are in the middle of their transitions.  I feel so stupid and at times question my trans-ness because I am too afraid or uncertain about coming out socially.  I feel like a loser, a failure, and I feel like I don't deserve anything good in life.  What are some ways I can stop feeling so depressed and helpless?  How can I deal with the depression?"

Anon_ATG,asktransgender,I've accepted my dysphoria and now I'm depressed,"I never thought my dysphoria could get this bad. It's always been mild. Every once and awhile I would get upset that I didn't have a female body, but the thought of actually committing to transitioning never stuck around for more than a minute. I'm not actually trans, am I? This is related to my weird fetishes, right?

I can't lie to myself anymore.

The signs are overwhelming. I don't even think my parents would be surprised.

I feel like all the depression I have neglected from denying my condition has been bottled up, and it's consuming me.

It's only been a couple days since this started, but it's all I can think of. I can't focus. I can't enjoy anything.

I've had intense depression in the past, so I'm very familiar with how it feels. I can't live the rest of my life like this.

I don't know what to do. I'm seriously fucked in the head. What a shitty hand of cards I was given. Transitioning sounds like a fucking nightmare that I can only dream of affording. Is it really worth the gamble?

I mean, I don't feel suicidal yet. It's only been a few days, maybe this will just become a more mild depression that I have to live with. I could just spend the rest of my life hating myself.

Or if I take the gamble, I'm ether happy, or I still hate myself, like if I couldn't pass. I don't think I could. I know a lot of people are too self critical, but I'm an ugly motherfucker. I've had more women talk about how ugly I am while in earshot, than have had women ask me out. I've never been complimented for my looks.

How could I even afford this if I wanted to. I don't have a job, I can't get a good job. I can't even get a shitty job apparently. There's still the really shitty jobs, but with this new depression I really don't think I could handle that.

My parents are trying to get me on disability. I don't know much about it, I highly doubt it would aid in my problem here.

I don't really have a point. I have no one to talk to about this, so I'm just venting. No one knows about this. I think my close friends and family members would be supportive if I came out, but I just don't know about my parents (who I'm not close with)

I live with them so I'm not risking shit.

How do you people afford this."

Lorie_love,asktransgender,Self harm thoughts : yet another trait of dysphoria ?,"Over the last few weeks, self harm thoughts have entered my life.
I initially did not pay much attention, as they were mild (but annoying), and because I *knew* I wouldn't voluntarily hurt myself. These particularly showed up when I was manipulating knives (I was picturing myself hurting me). It is now getting a bit more overwhelming with thoughts of knocking myself (my head most of the time) against anything that would hurt me (walls, doors, ...), and they occur much more often.
Again, I think I won't do that kind of thing, but that worries me a bit. Has anyone ever experienced the same thing ? For the first time in my life, I have the feeling of becoming mad.

Hanna529,asktransgender,"Did anyone else experience a situation where your body seemed to be ""wired for estrogen""?","From reading about others' experiences, it seems that for most, breast buds often don't start until months into HRT.

I've been on HRT for 2 and a half weeks and I already have clear breast growth to the point where it's noticeable if I wear a T-shirt.  It's not much, but it's not invisible either.  I'm overjoyed that estrogen is being so generous to me, but I'm also a bit freaked out, because it's going to out me before I'm ready.

I've been reflecting on this, and I realize that testosterone seems to have spared me.  I've always had wide hips.  On a male, it looks a little strange to have your pelvis noticably jutting out, but I realize now how lucky I am.  My beard and body hair is very sparse, and my beard grows so slowly (and always has).

I'm wondering, have any of you out there had a similar experience?  Something many of us obsess about is how we will turn out in the end.  I'm just wondering how it worked out for others who went through a similar experience.

I should add that I am 24."
Throwawayadaydre,asktransgender,A question,"To preface this isn't one of those posts asking if I'm trans or not, I have already accepted I am. This is more a question regarding sexuality. Here's a little background, I'm pre everything and before coming to terms with being trans assumed I was gay. I think I confused being feminine with being gay. I have always had crushes on girls and am currently obsessing over a girl right now. Although I have done stuff with guys before I find myself feeling indifferent toward them with regard to sex. Although I want to be with a girl romantically and live with her, sleep with her, hold her hand, support her, laugh with her insert cliche from Rom com here etc. I do still have the urge to get, for lack of a better term, dominated by a man. I'm not sure if this is a fetish or not because every time I have done stuff with a man it always seems better in my head than what actually happens. This crush I have on this girl is like the strongest crush I've ever had. Theres this happy feeling of euphoria in my chest when she's near and I can't help but smile every time i look at her. Part of my problem is I feel like if I pursue a romantic relationship with her I may be somehow lying to myself or deceiving her because of my past with men. Has anyone ever felt this way? Every time I think I'm attracted to men I think but if I choose men then I can't have a relationship with a woman for the rest of my life and remember I really want to have a wife. Am I alone here? If I compare the sex I've had with girls to with boys I find that I'm pretty ambivalent either way. I enjoy being around woman and talking to them only not in public because I'm usually way too anxious to even function. You can probably tell from my inane ramblings that I have ocd and like to check and test myself. I just want to be with a woman and not feel like I'm lying to myself. Not sure if that's an obtrusive thought or a legitimate one. I really don't want to be with a man but sometimes I tell myself stop lying to yourself you'd be doing the woman you're with a disservice by being with her. I'm probably being hard on myself. Ocd sucks because I can't think rationally most of the time plus I'm sure there's some psychosis in there as well. But I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has felt this way and if I have any shot with women or what? I hate torturing myself like this. I just need some reassurance, the drug of ocd reassurance, that sounded pretentious. Haha well maybe I'm asexual I don't know. I just want to be with this girl so bad and I feel like I'm getting in my own way. Also let me bring up the type of pornography I watch. I like watching really amateur lesbian stuff and lesbea and sometimes Lisa ann because she's sexy and I like to pretend to be her. Mostly I like fantasizing about riding a dildo or getting my butt eaten out usually I'm the submissive one though and on the other side of the coin although I have cut down, I watch gay porn usually with some muscular dude with a twink just going to town on him or daddy and twink but mainly I like when one man is dominating another. Is that common for lesbians? I used to go on grinder and initiate convos just because the possibility of getting fucked turned me on I don't think I was as attracted to men and their physique as the idea of getting dominated although there is tiny amount of attraction to bigger guys whereas with girls it's a different thing, I feel like it's degrading to the everyday woman I see if I picture her naked or us having sex so I usually just acknowledge the cute ones and stare at them like an idiot. Men in public don't really give me an erection nor do women it's more the idea of imminent sex that gets me aroused. This girl I have a crush on is very attractive though I don't get a hard on I more picture me being in a relationship with her, I've never felt that way about any guys except maybe one. When I do jerk off I picture her with a dildo or sometimes just her on top of me just making out and kissing my neck and similar romantic stuff but usually I can never start an erection just from that usually it's coupled with porn that helps me get there whereas when it comes to guys just going on grinder (although I don't do this anymore) and thinking about the possibility of having sex would give me a boner(i guess that's kind of a form of porn though so I guess I'm equal there). So I guess I'm wondering if this makes me have to like guys because maybe I'm a little more physically attracted to them or is my crush on this girl a jealousy thing although it doesn't feel like that. It's just this super happy feeling in my chest every time I see her and think about her. I tell myself I don't get an erection to the thought of her and me doing it because in my fantasy I don't even have a wiener is that a possibility? Like I really want to be with this girl lol. It hurts. Ambivalence sucks. I just want to transition already and spend my life with this girl. Sometimes I feel like I have no control over this and am being forced to be with men, I don't have a lot of control in my actions or thoughts. I haven't taken my zoloft for 4 or 5 days so this is all probably due to that but I had to get this out. Don't worry I'm picking up my pills tomorrow morning haha I'm a schmuck. Has anyone been in a similar situation. Sorry for this being so long but I wanted to make sure I got everything. Someone please help. I feel like a lesbian but am still in a man's body and can't escape the idea that femininity=gay or I think that's it. "
Aconfusedcatcus,asktransgender,Help I've done it again :(,Every time I'm on duty (military 24 hour post) my favorite thing to do is catch up on these sub reddits. When I do this the urge to throw in the towel and finally be who I know is inside me is stronger than ever. When I don't spend a lot of time on here those feelings are not as strong but they are still there.

Any person who struggled with deciding to transition; what did you do or what made you realize it was the right thing to do?
Osricthebastard,asktransgender,"PSA: If you get misgendered by people you know, just politely correct them and see what happens.","The ignorance is real guys. I've been coming out to people and having the pronouns conversation with them and a few of them just seriously genuinely did not know that I did not want to be referred to as a man despite telling them that I was physically transitioning to a woman. I told them, politely, let them know I understood it would take an adjustment period, and nobody has gotten shitty with me about it so far. There's also some people who I've come out to who are for lack of a better word a little slow, mentally, and they keep fucking up but I have patience with them as long as they keep correcting themselves or responding positively when I politely correct them. The people who surround us are having to reprogram their entire habitual vocabulary when it comes to us. As trans people we spent years as our assigned sex being very deliberate with our speech and mannerisms, trying to blend in, and we forget that for most people, conversation is just a stream of consciousness. They don't really think too much before they speak. They just speak and it's all coming out about a quarter of a second after the thought form itself.

The more honest you are with people about how it makes you feel to be misgendered the more likely they are to show you compassion instead of defensiveness or stubbornness. Be real with people. Explain to them that it hurts your feelings and it feels inappropriate given your personal appearance. Explain to them what dysphoria feels like if necessary. Above all be firm and assertive but not rude. If someone gets rude with you, just tell them that you're politely backing out of the conversation and have no intention to continue until they're more receptive to what you have to say.

I'm writing this because I see a lot of people on here get very very upset about people not gendering them correctly while meanwhile some gentle probing will reveal that they haven't really ever asked people to gender them correctly, merely announced themselves to the world as transgender and then expected everyone around them to be well educated enough to know what that entails.

Another thing we take for granted is our understanding of transgender issues. The average joe seriously has no fucking clue and for most of the people around us their encounter with us may genuinely be the only face to face interaction they've ever had with a trans person (to their knowledge).

Be assertive but be patient. It pays off."
petrified-throwaway,asktransgender,"Is it normal to have no regrets about anything right up to eight weeks before SRS, then suddenly second guess EVERYTHING?","That's my situation.  Happy being trans, happy with all the changes from hormones, reasonably happy with FFS, happy with the social side, etc.  Have been for years now.  No problems whatsoever thus far.  I've been working with a therapist throughout and have been making sure that each step I took was the right one as best as I could.

Then I think long and hard about SRS, decide it's the right choice, and I get SRS organized, get my letters, pay for it, book flights, no issues at all.  SRS is eight weeks away.

And now that it's all set in stone, I find myself thinking, ""What the fuck am I doing?  This is all wrong!""

Like these feelings couldn't have surfaced a little sooner, before I paid for everything?????  Before I spent two years on HRT?  Before I basically fully transitioned?

Has anyone else experienced this kind of nervousness or second guessing their entire transition?  I'm fairly sure it's normal pre-surgery jitters, especially given that it's ""elective"" surgery and I don't ""need"" to have it in order to survive.  But I want to make sure that it's not a legitimate sign that I'm not actually trans and I should back away now.

FrazerFree,asktransgender,Talked to my Mom for five hours. I got NO WHERE! (Rant),"Talking to my mom feels like I'm listening to a preacher. I try to talk about my feelings and how it hurts, as she says is ""wow, those are your feelings. I'm sorry your feeling that way, but they are of the world and the devil. You need to pray and make a relationship to God and all of your ailments and feelings will leave you. You are lost and of the world.""

Every time I try to explain it to her she says I'm confused. She told my Uncle, never her asked her too, and he agreed I was simply confused. My terrible feelings that have hurt me my whole life are just confusion, they aren't. 

I try ask it where it says where I am doing wrong, she only talks in religious terms , and she continues to say that it must be. ""No way God would not see a man in a dress as an perverted."" I try to argue it myself and she says she has been a Born again Christian my whole life, someone as naïve as me wouldn't know. When I continue to gets annoyed for begins to cry why I don't believe here and why no one will listen to her.

She says she loves me, she does, but she doesn't show it. Any time I have wanted to talk about my feelings or anything, she brings I how I should just pray, and then it'll just get better. If I believe hard enough. She then spends half an hour explaining how Christ will save only he we believe and get rid of our sinful feelings, listing off things her preacher on TV have said. There is NEVER any real communication between us. It is always deemed by her as simply petty and sinful compared to Christ. 

Hell, Whenever I talk my beliefs she works endlessly to pick at my words to try to misconstrue them to show how I was so wrong and misled. We spend HALF THE TIME arguing semantics. 

She said she'll support me with whatever that I decide. Luckily she is always quick to point out how I am abnormal for my feelings. She doesn't understand why a boy wants to be a girl. She mocks me since I can't menstruate, meaning I never understood the feeling of being a woman. She refuses to accept that maybe reasons exist why I feel this, and it is a real thing. All of her assurance ends up with a simple, ""i'll have to get used to it.""

She also refuses to stay on topic talking about me and goes off on random tangents of theological topics to prove the wisdom that God brought her.

I am also a Christian myself, but she is purely arrogant and hateful. She sees it as a way to allow her to discredit and hate others.

I have no idea how I will handle this going forward. So much effort has been put to try and just be reasonable and understanding to her as possible. She just mocks and attacks me. NO COMPASSION AT ALL. I won't cut her out and she won't me. I love her, but it is hurtful being around her since I can never be good enough for her.

Genderqueertrans,asktransgender,Did and do always have/had the conviction that you mentally were/are the opposite sex than the sex you were born in and how much easier was transitioning knowing this compared to if you just would have had the desire to be a woman but not would have felt like one?,"Sorry for my long quite complex question . 

What I actually mean is the following : since very early age I can recall memories were I already thought about myself as a girl and where I already was convinced that I was mentally a girl in a boys body . I experienced by talking to a lot of other trans people that not every tg ts person feels this way . That some people transitioned because they just had the desire to be someone of the opposite sex but that they didn't feel mentally like having girl or boy brains in the opposite body . 

I was thinking about this last night . I never am scared to get "" clocked "" when I go out because I feel like they can't clock me on something that I already am ( a woman ) and I never feel like passing is what I need to achieve because I already am a woman in my experience and I already feel like a woman being between other women . Basically my conviction of mentally being a woman results in the fact that I don't feel like I have anything to prove to the world to say so . I don't feel less when being  between other girls . Sometimes I tell myself I'm just being too proud of myself but then I realise that I might be someone who fits into the trans child narrative ( I'm almost 20 now )

For those of you who always lived with the conviction of being somebody of the opposite sex mentally ( having the conviction that  your thoughts are those of the opposite sex , that you would have different brains on a scan ,... ) how much easier did this make your transition in the fact of "" never looking back "" compared to if you would have just had the desire to be someone of the opposite sex you were born in but you didn't already have the conviction that you feel like someone of the opposite sex ?

Basically my question is this : did the fact that you lived with the conviction that you were the "" born in the wrong body "" type often talked about made your transition easier than if you would have just had the desire to be the opposite sex? 

Sorry if my question comes of as confusing . I live with the conviction that my brains are that of a girl already and thus in regards of transitioning I don't feel like I am becoming a woman , I feel like I am alligning my body with my girl brains . I don't feel like the surgery or hormones are making / will be making me something . 

PS : I initially started to label myself as a genderqueer trans person because I didn't feel like I had to go through anything to be anything , so I felt like I was a woman living a genderqueer life because of my male body . Now I am in everything medically I just identify as a woman , not even as a trans woman , just a woman born with a handicap . "

buddzy,asktransgender,help edify a clueless cis dude,"I'm 100% heterosexual cis male.  I only know one transperson.  He was someone I was very good friends with when we were kids.  We lost touch toward the end of middle school.  Now we're in our 20s.  We recently reconnected online, and to my complete surprise, he is now a she.  I've never interacted with a transperson before.  So I've never had a reason until now to try to understand all this trans stuff.

I'm college educated, open-minded, and secular humanist.  I have gay friends, I dated a bisexual girl once, and I've voted for marriage equality.  I'm not a prick.  I care about people.  Human suffering in any form troubles me.  On most issues I'm super liberal, like almost socialist.  But on the issue of transgenderism, I feel like one of those really old white people who still calls black people ""negroes"" or ""colored folks.""  I've spent my life slowly but surely rejecting my right wing Christian upbringing in order to get to where I am now ideologically, so on one hand I feel like understanding and accepting transgenderism is the logical next step in that process.  But on the other hand, transgenderism is something that has always struck me as fundamentally incomparable to any other sort of thing by which one might be discriminated against.

So part of me thinks, if I just had the right information, I could go from ignorance to acceptance on this issue in much the same way I came to understand homosexuality nearly twenty years ago.  But another part of me thinks maybe, deep down, I really am one of those well-intentioned yet hopelessly bigoted old people when it comes to the issue of transgenderism.  I hope not, and I see that as potentially being a huge conflict in my ideological framework.  Especially now that I actually know a transperson personally.

Some of you are going to hate me, but this is the Internet, so whatever.  Your answers might help me become more sympathetic to the trans community, or they might reveal an irreconcilable bigotry in me that I had no idea I was capable of.  That said, the following questions are coming from a place of benign ignorance and earnest curiosity.  I don't mean anything as an attack on anyone's personal identity.  But if you feel attacked and want to respond in kind, you're welcome to do so without fear of further retaliation from me.  I'm only here to learn about your community, not argue with it.  So without further ado, here are my questions:


Is transgenderism a product of nature or nurture, or both?  Is there a scientific consensus?  What is your opinion based on your personal experience?  At what age did you realize you were trans?

My sexual orientation makes a distinction between cis women and transwomen.  Should I alter my sexual orientation to be inclusive of transwomen, or should I accept that there is a legitimate distinction to be made?

Why is the trans community coupled with the LGB community?  One is about gender identity and the other is about sexual orientation.  I could see why they might be political allies.  I can see how someone could be a member of both.  But I've never understood why these two distinguishable groups have apparently been combined into a single LGBT community.

If a pre-op transman commits a crime worthy of a prison sentence, should he go to male prison or female prison?  If a pre-op transwoman commits a crime worthy of a prison sentence, should she go to male prison or female prison?

Should a transwoman athlete be allowed to compete in female sports leagues?  Even mixed martial arts?

Do any transpeople who undergo gender-(reassignment? confirmation?) therapy ever consider taking it a step further in terms of extra genitalia?  What's stopping someone from having four boobs or two penises or both a penis and a vagina?  Or some kind of altogether novel genitalia?

Are there any cases of parents who actually put pressure on their child to conform to transgender roles?  I once met a single mother having lunch at a pub with her son who was dressed as a boy, looked like a boy, and talked like a boy, but she referred to him as a ""she,"" her ""daughter,"" and they both used the women's restroom.  My impression was that maybe she had always wanted a daughter but got a son instead.  Are there any cases where a transgender child grows up and ""changes their mind"" and reverts to cis gender?

When I talk about old times with my transgendered friend, how am I supposed to refer to her?  Back then, she was a he.  He had a male name and did male things.  Am I supposed to alter my memories and replace the old name and pronoun with the new ones?

How do you deal with childhood friends and family who have a difficult time accepting your new name and pronoun after knowing you by your former name and pronoun for so many years?  How do you deal with childhood friends and family who outright refuse to use your new name and pronoun?  In my friend's case, she didn't just pick a female name, she picked a stripper name.  And no, she doesn't strip or model or perform in any way shape or form.  It's not a stage name, it's her new, legal name.  And she doesn't put much effort into passing as female.  But I've seen her get pretty upset about being referred to as a ""he.""  Between the strong pronoun preference, the unconvincing appearance, the stripper name, and our past history, I'm finding it very difficult to be comfortable just talking to her online.  If I say ""he,"" she gets upset.  When I say ""she"" I feel like it's in spite of my own sensory perception, memory, and logic.  I feel like Captain Picard being told there are five lights.

**Edit:** I converted all the uses of ""he/she"" to ""she"" to make it easier for you all to read.  Still makes me feel like Picard when I write it though. :("
DrHonky,asktransgender,Escaping Negative Feelings.,"I am MtF and plan on joining the military (can't afford college and I think it would be a good experience.) So I can't start hormones yet. It doesn't bother me too much, but when it does I can get a bit depressed. What I've been doing lately is playing Dark Souls (partially in anticipation for DS 3) but also I make female characters and make them look like me, I did the same in Fallout 4 and being able to escape reality and be a woman, even if it's in another world is amazing. It helps me to overcome the moments of depression and sadness.

leydigcellhate,asktransgender,Realizing I'm straight and I don't know what to do now!?!?,"Over the past year, I have come to figure out I am not attracted to women, and indeed am into men. This isn't too much of a surprise, but I am finding it hard to deal with. My girlfriend/partner knows this... and is straight as well, so we're not the greatest match intimately. I guess I've come here looking for some help or experiences of other trans* individuals who may have been in relationships while transitioning and then figured out they are straight.

We've been together for 6 years and the thought of separation is not pleasant since we love each other and have a great friendship. However, it almost seems like best friends or close sisters. 

I guess I don't know how to handle a realization of my sexual orientation; one transition seems like its been enough! GAHHHH

tossinthislater,asktransgender,"People saying they love and support you, then silence","Sorry this is kind of a vent instead of a question, but any shared experiences would be appreciated

So over the last couple months I've gone through the very stressful process of coming out individually to a bunch of my family and close friends. Every phone call was preceded by sky high anxiety followed by intense relief, as everyone just said they loved me no matter what.   I started presenting as myself more and more, until I was confident enough to do so everywhere.  

I get lots of feedback that I pass and am pretty.  I really feel good about myself.  I want to just BE myself, I made a short but nice coming out post on facebook, that this has been hard for me and I appreciate all the acceptance from family and friends I'd gotten so far, changed my name, pic etc.  Got some very good replies, I was even surprised by some heartfelt words from people I never would have guessed.

I have been spending more time out and about since then than I ever did before, having fun with friends and really looking forward to life.

But all the family I spent so much time agonizing coming out to? Radio silence. Not a phone call, not a text, no messages or comments, not even a like.  These are people that have known and loved me my entire life, who cried when it's been a long time since I visited, shared weddings, funerals, holidays and vacations with, who have shown support and care for all the events in my life.

But for the hardest thing I have ever had to do? Nothing.

I know there are probably a million reasons why - its more real now, they need time, whatever. 

It Just Hurts."
Shikhandini,asktransgender,Physical Dysphoria vs. Social Dysphoria: your experience?,"Sometime lurker, first time poster, blah blah. But I do want to say: you folks are awesome and were a big help in getting me to take action on this long overdue transition.

Part of why I didn't admit to myself that I was trans earlier in life was that I labored under the outdated misconception that dysphoria *necessarily* entailed strong revulsion &amp;/or alienation from my body as it is. It turns out that I don't utterly hate my male body, I've just desperately wished I had a female one for over twenty years. (I was also very lucky to have a not super masculinizing puberty, which leaves me able to present successfully with makeup, a wig, and some lentils in a bra; but oh did twelve year old me **dread** that this would not be the case by now!)

However, my dysphoria *is* intense and debilitating when it comes to my gender as a social identity. I hate meeting new people, especially at events like parties or mixers, because the biggest thing everyone has to go in is gender presentation. I've always felt false, awkward, and paranoid that I'll be ""found out,"" which didn't make much sense before I'd consciously admitted to myself that I'm trans, but was there nonetheless. The social effort of presenting as male has always felt like being an actor cast for the wrong role—Sean Connery as a buffoon, Tom Hanks as a megalomaniacal villain, Keanu Reeves as capable of expressing a variety of emotions (huh, why so 90s?)—I hope you get the picture (and that his doesn't derail into a debate about actors); whereas the thought of social engagement as a woman feels so right and liberating. I made excuses about shyness and a supposed lack of social talent for years, but it's only gotten worse the more I've grown into being a man (shudder), and the few times I've been able to present socially as a woman I felt so at ease. In short, I've been trying to pass as male ever since social gender started being enforced on me as a kid and I'm becoming worse at it the older I get.

Disentangling these two categories of dysphoria has been really helpful for me in coming to terms with my identity, but it's not something I've seen someone else talk about in similar terms. How does your experience compare? Does your dysphoria take only one form, does it break down into these categories or some other set?"

I'm guessing that the reason is obvious, since I'm changing it to a girl's name.  And I assume they will ask as part of my court appearance, but the fact that they haven't asked yet struck me as very odd.  Among my trans siblings who have legally changed their name, is this 'normal'?  "

It has gone from being a slow aching to something I'm thinking about all the time but I don't know how to express who I think I might be to everyone else, or even myself.
I've never been given the chance to explore my more masculine side so I have no idea how, and my parents would be extremely unsupportive if I came out to them so that's a no for now (live at home). 
If anyone can give me any sort of advice on how to explore who I could be or even just how to cope I would be forever grateful. I cant do anything with my long hair either because my mother in particular believes I must always look feminine.

I'm sick of that image that stares back at me

I'm sick of that thing that hangs from me

I'm sick of these arms that remind me of past

I'm sick of these moods that come on so fast

I'm sick of my emotions running all over me

I'm sick of that mirror not showing she

I'm sick of my feet and their gigantic presence

I'm sick of nerves and their unsettling essence

I'm sick of seeing her beauty and wanting it so bad

I'm sick of overthinking things and being sad

I'm sick of hearing that former name

I'm sick of them thinking this is all a game

I'm sick of the look I get at first glance

I'm sick of them not even giving me a chance

I'm sick of religion and it's poisoning grasp

I'm sick of bad memories and their suffocating grasp

I'm sick of not wanting to eat because of my weight

I'm sick of society and their undying hate

I'm sick of the clouds and all of the rain

I'm sick of of disappointment and constant pain

I'm sick of my black and white existence

I'm sick from waiting all of these years

I'm sick of being consistently impatient

I'm sick of all these unnecessary tears.


But I'm not sick, I'm healing.

I'm not dying, I'm living.

Eager to advance

Eager to conquer

Eager to dance

Shunning fears


I'm becoming me

Can't you see

Negativity flee

You can't destroy me

I don't think I ever even realized how bad my depression was until I learned what the alternative could be. I've really come to understand how devastating it's been for my social and professional life. Fortunately, I don't suffer from any suicidal thoughts or deep penetrating sadness but my depression often takes the form of total pervasive *apathy*. There are alot of days where I just don't want to talk to or see anyone - yet simultaneously yearn for human connection. I don't want to get out of bed most days despite knowing there's alot expected of me. All of this is exacerbated when I'm in boy-mode or feeling even the slightest bit male/dysphoric. "
yo2345,asktransgender,Do anyone know something about transitioning in Argentina?,http://cdn.meme.am/instances/64941919.jpg
TheLivingExperiment,asktransgender,Did you send an email to coworkers? If so could you share to help others with theirs? Here is mine,"It was hard for me to find good professional templates to use for my letter to my coworkers that I wanted to send out prior to full time. I did a ton of searching but couldn't seem to find much out there outside of [this](http://www.entirelyamelia.com/2013/10/28/today-i-come-out-at-as-trans-at-work/) one that I liked. So sat down, spent about 6 hours working and reworking this using hers as a template so I didn't miss anything (and she words things nicely). 

So to help others when this time comes for them I wanted to post what I sent out, and thought it might be good to have others post theirs. It can suck trying to figure out how, and what, to say in a professional realm so hopefully this can help somebody. This community has helped me a ton, and I want to try to give back to it. 

Anyways here is the letter to coworkers:
&gt;Good morning!

&gt;I know this email is a bit long, but this took me a bit to compose this so I hope you take a few minutes to read through it. I've attempted to keep this as brief as I reasonably can. 

&gt;Since I've started here, my physical appearance has changed a lot. It might be obvious to some people about the reason behind these changes, but perhaps not. In either case I've done my best to keep my professional life very separated from my personal life. But now I'm at a point where those can no longer be kept separate and that is the reason for this email. 

&gt;I am transgender. It's who I've always been and will continue to be. Over a year ago I realized I could no longer refuse to accept it, and I knew what that meant. So I started down the path to transition to live my life as the person I am, not who others (or society at large) thinks I should be. Since I started down this journey I haven't looked back, except to reflect upon how I am not the person I pretended to be, and it's helped me become happier than I've ever been before. 

&gt;Perhaps the easiest way to explain what being transgender is would be to say that I identify as a woman, but it's more than just that. I've felt this way my whole life from some of my earliest memories through to today. It's not simply about clothing, makeup, or any of the physical stuff. It's also not that I feel ""trapped in the wrong body"", but, like many trans people, am simply working to align my mental, emotional, and social lives with one another. I hope you won't feel awkward or uncomfortable around me moving forward and outside of using a new name, some different pronouns, and a different appearance things don't need to change much from how things have been. 

&gt;Starting this Monday **(date)** I would ask you to start using my new legal name, **(legal first name)** (or **(common name)** as most people do), and female pronouns (she/her/hers) moving forward. I'd also ask to please refrain from using my old name and male pronouns when referring to, or interacting, with me. Our systems are being updated to reflect my new name so there won't be any confusion from seeing disparate names in Outlook, IM, or elsewhere in our systems. I know there will be an adjustment period and know it will take time to get used to; however I ask for your understanding in this and the importance of using the correct name and pronouns. I won't take offense to honest mistakes, provided it doesn't feel intentional or deliberate, but will start to kindly and politely correct incorrect names or pronouns if needed over time. Beyond that I'd only ask that you see and treat me the same as any other woman in the office. I also do want to take a minute, just so there isn't ambiguity or uncertainty, to say that I will be using the women’s restroom; additionally there are some words (e.g. ""tranny,"" ""she-male,"" ""shim,"" ""he-she,"" ""pre-op,"" ""post-op,"" ""sex change,"" ""MTF,"" ""TGirl,"" or ""it"") that are completely inappropriate and never acceptable to use. 

&gt;There is more to this than I could ever begin to convey in a simple email and I want to keep this as short as I can. If you have questions please feel free to reach out via email, IM, or stop by my desk. I'll be happy to answer almost any respectful, and workplace appropriate, questions to demystify what being transgender really is and help to create a greater understanding of what being transgender means. I also have some resources I can link you to if you're interested that I've used to send family and friends when asked. If you would prefer to talk through personal email instead, just let me know and I can give you my personal email instead. It might seem overwhelming, but it's really not all that complicated. I, like you, am here to do my job to the best of my ability, and plan to continue doing exactly that. 

&gt;I have greatly enjoyed working with all of you since I started here. I've enjoyed the professional relationships that have developed over that time, and I look forward to continuing to develop those relationships. I appreciate you taking the time to read through this, and hope you have a good weekend.

&gt;Thank you, 

&gt;**(new name)**

Additionally I did sent one out to vendors I regularly work with just so they wouldn't be thrown off by the new female name:
&gt;Good evening,
 
&gt;I wanted to take a minute to send you a quick email to bring you up to speed on some changes that took effect today. First, and most relevant, is that my name has changed and you’ll be seeing emails from “**(legal name)**” from now on. The email account **(old name email address)** will have emails forwarded to my new account for a little bit; however, emails should be directed to **(new name email address)** to ensure that I will get them. I would also ask you to use female pronouns and either “**(legal name)**” or “**(common name)**” (which most people use) moving forward.  Secondly, I apologize in advance if you don’t recognize me right away as I don’t look the same as you may remember.
 
&gt;If you have questions, please let me know. Otherwise I look forward to continuing to work together.

All of the response I got were positive from both emails FWIW. "

So, I'm seeking advice.  Here goes the question.

Backdrop, Jan 20 or 21 my CISGF and I get in a fight, she punches me and I couldn't close my jaw for about a week. As the norm ""I'll never do it again"" I forgive. Blah blah blah.

Fastfoward to yesterday. We're chilling on the couch and she has a FTM friend she's known since he lived as a she. He has a wife, my GF (we'll call her M) starts going off on how it messes with M's head and that it's not a straight relationship. I try to calmly talk to her about how it's a straight relationship. Ya, no. She looks back at her computer and says

&gt;I'm in a straight relationship cause you (me) has a dick (I'm preop).

Minutes later she pushes her laptop off (mind you it was a gift I gave her) and the argument continues. Like the lack of sex (it's been a few weeks, and last time I had sex I cried it felt bad, betrayal really, really not enjoyable as I play the guy in bed) and since then a behavior change (in me) she's noted how I sit to use the bathroom opposed to the male standing, and of course this doesn't sit well. I remind her how I feel about the part of me. 

Well as I gather not only my laptop but hers I go to leave the house, well, she gets in my way, I turn around to go out the back she pulls my hair/shirt while holding me slaps me hard enough I can't (again) close my jaw 100%. When I did get outside she then threatens my belongings (IE Xbox One). She slams the door and locks it. When she opens it I tell her to leave, I put my knee in the door so she can't close it. I'm able to reenter. Moments later M said 

&gt; I hit you cause you're a guy! 

Then goes on about balls I don't recall all the details.

She blames this on her Bipolar Disorder, which I've known about but this is extreme, calling me male, throws a fit cause she's not getting sex when she wants it, though it was talked about how few our sex may be.

I ask, am I out of my mind to want to take a break until she seeks help? I flew her out from the east to the west. she has no family here. we live together, I'm not kicking her out, but I fear having another argument cause who knows what may come of it."

dchritina89,asktransgender,Ftm having doubts about whether to transition or not,"6 years ago when I was 20 I started transitioning, but then I lost my support system and was rejected by family, so I learned to cope with being a female. I've never been comfortable with my body, especially my private parts. I do have a beautiful 2 and a half year old daughter (her father's not in the picture). I used sex as a way of validating myself and my feminity, and had a number of one night stands. 
I'm engaged to a transgender woman. I'm actually pregnant with her child. She's made me more comfortable with my body because she loves me for who I am. But the other day she did ask me ""have you ever thought about being a guy? you don't seem comfortable as a girl."" And I opened up and told her that awhile back I was transitioning. She's encouraging me to transition again. 
She bought me boxers, cologne, and men's body wash last night. I picked out the name Riley and she's already started using it when it's just us and I'm her prince now instead of her princess. 
I really wanna start binding because I've always found my large breasts to be an annoyance and I want a packer that allows me to stand up and pee. I think one day I'd like to fully transition getting top surgery and bottom surgery (would I ever have a fully functional penis?).
But there's doubts in the back on my mind. Do I really want my daughter to go from calling me mommy to daddy? Will it still be ok, as a man for me to wear pretty nail polish (my only makeup indulgence, but I have quite the collection) and my pretty necklaces (the only jewelry I like, I don't even have my ears pierced)? My fiancée says she's always dreamed of having a husband but she's very attracted to women, will she still love me when I transition?

SmurfsAreTasty,asktransgender,"Felt like the endocrinologist was trying to be the judge of who is, and isn't, transgender. Anyone else have problems with yours?","I'm just going to get this out of the way. I'm 35. I've known things since I was 6, and before that even, but the first clear memory was about then. I grew up around very homophobic/transphobic groups of people, and having any gay/trans friends would have increased the pain of the living hell I spent my childhood, teens, and 20's in. I have so much PTSD, that I actively avoided going into the military and explaining why to people, because I knew I would most likely be another horrible statistic. My life has been one of a complete lack of trust for anyone, inability to be close, and a self-hatred/homophobia/transphobia that I had been trying to destroy with help from alcohol or drugs. So being ""ME"" infront of people I don't know is an extremely difficult thing for me to do.

This leads me to my appointment today with the endo. He's a VERY knowledgeable person and was the personal White House doctor to two living Presidents. The guy has experience out the wazoo in many different fields of medicine.

I've never really gotten medical help before. And when I had, someone else was usually with me. I have a REALLLLLLY hard time expressing and explaining myself in words. I get lost in thought. So when my Endo wants to here WHY I feel I need HRT, it comes out as a mis-mash of different events in my life when I explain it to him. He also asks me ""Have you dressed full-time and gone out often?"" .... If I didnt have a crushing social anxiety, SURE, I'd love too. ""Do you have many friends who know?"".... Two. But That's actually all the friends I have.... ""How about your family?"" .... Mom knows, brother says 'whatever', deftly afraid of telling my dad. But, I'm working on that with my therapist. ""Ok. Well, understand there will be affects. *lists off what I already researched*."" ""Now, also with the adjustments to hormone levels, there are certain surgeries that will affect these levels. Are you planning on these?"".... Y..y..yea... ""Ok."" He then explains to me about how I can stop taking them after 6 months if I don't feel right, and be able to reverse/stop most changes.

I'm probably just being a little too sensitive, but it really seemed like he was asking some questions to gauge how serious I was about things. I just hate that feeling of being judged.... But I better get used to it.

user32852835,asktransgender,How do I deal with a neighbour who holds transphobic views?,"hi everyone

I'm living in a very close neighbourhood where everyone knows one another pretty well. It's rural, so everyone helps each other out with tools, knowledge, vegetables, fruit, etc. It's a pretty sweet arrangement and I love living here.

We have at least half our number who are LGBTQ+, though I'm the only one (that I know of) who identifies as trans. Only a couple of folks here know my identity because I'm not really comfortable with everyone knowing yet. We have some christians who may not agree with being LGBTQ+, but they very much keep it to themselves and have a good relationship with everyone anyway (e.g. the catholic family who lives next to the lesbian couple, and their relationship is very good).

A single lesbian woman lives by herself and I just found out that she holds transphobic views. I called her out gently on it, but suddenly I feel very uncomfortable here. She uses language like ""all women"" but I feel that it's now loaded to exclude me, even though she has no idea of my identity. She wants to hold women's spaces here, but I no longer feel welcome and the more I think about it, the more upset I feel. I feel very alone all of a sudden.

How can I deal with this?"
genderjourneying,asktransgender,How to stop being regretful over lost time?,"I was born physically male but with a more female personality. I had a fairly miserable time in a single-sex school, I didn’t know how to make friends, all the other boys just seemed to want to hurt me and I didn’t have a clue why. I thought I was acting just like them, I was often even excelling academically, but I didn’t care about sports, and I didn’t know how to banter, and I really didn’t have any idea what was going on around me.

When I hit puberty though I knew something was very wrong. Obviously wrong. All the other guys at my school all started to want to get girlfriends, I started desperately wanting to be a girl. I knew I had feelings for other boys in my class. I wanted to only hangout with them, to be put in the same group as them, and wanted to spend my entire day with them. This was all I could ever think about. Sadly, I didn’t understand my feelings at the time and I kept thinking to myself if this sensation of infatuation, only a phase. I did not want to label myself as gay, it seemed so wrong I could not even mention it. I felt like I needed to be a girl! I told my mother and she had such a tirade I shut down emotionally. I never would have told my father when he was alive. 

I’m 32 now, and this feeling won’t ever just go away. It’s hard to explain, and I have basically tried to suppress it all, but I know that it is there under the surface all the time, and it gets harder and harder to carry on knowing that I’ll never get to really be the person I want to be, and people won’t ever see the real me or understand why I behave the way that I do. I still present as male for now, but I have very feminine posture, body language and mannerisms, and predominantly female tastes in music and media. I started taking hormones for 5 months and they have brought a lot of relief for me personally. 

I’m wishing I could have been braver about telling the truth about myself when I was a teenager. I’m wishing that this current ‘transgender’ movement had existed back then to this degree in the public consciousness, as I might not have felt so afraid and all alone. I’m wishing that I hadn’t spent half my life in the closet, trying to convince both myself and my family I was ‘straight’ but knowing that I actually had no real feelings of wanting to do those things, and consequently never doing them. I never knew how to express that I am female and I'm exclusively attracted to me. It's difficult for me to me to admit, but I am a woman. Maybe there was no point to the post, but it sure made me feel better."

EmInCO,asktransgender,Awkward stealth situation,"I've never asked a question here before, but I've begun having to deal with something awkward and thought I could get an idea how to best handle it.

For quick background... I ""transitioned"" what I consider to be a while ago. I started hormones about 5 years ago (almost 6 actually!) and had my surgery a little less than a year ago. I'm 23 and I moved to a new state this past August (post surgery, etc) for grad school, but also to become completely stealth. I didn't want anyone to know anything about my past pre-transition. I'm from CO... that might be confusing with my tag. 

That's where my question comes in. I moved to an area that I thought would be equally if not more accepting, but it's much more conservative than I expected (I don't want to say where that is). I overhear a lot of snide and even outright rude comments and jokes directed against the trans community, especially against trans women. These comments are said amongst what they believe to be only cis individuals. I really doubt that these people would say anything like that when facing an actual out trans person. 

On a few occasions I've definitely not hesitated to question or stand up against these types of people, but it also kinda clashes with being fully stealth. I don't want to argue the faults or merits of being stealth, obviously it's important enough to me that I've gone to significant lengths to ensure it. How then, can I handle these issues? Do I just have to continue picking my battles and trying my best to ignore it the rest of the time? Aside from simply outing yourself, which I won't do, how would you handle this kind of situation? "

Machoire,asktransgender,"Coming out to conservative parents, while living literally next door in the house they've bought.","TL;DR - How do I come out to conservative parents and who own the house we're living in? How do I even start the conversation?

Long version ~
I'm in the unfortunate position of being out to my sister and friends, and not my parents. I've been seeing a therapist since April/May of last year, and just did my second injection of T earlier today - both of these things my parents are completely unaware of.

My parents have their house and recently bought the house next door, which is where my husband and I are currently living after previously living in their house. They're paying the mortgage and we're paying the electricity/gas. My therapist suggested making out a lease to try preventing them from kicking us out, but I feel like that may raise suspicions?

A bit of background: My dad was stay-at-home for all my life, my mom was Military, and I've had short hair + wore masculine clothes since I was old enough to chose for myself. I've never been very feminine but due to my mom having short hair + not being very feminine herself, I'm afraid they just see me as a ""girl"" who simply prefers to ""look masculine"" which..isn't the case.
My husband on the other hand is feminine-inclined (genderfluid but not out to my parents either) and though my parents like him enough, they frequently insult him for not being ""manly"" (ie they call him derogatory gay slurs, mock his clothing choices, etc. and when he gets upset they brush it off as a ""joke"" and ""don't be so sensitive"").
Basically masculinity = good, femininity = bad (my sister became more feminine during high school and my dad hated it, and still hates it). I really dislike thinking that this might be ""beneficial"" for me but, well, there it is.

Anyways. I'm going to have to come out to them sometime this year as I've recently began taking testosterone and the physical changes are gonna be happening. I doubt I could avoid the issue once my voice begins to drop haha.

I have no idea when to tell them or how. I can work up the courage to tell them but once I'm in the same room with them I just stall out. I've thought about emails (they're not email people) and I've thought about letters (we live literally right next door to each other). I'm still inclined to tell them face to face but it scares me.

Worst case scenario they freak out and want us out of the house, and I'll be disowned and we'll be homeless. We do however have my husband's family a couple states south that we've come out to and have accepted us both with open arms, so I guess there's options there.

Anything less than that would be fine by me.

They're not religious so I guess I won't have to worry about that? They do have a history of estranging themselves from all our relatives (it's literally only my parents, my sister, and myself now - no aunts or uncles or half-siblings, but a lot of them do do drugs and are awful people in general) and I'm afraid they'll have no problem kicking me from their lives.
Also. My dad has said multiple times that, despite not agreeing with gay/trans* people, that they can do whatever they want because he doesn't care (my therapist said this might be good?).

This is the main cause of stress in my life and I think about this every day, especially when I'm around them. I hate lying to them and it feels like such a lie letting them assume I'm someone I'm not, and conceding to it."

I'm just wondering."
Lauren111,asktransgender,That point in depression,"I have had some hard months. I was sad enough to try to end it. Some consider that means for a second chance. But when I realized all my friends were gone, my inability to make new ones, I realized how unimportant I was. Like if I were gone, who would care? All I wanted was to be a girl. My FFS failed me. People still tell me I dont pass. I've failed. In 100 ways. And there comes a scary point where no longer are you trying to get better, but rather just wanting it to be over.

I had a dr who tried to perscribe me drugs that would make me fat, kill my sex drive, give me seizures if I drink. All of it would kill the situation. They don't get it. I had a therapist who was so so awesome. But no therapist knows how to treat an unpassable trans person. In order to move on you have to get past that feeling. But it just doesn't matter. I wanted friends, I wanted to be a girl, but I failed so miserably.

Anyone who tells you its better to be hated for who you are than love for who you are not... is so utterly and completely wrong. Its so damn worse. "
SecretOfficerNeko,asktransgender,Dealing with loneliness and lack of people I can turn to?,"So, how do I deal with having no support network, and more importantly having no one who can relate to you in real life?

I've looked for support groups in my area, and there are none, at least none that are within a distance I'd be able to travel with my limited transportation resources. I've tried LGBT groups as well, but they are all LGB, and I don't really feel as comfortable around them to be open to them typically. Online is alright, but I always feel like a burden if I'm not being positive, and don't generally get any feeling of support or comradeship from sites.

In the end, I have no one who I can go to in person for advice. I've got no group that can help me figure things out, or help me with this confusing and jumbled mess of attempting to transition, and in general I'm just bloody lonely as all hell, even when I'm in a group.

What am I supposed to do. I'm just overall feeling, overwhelmed, wholly incompetent at life in general, discouraged, isolated, scared and doubting my own ability to really do anything at all. In addition, I feel like no one of the people I know really care, or give any shits about me whatsoever, and I have doubts that they will really care, or provide any support, in the short and long term.

Older_Wiser2,asktransgender,MtF ??? What am I ???? Now I'm not sure how to describe myself ......,"This is a new journey for me and at times I wonder just what am I ....  Am I MtF transgender? Am I transgender at all? Am I just dazed and confused? Does it even matter????

My story in a nutshell (no pun intended) is that I've wanted to be female since my earliest memories which I vividly recall at age 5. I'm now 67... But I came from an era where things like this were never discussed - at least not openly. I still don't discuss this with the exception of a gender therapist I started seeing last year and my ""support group"" --- everyone here on this reddit transgender community.

I have some medical conditions which my primary care doctor said could lead to a diagnosis of AIS or some type of androgen insensitivity. But, born male, I lived a normal male life - got married - kids - divorced - retired - etc. But two years ago, medically, my hormones went haywire. That led to first developing gynecomastia and then to fully feminized breasts which are very ""full"". And it seemed my prayers as a five year old child were finally being answered. 

I started a DIY program a little less than two years ago after it was clear my body was being fueled by estrogen. And that led me down a new path and a new life. Now I can't imagine myself without estrogen running my system. Even the thought of building my testosterone levels back up and blocking the estrogen is repulsive to me .....  BTW - my latest blood work showed my total T at &lt;3 and my E serum at 206.

BUT - that leads me to the question of ""what am I?""  --- I present as a male and it would take far too much work (and money) to try and ""pass"", I feel good about my looks and I would make a very ugly woman for sure anyway,  but I love being feminine. I have developed fairly large breasts which I can no longer hide nor would I want to, my skin has softened a lot, I have curves, friends say I look ""younger"", and I've started using just a small amount of makeup - not so much that you can tell but just a bit to soften up my face and the dark circles and bags under my eyes. Although it's not noticeable, it is in my mind's eye ... I can almost ""feel"" the makeup and that's the part I enjoy...

NOW - What am I??? I believe there's a continuum where on each end is a cis gender ... and then there are shades of grey .... I've had people say to me that you're either male or female - nothing else. But I know that's not true - or at least I ""think"" that's not true.

I'm male - I love embracing my feminine side - I love the estrogen fueling my body - and I love being considered in some way female. 

*Please help me -- what am I??? Does the term ""transgender"" even apply to me as I'm not making the medical transition from male to female?*

JustAMadi,asktransgender,Could I possible get some answers dealing with going back to school and transitioning?,"I feel like I am currently stuck in a rut in my life. One option I have is to go for the Computer Science degree I used to aim for before the mess I call my teen years.

Some basic info:

* I am 25 years old.
* I live in California.
* I will most likely try to go back to school starting next year.
* I am a pre-everything transgirl.
* I already have a degree. I used to actually wanted it but near the end, my feelings changed and it was too late to move into other majors due to how impacted things were at the school. Plus, they don't do second Bachelor's which doesn't help that much - at least in terms of housing and my current job.
* I am currently living with my parents and have a job that helps out enough for bill payments.
* I am currently losing weight so that I can start HRT at some point as well (50 pounds lost in two years so far!) and I hope to lose more so that I can have a good base weight for starting HRT.
* I would have to take out a loan since:
 1. I would have to move out from where I currently live which means I won't have a feasible way to make it to work.
 2. I don't make enough currently (after paying bills) to save up.
* I am also hoping to get an on-campus job, mainly so I can pay back the loan and hopefully other bills that the loan cannot cover.

The big questions:

* Generally, would it be a good idea to go back to school either way?
* I have seen that some schools have HRT in there student insurance plans. Would it be a bad idea to look more at those schools, even if the tuition is higher? On the other side, how does health insurance payments fit into student loans for those without jobs?
* Is there a way to stay on-campus over the summer and winter breaks? I mainly do not want to move back into my parents' house each time since I am hoping to transition and I know they won't approve of it. 
* Is there anything else I need to know that could possibly help me figure this all out? Any good resources or links? I already have a few in my folder and I am still trying to understand student loans but more info is always helpful."

She says she needs more time, that's she's still adjusting. Is it even remotely possible that she will ever come to know me as I am?

I can talk in a higher pitched voice (like everyone can) but whenever I do so, my Larynx doesn't really do anything, and it's literally impossible for me to talk when I'm 'flexing' it.

DrKath,asktransgender,"[Tw: assault, sexual Assault] Assaulted. I'm fine but now I'm fearing for my safety. How do I make the fear go away?","Hi reddit.

I was assaulted last night. It ended well but it was a close call.
I was going back to my place with a friend after exiting the movie theatre, it was 10pm and dark outside. It's a short walk but unfortunately we ran into 4 guys, one of them looking for trouble. I'd say they were 17,16,14 and 12. 

The youngest one asked us for cigarettes very aggressively. We answered that we don't smoke and my friend adds that smoking is bad in a joking manner to lighten the mood. And boy it escalated quickly. He pushed me from the back asking ""are you saying this because you're racist?"" (they were of North African origin) we said of course not (what does that even has to do with everything).

They started looking for even more trouble, surrounding us and stuff. And that's when I get the scare of my life. One of them clocks me ""omg it's a man!"" they start getting really close, asking questions. All I do is repeat ""I'm a woman"" but they don't believe it. My friend tries to get us out by saying ""please, we're cold we just want to go home"" but they don't listen. They start misgendering me and calling me names. One tries to steal my phone in the confusion and I stick my hand to my pocket to prevent him.

One slaps my ass. I'm getting very scared, one of them starts to unzip my coat and I can already see myself naked in the cold in front of them, humiliated, then beaten up or worse. I want to cry but keep a strong face. ""I'm a woman"" ""we just wanna go home"" we repeat, but they grab us to prevent us from leaving.

But this day luck was on our side. The oldest one suddenly says ""hey we got no problem with this it's not our business"" the second oldest starts agreeing with him. And they pull out the youngest ones out of our reach, restraining them to stop and telling them ""those things never end well, leave them alone"".

And we proceed to go home. I'm so shocked I couldn't even cry. I've never been so scared in my life. My friend hugs me. I can't help thinking that if she wasn't here I was done for. 

I had a nightmare about it this night. And today I can't help thinking about it.

How should I handle such a situation ? I was so scared I could only repeat ""I'm a woman""

How do I stop fearing? It's been 3 months since I was last clocked by someone. Maybe I should've shaved my face again before the movies. It may be my voice. Idk what clocked me. Now I'm back to square one. All the confidence I had in my appearance has been crushed. I see a man in the mirror today. I'm so scared. I'm probably not gonna get lucky next time. 

How do I stop fearing when going outside? how do I get this out of my mind?

Thanks for reading. And sorry for the bad story.

Cheers. Kat"

jnb64,asktransgender,"What's the best way to respond to ""don't label yourself"" when talking about transgender issues?","Ally, not trans myself. I recently read through some Youtube comments (I know, I know) where people were arguing about gender. There was some typical transphobic stuff from total lost causes, but there was much more troubling ignorance from people who I know to be generally decent and not at all hateful.

I won't link unless someone requests and I won't copy-paste either, but basically, their ignorance could be boiled down to ""gender is just a label society has forced on us, all this transwhatever stuff, it's just accepting labels. Just be yourself, no need to use extraneous labels.""

I actually sorta hear this a lot from well-meaning folk. They think they're being supportive and informed and ""fighting the man"" with their anti-label, ""just be yourself"" message while completely ignorant of how their treatment of the subject of gender is *exactly why* trans people can't ""just be themselves.""

How do you handle this sort of situation? What do you say? I don't want to lecture anyone, especially since it's usually from otherwise-pleasant people who aren't lost causes, but at the same time, this ""anti-labels / be yourself"" view of gender is very frustrating and I feel the need to speak out against it."
tgpineapple,asktransgender,Hiding HRT (and other assorted questions),"Hola! I went to a GP today who previously referred me to a psychiatrist to enter the HRT process...in August. But today, I asked if he was willing to do informed consent because the wait was so long and he agreed and asked me if I could have blood drawn and I said yes, and 2 days after my 18th, I can start HRT :D (Sorry I just really wanted to get that out because I'm super duper excited).

Alas, I have a couple problems. First, my parents are convinced, still, that it is a phase and has been for the last three and a half years. I've told them none of my visits to psychologists about it because they are hostile people who will try to force me to be '""normal""'. I'm MTF, and I need to hide it from them. I'm not doing a good job so far because I wear makeup and nail polish that's super obvious as a jabbing protest, but I think the more severe effects of hrt are going to be prominent. 

So:

1. How long can I realistically hide the effects from them? If you want, you can share your experiences with it, I like reading people's stories :)
2. How do I go about hiding the various effects? I've read about sports bras from older posts, and I don't expect them to grow in until later on, and women both sides of my family have smaller breasts anyway. I have a very soft face already, and not too worried about that, but what about fat redistribution? Is that fairly prominent?
3. My GP is planning on putting me on spiro and likely Estradiol Transdermal Patches. Where's the best place to put the patches to avoid them being seen? (Also any opinions on the patch vs pills and injections are nice too)
4. I haven't been practising a feminine voice too often, but how hard is it to maintain both a masculine and a feminine voice? I plan to drop the masculine one after a year or so. 
5. Is there a clear list of things I need to watch out for in the first month of starting hrt? I know there's mood swings that I'll need to contain (because I get snappy and my parents sometimes get violent), but are there any other things I need to watch out for?
6. I'm 159cm tall and about 50kg - so rather skinny. Do you usually gain or lose weight after starting? And if you gain, is it difficult to lose weight; and if you lose, is it difficult to gain? I don't want to put myself in a dangerously underweight situation.
7. I'm definitely going to come out on facebook, and I plan to post a picture of the meds I'm taking rather than a wall of text - kind of like a clue if people want to look it up. Anyone do something similar, or opinions on this? I've left people confused about my gender because in the past I've been ambiguous about it and I owe some friends an answer.
8. My brother consistently calls me his 'big sister' or 'mother' and I think he's mocking me, but he might be clueing onto things. He's 12 now, and I want to explain to him what's going on. What's the best way to open a conversation about it?
9. I live in an area where I've not seen or heard of anyone that's transgender. My GP (who is lgbt friendly) in the area had only one patient before me and that was 4 years ago. Anyone in a similar situation, and have experiences to share? I feel sort of lost and alone. 
10. Last question, sorry. Now that I'm so close to the next step, I suddenly feel strange that at one point I was questioning it but in my mind I quickly assured myself that I was definitely transgender, but from time to time the question pops up again. I remain sure of it, but part of me thinks that I might be wrong. Anyone else feel like this?

Thruway234,asktransgender,Is there any medical reason for having to take a drug test before getting hormones or is it just another hoop to jump through?,"So I've unexpectedly become able to take hormones recently, and naturally I want to start ASAP. Problem is, my therapist made me aware that I need to pass a drug test before starting, which is something I'm incapable of doing right now. However, I do have a friend that is clean and willing to help me out, but I want to make sure I haven't somehow missed something about the test.

I didn't remember anything about a drug test when I read WPATH in the past, and after rereading it again it still wasn't there.

If absolutely necessary I can get clean and just take the test myself, but that would mean waiting longer to get hormone therapy; call me impatient but I really don't want to wait any longer. 

So, after doing research nonstop for years about transition, and recent research specifically for the drug test I have found no actual medical reason for it. Despite this though, I just wanted to ask you guys to make sure. Is the drug test actually for my medical benefit in any way or is it just another obstacle on the path to transitioning?"
Elesaa,asktransgender,What happens when you go off HRT for a few days?,"Hello /r/asktransgender! I know that this is a wall of text, but I ask you to please read all of it. I'd like to know if I'm alone in this. :(

I'm 22 years old, MTF. I wanted to hear your experiences when you've been off HRT for 1 or 2 weeks. I ran out of AAs for a few days for reasons, and I experienced a serious mood shift that almost made me feel as if I was a different person. I got my AAs just yesterday and I'm so happy about it, but I still wanted to share my experience. Here is what I went through.

* I started feeling like my nasty boy bits controlled my libido and it made me feel super awkward and uncomfortable.

* I started feeling and thinking stuff that didn't feel like ME. It's almost as if I was ""possessed"" by testosterone and it filled my mind with garbage and thoughts, feelings and doubts that I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE. (Questioning your ""transness"" or womanhood, anyone? Ugh.)

* I started having spontaneous erections for looking at other women. It made me feel horrible because I was not even aroused! This makes me wish I was asexual and totally free of libido. I'm not even sure that I'm a lesbian, or bisexual, or whatever.

* The worst part is that I had a weird tingle sensation on that disgusting sausage-like piece of s*** when I looked at myself in the mirror and looked kind of attractive. I AM NOT attracted to myself and don't want to be. I as a person feel super disconnected from what my genitals are going through. Why is this happening!?

* I went from a state of inner peace, happiness and security in my womanhood that estrogen had given me, to a state of constant worry and anxiety. I went from feeling like I AM a woman to feeling like I want to be one. I know that I'm one, but gosh... This is horrible. I feel like my body, feelings and thoughts are betraying me.

I'm so glad that I'm on HRT again, I started just yesterday but I trust it will take away all of that bullshit that I don't want to experience. It seriously makes me feel bad and I wish I could just get rid of it, but it feels as if my body was tangled in a huge spider web. The more I squirm, the more powerless I feel. I have dealt with crippling anxiety and ""what if"" doubts before, so there's also that. I feel like being off hormones has brought it back.

What are your thoughts and experiences? Thanks! :)

PS: Just a clarification, I did NOT start transitioning for sexual or kinky reasons and would probably end my life if I was not a woman, but a guy transitioning for sexual reasons. I also wish I could get rid of this tingle feeling I described earlier because it feels at odds with who and what I am. I'm on the verge of tears as I type this."

I am a male in my late 30's and I have been crossdressing since I was 6. For a few years I have been struggling with an addiction to shemale porn. I have recently wondered if that could be due to suppressed transexual feelings/identity. I have been wondering if I am a transvestite fetishist, due to feeling very aroused about wearing female clothes, but when I watch shemale porn I fantasize about being in those ladies shoes. 
Has this been a way for me to act out my transexual identity? Right now I am wondering, and I have this nervous feeling, kind of like butterflies in the stomach whether these are real feelings or not. Its occupying my mind quite a lot and I have been wondering if it might be transexual feelings coming to the surface? I am a bit confused and am wondering about seeing a specialist. Is there anyone else that can identify?"

M995,asktransgender,How to reassure myself my trans thoughts are valid whilst at the same time intrusive thoughts I have are not valid?,"Hi everyone.

Basically I have recently been having really bad intrusive thoughts after receiving some potentially threatening health news regarding a defective gene. I'd rather not go into the nature of my intrusive thoughts as they are disturbing but I am seeing a therapist about them who knows about them so I am getting help.

I was just wondering how I can reassure myself that my trans thoughts are valid whilst my intrusive thoughts aren't? I feel unhappy and scared and disturbed by them for the most part. However my trans thoughts make me feel happy as I like imagining myself as a woman and having a body that is more feminine. I think that says a lot given that transitioning will come with a lot of hardships. 

I also feel like it's OK to admit I may be a bit uncertain about my trans thoughts but my happiness around them means I shouldn't worry too much about it. If it seems like the right thing to do then I shouldn't worry about it.

Do you think that makes sense? Perhaps I'm just looking for others to say ""yeah you're right lol it's all good"" but yeah let me know what you think.

Hope you all have a nice weekend! "
ohtowthahreryn,asktransgender,Is it possible to accept the fact that you can never become the person you want to be?,"Hello,

I'm 21, male. This is a throwaway. I don't think I'm transgender, but I'd prefer being a girl over the current state of my body. I hate it. It would be a perfect body for a stereotypically masculine person bursting with confidence. The problem is, I fucking loathe typical male behaviour and clothing. The endless competition, having to prove yourself to be a ""real man"", the lack of intimacy and emotions, working out, muscles, weights, gyms, it just makes me want to throw up. The same is with clothes. I hate wearing button-down shirts, hell, I'm uncomfortable even in polo necks. Suits are just abysmal. ""Look, I'm wearing a yellow tie, I'm so creative"" It's a fucking suit. It's fucking boring, no matter what color your tie or shirt is.

Sorry, I just needed to get that out.

I find stereotypical girls just as repulsive, if a little less. Probably because of the lack of violence. I've never been a violent person and I'd never want others to perceive me as threatening. Sadly, with the way I look right now, they sometimes do.

Girls can wear anything and they look ""good"", because that's what society thinks and therefore they are allowed to. (Of course they're criticized for their dress sense all the time but I'd take that over getting beaten up.) Ideally, I'd want myself to look like a girl, sans boobs, plus penis. And wear all the things I'd like. And be sweet and pretty and cute and harmless.

That is impossible. I'm 6'3, hairy all over, and it'd never look normal if I tried ""transitioning"". Sure, people always say that there is a way, but trust me, there isn't. There's absolutely no way. I would never look normal. I'd always look odd and out of place. Unless there is some kind of technology to shrink my body by 15% it's im. pos. si. ble.

I think I'm pansexual. I've been in love with both boys and girls, though never actually tried either. I guess girls sense that something's off with me. I don't think I could become the kind of person that heterosexual girls are all about. With guys, it's extremely rare that I meet one that I like, I mean both physically and emotionally. And even then they're always straight.

Right now, the only solution that seems possible is to just supress these feelings and just force myself to be a cishet guy. I'm currently a failure of a cishet guy. I have no idea how I should do that. Or if it's possible at all.

I'd love some insight from someone with more experience than me. Thank you for listening."
[deleted],asktransgender,I'm in crisis and I could really use some support on getting out of this rut,"Every second thought is pushing me to cut and I'm trying to refrain myself from doing it otherwise I would be undoing all that effort from not cutting. But I can't help but think this way when every time I look in the mirror I just see this person that doesn't even remotely look closely to what I would like. I see my scars on my leg, my weird torso and just everything else, it's getting too much.

I fucking hate myself even for just how I act and I just wish I'd simply stop existing. It's getting too much, how am I supposed to even enjoy my life like this! I hate my body, I hate my voice and I hate everything.

At this point I guess I'm just spurting out my feelings in this post, I'm sorry. I just don't know what I'm doing with myself, I just want these terrible feelings to go away but I can't escape them and I feel so alone with them. 

How do I get myself out of this, because my only escapes are the destructive ones."
ashergerbilmaster,asktransgender,"What to do when you first come out, but you're too nervous to try and change things?","About a year ago Ive came out as being trans, but it's only seemed to make things worse. I feel uncomfortable being called my birth name, but it's even worse when people call me 'Ash,' the name I prefer, and think I mean 'Ashley' and continue to still call me a girl and use 'her' and 'she.' Even my mom calls me 'doll' and didn't help me tell my extended family about my gender, but instead said all I wanted was to change my name.

I feel sick thinking about how many people still associate me with being a girl. I asked my dad to try and adjust and instead just cried and made comments on how he didn't like the first and middle name I have been thinking about.

It's worse at high school. Im too shy to speak up due to social anxiety so most teachers call me by my given name, only 2 of them call me by 'Ash' or 'Asher,' but one of them uses my given name and 'Ash' interchangeably. I rarely go to the bathroom because Im too nervous to go into the boys room and going into the girls room can ruin my mood.

I dont have many friends, though my one who lives farther away and also is trans helps me out a lot. The ones I know from school dont. A few of them put in effort, but I know they still see me as a girl. The most supporting one once said people treat 'us' differently because we are 'girls.' I told her I wasn't, and she shrugged it off and said I still have a girl body...

Im really having a harder time doing things lately. Ive tried counselling, but I cant get into it. It makes me extremely anxious talking to people face to face with only me and them. I cant have family with me since they don't understand my feelings and tend to make it worse. Im afraid Ill never be able to get the hormones or surgery I want because counselling is terrifying.

Everything is really putting me down, I feel like Im not really a boy because I cant stand up for myself. Im embarrassed and feel shameful for so many things. I dont really want to deal with any of this, but I dont know how to fix it. I only feel happy with myself online or in video games because people dont know Im trans, so they act like Im a boy and they dont make things uncomfortable or confusing with stuff like 'girl bodied' or slipping up pronouns.

How can I change things to help myself feel more confident and not anxious about telling people what to call me? Sorry for making this so long, I just dont know what to do anymore."
Elesaa,asktransgender,Afraid of not being a woman/not being trans (possible TW for kind of suicidal thoughts),"Hey y'all. This is yet another long post, but if you feel like helping a fellow trans girl (YES I'M A GIRL DAMMIT, LEAVE ME ALONE FUCKING DOUBTS) please give this a read. Thanks in advance. &lt;3

It's just that. I'm feeling deep fears of not being trans or not being a woman and I have been crying for the last few hours over this. I must mention that I've been off HRT for at least a week, and got back into it just last night, so there's that.

I have always had a deep fear of being ""just a guy who deluded himself into thinking that he's a girl"" and the thought has even made me dig my nails into my skin to the point where I have almost cut myself. Same goes for the thought of being a fetishist, AGP, a guy and whatnot.

I have dealt with crippling anxiety. You know, the kind that makes you feel and live your fears as if they were real, so I'm sure that anxiety is the thing causing me to feel like this, not to mention the enormous dysphoria that I'm feeling towards my genitals right now.

While I wish I could relieve my dysphoria, I'm afraid of not being dysphoric because I'm fearful of two things:

1. Not feeling dysphoric = not being trans = going back to being a guy. Stupid, I know.

2. The horrible and crippling fear that my female gender identity is somehow a result of depression, that I'm ""not really trans"" (god please nooooo) and that I'll just ""de-transition"" into a happy guy (typing this actually made me tense my stomach muscles and start crying again).

I don't want to be a guy. I don't even want to be the happiest guy alive. I'd rather be a girl living with crippling dysphoria for the rest of her existence instead of being a guy. I don't even want to be a guy that looks like a girl, a feminine guy, whatever.

I want and need to be female in mind, spirit and body, dammit. Why is my mind playing these tricks on me!? Why can't it just accept and internalize that MY GENDER IS FEMALE!?

I must mention that I've been living almost fulltime except for specific social situations since August of 2014. The thought of being a deluded boy that is living AS A GIRL, but is not really a girl, makes me feel like grabbing a shotgun and shooting the shit out of my guts and entire existence.

I'd normally feel that this is a strong sign that I'm indeed a woman. But I'm reminded of the 3 or 4 people who transitioned, had SRS, then regretted it and went back to their assigned gender (oh my god please no :'( ) and I freak out. ""What if I'm one of these?"", I ask myself.

It doesn't help that my first specifically trans thoughts occurred during my early teens, around 14-16. It makes me feel so invalidated and fake.

Also, my [anxiety/dysphoria/whatever shit tricks my mind is playing on me] make me constantly question if I'm truly happy living as a woman. I hate it because at this stage of my life I would expect to not ask myself these questions EVER FUCKING AGAIN. They make me miserable and I can't stand having this part of my identity touched or messed with. When I stop overthinking, I often feel happy and smile when little validations or female thoughts occur, like when I realize that my boobs are growing, or seeing a bit of fat redistribution and realizing that I have some curves. Seeing my face in the mirror and realizing that I look female.

It makes me smile spontaneously and sincerely, but then my stupid intrusive thoughts come and make me ask myself ""am I fooling myself into thinking that I'm happy?"". ""Am I really just turned on by what I just saw in the mirror?"" ""Am I just attracted to women and therefore smile because I'm flirting with the woman in the mirror? (It's stupid, I know, but please bear with my irrational, idiot thoughts.). ""Am I just smiling because what I see in the mirror turns me on? (no it doesn't)"". 

And when I answer, another round of questioning begins: ""Are you really sure about what you answered? Are you really being honest? Are you not lying to yourself? Are you really happy? What does true happiness feel like? Would you be able to feel like this as a guy? Would you feel happy as a guy?""

Most of the questions to those answers are a hopeful yes, except for the last two. I have no interest in feeling happy as a guy, nor do I want to feel happy as one. I'd rather be suicidal than enjoying life as a guy. :|

I hate questioning my gender. I hate questioning the fact that I'm female. I'd do anything to not have those thoughts again. I'd even agree to become an entirely different person if it meant being able to be a normal girl who would never question her gender and that would have the fact that she's female 100000% internalized into her mind.

Please help me and tell me that what I'm going through is normal. I don't want to be a guy. I want to be trans. I want to be a girl. I want to be 1000000000000000000000000% confident about it. I NEED THIS.

Much love."

Kernaghan,asktransgender,How do you deal with being referred to as the wrong gender?,"I was going to make this as a very personal, straight to the point selfish post saying about how upset I am that I have to go to work and have customers who call me by male association 99% of the time (there was that one customer who called me androgynous many a month ago, I made a post about it too). To also have my family members, especially my mum just say how I've grown into 'this man' that she never expected. She quickly re-worded it but the initial sentence was still there, not apologised for, completely said with intent.

But enough about me, that's not what I wanted to get into so much, I want to know about you, the person reading this and maybe considering a response, how do YOU deal with being referred to by a gender that is not your gender identity? Do you accept that you don't pass as your gender identity and just shrug it off? Or are you like me and let it eat away at your psyche or mental state until the very idea of going out and being around people is a struggle at best? Do you have a coping mechanism you wish to share?

confusedthrowaway828,asktransgender,Am I Transgender?,"Okay so sorry that this is so long, but I'm going to pretty much tell my life story. I have been dealing with this for a long time and just want some sort of solid answer. I realize this question is something that is mostly a personal matter and I am the only one who can know for sure, but I've been internally struggling with this for years and I am just as confused now as I ever have been. 

I am an 18 year old boy, a virgin and have never really been in a real relationship. I have had gender identity issues for as long as I can remember. As a child(around the age of 5), my older sister would sometimes dress me up in her clothes for fun. I would always protest and pretend to be upset about it but I secretly loved it. I used to go into her room at night when she was asleep and steal her clothes, often wearing them to sleep. I also used to love playing with girly toys and watching girly movies. This was all before I had ever even had a single sexual thought, so there was definitely no sexual connotation behind any of it. I remember one specific time that always makes me laugh. My brother who is 5 years older than me tied me up, shot me with his air-soft gun, and was forcing me to watch some boring movie(surprisingly not an out of the ordinary occurrence lol) and I told him, ""It would be way worse for me if you turned on the Barbie movie!"" in an obvious attempt to try and get him to turn it on. He did turn it on and I happily watched the whole movie while tied up :)

As I grew a little older (like 3rd-5th grade), this kind of activity went away for the most part. I still felt like I was a little different but I wasn't nearly as impulsive about it. I spent most of my time trying to fit in with my friend named Ben, who went to the local public school and was my neighbor and best friend since the age of 3, and his friends. It is important to note also that, I wasn't ever ""pretending"" to be normal in order to be their friend or hiding my true feelings. I genuinely enjoyed hanging out with them and acted like a normal adolescent boy. Although I usually did not participate whenever we played sports(I never really liked sports as a kid other than swimming and skateboarding), I would have no trouble participating in other, typically boy associated, activities.

Then, when I hit puberty in middle school it became very clear to me that I was sexually attracted to men, as well as women. I was incredibly ashamed of it, as I grew up in a very religious family and attended Catholic school. I was really depressed about it for most of middle school and even attempted suicide twice. I once came out to Ben and his reaction was immediately very negative, so I responded by playing it off as a joke and deciding to keep my sexual identity to myself from then on. Around 8th grade, I eventually began to accept and even be proud of my sexual attraction towards men, while still keeping it a secret. Also around this time, my gender-identity issues started to resurface. I began cross-dressing in private quite frequently again, but now it felt more like a sexual fetish than an actual mental condition. Dressing up aroused me and as soon as I came, I would have no further interest in being in the clothes.

By the time I entered High School, Ben and I both started experimenting with drugs, mainly marijuana. I insisted on going to the local public high school, so I could go to school with Ben and his friends. This was a huge change for me because I went from an 8th grade class of 48 kids to a freshman class of 1,600. Being a very shy, overweight kid and knowing no one except for Ben and his friends, I never really made any friends outside of his friend group, which quickly became known as the “stoners”. Although I was a smart kid who was very academically ambitious and in many honors and AP classes, almost all of my friends in school were guys who didn’t give a shit about school and spent all their time doing drugs and making fun of other kids. Not the kind of kids who are accepting of lgbt people at all. Because of my shyness, I would remain stuck in this friend group for the rest of high school. Meanwhile, my sexual fantasies became even more extreme and unusual. I would often masturbate to the thought of simply acting girly and being friends girls in my classes. Nothing sexual, just being friends. As High School went on, I continued to further indulge in my sexual fantasies. I spent much of my free time at home, reading tg stories and tg captions, and watching sissy hypnos. I became obsessed with the thought of becoming a super slutty, dumb bimbo who’d let any guy fuck her. I no longer would feel ashamed after masturbating and even started eating my own cum and pretending it was that of some guy I just sucked off. I also found myself having these fantasies constantly and was unable to separate them from my everyday life like I had in the past.

In the past 2 years, it has become more than just sexual fantasies however. I started to enjoy wearing girls clothes less for the sexual arousal it gave me and more because they made me feel good in a much deeper and nonsexual manner. I decided that even if I never actually would become a girl, I still wanted to be small and have a girlish figure. So I started dieting heavily and doing yoga and squats everyday. I lost a ton of weight which made me much more outgoing and feel better about myself than ever before. Although the majority of my friends are still from the same friend group, I started becoming friends with a lot of girls also. I started to adopt some girly mannerisms and will now subconsciously do things like crossing my legs at over the thighs, talking with a lisp, and talking with my hands a lot. I also started to lose interest on the whole bimbo thing and started to imagine my female self as just that, a female version of myself.

Now I am a senior in High School and feel more confused about my gender-identity than ever before. It has gotten to the point where I actually feel like I’m faking my personality around my friends to fit in and I spend most of my alone time wearing women's clothes even when I’m not sexually aroused. I greatly look forward to next year as I’m going to college far away by myself, and planning on starting over as a whole new person. I just don’t who that person is going to be. I am still afraid that if I decide to go further into femininity and start taking hormones and whatnot, I will eventually realize that it was all just some sexual fetish and not really what I want. It seems kind of silly considering I’ve literally wanted to be a girl since before I even knew what sex was, but nevertheless, the thought still scares me. I also still have yet to come out to anyone (I plan on coming out to Ben before college though) and fear how my friends and family will react when they find out all this stuff about me.

So if you actually read all this please tell me what you think about my situation and how I should continue. Thank you so much! &lt;3"
Henchman24RIP,asktransgender,I'm in a really dark place. Again.,"I seem to find myself here with some amount of regularity. I'm sorry to those of you who are tired of dealing with me. 

I also apologize in advance for any grammatical errors and the like, I'm on 2mg of lorazepam right now, and this makes 4mg in the last 12 hours. 

I'm having an exceptionally hard time keep going. My hope is basically non-existent. 

I basically feel *worthless* and *fake.* 

I feel *worthless* because I have no real friends. I have acquaintances. Anyone who would say they are close to me, would be lying. 

I feel *worthless* because I am completely unable to find a job. I applied for a job at a local *LGBT Center* that I was perfectly qualified for. It would've been a dream job. Not only did I not get an *interview.* I couldn't even get a *courteous rejection.* I would've been working under a trans hero of mine, and that would've meant *everything* to my self confidence. 

I feel *worthless* because the only messages that I get on dating sites are from men in open relationships. Single men don't want to date me, because as a trans woman *I will always come with baggage.* They're just hoping they can fuck me, and move on. The thing is, if they saw me naked, *they wouldn't want to fuck me*.

I feel *worthless* because my parents guilt trip me over my depression, my anxiety, and how debilitating it has become. They're also incapable of emotional support.

I feel *worthless* because my lack of any money has kept me from buying anything that would help me with transition. Few clothes. No female shoes, two pairs of jeans. 

I feel *worthless* because I've missed three voice therapy sessions in a row because of anxiety attacks.

As to feeling *fake.*

I feel *fake* because I waited so long to transition, that I have to put on a wig every day. 

I feel *fake* because I have to load down with so much cheap makeup to cover up the blonde hairs that the laser sessions I *could* afford left me with that surprise. I *can't* afford electro. 

I feel *fake* because I waited so long to transition, that a year of HRT has accomplished essentially nothing, and I have to use pathetic, too-small, silicone pads in the *one* bra I've been able to find/afford that fits.

I feel *fake* because in spite of wonderful comments on my appearance from people on here, I am *always* misgendered. 

I don't think I can handle both of these things anymore, especially not when I feel *hopeless.*

My best friend told me I was a bad, mean person, on my birthday, four weeks ago, and *took herself out of my life.* 

I'm starting to *believe her.*

I *desperately* don't want to die. 

I was filled with such a euphoria after coming out. Last summer I was so happy I couldn't even believe it. I literally had not been that happy since before *puberty.* 

I've seen how good the possibilities are. I just have *no idea how to get back there, or hope that I will.*

I live so far from anywhere, that it makes it difficult to get momentum. I spend my days sleeping in late, then sitting in front of my computer, refreshing Facebook, refreshing Reddit, and binge watching something online.

When my depression gets to be too overpowering, I go and lay down, and read until I fall asleep. 

The last few days I've had trouble even doing that, because I *sob, and sob, and sob* as soon as I'm alone in that dark room. 

I've been fighting depression since I started puberty, for the same reasons so many of us did. That affected me *horribly* until I was 32, and I began transition.

The depression and dysphoria are back, back with a *vengeance.*

And I am so, *extremely tired*."

Real brief backstory- 25 years old MtF, I sort of always 'knew' I was a, A LIL BIT DIFFERENT.  5 years ago I had dawning realization that I was trans.  About 6 months ago I met another mtf online and got an enormous amount of information on the subject.   I am now on spiro, and I am going to be starting the full HRT next week.

I find myself in a constant cycle: doubting who I am, getting past that doubt, being SURE of myself, and then doubt creeps back in.  The doubt always seems very convincing, and usually makes sense.  I am afraid that maybe this is all just some sexually based fetish.

MalikaToMark,asktransgender,Should I Go Back To Living As A Guy?,"I am living full time as a woman. No HRT. No surgery. For some time now i have had this feeling of going backwards to living as a boy again. I think one of the reasons i wanted to live as a woman was because of vanity and attention seeking reason's. As a guy i was seen as an ugly gay male and as a woman i am seen as attractive, but not much anymore as i am masculinising!! 

I guess you could say i am 'dysphoric' (i don't actually know if that is what it is) about my face and voice and i wish i had a Nicki Minaj shape body and i know these are things that Cisgender men DO NOT genreally want, but, even before i started living as a woman full time (almost 2 years ago), i never once felt uncomfortable as a boy.

I mean, i wish i was a Cis girl, but i am not! I am VERY confused and i think about transition every day and think 'what if i regret transitioning', 'what if i am not really transgender', 'what if i am just doing this for the wrong reasons, 'maybe i am just mentally ill abd i have something else completly wrong with me instead of transgendersim'!! But, hear is where i get confused the thought of me having breasts and a feminine body and voice is something i like VERY much. But, not having them as i don't now does not make me feel uncomfortable. Like, when i see a beautiful women who gets wolf whistled, i wish i was that girl. But for what? Attention reasons? Because she is stunning? I don't know!! 

When people say 'sister' and 'daughter' i am like 'what'? When i say something i almost always say 'Son' i have been doing this alot recently. For example if somebody were to say something i would go, 'how can you say that i am your'.... and in my head i am thinking 'SON' or 'SAY DAUGHTER' in case people wonder why i have 'misgendered' myself! I would rather have a large cup size rather then a large penis size. I would prefer to be the girl in the relationship. But i don't know. I saw one counsellor and they were useless. Although they did say one interesting thing. They said 'so the worst thing for you is somebody calling you a man', and i replied 'yes'. I have often been very scared of therapists as don't feel comfortable disclosing too much information as i have had some in the past who judge me. And i have a fear i will disclose too much and they will call me insane!"
Michahh,asktransgender,Would this be described as transgender?,"I don't know if I'm using Reddit right, so I appoligize if this is wrong? Anyways this is going to be a question about transgender female to male. I've always felt like a girl. I liked all girl things like dresses, makeup, and all that jazzy stuff. But as soon as puberty hit me I changed. I started wanting the boy lifestyle, so much to the point where I was ashamed of going out in public only to be viewed as a girl. But I'm not ashamed of my body. I feel I would be happier as a male in the future, and I would definatly transition if I could! But even if I do sort out all my feelings, it comes with worry. I know I can't change now because I am going to an all girl highschool. And what if I don't fit in with boys? I still like female stuff but I don't actually want to do it. I want guys stuff.

It was also a strong motivation for me to work at school to be able to enjoy it later in life (money was an issue at that time). I have accumulated many rc boat kits over the years, and they just sit there.  
  - Socially, it was not fun, I was not really fond of social relations, social events, etc... Never got drunk ! I had only a few good friends during school.

trrrrrrrans,asktransgender,Is it weird that I was never been able to voluntarily orgasm until I started HRT [Very NSFW],"I'm gonna go over my general situation with my ability to have an orgasm, because this whole thing is just kind of weird and complicated.

I'm 16 (17 in a month) and started HRT about 8 months ago. So, up until then, I'd had a couple wet dreams, but strangely, I would never be able to masturbate. All that would come out was a bit of precum, and never anything more. I got a normal amount of erections and stuff, sure, but I just couldn't ejaculate.

Since starting HRT, I've been able to ejaculate voluntarily on occasion. I can't masturbate and consistently orgasm, but I can every once and a while. Thisis extra strange, because my sex drive and frequency of erections has been waaay decreased. 

If it's relevant, all aspects of being on HRT have been normal (as in, average changes). Also if relevant, I've always had pretty small genitals and have sort of suspected I'm intersex for a while.
So, is this normal? Has this happened to others? I've never heard anything about this happening, and it all just seems kinda weird.

confusedbookperson,asktransgender,Struggling with gender identity?,"For as long as I can remember, I've been confused about my gender identity. Since I was in my early teens (I'm currently 21) I've been cross-dressing in private, and fantasizing about being a woman during sexual arousal. In addition, sometimes I feel jealous of girls (this was a big deal for me when I was in school, dealing with puberty). I've seen a therapist for several years, but frankly this hasn't helped me in the slightest- most days I feel depressed and anxious about my identity, not really knowing if I could transition successfully if I decide to. My real question is, do I really fit the profile of the usual transgender person?"

I know no one can tell you if you're trans or not. I just know that I spend a lot of time reading websites, going on forums like this, talking to people and just having way too much anxiety about my gender identity.

I remember the first person I came out to and the only significant one that I'm still only really out to is my partner. s/he said that sometimes they are a boy and sometimes that they are a girl. And I said to them that I didn't want to be a boy or a girl. I still feel that way I don't really want to be a boy or girl. Back before then I just used to introduce myself to people just as a person. Which was half jokingly. I didn't even know this was a thing at the time. I mean I guess I don't want to be seen as a man or woman. I just want to be a person. But,then people ask ""Okay what does that mean"" What does it mean to be a man or woman? And I just don't know.

I feel I was confident with this and being me and know I'm not. I know sometimes it feels that I'd like to be a girl. And then people ""are like you can't have it both ways."" I know that I wear ""girls"" clothes sometimes. But, I don't see it that way it's just my clothes and it feels right. Is part of it a fetish where I dress in ""girls"" clothes even though that's just how I like to dress and I'm embarrassed about it subconsciously. I don't like to call it crossdressing cause it just doesn't feel like crossdressing if that makes sense. I just want to get out of my own head and feel okay with this.

It's like ""you're just doing this for attention"" But, I'm not an attention seeker I don't like to be center stage I don't like crowds. I don't know. What if I am lying to myself? What if it's a delusion. Sometimes it's brings me to the edge more recently than before. And I just want to be sure. I want to make it better. Would I have ever found out this was a thing if someone else didn't tell me first. I just don't know.

So what did you all use to make it easier for those you know to understand your gender and sexuality? If it was a chart, which one did you prefer? If not, what method did you use? Did you simply try to explain it verbally?

 says that the reason they aren't going to come is that they don't want to explain to her sons that there second cousin who was a guy is now a girl and its really bugging me first of all I wasn't going to transition (or at least go full time until high school was over).

OHMYEFFINLAWD,asktransgender,"DIYing, need to know how safe dosages are.","Have 90 pills of 100mg spiro, and 90 pills of 2mg Estradiol. They are intended to take orally. 

I however cannot get any more pills fo 6 months due to other reasons. So I have decided to turn a 3 month lasting stash into a 6 month lasting by breaking the pills in half. 


So for the next 6 months I will be taking 50mg spiro and 1mg Estradiol. I will also be taking them sublingually to get more out of them. 

About me:
19,
6ft tall,
235lbs

I did the math 
orally 5% ends up going into my blood stream - 
and sublingually 25% goes in. so - 
5% of 2 mg = .1
25% of 1 mg = .25

So actually half dose sublingually is more than full dose orally.

What do you all think? Is it safe, should I still get blood tests? Will this put me at risk for health issues like breast cancer or anything like that?


edit: I forgot that I couldn't ask for medical advice, but I just want to know if these doses will do a good enough job, to prevent any more testosterone related changes, like chest hair growth. and if i need to get blood work done since these are low doses and might not do anything.

**The Best Kind of True...**

I live in a house with 1 female human, 3 female dogs, 1 female cat, 1 female snake and a male dog.
I told my roommate about being trans shortly after starting hormones.  The very next day she's in my room talking to me and noticing all of the female dogs lying almost on top of my male dog.    
Roommate: ""Poor dog, even in your room he's still surrounded by Estrogen""

63690302,asktransgender,I feel like my gender changes all the time,"I feel like I can't keep how I feel inside to stay constant; one day I will be super happy and satisfied being a guy, and the next I'll be very happy with being feminine but depressed that I don't look how I feel inside. Usually it isn't as drastic as daily changes, mostly every couple weeks, but it is still maddening switching back and forth. It is seriously frustrating and I don't understand it.

When my mental state changes from guy to girl/girl to guy, everything about me changes; how I act, how I think, what I like, weird stuff like where I want to go to college, and it doesn't seem like a normal thing. And its not like I'm forcing my self to like these things either, it truly feels right depending on what gender I feel like.

I don't know how to feel about anything anymore, is there anything I should do to stay one gender a different way to look at this?"
demonvicky,asktransgender,How to respond to casual outing of a stranger?,"I'm a little stumped on how to deal with this, thus my question here. In one of the online games I play I was talking with someone (Let's call them Bob) over voice chat about the game and the various guilds and politics thereof etc. We got a talking about an expedition that I myself am on along with many hundreds of other players in the game when Bob mentioned a specific person (Let's call them Mary) asking if I had seen them in the group (He asked because this person would stick out due to their unique mode of transportation). I said I knew of them, but had not seen them yet and yadda yadda.

Bob mentioned that He (Referring to Mary) was a member of Bob's group secretly. I corrected him saying I thought Mary was a girl and then he said that Mary was trans. But that that was ""cool, you know whatever, no big deal"" especially since ""Mary doesn't make a big deal out of being transgender like Sarah does, all Sarah does is talk about being transgender and take offense at things, even when your going out of your way not to offend them"".

I would say that Bob was more positive about it than I am making it sound here. He was also a bit tipsy I think, not that that's an excuse. I didn't really say too much to Bob in response to these revelations, perhaps I should have. But he wasn't deliberately trying to be mean about it. Still, I don't know...

I looked the two people up after this conversation, of course, but I didn't find any public mention by them or anyone anywhere of either of them being transgender on the game sites or social media. I'm actually kinda excited that I found some other players in the game who are transgender and would love to meet them (Especially since I'm on the same mission with one of them). But I'm torn on how to approach them...

**Should I tell Mary about what her guild-mate Bob said?** I am in the same group as Mary right now so I will run across her, I see her chat in the group chat often enough. I'd actually really like to talk to her as a fellow transgender person in the game. I'm closeted myself though (Only a few friends and some family know), so I'm not sure how I would bring it up. I would have no problem telling her I'm transgender, maybe that's how I should approach it where I give first disclosure?

Once years ago I had a former-friend go around telling people I was not what I appeared to be in a game and no one told me. I didn't find out for months, and I wish I had learned it sooner but my friends whom had been spoken to just kept it quiet. In my case though the person was being malicious and using it as a character attack saying it was an example of why people shouldn't trust me.

That makes me want to inform Mary about what transpired even if Bob was being nice about it. But at the same time I don't want to stir the pot.

And what about Sarah, should I tell her anything? I don't know Sarah other than she does have a reputation for being in the center of drama (Though I never knew about the transgender angle before). This one I am more inclined to let go as I won't run into her anyway and don't really have any desire to interact with her regardless."

Pootsonnewt,asktransgender,Why does it take so long for people to get progress?,"Okay so this is my first post over so go easy on me. I should start with a little background. I'm 25 years old and 4 years on HRT and I live in NWT Canada. In this isolated community of 2 thousand people, I don't know any trans people, Ive never known any trans people and I don't spend much time online. So as I decided to find out what the whole online trans community is all about, and get in touch with people who have like problems I find a lot of discussion of people fighting and waiting for HRT, up to a month!!! or longer even?!?!?! I don't get it? 

Back when I finally decided to go for it and start HRT with no prior mental issues recorded, or any sign of being trans at all cause I kept it well hidden. I had made my self an appointment at the local clinic walked in, and walked out with HRT, a running lab requisitions for 12 months and a referral to gender specialist in Alberta to make everything legal. To top this all off when I finally got to see the psychiatrist a few months later he gave me approval for SRS in one single appointment, which I explicitly stated I did not ever want.

Why is it so hard for people to get the medical help they desire? Am I truly in my own world up in this frozen lonely hell?"
transthrowaway987,asktransgender,"Serious disarray, need help!","Okay so I'm in quite the predicament right now as far as sexuality and identity goes and I'm not sure what to do or where to go with it.

So since I was 17 I'd decided I severely wanted to transition. I never really had bad dysphoria or anything but there was always a part of me that wanted to be a girl. I'm not entirely sure how or why. For about two and a half years I repressed while talking to trans friends and seeking guidance and just generally not being sure what to do. Eventually after being told ""if you don't do it now you'll regret it when you're 30 and gave up your life to repress"" enough times I started hormones at the age of 19 in February of 2015. I was taking Aldactone and Estradiol from an online source (a d c) at 200mg/4mg. Then it got to November 2015 and I finally got my levels checked through an IC clinic and got a prescription. My levels were at no point in ""optimal"" range throughout all this time. My T wasn't quite low enough and my E was never quite high enough. However during those 8/9 months there was never any question that I wanted the effects of transition and that I wanted to be a girl. 

Now that I've been on prescription the effects have been much more potent and congruent with what I've been told. I'm almost positive my levels are in target range. However since this began happening I've been feeling a lot less trans. Part of me still wants to be a girl but as the effects begin to occur and become more and more irreversible, I'm less sure that it's what I want. I do still hate masculinity, and I think a confusion in my sexuality also plays a big factor in this. I've becoming more and more interested in guys (even though I've been dating a cis girl through all of this) and most of the guys I become interested are both gay and way out of my league. It almost makes me want to hit the gym and be a boy for them. 

My thoughts are becoming really scattered and I'm really worried and I don't know what to do. I did a bunch of acid the other night and spent a long time looking in the mirror and I'm just not sure what I want any more. My face is feminine and passes with makeup and the right lighting and angle but the rest of me is very, very masculine and I'm not sure I want to be a girl that will never be recognized as such. Wouldn't it just be easier to stay on Spiro and be a gay femboy? But then there's part of me that wishes I could be this pretty, feminine girl and I just realize with my build and dimensions it'll never be possible. Like when was the last time you saw a cute girl with a 46 inch rib cage, b cups, 24 inch shoulders, no hips, and size 13 shoes that was 5""10? It'd be so much easier to just be a guy. But at the same time I have breast tissue now and idk how that would work. 

I'm just really confused and scared about what I'm doing to myself. I don't like the idea of being gay but could it just be deep rooted homophobia that's telling me transition makes it more acceptable? I feel less attracted to women and more jealous of them but now after all this time I'm not sure if acting on that jealousy was the right thing to do.

I'm sorry for ranting I just really needed to get this off my chest and really need advice."
fraidycat787,asktransgender,"Wait hold on, is this voice dysphoria?","AMAB for context. 

So I've recently realised I kind of hate how deep my voice is. And more to the point I actually have ever since puberty started. 

It's not a feeling of being disgusted or depressed whenever I hear my voice though, it's more of a weird disconnect from the way my voice should sound. It just doesn't sound like I feel my voice should sound. To me it should sound a lot higher. Not like super high, in my head my voice should be more in the low feminine range than the masculine range. My ""inner voice"" is a very neutral tone, wavering between dead centre and slightly higher. Even when my inner voice is ""masculine"" it still sounds a lot higher than my actual, physical voice and when I think about that I get kinda sad.

It makes me uncomfortable with talking and sometimes when I'm having a conversation I'll think of something to say, start saying and freak out like ""ahhh this isn't what this should sound like what the hell stop talking stop talking"". 

Is that what voice dysphoria is? Shit why don't they teach us this in schools instead of bloody cellular biology. 

Also, if you feel like sharing, what's the silliest thing that you look back at and think ""oh wow that was actually dysphoria?"""

sophiaphilo,asktransgender,Fixing my sexuality NSFW,"   I'm really really lucky. I've been dating a trans girl for a few years now (I'm also trans for reference) and we've recently become affianced. I honestly feel like the luckiest girl in the world, she's helped me grow through a lot of issues I've had with my body and my sexuality. Anywho, I developed a bunch of weird kinks pre transition and then thanks to a catholic upbringing proceeded to add each one to my internal list of crud to feel guilty and ashamed about, right along with wanting to be female. 

   Puberty happens, crap gets worse, sexual desire increases and the guilty feelings increase more. I was finally able to get past my feelings about transition and one of the things I was looking forward to most was reduced sex drive so I could stop feeling so bad all the time. Works awesomely and exactly as planned for a year or so, then I meet the love of my life. She helps me not just ignore my body, which I had thought was enough, and learn to actually enjoy it and enjoy sharing it with the woman I love. She helps me through a lot of the knots I'd tied in my own head, helps me feel less guilty about wanting to talk about the feelings I had, that I wasn't wrong to feel them but that they didn't have to be that way. I start opening up on things I've never opened up on and everything is awesome. 

   After ~2 years of being together and getting affianced I finally feel comfortable starting to talk about the weird kinks I developed pre transition and about maybe wanting to explore some of them a bit. She... doesn't like it. At all. She makes it clear that she supports me no matter what but she doesn't really feel comfortable with the things I want. What's more, she's visibly discomfited by my asking. In my head, it felt like a confirmation that I was right to be ashamed of the things I wanted. Kinda totally grew out of proportion in my brain, like an infected wound. I can't enjoy my sexuality again, every time I try I see her face contorted with discomfort. It gets totally distended in brain space and in my head it turns into her being disgusted by me. I stop sharing. She didn't super notice at first, I've always been quiet and me not talking isn't that out of the ordinary. She didn't realize how important... Or not important but how complicated those things were in my head. 

   I start getting angry that she doesn't notice, even though I realize at the same time that I can't expect her to just guess what I'm thinking. I've brought it up once since then to try and explain how I'm feeling, but I ended up just feeling to sick and ashamed of myself to actually explain. And how do I tell her that the weird things I want, the things that just discussing make her so uncomfortable, are important enough that it can apparently undo three + years of personal and joint growth? I don't like this. I miss sharing my body with her. I don't like being angry. I don't like not liking myself for being angry unjustly. I don't want to make her uncomfortable again. And I feel like such a whiner because I've won the life lotto in finding this girl, I just don't know how to un-insane myself enough to not ruin our lives. I wish I could just drop the kinks, I don't want them to be connected to all this other stuff but I don't know how to fix it. :( Sorry for the novel.

edit: should probably clarify, in immediate hindsight, but the kink stuff is mostly different and very specific kinds of being subby and s&amp;m things, not anything illegal or super dangerous. There's some other weirder stuff I don't feel comfortable being specific on, but it's all approximately similar.

kenjataimuFeels,asktransgender,"Am I trans 2.0? calling out those who had tg/sissy fetishes, MtFs who were into bodybuilding. NSFW","I was very unhappy with my myself and my life until I started going to the gym.

I was your typical awkward out of shape depressed nerd with no friends, no life and no hope with girls. Self confidence didn't even exist and I was so weak (mentally and physically) I would get blown away by the slightest gust of wind. I hated my life and desperately wanted more but I felt I could never change.

As I got stronger in the gym so did my confidence and self-esteem, I felt the best I had in my entire life. *Lifting heavy* , pumping my favourite music and *flexing in the mirror*.... feeling *dominant*, *powerful* and *masculine*... I loved it. I would imagine myself as a confident successful man in all areas of my life with women admiring my ripped body and men respecting me.

I felt increasingly comfortable in my own skin the muscular I got, *it felt like this was the person I was meant to be*. Some people say that inside every fat person is a thin person waiting to get out, well I say that inside every unconfident skinny nerd is a confident muscular alpha male dying to be created.

------------

Unfortunately I stopped going to the gym for a number of reasons, including work commitments and lost motivation (I plateaued and discovered I had low testosterone and this in combination with my skinnyfat genetics and poor bone structure - small hands and girly wrists, would make it make it impossible to achieve a physique that looked remotely like I lifted weights). I also felt I could never become this man in terms of personality.

I started to return to my old self physically and mentally and I hated it. I sunk into a depression and started to think I would be better off as a woman that this weak pathetic omega male. 

These thoughts ended up becoming sexualised. I developed a feverish 'turning into a girl' fetish which after months of use became 100% of my sexual fantasies. I got off on stuff like ‘TG’ material (captions, comics, stories gifs ect.). I did have *some* female body fantasies in the past starting at age 11-13 before porn when I used to fantasize about waking up as one of the hot girls in the class, but these kind of fantasies were insignificant next to my normal sexuality.

---------------

After months of binging on TG and later 'sissy hypno' it really messed me up. Even when I looked at straight porn I saw myself as the woman. I gradually lost my attraction to women in real life and when I saw an attractive woman my thoughts were I want to be her rather than I want to have sex with her. I could only be turned on by the thought of being a woman. My porn use escalated to material that included having sex with men as a woman, this was very strange because I have never been attracted to men and felt disgusted after I fapped. When I have porn flashbacks that involve having sex with men I feel like throwing up.

I did not like this fetish because it conflicted and fought for control with my 'natural' sexuality and gender, this really scared me especially when I escalated to the stuff involving men for reasons explained. I used to cross-dress sporadically in the past but I stopped doing it once when I was lifting weights once had a decent amount of muscle on me. This very strong erotic desire to be a woman leaked out of a sexual context and this had me very concerned. One of the recommendations was to take a break from porn to clear my head so I did Nofap for 30 days.

At first the urges got worse, sometimes I felt like I was being possessed by a woman and even had phantom boobs. My anxiety went through the roof, it was insane. Fortunately it got better and I started to feel calmer and more masculine, also my attraction to women started to return towards the end of my Nofap journey. I am not cured of this fetish 100% yet but I am getting better over time and am confident it will go away.

I used to have severe TOCD (Transgender OCD) before starting my 30 day reboot but it got better. I am pretty sure I just overindulged in these fetishes to a point where they got out of control, but I am experiencing a resurgence of TOCD after going back to the stuff and binging on it for weeks. I am still worried that I might pull a Jenner in the future though, so that is why I am here.

So... What does everyone think? Any comments would be appreciated. I am especially interested in the opinions of people who were into tg/sissy porn and MtFs who were into bodybuilding as men."

No one in our class is Trans and although some people presume they can just discuss these topics, I was left feeling like I really needed to find out how these films are seen by the Trans community. Basically I have these questions:

Is it important to you that Trans characters are played by Trans actors? (obviously I assume it’s seen as pretty shitty, but I’m kinda over being a kid at college making assumptions on other peoples behalf) 

Who are the most talented Trans Actors?

When Stonewall made a film about a cis white guy who was “straight acting” (the director actually said that) what did you feel/think? 

Should Jared Leto have been cast as Rayon?

And could you maybe point me in the direction of films that feature Trans characters or employ Trans actors and are respectful to the Trans community.

InfamousScribbler,asktransgender,Quick question about voice practice and singing. [MTF],"Heya, everyone! I asked this question before, but didn't really get answers, so I'm trying it again.

I've heard a number of times that the ""secret"" to achieve head resonance was to move the larynx up and ""back"" (more specifically mentioned in this link: http://lena.kiev.ua/voice/ ), and I do notice that when I do the resonance exercices found on [this](http://webjedi.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Oral-Resonance-Practice-Exercise-1.pdf) page, my larynx seems to move back slightly. 

Now, what I wanted to know relates more to singing to high pitched songs while trying to keep head resonance (which, mind you, I don't know if I do correctly). When I sing to kinda high pitched songs with head resonance, I sometimes go too high or force my throat too much and actually *feel* my larynx crack and it feels like it moves deeper in my throat still. I don't try talking with my voice box that way because I always get worried that I'm screwing up my vocal cords, but I was wondering if that's actually what I'm supposed to be aiming for to get proper head resonance. Did that happen to anyone else? 

I heard about people playing around the ""crack"" in their voice to find the right resonance, but I always assumed this crack was the gap between falsetto and not-falsetto, am I mistaken?

Additional details that might be important: I got a tracheal shave last June and I didn't notice that about my voice box before (granted I didn't push my voice that far then). Maybe that could be linked?

**Also**, I noticed that I can't seem to get into proper falsetto anymore. My normal vocal range is pretty okay (I reach up to 260 Hz easily), but my falsetto is basically impossible to reach when I'm using ""head resonance"", except the rare occasions where I get something super high pitched but also super, super soft. What's the deal with that? "

I wasn't dealt that hand but I can reshuffle the deck.

That means giving up a lot of what I have now. Is it worth it?

The universe keeps giving me signs not to transition, but the universe has led me on only to screw me before.

I have constant suicide thoughts at the moment. Maybe they'll go away, maybe not.

If I proceed on transitioning, I'll wonder ""what if"". If I don't, I'll wonder ""what if""

Either way I'm fucked. One way, I have some potential to be happy, same for the other. Both are uncertain. One way is for sure for me, the other is partly for me and partly for my family. That's a compromise, but I want to be a woman.

Why was I dealt this hand? I want breasts, I want a cute tush, I want big hips, I want a vagina. Is it too much to ask?

If there was a magic potion or a machine to turn me into a girl ASAP, I would do it. No second thoughts. But it doesn't exist and the journey to womanhood is dangerous, uncertain, and scary.

I felt I was stuck before, now I'm more free to make decisions to make me happy. Yet I'm so scared and allowing myself to be doubted at every little thing.

What the fuck should I take from that? Why can't I just transition without the doubt like so many other transwomen?

I know this is probably unhealthy, and I know that ""passing isn't everything"", but I can't help myself.

My question is in regards to how the rib cage (and body frame in general, I guess) scales with height.  My underbust is somewhere between 30-31 inches if I pull tight.  My shoulders, however, are 18 inches across.  I can't tell how much of this is muscle.  I'm a scrawny, tall skinny guy.

Is this a normal rib-cage size for someone of my height?  I'm unsure of how the size of the rib-cage scales with height in cis women.  Also, has anyone here had their underbust measurement shrink with HRT if they were scrawny in the first place?  I understand bone can't shrink, but I've heard there is some connective muscle that can.

Another big concern of mine is my shoulders.  Like I said, I can't tell how much of it is muscle.  I have difficulty finding the bony points for the biacromial measurement, so could that be an indicator that there's a lot of muscle there?

Perhaps this post is more appropriate for [r/relationships](https://reddit.com/r/relationships), but I'm infinitely more comfortable here, so blah.

As many of you probably have, I've kinda been struggling with the whole ""holy sh!t my sexuality might not actually be what I thought it was"".  I've only fully accepted myself as MtF, and I have no idea any more if I'm even attracted to girls as a lesbian.

As of now, I currently identify as asexual, mostly due to having had a panic attack the last time I tried anything even remotely below the belt with a girlfriend.  I've since met someone new (afab though she is gender-questioning) and luckily is also asexual.  We've been kinda cuddly and adorable as highschool couples are, but since we barely share a schedule / are just kind of awkward around romance, we really only chat on and off day to day, so I'm not entirely sure how we would classify the relationship.

This is all well and good for now, but I'm not sure if when I transition if I'll be able to maintain a relationship with her owing to some increasingly persistent thoughts towards guys.

More recently, I've noticed that one of my very good female friends (who isn't in my closest friend group and thus doesn't know I'm trans) has been flirting rather heavily with me.  I'm a naturally flirtatious person (ironic, I know), so I'm worried I've been leading her on, and now she's asked me to dance at our upcoming semi-formal.

I'm not entirely sure why, but the idea of talking to her about how I'm not who I say I am or some bs and that I'm not even sure I like girls terrifies me, but I don't know how else to remove myself from the situation and still maintain a friendship with her.

Dear Dad,

Sorry for the long delay in responding.  I have tried to start this letter many different ways.  Often it turns me feeling very angry with you.  Doing that serves no purpose, our relationship is already badly damaged. You are correct when you say that suicide is a concern.  There is no doubt that transgender people have a higher rate of suicide.  But forcing someone to be something they are not only makes that risk greater.  Telling a child that what they are feeling is wrong is not going to positively impact their self-esteem (high self-esteem is critical to reducing risk of suicide).  That being said, I don’t think I can ever convince you to change how you feel.  

I am at the point where my letters typically go negative so, while it may seem abrupt, this is where I am ending at least on the topic of suicide.  If you like I can provide data supporting the statement that a supportive family lessons the risk of suicide in transgender kids. And, if *childsname* ends up living in society as a girl, then this becomes moot except for the impact this has had on our relationship.

Love, Pmags3000
  


His response:


Pmags3000,

The Jews were astonished when Jesus said ""Let the little children come to me.""   That statement forever turned the world upside down.   

What is happening with *childsname* can by best addressed in an environment that recognizes that all authority in heaven and on earth was given to Jesus.    

These two thoughts should be a clue to those who are open minded that there is something very basic that is lacking in her formation.

Your chief responsibility beyond safety is ""spiritual formation.""

Shikhandini,asktransgender,What's in a name?,"Dear sisters, brothers, &amp; siblings of all other kinds,

If you have changed your name, or plan to do so, what was the experience like? How did you select it; how did you come to feel that this was *you*; did you have a ceremony of some sort; how did it go over with family/friends/coworkers; what was the legal experience like; etc.? Tell your stories!

For me, I've always felt a strong attachment to the name my parents had picked out if I'd been AFAB—it always felt *right* in a way that my AMAB name never has. In fact, my parents were convinced I'd be a girl and had first and middle names all ready and then agonized to come up with just a single male name, which is how I got my mother's maiden as my middle. I've always loved names and their meanings and wished for another, but no other male name seemed better than the one I had and kept out of indifference. Female names on the other hand... those I played with in abundance. I'd name imaginary girl children in royal catholic fashion: half a dozen given names all strung together with care given to their musicality and family history.

Now that I'm finally living the dream I really want to take the name I would have always had if my chromosomes had cooperated, but it belongs to an ex whom I'm rather painfully estranged from.

SenaCat1,asktransgender,Stop gap measures with dealing with facial hair?,"So I'm in a kinda limbo medically, but I'm in a position where I'd /really/ like to knock the facial hair down, or at least make things a bit better passing wise. Shaving as of... not quite a year ago actually wasn't too hard although clearly not ideal. But for some reason over that time it's become a lot harder to get a good shave without tearing my face up. I could understand if it was puberty but that's definitely not an issue. Money's tight or I'd try for laser.

Basically, I just need /something./ Anything that people have gotten to work, lightening, slowing growth etc. I don't expect miracles, I know. I did try a cream but apparently it was ""for black men only"" and I missed that when I got it, barely any results and worrying redness. I tried tweezing once, and although it hurt and was slow, I did like the results. And I could watch something while I did, with a pocket mirror. But of course screwing myself up for future electrolysis is something I don't want to do.

With the razor+shaving gel+time and emotional expense that's already being put out, I'd be willing to pay some for whatever it is as long as it was a pretty safe bet. I don't care if I have to keep shaving, I expect that."
CeciliaMemorabilia,asktransgender,Is it illegal for a medical insurance company to stop covering my prescription after they discover I'm transgender?,Just went to my doctors and they Denied to pay for my visit which they paid for last time and then I went to the store to pick up my prescription and they completely denied to cover it. They were coving my spirited ore and not my estrogen but now they stopped coverage for both.. What gives I can't afford it...
sensitiveasfuck,asktransgender,Am I really transgender?,"I guess I came here asking this for a pretty important reason. I've been on hormones for almost a year because this is what I wanted, this was my decision. Not a day goes by where I don't wish I was prettier, more stealth, and passed flawlessly. These thoughts consume so much of my time and they never end. Its all I care about now. Being in my early twenties and only just starting this journey is another huge problem for me.  
   
The reason im questioning myself again is because I didn't find this part of me until a year ago. As soon as I had this realization all I could think about is taking hormones and not wasting another day. Of course if I had wanted to be a girl at a younger age then I would have had more practice being a girl socially and maybe would have started hormones way earlier.   
  
All I can think about is how im starting hormones so late even though im just a few years past twenty. I'm rushing everything hoping that I can get some of that time back. What im not sure of is why I didn't want this when I was younger? Have I changed just recently or was this something that was always there but there were no words for. I would say i'm a very naïve person.  
   
Whenever I find something I like I always think the same thing ""why didn't I know about this sooner"", like a theme in my life. I wonder if i'm just picking up another thing I like and its just that a hobby and not what ill want forever. All those things I found that Ive liked have eventually panned out as phases.  
  
Did I always want to be a girl? have I always been akward with people because I knew something was wrong? or am I just an akward person? Is this wrong for me because it started out of nothing? I ask myself this because taking hormones is a serious decision, but ive basically already made the life altering decision. Did I make it too quickly or was I rushing because it was something that always lied deep in my heart? i'm not sure.  
   
Looking back I can only think of one thing that couldn't just be written of as normal pre teen boy behavior. I used to walk like a girl when I was a kid in a family of all girls. My dad would always make fun of me and eventually I stopped. I guess I should mention that as soon as I found trans porn I became obsessed with it. I needed it everyday, but I still think that can be just seen as normal boy behavior.  
  
I remember I liked to always have one boy friend around. Just one guy all my life up until I found trans porn. I never liked groups of guys but I always loved to have one guy around. Watch him play games or just talk about funny stuff with them and just have fun. I would always refuse to hang out with more. I was perfectly content hanging out with them alone. This could also probably be written off as normal. Or at the very least just sexuality related.
   
The more I write about the more I need to understand what is normal. I think I've always had a skewed view of normal. I think its very possible in a house full of girls they didn't notice abnormal behavior.My dad wasn't around after I turned 10. Maybe I am normal and i'm making things up. I really don't know whats real anymore. But I do know that if I could take it all back and redo it as a girl with my brain I would in a second.  
  
After finding out that hormones were possible it just kinda resonated with me. I feel like I've been like this forever. There isn't a point in time where I can say ""this is when I stopped wanting to be a guy anymore"". Its far more like ""this is when I realized that I've been a girl all along"". I feel like I've lived the life of a typical tom-boy who never had anyone call her beautiful or notice that she was there at all. I feel like I just got lumped into being a guy and I just followed the rules.  
  
Did I mention my family is very transphobic/homophobic and that I have no support at all? yeah and I can't tell which type of brainwashed I am. Have I been brainwashed my entire life? or is me being transgender the recent brainwash? Because I think there is something that may not be said here often but its okay if your cis. That's what non-binary is for. Just because your a girly guy or a boyish girl doesn't mean you have to transition.  
  
But and im sorry if that sounds preachy. Its basically up to you and I guess that's what this post comes down to. Its up to me to decide and all y'all that are unsure yourselves. I know I said a lot but honestly I'm still don't feel any better. If I was an analytical person i'd probably say that the past is the past it doesn't really matter what you've done you have to live with yourself from now on, so do whats right for you. I'm all right brain though so idk.

SuperDesk75,asktransgender,Has anybody had a (long term) positive outcome with stopping short on your transition in order to save a marriage/family?,"By ""stopping short"" I mean, like, transitioning to more of a genderqueer/on-the-spectrum state, when you would be trans'ing all the way otherwise.

Leetta,asktransgender,Women are complaining I'm using the women's room at work. Not sure how to handle it.,"I was told by two of my bosses that women are complaining that I'm using the women's restroom. 

I'm pretty upset by it to be honest. I guess all the messages of support I got when I came out months ago don't extend this far. 

I'm not creeping on people, making a mess of the place, or even interacting with anyone. In fact, I've only seen other people in the bathroom when I was using it maybe twice in the past 6 months so it's not like I've even given them anything of substance to complain about.

My boss told me legally they can't tell me to do anything and they were just trying to address it with me to make everyone happy. I told them I'd think about it and possibly use the Gender Neutral bathroom that is on the other side of the building.

I'm not sure what to do long term,
I didn't want to make any more waves than necessary and I wanted to try to keep these things on the down low at work as much as possible, but I am also really upset these women would be supportive to my face and treat me like a creeper behind my back based on NOTHING. 

I'm torn between keeping my head down and using the Gender Neutral bathroom and feeling spiteful enough to just continue using the women's and letting them deal with it.

I've had a really rough week dealing with a sharp increase in body dysphoria I am feeling and this feels like the cherry on top. =\"
Bi-Fuzzled,asktransgender,Am I transgender if I hadn't shown much signs before?,"Okay, so I am 15 going on 16 and last year I've started having serious gender issues which I pushed past until this year where I had a breakdown in front of my parents. I came out as transgender and they seem supportive but believe that this may just be hormones and puberty since I hadn't shown signs of being transgender before. The only real event of my gender problems was in grade 6 when I prayed to a god I didn't believe in to change my gender. so my question is am I transgender or am I like faking it? I really need help its driving me crazy and like its killing me slowly."
seekingcontemplation,asktransgender,Almost 2 months of low dose HRT... and feeling things... Too soon? Or no?,"Hi all... 

So it's been about 2 months on low dose (1mg E sublingual, 50mg Spiro, 5mg fin)... 

Anxiety is quite quiet thanks to other meds... and I still have spikes of dysphoria that hit hard but not nearly as often. Skin has softened somewhat, cystic acne is practically gone... LOVING THAT... Love waking up without certain morning annoyances as well. Don't feel like a total sex offender lately too. Also nice. Small changes to the rear, I'd like to think too. 

Anyway, What has me curious though is how I feel breast growth already. I feel pangs, itches, pokies, (like a thumbtack pointy side out trying to come out) and other things. Definitely at the ""ow crap I hit myself there I didn't mean to"" stage. I have had what would be called ""gyno"" in my male life for some time so I know I have a bit there already. 

My T was pretty high at the first pre hrt draw but I was doing fin for a while before HRT, meaning not as much free T could turn into DHT and give me a skewed reading maybe.. so I'm wondering if this just means I'm very sensitive, if my T has dropped a lot, or.. what? This is a starter dose I'm on, technically, yeah?

In my late 30's.... thought I wouldn't have a lot of response so early/at a ""low"" dose. Mainly did it for  mental ""check""... I am liking it so far but curious what others have to say

Thanks a ton! "
FraffoP,asktransgender,Questioning myself... (20k characters post ahead),"Hi everyone! I'm sure you have seen dozen of threads like this one here, but I really need to talk with someone...

I'm a 20 years old AMAB and I've been questioning my gender for a while now. I'm already in therapy, started 2 years and half ago, although for different reasons. My therapist (whom I don't think is specialized in gender identity issues) is aware of what I feel and we are exploring the whole thing since mid December. But I want to talk about this later, first I want to tell you my story and experiences.

Everything began when I was 4 years old, probably. I remember that at the age I was still living in my old house, and one day, while in the bathroom, I asked my mother if I could wear her pantyhose. It didn't look like she was reluctant at the idea, she even helped me.
I don't quite remember what happened in the next few moments, but after a while I was standing on my parents' bed, looking myself at the mirror: in addition to my mother's pantyhose, I was wearing one of her dresses, red lipstick and sunlight glasses. I was trying to act very feminine and I still remember what the little me was seeing in the mirror: a confident and extrovert girl, the opposite of what I was. I loved it. Although the me of now sees that boy as ridiculous... I mean, he thought he was feminine, but at my eyes he wasn't. I don't know if this makes sense, but it's probably some sort of internal transphobia, I guess.
I don't know what happened after that, as I don't have any similar memories of my childhood. I've always been a timid and introverted boy. Until 4th grade elementary school, I would cry if a teacher scolded me, even for simple things. I would often ask was wrong with me, since I was the only one in the class that was crying everyday, basically.
I remember playing a lot with my sister. Sometimes we played with dolls (like they were our son and we needed to take care her of them, taking them to a phantasmal doctor, etc., lol), other times with action figures and my toys.
But there is a feeling that we also played some kind of role-reverse games... Although I'm not entirely sure about this, but I don't know, I can't shake this feeling off, like there was something similiar in my childhood that maybe I repressed it.
Then, when I was around 8 years old, the me in the mirror of that day started to live again. I would often look in my mom's and sister's drawer, looking for pantyhoses. Orange, red, white, black... I thought they were a cute and quite comfortable article of clothing. I would wear them while studying and without my pijama pants on, because I liked how they softly embraced my legs.
Anyway, that was also the time where the first sign of puberty were showing off... A night, while I was wearing them, I started to rub up against my bed and I had my first orgasm.
After entering middle school, I reprimed the whole thing once again. But eventually it came back in a stronger way, a while before my first year of middle school was ending...
At the time, my sister was still in elementary school, so I had lot of free afternoons. I would dress up like a girl and feel aroused. After the deal, though, I would feel so ashamed of myself and I would take the clothings off right away. ""I'm a boy"" I was often repeating myself, ""the fuck am I doing?"". But I did it again, again, and again. Surely there was a sexual thrill to it, but I also loved to see how I looked, how those clothes suited me, and feel like a real girl...
That summer (or the one after that? I was 11, by the way) I remember a... ""funny"" thing. One night, both me and my sister were still awake, and so we started to talk. We decided we would play a card game the day after (Yu-Gi-Oh), but with some kind of bet: if I were to win, she would have got to try some of my clothes, but if I were to lose... I would have to dress with hers. Needless to say... heh, I did lost on purpose. It's fucking hilarious when I think about it now... lol
It was no big deal to fake my loss, since middle school my masks collection started to grow bigger and bigger.
So I dressed up in front of her, I was kind of excited because someone was about to see my trueself (maybe?), and I also started to act feminine because I liked it. She was also suggesting me what to wear, like leggings, jackets, skirts, etc., and I was also giving my thoughts on the clothes... But then, I started to feel sad, scared and depressed. I started to think I was a freak. ""About the clothes thing... I'm sorry, but I think is better not to do it anymore... I'm sorry..."" I told this to my sister. She looked sad at first, but in end she stopped bugging me about it. She also doesn't seem to remember.
On my last year of middle school, my depression started to worsen. I would often stay at home from school (and crossdressing in the morning, always with those bad feelings after jerking off), even though I was an excellent student... I believe the pressure on me was just too high. My parents always tried to reassure me, telling me that I wouldn't had to worry if I were to get a bad mark every now and then because they were normal things and could happen to everyone, but... I don't know, I've always felt like... not human, maybe? Most of the people in my class had lots of social life, while I... barely got out of my home. Sometimes (rarely) I would go out with some friends, but most of the time I was at home, studying. Not to make myself happy, but others...
And I paid this thing, on my first year in high school. I was one of the best in my class, but my walls broke after the first quadrimester, and then I quit school. I would pass my days crying in my bed, willing not to live, but also not to die. I would crossdress sometimes, but less times than before.
In the next years I would try to get back to school (I even changed some), but everything was useless, I kept falling to the ground. The pain was enormous, I was also just a 15 years teenager at the time. As a result of this, I've also lost all of my friends. Well, the physical ones. I was able to bond a lot with a girl I met online a year after my break down (so when I was 16 yo), and she's basically my best friend right now (we can't see each other because she's very busy, but she is supporting me &lt;3).
That was also the period I started to see a neuropsychiatric and taking anti-depressants. I feel like I've been frozen for some years. I started to """"""live"""""" again when I was 18 years old. I started to see a therapist in the summer of 2013. Life improved a bit, but not so much. I still was at home most of the times, playing videogames, taking anti-depressants, sleeping and so on. Crossdressing faded away when I started to get depressed and been silent for different years (because my sister started to stay at home from school too, although for complete different reasons), but it was coming back.
Meanwhile, I felt in ""love"" with a girl I met online. She was a bit far away from me, but I was able to see her at least two times per month. I felt like I was just trying to conform myself to the other guys: having a relationship, the first experiences, etc. Something I could never had in the past. I also felt like my curiosity for sex vanished. I would try to think about it, but the thoughts didn't appeal to me like I was hoping. I'm still virgin and that's okay, honestly.
Soon everything started to feel like a huge boulder on my shoulders again. She was also the first person I told about my crossdressing (that I labeled as ""fetish"", just because I was scared to explore more), and she was supportive about it... at words. She would never ask what I was feeling, what clothes I liked, how I wanted to feel girly... nothing. We broke up a year later (last October) because of different problems, although this may have played an important role in this decision (which I took it myself, and probably one of my first important decision since I've entered the adult world). I remember that, a month before we broke up, I suggested her we could cosplay as two female characters, but she didn't want to. She said she was afraid of others' judgement about me at first, but in the end I realized she was afraid of what others would think about her. That saddened me.
There were times when I was kinda joking about being a girl inside and she would respond (of course in a joking way) ""if that's the case, then I'm sorry but we can't stay together, I'm not lesbian"", and I would get sad.
I told my therapist about my crossdressing ""fetish"" about 9 months ago, when I still was in a relationship with this girl. I wasn't sure to tell him, but at the time I thought ""what if I'm a girl?"" and that freaked me out. So I explained to him the whole story, while trying to reassure myself from point to point with phrases like ""It's just the clothes, being a woman is more than that and I don't know what it means"" and so on. Actually, I don't remember how he reacted to my story, but he was calm, and I certainly didn't felt judged.
Then December. As a single, I could focus more on myself. A bit before Christmas, I started to look for clothes and shoes online. I liked to imagine myself with those clothes on, but I also felt a bit sad. Because I didn't want to spend money on something I could have worn only at home, and I hated the fact that I would have probably got erections if that were to happen. I wanted to be able to wear them forever, and to stop sexualizing them... I really felt like, in the end, I was a girl. I was happy just thinking going out dressed as one, and be treated like one. My chest burnt at the thought. And that scared me. ""Me thinking about transitioning? What the hell am I saying? I can't... I'm a boy... maybe...?"". This time my discomfort was on an absolute different level, more painful than before.
I started to think about my family, how I already disappointed them by quitting school (although they say it isn't true and, still now, they always try their best to make me happy), I feel like they don't deserve this. I also felt fear of judgement, a fear I've always had. Fear of not be able to be a complete woman, or be recognized as one. Fear of being alone.
As I was exploring things and accepting for what I am (or at least how I feel), a girl, I felt incredibly calm and at peace with myself. Also more confident. I was happy to feel I was a girl. But then doubts came... What if I'm not truly one? What if I'm lying to myself? I get sad at the thought I'm not a girl... which is ironic, since some time ago it was the contrary! Plus, why would I torment myself with these thoughts? Wouldn't I be happy to feel like a normal cis person? But in the end, I don't know how normal people feel...
Many that are reading my post are probably thinking ""well, you just talked a lot about female clothing, maybe you really are just a crossdresser"", and you may be right, but there's more to it.
As I started to be affected by depression, something changed in me. I've come more aware of my traits. Remember things I had forgot.

* I wanted to know a lot of girls and be friends with them. At first I thought that was just attraction, but then... I wanted girl friends only because I was feeling more at easy with them, because of similiarities in the way of thinking, or approacing others. I've always been a very sensible, gentle, kind and altruist person. I'm also sweet. I love cuddles, hugs, and cute things. I liked to think that girls were mostly like this.
* In middle school, males in my class were often talking about abs, train the body, etc. I tried to agree with them, I faked it everytime... because deep inside I hate how the male body looks, at least on me. I've limited physical activities of that kind since always, because I wanted my body to resemble more that of girls.
* I HATE body hair. I have a lot, sadly... I tried to shave my legs once (middle school period) and I totally loved how girly and feminine my legs looked, but I did it just that time because I was scared of judgement and then I discovered that the more you shave, the more and stronger the hair regrows.
* I remember I was a bit happy when my beard started to sprout... until I saw it grow on my face. I still have some ""blank"" spots and I'll be honest: at the thought of having my face full of that shit, I get sad and angry. And I think I wouldn't forgive myself if I were to wait on taking hormones. I mean, I know that facial hair already there won't go away, but all the better if I can limit its development.
* I don't hate my voice, but I don't like it either... I would love to have it more feminine and sweet.
* When I look at my body, I try not to see my body hair, and instead I try to focus on my shape: I don't have hips like those of a girl of course, but I've always loved to think mine were kinda alike. I already have a good and soft butt, and I'm slim.
* It's been years since, when I had to go out, I dressed with skinny jeans (because they make me feel more femme) and a jacket. They are the SAME clothes everytime. I don't feel like buying male clothes, nor the urge. In the past it was always my mom the one who bought me clothes, I wanted to have nothing to do with it.
* When I'm out of home, I find myself staring at woman clothes' shop, at pretty dresses, shorts, skirt and shoes... The other day I saw a beautiful white dress and I couldn't keep my eyes off it, I had to stare it and thinking ""how great would it be to wear it? It's so pretty..."".
* When I see girls, the first thing I look are their clothes, then their body's shape, and sometimes I wonder if it's just sexual/romantic attraction... but I also feel like I want their body for me, their movements, their way of being. It's so confusing.
* It may sounds irrelevant and stupid, but in videogames I always (or almost) choose to play as a female character, because I feel like I can represent myself better that way.
* I also go by female pronouns on the net, and the warm feeling I feel in the chest almost everytime I get addressed as one... I wouldn't change that feeling for anything in the world. As a consequence, though, I often got an erection and I got sad... I don't want to have them at those times :(
* I also hate my name, and this is it since I was born. It sounds so manly, rigid... I feel disgusted almost every time I hear it. And when I don't, it is because I'm not even paying attention to what a person is saying to me.
* I always opt for longer hair than the majority of males, but even then, I don't like how male-style suits me... Funny thing time! Some years ago I had hair long 'till the start of the shoulder and... I used a ribbon for my fringe... The thoughts on my appeareance went from ""who is this ugly male..."" to ""holy shit, what a cutie!"" :o I mean, isn't it strange how a simple thing like a ribbon can change the sense we have of ourselves? Humans' mind is strange and amazing indeed...
But still... the doubts are so painful...

I've already explained how I feel to some friends (mostly online...), but I do have that one cis female friend I mentioned above. She's so accepting and wonderful. Last week we went shopping together with her boyfriend, I had so much fun :) Since she didn't told him anything, we decided to refer to the things I was buying as they were for my sister.
About this, a curious thing happened. Her boyfriend decided to wait for us outside the shop, but my friend insisted on pretending everything was for my sister. She was often repeating, oddly at times, ""So is this what your sister like?"" and similiar things. Sometimes I would get sad because I really wanted her to drop the act and finally refer to me... And just when I came back at home I understood everything: she was just trying to protect me from the other people. I was so happy about this... And I appreciated it so much. There were like only girls in there, and I would admit that I would have feel awful if someone were to stare at me while I was choosing chokers and make-up.
About the latter, I spent around 32€, and honestly I don't think a cis male would have spent all those money just so he could get off at home while dressed and all... Although I still have to try make-up... I remember when I was doing it years ago and boy, was I fucking cute... I loved how I looked!
But now I'm scared... what if I look ugly? What if I don't like it anymore? I don't want that to happen... My sister moved out from home and took everything away with her, I can't even wear some girl's stuff and reassure myself this way... :(

My parents doesn't know anything yet. My mom is very religious, my dad has a strange way of joking, often with sexualized content and in the past made some transphobic comments (which I adopted growing up, probably for distancing myself from... myself?).
But I'm positive my mom would accept me with little trouble... And I wonder if she remembers that time were I dressed up at 4 years old! I have always been open with her with every kind of thing. She's not like those religious people who think that masturbation is a perversion, etc. She's also has a gay brother that lives in Amsterdam and that she loves with all of her heart. He lives with his boyfriend and I had the honor to stay with them two weeks during Christmas 2013, it was amazing! I loved that place, people were damn open. It was like an entire new world for me.
I'm thinking to write a letter to her this or next week.

As for my therapist... As I said at the beginning, we are exploring the thing, although... I don't know, sometimes I feel like he doesn't understand me. He doesn't seem like he's going to push in one direction or another (and of course I appreciate it, I don't want to hear ""you are/are not trans""), but sometimes I feel like he doesn't fully support me. Maybe he doesn't believe me completely? I mean, I'm in therapy with him for about 2 years and half and he helped me a lot, maybe it's strange to him that I suddendly approached the argument with such resolve?
At the beginning, he also come out with homosexual arguments, which made me think about the whole Blanchard ""autogynephilia"" thing and the fact of being a girl to stay with men, which I think is kind of bullshit. I explained to him that to me gender identity and sexual orientation were two different things, and if I were to fall in love with a man, I can go with him even as a male. I mean, I don't have to resemble a girl to stay with guys XD I've already made up my mind about sexual orientation some years ago. I feel attracted to girls so much (maybe a bit too much...), but I also wonder how would be a relationship with a man. Sometimes I envy girls that get hugs, cuddles, sweet kisses and lovely words at their ears... I want to blush and feel embarassed like them :(
I feel like I have to prove to others what I am... despite I'm struggling to know this myself, lol. It's kind of ironic.
My psychiatric, on the other hand, seemed more supportive since the beginning. I've talked last week with him, and he even asked me if I already talked with my parents!
I feel like I want to start HRT so much, but on the other hand I'm scared... and then there's all this waiting time. I mean, how much do I still have to go on? There was a time when I was going to my therapist full of confusion (in regards to other personal problems), and ended up getting out more sure of myself. Now that this topic went out, before I enter the door I'm so sure of being a girl and want to look like one in every aspect (minus the genitals area, it is one of the few things I like of my body), but I end up getting out more confused, depressed and unsure...
He has like 20 years experience on his shoulders and a lot of specializations (minus the one for gender identity issues, or at least I didn't see it among them), but I wonder if he's the right person to follow me in this delicate journey?

I already read things like ""The Null Hypothecis"" and the Gender Variant Phenomenom of Dr. Anne Vitale (which, I admit, it was like reading about myself). Or the ""would you press the button"" thing (yes, I would). They helped me a lot, and feel more sure about what I want to do, but still... I know that in the end the only one who can answer all of these questions is me. Maybe I just had to let all of this out, and talk with someone.
I lurk in this subreddit daily, reading your stories and often feel your pain... I can say that I know what it feels to suffer.
Why couldn't I be a girl since I was born? :( Or, at the very least, being like all those normal guys that doesn't question anything and look so full of themselves... being like this sucks. Sometimes I would prefer to die.
I often look at amitransgender.com... that site makes me fucking smile everytime I click on it. I don't know, it's kind of special to me.

I'm so, so, sorry for this hell of a long post. I also apologize for my English, but it isn't my mother tongue! If you didn't understand something, feel free to point it out and I'll do my best to explain it in a better way :)

EdWood24,asktransgender,I want to act more feminine.,"I wish I was more feminine but I'm still on autopilot when it come to my mannerisms (no pun intended). At first it really wasn't noticeable but it is really starting to make me feel self-conscious. Is there any way to at a little more feminine.

Edit: To be clear I'm not talking about gender stereotypes, I'm simply trying to find a way to present on the outside the way I feel inside. It would also be nice if I could limit the ''You don't even act like a woman at all"" statement when I come out to my family."
iamsammii,asktransgender,"My employer just switched to using my legal name, after having been using my preferred name exclusively for 5 months. What do :(","I work through an employment agency, which provides staffing services to a certain transit company. I started with them in August; I applied under my preferred name, but when I submitted my information for the background check I used my legal name, and there was absolutely no issue.

But now, I'm under a new contract (with the same transit company) and they requested to do a background check again. This time, they said they would put my legal name on the contract list. Which means I would sign in under my legal name, I would get trained under my legal name, I would be known by my legal name, which I absolutely refuse.

Can I do anything about it? I am going to completely hate work if this continues. :(

**EDIT**: Apparently they're using ""Legal (Preferred)"". Not sure how I feel about that."
d246ga,asktransgender,Coverage in Canada (QC),"As someone who's trying to immigrate into Canada, specifically living in Montreal, I would like to understand how trans people in Canada have managed to get insurance coverage for necessary services, namely FFS and HRT.

I'm aware, for instance, that in Quebec, there is no provincial coverage for FFS, but if I can find the right insurance provider, can such procedures still be covered by insurance? If so, might I have to ""shop around"" for employers based on what insurance plans they provide? If I do have an insurance plan that covers it, Should I expect to be asked to provide a therapist's recommendation?

Is it the same for HRT?

I apologise for my confusion, but I'm very interested in hearing from anyone here who has managed to get these services (especially FFS) or any others, such as hair removal, etc. covered by insurance. Thank you."

Is the only to get people to acknowledge my gender dressing hyperfeminine or constantly bringing up my identity? I'm at the end of my rope here. I'm bringing this up because someone in a community I am heavily involved in told me that he ""never, ever would have thought that [I] was trans"" even though I have never worn any male gendered clothing for events in this community, and have personally corrected the person in question on my pronouns. I thought it might be just this one person, but almost everyone I ask reacts the same way, and I just don't get it. I only want to be acknowledged, I just want to exist. Why is it, despite my efforts, that people's perception of me won't change? Even right after I meet a person, so it's not like they can't shake a previous version of me.

I'm sorry, I'm frustrated and desperate. I don't know what to do to make this change. It's so depressing to find out that all of these people don't see or acknowledge as anything but a male (With a weird fashion sense?? I guess??). I wouldn't even mind, at this point, getting verbally harasses because of my trans status, just because it would then mean that someone is at least vaguely aware of my existence as a trans person. ;_;"

Would it be better to just drop hints, like saying I have been questioning for the last few months?

My mom doesn't ""get"" my study choice. She ""can't see"" me doing fashion design because I haven't shown an interest in it my whole life, basically. She thinks I'm only going into the program to get away from home, which is partly true, because I live in small-town Nova Scotia and the people here are all ignorant hicks, but I *am* really interested in fashion design. It might sound weird coming from a transman, but I really want to do drag, because I love womanhood as a concept, and I love playing with gender and gender expression. My dream is to be a drag queen and make my own costumes, and I know trying to explain it to her would go way over her head.

Would it be best to not actually come out to my parents and just let them discover it on facebook or something on their own?

-joannac-,asktransgender,Hair strategy for transitioning,"I'm a 36yo mtf trans woman pre-everything.  I'll be starting HRT in May.  One aspect of transitioning that I feel very strongly about is my hair.  For my own confidence sakes I really do need hair that is good enough that helps me to pass.  

Currently, I have a receding hairline and very typical male pattern baldness.  I've been thinking about how best to tackle this problem because I'd like a very positive outcome and I'd love to hear the opinions of those that are in a similar position.

This is what I've thought of:

* Spend the money on hair transplants now but opt for a female hair pattern (*I still present as male publicly*)
* Wait until May when I start HRT and then start Finesteride too and see if the natural regrowth pattern is sufficient for good looking hair.

Also first post under this account! Yay!"

While in a meeting, I noticed that both my boss (a cis man and a good friend) and our ceo (a cis woman) spent about 10 minutes talking to my boobs instead of my face (and I think they had no idea). It felt weird... First, it was completely noticeable and took me right out of the conversation - it was not subtle. Second, it was very affirming, as they were both clearly seeing me as the woman I am, and not the man they've known for several years. 

But I couldn't help but wonder if I was being taken seriously, which was sadly confirmed later when I was constantly talked over, and my (very) knowledgeable opinion was disregarded, and the men (in a conference call) addressed answers to my questions and concerns to the other men on the call. 

I know, this is what I signed up for. And I'm not complaining, it's a hell of a lot better than suicide. But still, it's a lot different to experience it than to talk about it.

WideEyedKitten,asktransgender,"My Experience with ""Coming Out"" and Other Questions.","For the past four years or so, I've had mild dysphoria. I'll look at girl's clothes and think, they have so many more options, or I love the way those look. I hate my voice. I have always hated facial hair. I always played as girls in video games and all that jazz. Every now and then I'd wonder, but I'd just shut that down as unrealistic. 

About 5 months ago, though, I became depressed, and with that depression came the hard dysphoria. I started wondering if I might be trans. I'd honestly acted like a woman online for a long time, though never in reality. I struggled for a long time, especially since I suffer from OCD. I was terrified it might be tOCD. Eventually, though, I decided that I must be transgender. The thought of being a woman brings me relief, not anxiety. It's the stuff that doesn't match with being feminine that gives me anxiety, my height, broad shoulders, being a hairy guy, having a relatively deep voice, all that stuff, that's what gives me the anxiety. Of course, I'm still not 100% sure, but I feel most of us aren't ever 100% sure. 

So I finally gathered up enough courage to come out to my parents. It was terrifying, since I'm 17 and still dependent on them. I was honestly a little afraid they might say they won't help me out with college if I told them. It's been extra hard for them because, in the letter I wrote, I also wrote about how I've been dealing with depression. At first they promised support and all of that. Then they did research and they too discovered tOCD. Now they're pretty certain that's what this must be. 

We had a talk Saturday night. My dad said as a kid, I never showed any ""symptoms"" of being trans. I never said I was a girl, I peed outside standing up, I loved wrestling, etc. He says he still doesn't see any symptoms minus the shaving and long hair. He says I curse like a sailor, play masculine games, am good at math, etc. Granted, all those are true, but I don't think they make not trans. 

They also reminded me about how when I was young, my OCD was awful. It was one of the worst cases my therapist had ever seen. I believed my parents were impostors, I would skip meals because I was sure they were poisoned, I would wash my hands until they were raw, and I even believed there was an evil car that would punish me if I lied. So, that means to them that believing I'm trans. 

But this has caused a ton of anxiety for me. What little amount of certainty I had was shattered. How am I supposed to be sure when the two people I trusted with this secret are telling me I'm wrong? So now I keep questioning myself. And I'm finding myself obsessing over if I'm trans or not. And that fucking terrifies me. because if I'm starting to obsess, that might mean it's just tOCD. But I want it to actually be transness (not a word). I don't want it to be tOCD, and to me, I think that's a sign that it is transness. Because why would I want it to be one of the most difficult lifestyles rather than something medicine and therapy could fix? I'm going to a therapist soon, and my doctor upped my dose of Prozac, and I'm praying the therapist agrees that it's more  likely being trans than tOCD. But that might just be the addiction to validation that comes with tOCD. So now I'm confused and scared. Is it possible to be trans AND have tOCD? 

Anyway, all that anxiety out of the way, I don't regret coming out. It's been hard on my parents, and things are a little tense between us, but they're trying. I told them they need to be open to the fact that it's not tOCD. But they promise me they'll support me no matter what I choose, as long as I wait until I get my depression in check, which I think is fair. Knowing that, it's a huge weight off my shoulders. Before I was really assuming worst case scenarios like no college help or being kicked out, but all that's come out of it have been a doctor's appointment, a couple of infuriating e-mails, two awkward talks, and a tense dinner. Other than that, things have gone much better than I thought.

LaughingSpectre,asktransgender,Help with FTM sex issue,"I am a cis female and my partner is FTM. He was on T for about 7 years and quit recently due to lack of available healthcare in the area.

JadeXyan,asktransgender,I think I'm about to fight a battle I can't win,"I'll try to make this short, but I have to vent a tiny bit of frustration. I recently asked my doctor if he'd write a letter for me to try to legally change my gender; it's a longshot, I haven't been on HRT for longer than 6ish months and of those 6 I've only been living full time for 2ish months, but the only requirement to make a legal gender change here is to have a letter from a doctor which states that you are being medically treated for your gender transition.

Anyway, I can't say I didn't expect that he might reject my request, even I'll admit it might be a bit early for me to be trying to push this, but I am likely changing my name anyway and I figured I'd give gender a shot too since it can be done in the same hearing. Anyway, it's not the rejection that is really getting to me, it's a small part of the reasoning and the timeframe he gave along with it that makes me feel the need to run this by other people. Essentially he tried to cite the WPATH standards of care and is saying that I need to live full time for at least a year before I do any of this, and once that year has passed he will happily write such a letter.

Well I've read the WPATH standards of care and reviewed them a bit more today after hearing this, and I see nothing that even remotely addresses legal name and gender changes in the slightest (please point this out to me if I've somehow missed it); in fact the old WPATH guidelines (v6 I believe) actually listed changing legal name and gender as one of the few ways that were to be used to confirm that you were living full time.

Anyway, he also discouraged me from changing my name but I will probably go ahead with that in a couple of months anyway because it will dramatically improve my life and I can't really see a reason to wait.. But I figured I would ask here before I started fighting my losing battle against his points and trying to lessen that one year timeframe (I mean really, I'm not asking for a recommendation of his full support for something huge, just a letter confirming that I'm undergoing HRT, which I clearly am...). So let me confirm here, have I missed something in the WPATH standards of care? Is this practice of denying and discouraging legal changes until a year of living full time a normal thing? Should I be waiting?"

With all of this suddenly going on I'm faced with the fact of, ""Oh Shit, this is actually happening...this is ACTUALLY happening!!!"" and I'll admit I'm kinda nervous. Every since my last therapist meeting I've kinda slipped back into my former depression a little so now I'm not nearly as excited as I should be. I know it's perfectly fine to be nervous and a little trepidatious, but how can I get myself over that. I've wanted to transition for years now, and now that I finally have a chance I'm wondering if I'm ready to take that next step (Even though I already know I am ready for it).

TheGiratina,asktransgender,"What do I need for surgeries? (terrified, nineteen year-old AMAB, on hormones for six months, very ranty and scatterbrained and scared)","Warning: This is long-winded and it's an attempt to get everything out... also trigger warning for self-harm.

I'm moving states soon, and when I do so it will mark my seventh month on Hormone Replacememt Therapy. When I move, however, I want more tham anything to come out at work (I am transferring to a Wal-Mart in South Carolina, thinking about contacting the Human Resources Department to oversee the process, experiences are appreciated) and in soceity in general. This is for two reasons, the first being the most important: surgeries.

The more I read, the more the standard for being accepted for surgeries becomes clear, and the more I loathe it. I stopped seeing a therapist immediately after I received my letter for referral so I could start saving money for these damned surgeries. Now I'm thinking I made a mistake. It seems to be the standard that patients receive two letters of recommendation from two therapists, one long-term. Which is problematic. I'm homeless and work a very low-paying job with no health-insurance and a dying car I'll need to replace sooner or later, most likely sooner. Definitely within the year. Even if I severely cut down eating to dangerous levels and other expenses similarily, I still would be rendered unable to save for surgeries or a car, or even a home at some point, if therapy came back into play.

The second reason I want to come out is I'm sick of being deadnamed and called ""sir"" or ""man"" by my coworkers. It happens several times a day, and it's a little more crushing each time. I love my real name and I love being referred to by it, but even two of the coworkers who know about my condition refuse to stop deadnaming or misgendering me, one of them going as far as to dare me to grow my facial hair out, or constantly making comments about it.

But coming out is scary. I worry for my health, mental stability, finances, and security due to transphobia, which I have no doubt is absolutely rampant in South Carolina. I am out to people I one hundred percent know I can trust, which has been three co-workers at this point. And only one asked ""How can I help you feel better?"", and she's the only one to have taken steps to affirm who I am.

Even barring the risk of violence or losing my job, I don't want to be out and have people still misgender or deadname me. To me, transitioning is as much as a private thing as it is a public, so the idea of not presenting as a man but still having to use male pronouns and my deadname, use the men's bathroom, and have people perceive me as a man or a ""fake woman"" is just as terrifying as the consequences to remaining in the closet.

But every day that passes my dysphoria seems to amplify. Every day I hate my genitalia a little more, every day I cringe a little more when I look in the mirror, every day it's a little harder to shower, when I can, and have my hands run along my repulsive absence of hips. Every day not dealing with the inevitable failure of transition in the most crucial of areas is a little more crushing. I've been able to not self-harm for three weeks, but those three weeks have felt impossibly long and difficult.

But it seems like there are so many hurdles to getting the surgeries I need. Finances, time, and approval. Fantasies where I have no arms to get rid of my huge shoulders or where I cut off my legs to take care of my height are getting rampant. I can't help it, I feel like I'm moving backwards sometimes. It doesn't help that I'm in a hyper-masculinized work crew, the unloading team, where lack of customers and constant supervision lead to crass, offensive jokes and crude langauge, that I grudgingly adopt to ""not be such a little..."" you can finish that statement, I'm sure. Transphobia creeps in, alot, sometimes brazenly, sometimes subtly. I always notice.

All I want, ALL I want right now - within the next year - in regards to surgeries is an oriechtomy (tucking for me is impossible, and it would get rid of a huge testosterone producer) and a tracheal shave (maybe with larynx adjustment, I have heard conflicting stories of its reliability.). I want these so I can, hopefully, even if just a little, pass. I want that more than anything, and every day, it seems so much futher away.

TL;DR: I'm wondering what my best options are for getting the surgeries (orchiectomy and tracheal shave) I want as quickly as possible, while also hurting me as little as possible financially for other surgeries and procedures and living my life as who I am."
throwaway57536,asktransgender,I just want to know,"17m here

I am confused. I've always liked girly things. from early ages I watched Madonna concerts. I have pink bedsheets and a pink sweater. I feel that I act effeminately. I do feel that I should have been born female, like life would be easier, if at least marginally, though it could be a case of the grass being greener...

on the other side, I would hate to go through all of the trouble to transition, or even just to come out to anyone, just to be wrong about it. what if this is just a phase? if I transition and I'm wrong, it's irrevocable and I'd be fucked. even if I did transition, all I'd be is a fake, a deception, illegitimate, a phony. I'd always be male. there is no way I could ever be a true female. I could always just kill myself and hope God smiles upon me and gives me another chance as what I was supposed to be.

Hi_Im_Teagan,asktransgender,So I've been on HRT (MTF) for 9.5 months and have these deep stretch marks on my chest....?,"Hey gang. 

So title. About me: a little overweight but not terribly so. Pretty decent breast growth-- here's a [timeline](http://imgur.com/a/qQHf5) (content note: some bruising here and there because I play rough). 

Here's some [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/3MVVg) of some of the aforementioned stretch marks. The first one even has a fucking random bruise. 

So how normal are stretch marks there? I have a couple random ones on my thights/back, but that's it. They're a dark red color, slightly indented, I feel that ""boob growth"" dull pain pretty much daily and haven't gained/lost considerable amounts of weight. 

My gut tells me it's a rather normal thing (there's only so much skin, if the tissue is dividing faster, something's gotta give), but I very rarely see people post about it. I'm not trying to brag about it or anything, my girlfriend was just really worried about it (her words: ""Jesus, who gave you *those* marks?!""). The skin is also pretty red/swollen too. 

Anyways... stay warm/cold/temperate/dry/wet(?) wherever you all are.

gassylammas,asktransgender,Does anyone here think about sex like the opposite gender?,"Do any of you that are trans ever think about sex like the opposite gender? I don't mean that you're gay/straight and have thoughts about that.  I'm born a male but when I fantasize about sex, I think about being a girl and having sex with a man, even though I don't think I'm really attracted to men romantically. It's really easy for me to get off on those thoughts. 

Is this common for people who are trans, and not for cis people? I'm curious if this is even considered a fetish or just how someone perceives their sexual identity? I'm not really sure how to word it. "
PermanentRoundFile,asktransgender,Coming out before you're ready?,"My 'best friend' of 10+ years squeezed the information out of me a bit earlier than I was expecting or ready for.  I mean, we usually get along fine, but one thing that has really started to grate on me (and our other friend from highschool) is that he just can't seem to stay out of people's business lately and seems to think that nobody has the right to private information anymore.  

On top of that, the first thing that he said once I told him that I'm not comfortable as a guy was ""I'm not judging you but..."" which you know means the exact opposite is going on.  He went on to say that no matter what I'd always be the same person to him, likely meaning that he's not going to respect the fact that things about me *are* going to change and will likely refuse to use a new name should I choose one.

But wait, it gets better!  Then he tried to tell me (in a very roundabout way) that it is because my father was never around to give me ""the validation and initiation that I needed to become a man"".  While I'm actually glad he doesn't know what it means to actively dislike having the physical attributes associated with masculinity, it also means that he's never going to see me for me, and that is super frustrating.

I'm already a pretty high anxiety person when it comes to social stuff, and the thought of having to see him tomorrow when I go to the gym is driving me up the wall right now.  The only reason I'm not an anxiety wracked mess right now is our other mutual friend who I explained a portion of the situation agrees with me that the whole thing is ridiculous, and although she doesn't know the whole of the situation, she is being very supportive, and will be there too.

Any anecdotes, similar stories, or advice?"

wirevix,asktransgender,Advice for travel-challenged FtMs?,"Hi, never been on reddit before.

My fiance and I are both FtM folks, living in Massachusettes, right on the border of RI--sadly far out of reach of Boston and therefor Fenway.  We don't really have much in the way of travel options, as the only job I've been able to get after five years of living here was part-time at Walmart, and my fiance is legally disabled.

We're both closer to 30 than 20, and while I'm not as distressed as my partner, we're both struggling with being unable to begin any kind of transitioning.  I've spent quite a bit of time trying to find doctors in the area we can reach by bus, but so far I haven't found any with any indication that they're open to helping trans people.  Our GP has already shot down any possible discussion on the subject, as he has no experience in the topic and doesn't want to learn.

The best shot I've seen so far is Rhode Island Hospital, as it's been listed on a few trans resource sites, but the taxi fees for getting there are gonna be pretty high for us.  It's less than 20 miles away, but all the taxi companies around here I've dealt with so far charge a stiff fee for leaving town.  

I just figured I'd ask if anyone has any experience with them, before I go trying to budget out a few hundred dollars in taxi fees alone.  I know it's not a very specific question, but I'm just kind of looking around for any sort of help at all by this point."

I sometimes think that I would *prefer* it if I was born the opposite gender. But I'm beginning to think that it might only be a case of ""grass is greener on the other side"" effect. As in, I only like it because it's something that I haven't been able to experience before. Because when I think about the reasons why, I also realize that I'm not looking at the full picture.

Transition is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult.

I get misgendered a good amount of the time, and a lot of the time it's people I don't know. Obviously I don't need to explain how that makes me feel. Anyways, so like I get people like that all the time, then I get people who are just overwhelmed by how attractive I am, and obviously think of men as female. I had a guy just stop in his tracks yesterday, come over, call me a beautiful woman, kiss my hand, and I just felt amazing. It's hard to feel people like that are sincere though, when so many other people still gender me male. I don't get it, do I pass or not? Obviously these men don't see to be humoring me, but then what about all the other people? Can anyone help me make sense of that? 

And it's not like it's just makeup or anything, because like the guy the other day who stopped in his tracks was when I wasn't wearing any, and when I'd grown my facial hair for electrolysis (though admittedly I don't have much). So like it's not like putting on makeup stops this from happening. 

Edit: To be clear I doubt people are that likely to notice my facial hair. I mentioned it not because it's a huge sign of my assigned gender, but to say that I wasn't looking my best. And that it wasn't just makeup causing this confusion or something. "
AGirlNamedKiwi,asktransgender,My school is breaking the law and i need advice on what to do next.,"Quick background: I'm 17, a trans girl, and go to school in Illinois in the U.S.

Anyways, the law in Illinois states that people can go to the bathroom they identify with, but my school does not. I went to talk to my school councillor about 30 minutes ago and let them know that i did my research and that it is the law that i could go to the girls room. This was met with her going to talk to the principal, and returning with the following. She said that the school was ""working on getting a third bathroom for all trans students."" This is so not going to happen, there's like five of us here. She continued to say that ""in the meantime, you have to use the mens room,"" sigh ""or better yet, you can just use the restroom in the nurses office."" Well, all of my classes are on the opposite side of the building, and there's no way they're actually going to do anything without being forced to. Ask Transgender, what should i do?

Edit: Well, now that i'm out of said school, i can actually kinda follow up.
My current plan is this, I used the girls room, and will continue to use it until they try to do something about it (most likley threaten suspension/ expulsion). I will then show them, and inform them of what the law is, and if they still don't like it, that's when i'll catch them in the legal checkmate combo, lawer and media coverage. only problem here is i have no money, and little clue on how legal cases actually work (aside from tv and ace attorney).
Also, i informed my mother, and not only has she taken the schools side, she doesnt see how unjust this is, and how much it means to be validated on such level. also, it's Edwardsville High School, so no, i'm not the child from chicago."

AliceOfRohan,asktransgender,Ive been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria a few days ago... But now Im super confused...,"Hello, Ive been going to psychiatric therapy for about 5 months now, and a few days ago, my doctor pointed out that I could have gender dysphoria. He gave me a small text to read about it and there I realized I have a lot of the ""sympthoms"" but not all of them. My doctor says that doesnt matter, and that I could be trying to suppress the feeling.

Im 21, Ive crossdressed, but I like girls; doctor told me sexual preference is independent of gender identity, which caught me offguard tbh. Eventually I realized, I'd be much happier, confident and confortable if I was a girl.

I told my mom about this and she is totally cool with it, same with my best friend. My mother has even offered to help me buy new clothes. 

I'm feeling very good now, like my antidepressants are finally kicking in, but with each day that passes, Im getting more and more doubtful...

Of course all the social stuff that ""coming out"" means, but most importantly, What if Im not actually trans? If I were to start HRT, what if I repent? This is not something one should take lightly, one cant just make a 180 degree turn and go back to the begining.

I haven't wanted to live for 8 years, and I think it's finally time I do something that i want for once.  
My parents still do not like the idea of me being trans almost a year later, they are still religious, and bigoted. I still live in this tiny town with no people, I still have no real friends I can visit, I still have no one that can protect me from home, no one that I can stay with to make me feel okay.  
Nothing feels okay anymore.  
And you are just strangers, none of you give a fuck about me, and I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm just some disgusting man playing dress up that wants to kill himself, you dont know anything about me, you dont know about my struggles, you guys cant care about me, and shouldnt, I don't even know why I am saying this despite knowing these facts.  
I've dropped deeper and deeper down this hole, I have felt less and less, done more and more to destroy myself, and others have done so too. I don't like the idea of it getting better, almost everyone knows it, but the suffering I feel right now is beyond anything I have felt ever in these past two weeks.  
I'm so tired  
Everything hurts  
Nothing is worth it, and I'm finally glad i've snapped and lost it, I can snatch this chance to kill myself whilst I am not thinking right.  
However, I am not the most irrational, I am giving myself till tomorrow night, but I doubt I'll change my mind.  
If there is anything to take away from this, you are much stronger than I, I know you can make it, don't doubt yourself, you will be a beautiful person one day.

The ceiling for me is casual sex only. And I look good. And my profile states clearly I have no interest in it.

But I still get it, all day everyday. When I stand up for myself and say ""no casual sex, id like to meet and potentially date the right guy"", im always told ""no thanks"". It honestly is starting to hurt.

GenderConfusion123,asktransgender,Looking for feedback on my transgender thoughts regarding masturbation,"I apologize in advance if this is an inappropriate question, but obviously I'm confused about where I'm at right now, and I wanted to reach out to you folks to see if someone may be able to offer their insight.

So, for as long as I can remember, I've been aroused by the idea of gender bending. Not always of myself gender bending mind you, just of the theme in general. My favorite topics involved feminine men being forcefully turned into women by hormones and surgery, and it was my biggest fantasy. And in fact, it still is. I very rarely go for any other types of erotica, and when I do, I often imagine that the woman used to be a male, or that I myself was the woman. Typically standard porn types, man on woman or woman on woman, and most often some sort of transgender porn.

Now, about a week ago I felt that I wanted to take a break from porn, because I felt it was causing me some porn-induced erectile dysfunction. I haven't got much evidence for this beyond a few situations. I'm still a virgin at 25, though the opportunity presented itself once. I brought a girl home from the bar, but I couldn't get hard. I think more than anything it was a combination of nerves and alcohol, but it absolutely wrecked my psyche. I was miserable about it for some time. I finally decided that PIED may be the cause.

The thing is, ever since I laid off the porn, my mind has been absolutely filled with transexual and transgender thoughts, almost exclusively for myself. I've been questioning myself the last several days if maybe I'm actually transgender, or transexual; or, if I'm possibly just going through porn withdrawal. Strangely however, for as long as I've been masturbating, these thoughts have always been present in the back of my mind, popping up for me to question myself every now and then, but never for long, and never strongly. 99% of the time, these thoughts disappear entirely when I climax. I've never questioned my gender identity this strongly before.

I'm honestly extremely scared of the possibility of being a transgender person, largely because I don't want to be known as that (as foolish as that may seem). Deep down, I know that I have some sort of ""inner-woman"" so to speak, but I don't know if it's something I'm supposed to pursue or not. I'm not unhappy as a man, I'm just unhappy with what I consider to be a major fetish. My entire plan was to stop masturbating to see if the thoughts would fade away or not (there are a lot of people who do this sort of thing for other strong fetishes by effectively cutting themselves off from that stimuli entirely, to mixed results (see /r/nofap)), but now instead I find myself questioning my gender and my identity.

What do you guys think? Is this along the same lines as any of you have felt? Is there any way I can get more information on myself that doesn't involve incredibly self-doubtful soul searching? Sorry for this probably rambling, barely coherent rant; I'm very stressed about this situation. So much so, I actually left work early today. I also apologize if any of this is offensive in any way, I'm not very up to date on what is and isn't kosher to say.

**TL;DR: I have a gender bending fetish and after stopping masturbating, the feelings are stronger than ever. Any relatable stories from anyone?**"

idkWhatLoveIs,asktransgender,I told my mom and now I feel really stupid,"I'm a 20 year old mtf who realised I was trans a few months ago. I didn't really want to tell anyone just yet, though. However, in a moment of poor judgement, last night while my mom and I were arguing I told her how I felt. 

Yeah, really bad idea.

While her reaction wasn't the worst, I think she's pretty disappointed in me. She feels like the reason that I feel trans is that I'm depressed and how I'm trying to latch onto any kind of identity I can and says that trans people have terrible lives and that no one is going to accept me if I decide to transition. She feels like I've been ""influenced"" by the trans community into feeling like this even though I keep saying that I've felt like this since I was a kid.

Today she want me to see some counselor that she talks to (this person who believes that she can channel spirits) so that I can get ""a neutral point of view"" which I agreed to in an attempt at damage control.

This is probably one of the stupidest things that I have done in awhile. It saddens me to see her be so accepting of me. Is there any way that I can convince her that this is how I honestly feel or at the very least convince her that what I was saying nonsense? I know it's manipulative but it feels like it would be easier to just act like I've changed my mind."
soontobejane,asktransgender,MTF How much does hrt affect body hair?,"I'm pre-everything for now (hoping to start hrt by October) and have seen a few threads about laser/electro hair removal. It seems that many people only get facial hair removed and that even that is expensive as all hell.


I guess my question would be: does hrt thin body hair enough to make permanent body hair removal unecessary or is this a cost thing? 


Is it worth it to have hair permanently removed from the *ahem* harder to reach areas?

Throwawayaing,asktransgender,How can I make my parents understand?,"Hi. I'm in a situation where my parents denies saying yes to make me go on hormones because I'm depressed. They mean that I'm not stable enough to go through it, while I stand on my side saying that this is something which will at least help a lot with my depression, and most likely cure it in the long run.

The logic I'm following is that my depression comes from my gender dysphoria. The best way to treat my depression would be to reduce my gender dysphoria, and the most effective way to do this is through the use of hormones, because then I could actually wear female clothing and hopefully feel less like a fraud.

However, my parents clearly says that they mean that the way to cure my depression is for me to do things I don't want to do, like go outside and meet new people a lot more than I already do. While I don't completely disagree on this, I find it really hard to go outside since I feel like the one everyone else sees is the wrong person (again, gender dysphoria). 

Considering all this, I can't see a better move for me than to start HRT, but I have no idea how I can make my parents understand this. I'm 17, and in a little more than half a year I will turn 18, and then it would be possible for me to do this myself, but I'm not sure if I can endure all this mental torture for so long. "
maddietelle,asktransgender,[MtF] [Pre-op] Almost Complete Loss Of Sensation on HRT,"So, for some background information, I'm 18 and I've been on spiro for 4 months and estrogen for 1 month. Before starting estrogen, my penis was entirely sensate as any cis-male's would be. Even though I'm circumcised, that never seemed to be an issue.

Starting last week my libido dropped drastically, which I was alright with... but now there's seems to be no sensation. I can lightly feel pressure (like poking your arm) and that's it. There's not any feel-good sensations whatsoever anywhere and the change seemed to happen overnight. 

Normally, I wouldn't care much about the loss. There are always other ways to get the job done and I prefer those ways... But without getting it up every once in awhile, I'm worried that there won't be much left for GRS. 

Of course, I knew the risks associated with starting HRT, but I have never heard of this before. Whenever I try to look for similar stories, all I can find are experiences of post-op women who lose sensation and it's starting to worry me. Has anyone else experienced this?"

Henchman24RIP,asktransgender,"Getting frustrated, and not feeling like you're a part of the community.","I've been dealing with a lot of mid-transition dysphoria and a complete nose-dive in my self confidence. A lot of this has to do with unemployment, something I know a lot of us face. I guess I didn't expect the issues to follow me from Texas to California. 

I applied for a job at an LGBT center that I was perfectly qualified for. I didn't have a degree, but they said they didn't care in lieu of experience. I have 7 years of that specific experience. I had multiple successful friends review both my resume and cover letter, and was so confident of getting an interview, I was more worried about finding interview clothes.

Instead, I didn't even get a *response.* 

I've met the person that would've been my boss, who is a trans hero of mine, and I've been to events specific to this department there before. 

My friends assured me that this wasn't a judgement on me, and they had certainly found more qualified people that I couldn't know about. Yet here we are, three weeks later, and they still have the job ad up, while others have also been updated. 

I guess I wasn't *good enough* with seven years of experience to even bother giving a *fucking interview to.*

As such, my self confidence has reached a new low. After a recent speeding ticket (mistaken car identity, not kidding, what the fuck, does everything work against me) took away my entire, meager, transition savings, I barely leave the house anymore. 

So I decided that I would try to do what I did in Texas, I would make new friends by joining a board game meetup. I figured I could find something specific out here, and I did. 

I was able to find a *Queer Women's Potluck and Boardgame* meetup in the same, awkward county I live in. Had to apply, so I did, and mentioned that I own roughly 60 board games, and am a *fantastic* cook (true story). 

The next day, the application process for the group was closed. I received no message at all, but I'm not dumb enough to not understand that the closure was in relation to me applying. 

So, I guess...

*What the fuck* do I have to do to be a part of the community, and have some sense of self-worth again? I lost my *best friend* who is trans this year due to drama, and I'm constantly losing hope and self worth. 

*What the fuck* is the point of fighting if even the community won't give me a chance? *What the fuck* is the point of fighting when I have to deal with all of this, as well as so much inner trans related turmoil and guilt that I don't think will ever go away? *What the fuck* is the point of fighting when over a year in, I still can't remember the last time I was gendered correctly, even when friends insist that I'm cute?

I am *so* tired of this struggle, and I am *so* tired of feeling completely worthless that I'm completely losing my strength.

What exactly do the terms non-op, pre-op, post-op, cis-girl mean?

Hdhshsj,asktransgender,Change My View?,"So I have a dilemna. I am a young Trans person and have recently joined a Trans social group at my college. Before that I didn't know anything about non binary Trans people. 

But I learned, and I accepted it because it makes sense. There is a spectrum and you could be man, woman, somewhere in between, or not on it at all. This is all logical.


But recently an old group member came back and he has been boggling my mind and I just don't understand. 

He was assigned female at birth. Claims he is trans. And says that he is a man. That's completely fine, obviously, but what confuses me is that he doesn't plan on transitioning at all, not even socially. He still wears dresses and makeup and there's just no way you could know he is not a cis girl. 

At first I thought he could he be an agendered or gender fluid person who prefers the he pronouns, but when I asked him he distastefully responded with no I am a man. 
Like it was weird to be non binary. 


Anyways, I just don't get it and It doesn't help that he is kind of a dick too. It just seems like he is mocking all of us at the group by pretended to be trans. I'm probably wrong though, but he agitates me and I know that's not right.

I've read a lot of people on here asking how they hide this or that and how do they stop people from finding out but hear little about those that simply don't care. 

I've yet to face any harassment, etc. so maybe I'm a little one-sided here, although my uni and my accommodation have anti-discrimination rules that could lead people getting kicked out should they try anything.

Plus I'm still sort of a big person so maybe people think that I could hurt them if they tried anything, which I would definitely do in such situations.

Makaio13,asktransgender,"I was insulted and scorned by an ex for being a femimine guy. Any advice/words of wisdom/personal stories regarding finding love, when you're told you are less than what you should be?","I apologize in advance, for how long this all is, and I'm especially sorry if this is the wrong place to come. I just really need to vent and I could really use some help. (If I need to remove this post, I will.) I sometimes post to /r/femboys, where I also posted this. Someone asked if I have ever considered that I might be transgender. I don't feel that I am, but maybe someone here could give me some insight.

I haven't posted in over a month. Honestly, I haven't dressed up in over a month. At first, it was that I didn't feel pretty/sexy enough. Now, I'm kinda feeling like throwing everything out and giving up on everything.

Why? I hung out with an ex this weekend, who I haven't seen since we broke up in high school. She came over and she found out about my...feminine side, when she found my stash of clothes and toys. She'd always known about it, I guess, just never knew *how* feminine I really was. She knew how much I liked my ass being grabbed, and she often teased my ass, during sex. It always bugged her, even though I didn't know I liked it until *she* started it. But, she was afraid I would leave her for a guy, and even cheat on her with a guy. It hurt that she felt that way.

So, fast forward to this weekend. After finding out, she relentlessly emasculated me. I know a lot of guys have a thing for being emasculated and feminized, in a controlled, masochistic way, but...I don't. I enjoy passionate sex more than aggressive sex. I want to be told I'm pretty while being fucked, not that I'm a sissy bitch. She called me a ""freak"" and ""faggot"" and she just...made me feel like complete shit. Kicked her out of my house, no plan of speaking to her. She called me today and apologized for it all and said she loved me ""so much"" but that it was just too weird for her that I wanted to ""be a girl."" Her reaction and abuse after discovering my secret wasn't a turn on, in any way. It hurt bad and now I feel like throwing every feminine article of clothing away and honestly, at this time, I just wish I was dead.

I don't want some big man to dominate me. I don't want some latex mistress to feminize me. I mean, it's fun to entertain the idea, sometimes, yeah, but my **ideal significant other** is a supportive woman who accepts my more-than-usual femininity, lovingly encourages me to embrace it, and helps me to comfortably discover more of it. I don't feel like any woman will ever accept me and my extremely feminine side, and that makes me feel worthless.

My thinking in coming to you here at /r/asktransgender is because I'm sure that at some point, before starting a transition, some of you may have had someone who resembled *my* ideal significant other. Someone supportive, who accepted, encouraged, and helped you. I don't hate being male, I just don't absolutely *like* being male, *all* the time. I'm *fine* with being a man, but I also want to be accepted for being a *feminine* man. A guy who's not ""less than male"" simply because he has a strong feminine side, too. How do I achieve that with someone who I'll care for and will care for me?"
PrayerRequest1,asktransgender,Question,"Hey, I have an issue and I need some help with it. It's nothing serious or important, just a minor thing.

I'm 17, Dmab/mtf and I just started hormonal and full social transition. Occasionally, I've been feeling the urge, the need, to seek out written transphobia on the internet and read it.

As expected, after reading this stuff I feel like shit, like I'll never be ""real"", that I'm just a fucked up mockery of who I want to be, that there's something wrong with me and I don't deserve to transition. 

How can I avoid this compulsion to read this shit, and how can I convince myself it's not true? I spoke at an LGBT youth support group last night and I felt a lot better for a while but now I'm worried I'm gonna feel the same way again.

midwestconfusion,asktransgender,Therapist question. (Not the normal kind),So this past Monday I had my second session with my therapist. And told her everything that had happened in the last month.  Her pretty much quoted response was; Well I was going to suggest you start doing everything that you just told me. Now at this point i was excited. But what bothers me is that she asked me if I wanted to come back in a month.  I know WPATH says if i want to do HRT that i must see a therapist for a minimum of 3 months. But its almost like she would have gave me my letter if i would have asked for it.  With knowing that do you think i should say something about the letter on my next session or just see how it goes?

Adrian52298,asktransgender,How does voice therapy work exactly?,"I know for male to female transgenders, voice is a key factor in transitioning.

So I've heard that vocal training/therapy is necessary to get a decent natural female voice. I've heard that they help you with your voice on certain topics like speaking, tone, pitch, coughing, sneezing, yawning, breathing, etc.

But how exactly effective is it? 

Can you please go into detail on how they teach you?

Do they go over other topics like singing, screaming, sounds of being in pain, etc?

And when I start taking estrogen, will my voice ""stay"" or ""remain"" exactly how it is now? Meaning it won't get any deeper?

shyember,asktransgender,How did you find self-acceptance after a lifetime of self-loathing / repression?,"I'm beginning to come to terms with being trans. I put forth concerted effort in my previous life to be a stereotypically masculine man, or to at least ignore / repress my feminine leanings.

I so engrained this behavior, that when my mounting dysphoria finally made itself undeniably clear to me in early December, that I was actually shocked by the revelation. Physically and mentally stunned by an image in my mind of a female me in a mermaid dress, and an overwhelming feeling of *rightness* that I had previously not known in my grey-fog life up until that point.

It snapped me out of my denial long enough for me to do some digging on what it might mean, and suddenly all the little signs and repressed memories of my femininity came surging back, pointing like so many highway exit signs to a single destination: ""You're probably transgender, dumbass.""

In a rare moment of clarity, I suggested it to my wife, who noted that she'd known for most of our marriage that I wanted to be a woman, but like me, thought nothing of it. #picardfacepalm

I started doing some more digging and tried the basics: shaving my legs (that was *divine*), trying on some girls' clothes (rather awkward on my nasty-square frame) and, after remaining mum on the topic while celebrating Christmas with my in-laws, shaving my beard off as soon as I was able (oh, god, have I really let myself go *that much?* -- that was a bad night).

The previous two months have been a blur. I've purchased a small wardrobe (thrift stores, yeah!) and have some clothes that actually compliment what small amount of figure I have. I enjoy wearing them, though I'm still completely freaked out about wearing them outside because as soon as I step outside my door, I'm convinced that I don't pass. And, I mean, really... I've got long hair, but I'm overweight and pre-HRT &amp; laser, so I'm not really surprised that I find it so terrifying.

I've got some basic makeup, and have watched a few tutorial videos from other transgirls around the interwebs about hiding beard shadow and applying a realistic amount of makeup to one's face. I enjoy my face quite a bit more with makeup on, but I'm still off-put by the amount and the darkness of my facial hair. It's really, really gross. That's an opinion that I've had since it started growing on me. Ick.

I'm out to close family (parents, sister, in-laws (yikes!)) and friends, and my wife will even call my by my name &amp; pronouns whenever I'm presenting around the house, so there's that.

I'm also out to HR at work. I wanted to give them a heads-up so that they're not in the dark when I start hormones and a co-worker asks ""Why does (deadname) have boobs?""

I've also experienced several bouts of severe dysphoria sprinkled through the previous two months. Again, feelings I've not felt previously in life. Intense, suffocating sadness and disgust at my body and my genitalia. My wife, having born witness to a couple of these episodes, has accepted me as transgender. &lt;3

That's about where I am today. I posted a rather glib, horrible little temper-tantrum over on /r/MTF about being ""gatekeep'd"" by my therapist, where most of the subreddit rightfully yelled at me that the WPATH standards of care *require* lengthy, expensive diagnostic delays, and I should've done my research better. Yes, I accept that. I am a noob.


My biggest problem is twofold right now:

1. I'm completely terrified about the social side of transition. I didn't have a girly childhood, I was raised as a boy and I preferentially selected male socialization to prevent harassment while I was in school (all forms of it). As a result, I have almost no social skills, and attempting to converse with women as I am today results in typical answers reserved for creepy men. :-( I'm also terrified of going out in public for fear of being clocked and harassed.

2. I still have trouble believing that I'm trans. No, not believing... there's mountains of evidence if I'm honest with myself, and look at my tendencies and raw desires leading up to today. To say *nothing* of the intense dysphoria I've started to be hit by recently; feelings stronger than any I've felt previously in my life. There's a flipside, too, in the gender *euphoria* I've experienced with every step I've taken to feminize my body or appearance. It feels *so right* and yet, my mind still wants to deny it. No, I have problems **accepting** that I'm trans. I don't want to be trans. I don't want to be a man, but I *really* don't want to be trans. FML.


So, hey, /r/Asktransgender, what did *you* do to accept yourself after a lifetime of denial? Does anyone here have any good mental exercises that I can try in the morning?

My hope is that I'm not alone, and this post will help others who are in my position as well."
SecretOfficerNeko,asktransgender,Good text and video resources to show a parent?,"So I came out to my father a few days ago via email, and he responded with saying that we should meet to discuss it in person 'one-on-one' in a few days so that he could compile his thoughts on the matter, but he was not dismissive, and seems to just want to talk about it and to get a better understanding. 

He likely is doing his own research into the matter in the meantime, but I also want to have resources available for him for when we talk together. Do any of you know any good text, picture, or video resources for talking with parents about being transgender or transitioning?

Preferably It'd be best if the resources aren't that long, since we're just meeting to discuss this, and these really are just things which we will use to round things off, but I'm open to whatever suggestions people have."
laurenbarnett,asktransgender,I am alone and falling apart with zero support in life.,"Okay, so I am constantly sending out nothing but positive vibes into the world and for the most part feel happy in life, but there is some negative energy deep inside me. I am not sure what my deal is, I was feeling pretty okay for the most part since starting my journey, other than figuring out how to tell people about me. (I have zero support, IRL or online, I find it extremely difficult to grasp the concept of trust and open up to people, due to life experiences, and find it even more challenging to open up about being transgender when I am presented the opportunity, I mentally can not do this any other way than face to face, I even know exactly what I want to say, so that's not the problem, I just literally can not make myself say the words.) But back to the main topic.. I went and saw a therapist for my letter (1/14/16), and got it after just one, one hour visit, I found it to be a very surreal moment, and actually was taken back a little at how easy the whole process was, this was also the first time I’ve presented myself as Lauren to anyone. I do not want to rush my journey, seeing as how it is my whole life I am talking about, so I waited about a week or so to make an appointment for my blood work. (Done on 2/2/16.) I continued to heavily think about my decisions in life leading up to my appointment, and was still generally happy and okay with myself while waiting, the day of my appointment I was pretty nervous though and almost backed out, but did not let myself. Once inside the doctors office I was welcomed warmly and everything went so well, after my appointment I was feeling even better than before, still only really feeling down about no one else knowing me truly. That’s pretty much when the good side ends… I have still not got my test back, and have called and was told they were there but they had not looked at them yet a week ago, I am not sure how long it takes, but I figured I would have got them back by now. Maybe it is just my stress from not telling anyone and waiting on my test, as well as plenty of other situations, but I am falling into a hole and am having trouble getting myself out, I have been thinking about just giving up lately and settling on life as it is, this thought gets me down even more and I feel I am stuck in some weird cycle that is never ending, I hate every aspect of being male to the point where my head will begin to hurt at times and I will feel this flinch type feeling inside, this mostly happens when someone says my legal name. I am also almost one hundred percent sure that my parents found out I am trans today, and can not look at them without the constant thought of “they know” running in my mind. I feel somewhat okay about the fact, but it just feels weird now.. 

Basically, I am depressed but hide it so well from others that I even trick myself into thinking I am okay. I feel like a bottle with a leak in it, I feel so full and happy at times, and then I get deep into my head and everything is sucked out within an instant. I do not think I am as strong as I tell myself, I have trouble rationalizing life, trust, friends, family, gender, and purpose. I’m sorry if this is too long or  all over the place, my head is just all over the place right now.. Thanks for anyone who cares to read."

Kit-ra,asktransgender,"ATTENTION! My therapist and I are working together to build a trans ""Big Brother Big Sister"" type system and I need YOUR help!","Hello!

First of all, thank you for reading my post! I appreciate your show of interest! Now, I know you're looking at this going ""Oh God, a wall of text."" but I assure you THIS IS WORTH IT! PLEASE READ! 

Are you still there? Awesome! By now, I am sure you are wondering ""What's this 'Big Brother Big Sister' thing all about?""

My therapist has a significant transgender customer base, and a few weeks ago she mentioned to me that she was interested in building a frame work to connect transpeople with other transpeople for a variety of supportive reasons. She brought it up to me because she thought I might be interested in participating as a ""Big Sister"" to other transpeople. As I am sure MANY of you who frequent r/asktransgender, r/MtF, r/FtM reddits know that the support provided in these reddit (and many others) can be indispensible and at times downright LIFE SAVING. Point is, things like this help and we can always use MORE when it comes to supporting our brothers and sisters before/during/after their transition. 

Anyways, we've been talking about it and we're going to work together to make this thing a reality for our community! We're currently working on forms for both the ""Big's"" and the ""Little's"" so that we can have a starting point for screening people and figuring out who might be a best fit for who.

THIS IS WHERE I NEED YOU HELP!

Disclaimer: Doesn't matter if your MtF/FtM/Genderfluid/Queer/Variant/Non-Conforming/Two-Spirited/Whatever. We need input from ALL OVER the spectrum!

* 1. Let's pretend for a moment shall we? Let's pretend, you are at the start to middle of your transition (or if you actual are, don't pretend, be real!), remember the things you struggled with (doubting your trans status, dysphoria, depression, isolation, makeup, clothing, etc)? Do you remember what you wish you could of had, that another human being could have provided (communication, a friend, hangout partner, someone to go out as yourself with, etc)? Do you remember the kinds of things that happened, that people thought were helpful but actually weren't (being overly brutally honest, rushing your transition, being an obnoxious cheerleader, etc)? I want you to think about those things for a moment, and type a few of the things you wish you could of had at the beginning and middle of your transition.
* 2. This is fun! Let's pretend some more! Let's pretend, you are in the late part of your transition at some unspecified point in your journey and you are closing in on being ""full time"" or ""surgery"" or ""stealth"" or whatever YOUR finish line is (or if you actually are, don't pretend, be real!). Let's also pretend you have a friend who has come out as trans, and they are looking to YOU for support (you also happen to be the supportive kind). What kinds of things are you willing to do, to support them (someone to talk to about trans stuff, help figuring their status out, help finding a therapist, clinic, etc)? Are their limits/boundaries? What do those look like (only communicate via text/email, no texts after 9pm, etc)? Are their deal breakers (clingy, super emo, etc)? If yes, please explain!
* 3. Any additional comments you'd like to make, suggestions, etc. Go crazy!

I would GREATLY appreciate your input and thank everyone who participates! Your contributions are going to directly impact our work and help us fine tune the experience for everyone involved. Thank you.

UPDATE #1: This program is going to be available locally to start, and if it succeed's I don't see any reason we wouldn't be able to build an online platform to increase it's reach. Let's not get ahead of ourselves though, for now it's only available to the Southern Indiana area locally.

UPDATE #2: Just to re-iterate; this program is something we are working on in our PHYSICALLY LOCAL COMMUNITY. This whole discussion is about research and learning about what support a ""Little""  might need and what support a ""Big"" might be willing to provide."
myaltaccount86,asktransgender,Has anyone had changes to their sexual preference while transitioning?,"I've read in a couple places, and my therapist has told me that when transitioning your sexual preferences can change. 

For example, I was asked if I'm attracted to men or women and I said that I consider myself bisexual, however I am much more attracted to women than men. And I was told ""sometimes during transition your sexual preference can change. You might find that you are more attracted to men or less attracted to women. Is that something you can be comfortable with?"" And I'm attracted to whomever I happen to be attracted to. That doesn't bother me at all. This whole conversation was over a half a year ago, so I don't really remember the details so I'm paraphrasing.

kiDsALbDgC9QmLFiIrrj,asktransgender,Does anyone else feel uncomfortable around non-passing trans women?,"I have to start this text by saying this: I am so, so, sorry.

I feel so, so guilty for feeling this way, but I don't think I'm going to be helping anyone if I try to pretend I feel differently than I actually do (isn't that what got us into this mess in the first place?).

I've been looking around for support groups, but a lot of them haven't been age specific, and a lot of them have been made mostly up of older (40+) trans women. In a group I went to just today, there was a 67 year old woman who was bald, had a deep voice, and was covered in piercings and tattoos.

For some reason, this kinda freaks me out. I've had anxiety issues for basically my whole life, and meeting new people isn't easy for me anyway.

I can't really explain why this freaks me out so badly. Maybe I'm projecting my own incredible sense of shame at myself onto them. Maybe I'm afraid that I'll look like that after I transition, and stand out from society forever. Maybe I feel guilty for having this reaction and thinking that being trans means I need to constantly be making a political statement every waking moment of my life.

Does anyone else know what I'm talking about? Can you guys help me work past this?"

I don't know what type of specific question I have but I don't know where else to post my problems on here. I guess if I could think of one it would be: why should I still be alive? am I lying to myself? will I ever be able to actually convince other people that I'm a girl or will they all just pretend and treat me poorly? nobody around me seems to care and they almost seem to get annoyed hearing me complain about my problems. maybe it won't be long before everyone is like that too, I don't know."
AeonianWolf,asktransgender,"""Can I pass?"", and generic age ranges for different success rates in that regard.","This is my first (second?) post here, and I'm extremely curious about what you guys think is the age range when it comes to passable transitioning.

First off, I'm 16 years of age, known I'm trans (MtF) since 12, and I'm fairly certain that I could pass. I'm shorter than almost everyone in my year group, short than most in the 3 below me as well. I often get mistaken as someone 2 (sometimes 3) years younger, and in the fitting year group at my school. I'm not a large build, quite small in fact, nor am I ""masculine"".

So, how long until I don't pass when is start? I live in New Zealand, so without any parental help it's near impossible to do anything until you are 18 (and even with help you can only have blockers). As soon as I reach that age, I'm getting stuff hella done.

At what age, generally speaking, does someone not quite pass as female when they are MtF? Is there a decent shot at me being fine until 18?"

As I get older the depression gets stronger and harder to over come. I am 43 trans M-F post OP. I guess I am luckier then most in that I got my srs in 2014 but after I got it I lost my job that allowed me to get it and since then I have only managed to old 2 jobs for a total of 4 months. To get the surgery I moved into my parents house but in 3 days I have to move out and I don't have a job.I will be moving into my boyfriend's place that he got for me when I had a job 2 weeks ago. I was working for the post office which was only temp as it turns out. I have put in apps every where for the last 2 weeks and not a single call. Even places that will hire anyone won't call me. My boyfriend doesn't understand why. he can't afford to support both of us. I tried to get food stamps but was turned down cause i made too much money in the past. 
I am out of gas and out of options. Oh in I live in San Antonio, tx So I sit here trying to think of a reason not to hang myself in the next day or so..so far I can't think of a good reason to be alive. if I don't find a job in the next 4 days I will be putting my boyfriend at risk of losing his place to live. So why should I do that to him. Its better I end my life and allow him to find someone else and get a roommate that can keep him safe. Sure my dad would be sad and so will my BF but those are the only people that even care if I am alive or not. So I can make 2 people sad or I can risk really hurting one that I care so much about. Logic says 2 people sad is better then one hurt badly. So I guess that is the right choice ending my life, I guess I will do it Thursday night after my dad goes to bed that way i will have a chance to say good by to my dad and BF. OF coarse I won't tell them what I am doing.

Nalaniel,asktransgender,A question about gender identity and presentation,"Does one have to present as the gender they identify with to be called the right pronouns? If someone (let's say an MTF individual) decides not to transition but wants to be called she/her, is that a legitimate wish? I know that strangers cannot tell if someone wants to be seen as male or female, but we're talking about friends, buddies and family here. There are various reasons as to why someone wouldn't want to transition. Social pressure, conformism, anxiety. I think it's not that hard to fulfill the wish of said individual. I would call an MTF individual she/her if they wanted it that way, even if they decided not to transition. 

What does the trans community of this reddit forum think? Please do not pay too much attention to my example. It is just a means to explain the situation. This is also applicable to non-binary, FTM and other individuals that might find themselves in such a situation. "
AnnaRose96,asktransgender,NSFW anal sex question,"Hi everyone,
So I'm a bi Trans girl and out of all the other trans women i've met (who are attracted to guys) i'm the only one I know of that is seriously squeaked out at the thought of anal sex. I'm pretty open to most things and honestly it sort of scares me off guys. Like  what could I even do, would i get used to it/ like it with time or will it always feel uncomfortable and 'off'. It just feels like i have no options in bed with a cis man/ trans man who's into pegging, besides giving them a blowjob. I can't really handle having my bits touched by other people, its just a complete turn off for me at best. 

So I guess the questions I'm asking are:

1. What can I do to get over my aversion to anal sex and see it as a fun positive thing?; and
2. If I can't get over it what could I do with a guy in bed other than giving him head?

anntike,asktransgender,Did anybody else have this thing were your new name kind of picked you at an early age and you didn't know what it meant at the time?,"&gt; title edit: this thing *where*

For me it was like that. I was watching this TV show when I was like ten years old one and of the girls had this name that always stuck with me. Up until I started processing that I'm actually transgender I guess I always just thought I would meet a really cool girl with that name (spoiler alert: I didn't).  
But when the time came to think about what my new name was gonna be, it wasn't even a question. I finally realized that this was actually my name all along.

And this morning I searched the forums for another thing regarding the name change and I found a thread where someone else said that this was basically their story as well. So I was wondering if this was something only a few of us experience or if it's actually a common thing."
DiscordiaEris,asktransgender,Subtle ways to alter gender expression?,"Hello,

I have recently been experimenting with subtly changing my gender expression in public. Specifically, I have been growing my nails a bit and applying a clear polish to them, and sitting with my legs crossed. Both of these things feel really good for some reason. Are there any other **subtle** ways to make my presentation just a little more feminine, or just to make myself feel that way? One example might be to wear girl underwear, but I don't think I am at that point yet.

Thanks for your answers.

NewMen282,asktransgender,I need advice on how to handle things with my boyfriend,"(Hey guys, so, sorry of my English is not perfect, I really doubt it is since I’m still learning, I’ve never used reddit, but I found this site open on my SO computer this morning and I found out he has being using this site to seek help, he asked me to try it out when I mentioned)

I’m a 25yo transguy, I know this since I was 17, but I was raised by ministers and my parents are on the more conservative side, so I had a life time hearing how devlish transgenders are and how wrong it is to be a part of the whole LGBT community, but now I can’t hide this anymore, I hate being seeing as a women, I hate my body and looking at myself in the mirror! This is driving me crazy! I know I’m a gay men, I’ve always felt attracted to males, and this hasn’t always ended well (I’ve dated my share of assholes) . My boyfriend is 23 and the best man I’ve known my whole life, we’ve been together for the last 3 years and we live together since last April. He’s caring, understanding, incredibly smart and generous and compassionate with everyone around him. I love how he holds me against his shoulder when he arrives from work, how he cooks for me and how small I look next to him (he’s 1,94m), his whole self makes me happy, and I don’t want to lose him!!! 

A few weeks ago I told him that I’m tans and I want to transition (I’ve being seeing a therapist for the last years and a half and she helped me to come to this decision). At first I was scared he would snap, but he did the most amazing thing I could imagine! He hugged me, kissed me and told me all would be okay, but he needed to think and digest this, he was wonderful!! I asked him if it would be okay if I told our friends about myself, he was okay with it and so I did it. A few of our friends (his best friends actually) were not okay at all and aren’t helping him, but I trust him to decide what to do with them! 

I’m starting to be worried about him, I can feel he’s confused, but researching and trying to learn as much as he can, he’s angry, depressed and started to smoke again, but he’s willing to try, he says he want to try to know the men he found himself with, I told him that who I am will never change, just how I look, I don’t know if he believes me, he has never being interested in man, and don’t know if he’ll still be attracted to me now, but he’s willing to try. He never yelled at me, never held anything against me and still is the amazing supportive guy I’ve always known, but it’s killing me to see him so sad, I feel guilty and like I’m losing him. I’m trying to take things slowly and respect his wishes, he already is trying to call treat me as a dude, and it makes me feel amazing, but I don’t want to hurt him? Should I break up in order to spare him? How can I help him? Please, I need advice.

I'm getting things together for starting hormone therapy in the near future (YAY! :D), but I don't really know which way I'm supposed to proceed in this regard, as my health service has said they can't write the prescriptions due to lack of experience on what the proper dose would be, or what to look for.

Also, how much can I expect to pay an endocrinologist over the course of the therapy? Should I brace myself now, and did your insurance cover the endocrinologist care?

teenelmo26,asktransgender,Day 1 of HRT! I have a few questions though.,"So today is the day, my doctor has prescribed hormones!  Estradiol for the first few weeks, then we are going to add Spiro (making sure no side effects and all that).  Very excited, but I have a question:

1.Doctor said it would be Estrace.  Pharmacy gave me Estradiol.  Is this the same?

2.Doctor said to take them sublingualy (under the tongue).  Pharmacist told me that is wrong and they are orally swallowed.  Upon looking online it seems you can take them either way.  So is my doctor correct or the pharmacist?  For today I did it sublingualy, as per doctors instructions, and online it seems that method has better results.

DolphinOfDestiny,asktransgender,Am i transsexual or a crossdreamer?,"I'm a 17 year old heterosexual male ande ever since puberty I've had arousing thoughts and dreams about having a female body. But up until a few days ago i've always dismissed the idea of me being trans, now i am unsure if i really want to be a girl or if it is just a fetish.

When i recently discovered the term ""crossdreaming"" i started looking around for people online who felt the same way i did. When I looked through articles and posts about it I was secretly hoping that it wold mean I was transsexual, but it could just have been my fetish speaking. Ever since I started reading about the subject I've wondered how i would look and feel being a woman, the thought arouses me but I also think I feel something else.

Anyways here is some background info about me that might help determine if I am trans:

* At an early age the majority of my friends were girls and sometimes when i had the chance i dressed up in female clothing.

* I kind of dislike my penis and I have always felt it has mostly been in the way. This is probably one of the reasons that i have never masturbated or felt any real appeal to intercourse.

* My behavior is in some aspects more ""feminine"" than ""masculine"", meaning I am often emotional and a bit introverted. I don't know if this matters but i thought it was worth noting.

Before you just say ""go see a therapist"", understand that i probably will do that but i just want to check if it is not just because of a fetish.


**Edit:** Thank you to everyone sharing their thoughts, it means a lot to me. I've spent some time thinking about my sexuality and what I really identify as and I have come to the conclusion that at least I don't want to be male, so i am trans in some sense. Figuring out what identify as is a lot harder. 
I have tried using a more feminine body language and it feels somewhat natural but at the same time it doesn't feel 100% like me as I know myself. That, along with not looking like a woman, is one of my greatest fears about having a transition, losing myself trying to be someone I think I am.
Does it make sens that i want to have a female body but not fully identify as a woman?

Is it a good trade off going full time?,"I went full time about 7 weeks ago.  I'm still getting used to things to some extent but one thing I've noticed is that any time someone uses my old name or pronouns while I'm presenting female, it's been really getting to me.  Two months ago, this wasn't a problem.  People would use my old name and pronouns all the time and that was to be expected.  I didn't react to it.  But now it can hit me hard.  Though I wish it didn't.  It doesn't happen too often but there's a about three people who still occasionally mess up.  It would be nice if I could just notice it and move on and that'd be all.  Have other people noticed this?  Am I always going to be sensitive to this?  Is there anything I can do so it won't affect me so much?  And lastly since going full time I've been feeling a lot less of that constant background level dysphoria I did before.  Do you think it's a good trade off going full time, to feel much less dysphoria in general but get hit by it hard at times others mess up?"

Antony2016,asktransgender,Healthy masturbation/fantasy advice for pre-everything MTF lesbian/recovering femdom addict? (NSFW) (rambling),"I was stuck for ten years on an addiction to sissy humiliation/emasculation/goddess worship clips. Since my teenage years I always masturbated anally and never had any psychological urge to use my cock with a partner. So I was never in a relationship, and felt enormous grief that I could not understand why I would fall so deeply in love with girls but have no impulse to touch them, let alone try to spear them with my masculinity.

So I got lost in a porn and femdom addiction, though I could never get into anything involving cock, cum, forced bi, etc. If I watched straight porn it would just be to get high on dysphoria and grief at not being a powerful cismale able to please the women I found so attractive.  As part of this I heavily abused poppers for the past six years because they amplify my sexual pain and, when done to excess, they make my dick disappear.

Then FINALLY earlier this month after buying a particular transformation clip I worked out that I am a transgender lesbian, and I just needed to get out of the closet and let go of all this sexualised self hatred. 

This led to some amazing experiences watching lesbian porn using poppers, a vibrating inflatable buttplug, and a pocket rocket for the front, in which I was able to imagine myself being the girl, and to masturbate like a girl. But clearly that is still part of an addictive and isolating pattern of porn/drug use that I want to leave behind.

In the past I have attended 12 Step groups like SLAA and SAA but they are difficult places as 99% cis, and usually require completely stopping masturbating which would make dysphoria worse (or would it?).

I am now finding myself unlocking healthy lesbian fantasies that don't involve my hated male self in my sexual thoughts or identity at all.  I am starting to be able to imagine myself making lesbian love with a girl, kissing and caressing each other, as if my dick doesn't exist and isn't something I need to be humiliated or emasculated over.   I want to speed up this emergence of my lesbian sexual self, and what I have heard called gender euphoria.

I can see that I will likely leave behind the intensity of my previous sexual habits, but I will be better connected to my true libido and positive sexual impulses.

I have just come out as a lesbian to one female friend who is very cool and good to talk to.

I am not in a position to start to look into HRT as I need to find work and also lose a very significant amount of weight.

So, that's where I am at. Any advice gratefully received.  And I would be interested to hear what kind of sexual thoughts, fantasies and practices other transgender lesbians have, and how did they evolve as you came out to yourself?

EskNerd,asktransgender,Any other trans women experience symptoms associated with a monthly cycle even before starting HRT?,"Back before I had even come out to *myself* as trans, I noticed a monthly pattern consisting of painful lower back cramps, mood swings, and acne breakouts. Once my cis wife and I started living together, I eventually began to experience these symptoms around the same time she did, each month.

I asked my gender therapist about this pattern, and whether it was possible for a trans woman to experience symptoms associated with a menstrual cycle. She merely said, in a tone bordering on patronizing, ""sure, I don't see why not.""

When I asked the same question of the ob/gyn who initially prescribed my HRT, she responded with a condescending *snort*. (Her bedside manner left much to be desired, and I subsequently found another, more supportive doc.)

Sharkwhether,asktransgender,"So, been an up and down ride. Could use...help? Or to just talk.","So, A few months ago, oh...hmm...maybe in september, maybe August, it suddenly kinda hit my like a wave that SOMETHING was up with me.

I wasn't sure what, too much in my life supported the idea I wanted to be more effeminate, even a woman (if I had a button I could push to instantly become a pretty lady, I would) but then here's the rub.

So, after that, I confided in a few close friends, scared and needed someone to talk to, thankfully, went flawless, they are were and are there. But, around November it all fell apart, I stopped thinking about any of it, and went back to the way things had always been.

Now, the past 2 months it came back hard, I've been wokring my ass off (Hopfully not all of it!) to lose weight, losing 7 pounds a week roughly, going biggest loser on this! But there is one thing nagging me, and it never stops.

I'm...not uber masculine, which I'm thankful for. It's hard for me to see truly my body shape under my fat (have 80 pounds to go.) but I took measurements, my hips and shoulders are almost the same width, my face is fairly soft and round (Had people say I have a baby face, which could wokr in my advantage, I guess.) But, I'm so, unbelievable terrified.

I am big, not just overweight, I mean big. I am 6'3"" tall. And I am so terrified of the idea of working, doing all I can to become more effeminate, only to realize I have no hope of looking even relatively like a woman. I am, genuinely, scared.

I know, people say ""Passing shouldn't matter"" But it does to me, it does. I don't need to be a super model, but I want to look womanly, I want to be able to think I'm cute or pretty, and I am deathly afraid of, no matter what I do, looking in a mirror and looking like a trucker with a dress.

Sorry this is so long winded but I don't know what to do, I guess. It's like this fear stops me dead in my tracks from making ANY progress on anything, hell, even if I wasn't trans, losing the weight is something I need to do, it's better for me! But even that just halts as this fear cripples me.

I don't even know if any of this is a question, just a ramble, but I have nowhere else to talk about this, my friends, while great, are all cis and wouldn't have much input. So....blah.

I have no idea how to overcome this, or if I can, or if I should even worry. I'd post a picture of myself, but even that scares me. Sorry for this being just...a mess."

It turns out it might even  be bilateral.  That was one of the more stressful exams I've been through even though she was trying to be understanding.

Anyway, the upshot is I need mesh surgery to repair this defect which is inside the canal.  Has anyone else dealt with this and then went on to have successful SRS?  Are there any problems regarding the mesh?  I noticed from the diagrams that the mesh covers right over the hole where the t-factory wires go in.  I'm afraid that might cause issues.  I'm not sure what SRS does with that left over plumbing once the gonad removal is done.

In short, her dysphoria gets worth with every passing month. At least once a week she will say she is giving up. She ultimately doesn't but I feel like each time she mentions it she is one step closer to throwing in the towel.  
  
I want her to have a normal life. I want her to feel authentic. I want her to feel confident. I want her to feel beautiful and love herself. Right now none of those things have happened. She hardly leaves the house (only with me because she feels unsafe). She feels okay on an emotional level - except for the crippling depression. Her self esteem is at an all time low. She sees herself in the mirror and immediately has a dysphoric episode that lasts hours or even days. She often tells me that she hates her face, hates her body, and hates herself.  
  
I have scheduled intake therapy for both of us (separately) but the appts aren't for a few weeks. She has been in therapy in the past and because she has a background in psychology, she finds it pretty much useless.  
  
I feel helpless. I feel horrible that she feels this way. I wish I could help but I know I can't. All I want is for her to be happy. If this means de-transitioning, I support that as well... I just worry that its only a temporary fix.

My (22F?) girlfriend is 25 and pre hormones due to being active military, which is expected to last almost another 4 years. She's recently started gender therapy, got a rec after the first session, and is now in the grueling process of trying to get to endo. She's already changed her doctor to do this, as her first one rejected her. She currently has a very supportive crew in regards to her work environment, less so in the barracks though, where she fears going out in female attire for herself and her vehicle.


* she wants to stay military for as long as she can, involving re-enlisting and going officer. I just....I don't get it. She wants to get legit front lines deployed eventually as well. She seems to think the ban will be 100% lifted in the upcoming months, and will be allowed to transition while on active, no problem. I haven't been able to find much that backs this up.


* she constantly shows me articles of violence towards trans women, and tells me how fearful she is of going out sometimes, but doesn't want to stop visiting little podunk redneck Southern towns, have hobbies with pretty unwelcoming environments (like auto repair), or have me try and speak up for her, or anything to try and help her out. Somehow she thinks moving somewhere more liberal and accepting won't help in any way....leading to point 3.....

We're ""too whiny, put ourselves out there so loudly, so why is it hard to imagine that violence towards us happens?"" she used violence towards POC's from police as an analogy for this and well....ugh. In a similar vein, she is anti-feminist in regards to 1st world countries, so, also....ugh.

And her mom is the most supportive of the bunch, it just goes downhill from there. She wants to give her family ""time to come around"", but it's been nearly 2 years. As someone who grew up with shitty conservatarded parents, I just left and haven't looked back, so her trying to deal with toxic people boggles me.


So, I guess my question is, how can she think these things? I've tried talking to her about this slowly, but the more she talks about it, the less logical it all seems. Help?"

Fairlady31,asktransgender,Social Anxiety: Does anybody else suffer?,"So I was out with my closest friend the other day, at her house smoking some weed and just chilling out. Her other friend who is a male came over, and for a while things were fine. I avoided talking mostly like I usually do, but I was actually out of my comfort zone for a bit (engaging in conversation, etc). We had been hanging out for around 2 hours, then she told me that her other friends were coming over (these two other girls and one of their boyfriends) around 6 PM. I don't know why, but that was it for me. I seriously can't handle larger groups of people, especially young people my age, I just feel like there's so much pressure. I started getting really dysphoric, I looked down and realized how big my feet look with my boots off, and then started noticing my finger hair for some reason and started getting really self conscious. So I made the excuse that I had to go for dinner and then just bounced for before anyone else arrived. I literally ran full speed in platform boots home. The next day (Friday) I was supposed to invite the same girl over for dinner at my house, but I felt too awkward about what happened and just didn't answer my phone all day. She seems pissed now and isn't returning my messages.

I'm so fucked up and it's tearing me apart. I like being by myself and in my comfort zone and can only handle brief periods of social interaction. I'm more fine at school because I feel like I don't have to be as ""on"", not knowing many people in my class and such. It's upsetting though because everyone including myself deserves friends and all I do is alienate myself from other people :(

Does anybody else experience this kind of stuff? It's limiting me from developing relationships and although I don't really care I know It's hindering my growth into adulthood."

newly_me,asktransgender,I need a hug :(,"Please, all I need is someone to tell me it'll be okay.

I'm 11 months into transition. All was well until about 6-7 months in, when my emotions started to get a little out of control (crying 10+ times a day, overwhelming depression). Despite this, the physical changes were something that kept me going everyday. I truly loved the person that I was becoming and the way my body was starting to feel.

5 weeks ago I tried the drug Lamictal at the suggestion of my doctor, as an off label treatment for the depression and mood swings. I was only on this drug for 7 days, but the impact that it's had on both my mind and body has been terrible.

My memory feels completely fucked. As soon as I walk into a room I forget what I was doing, or why I'm there. I've been unable to follow instructions at work because of the fog that still hasn't abated. For someone that was previously an exceptional performer (accountant), this is startling and frightening. I'm 29, and I've always had perfect health, and now all my joints feel like they're on fire and I've got tremors in both my hands. 

I could deal with all of this, but not the effect that it's had on my hormone levels. Again, I've been off this for 4 weeks now, and every day I'm watching all the changes that I had go backwards. I've had new facial hair come in (after having already completed laser), I've had fat redistributing, my hips have shifted back, and even my smell has changed back to what it was. And, the real kicker, my breasts are about 1/3 the size of what they were and the sensitivity is gone! 

It spiked my FSH and LH levels 4-6x higher than what they had been on my last blood test, elevated my T, and though my E was still normal, it's obviously not doing anything anymore. 

I don't know what to do. My family has been increasingly distancing themselves from me, and it feels like the one thing I was willing to chance everything on, has now backfired. I don't have many people to talk to, and now I'm so afraid that I've somehow permanently messed up the way my body metabolizes Estrogen, and that I'll never be able to physically transition. I can't even describe the pain of having all the changes I felt so positive about slide backwards on me. I feel so helpless, and so hopeless about it. I don't even fucking care about anything else that happens to me, if I can no longer fix my body, it doesn't matter.

Please, someone tell me everything will get better, and that it's worth it to keep fighting this battle :( "

So, I've been seeing this girl. I disclosed a while back and well, clothes came off last night. I put mine back on because I felt uncomfortable and scared, but she was very warm and careful and nice.

So, I gave her the one zine that we MTF's have about our sex lives. Later tonight, she mentions something about ""just realizing how attracted she is to trans* women.""

And then: ""...I think I've always been intrigued by and attracted to trans girls. I follow a trans model on facebook, those youtubers, and others. It's almost as if I feel like you are even more of a woman, a superior kind of woman. Sorry if I sound weird, but I have to go.""

My mood right now is a combination of ""What the f**k"" and ""how does this keep happening when I'm stealth."" I feel really weird and gross and uncomfortable - even though this girl has been literally perfect up until now. And on the one hand, being attracted to me is great. But just. 

Anyone have any advice or ways I can think through this?"

I'll be staying at Boston for several months this year and was thinking about starting working on removing the beard and my voice.

Does anyone have any good recommendations of places to go on either field?

Is that a good deal?) I also have no idea whether to let the beard grow for some time (days? weeks?) before going to a consultation.

Same deal with voice therapy. Not sure if there's a guide or list of recommended people. I'd do Skype too. I talk English as a second language so probably that's another hurdle to overcome but is better to start on that sooner than later.

Would love any suggestions or pointers about this. Thanks so much (and have an awesome Sunday!)

I've had gender dysphoria for a long time - I came out to my immediate family and friends when I was 15, that I feel that I need to transition to be male.

I've finally gotten down the road to actually transitioning, I've taken a male name and have come out to everybody who I know/see regularly/all my family etc. I've been crossdressing on and off for years but have finally switched to full time now.

I saw my psychologist today who said that my feelings are genuine - that they aren't some weird side effect of being mentally ill or abused or anything, and that she gives me the go-ahead to see an endo about getting hormone treatment.

This is something I've wanted for an extremely long time and the thought of being female for much longer fills me with disgust but I still can't help but feel nervous and uncertain about taking this next, irreversible step. 

Does this mean I'm not really transgender? Or is this a normal feeling? The fear of staying where I am, but also the fear of doing something so drastic/permanent? Any advice or help would be much appreciated - I'm feeling down because I can't understand why I have cold feet now, when I've felt this way for so long. 

Thanks,

BellaEllaElla,asktransgender,"Why whenever doubt is tossed my way, I get hardcore suicidal thoughts?","I got my prescription on Friday and pick up my doses, I'm good to go. I started for a day and half and then stopped. Why? because I realized that I should probably freeze some sperm.

Now I need to find a way to pay for it. As if being in college isn't enough. As if being transgender is enough. As if being in college, transgender, hardcore depressed, coming from a religious background wasn't enough. Now this.

I feel that I will regret not putting aside sperm further down the road the same way a pregnant teen often regrets giving away a kid they couldn't afford to raise.

This situation sucks dire.

I want to start HRT so badly. Perhaps it's because I am already low and assigned this as a last resort to happiness and if it doesn't go well, then who knows.

I've been on Reddit a lot. I have seen many posts that are similar to my situation. When will things get better? When will things be consistent? I'm so sick of having the ""win"" people's approval of my choice when all I wanted was some fucking help. Is that too much to ask for?

I can't get suicide thoughts out of my head, and it's becoming crippling and effecting my homework.

Most of my friends who I've told have been supportive. My family and some other friends think I'm moving too quickly.

I messaged my mom tonight just now to ask if there is any way that my parents can help me pay to freeze my sperm. I told her I got the hormones but I wanted to wait to do that for them. she appreciated it, she appreciated I told her and also appreciates that I don;t keep secrets from her. I'm her youngest child, I'm the last unmarried one. She can't let go of the fact that I am unhappy with myself.

She thinks I'm moving too quickly and is shocked when I said I have the hormones. She somehow thought I was going to wait until I saw a psychiatrist (I have an appointment a week from this Thursday.) Maybe it would be a good idea to hold off on hormones until then.

I made a gofundme, but it would take a miracle to be able to afford how much it costs to freeze sperm. :/

I just really want to continue with them because the second I initially started, I felt content and relaxed which is something I haven't felt in a really long fucking time (pardon my language, I'm venting, no excuse though :/)

I am also getting older by the day. More hair falls out, especially from all of this stress :/ The longer I wait, the longer my life goals get messed up as well.

I just don't know what to do anymore aside for something unthinkable. It's getting so hard. I just can't take it anymore. I feel like Frodo at the end of Lord of the Rings

Amy_85,asktransgender,I'm not ok right now... most of the time really,"Backstory: I'm 30 years old, AMAB, accepted that I was trans about a year ago with the help of some therapy which I could only afford with the money my father left me after he died.
I decided ultimately that since I was in the position of either transitioning and losing the woman I love in a slow and painful manner (someone I feel I cannot live without) that I would just continue to live my life in the closet. After all it worked for 29 years so I can keep it up if I get to stay with my love and start a family with her...



Fastforward 10 months to now. I am saving for a ring and we are talking marriage and babies and live together and everything. It is great, except everytime I am not preoccupied (like during my nightshift security job) I am overcome with dysphoria and doubt and all the depression. 

Tonight is especially bad. I've been having small anxiety episodes where my heart races and I get dizzy... that's a new level of dysphoria for me which makes me fear that I will be one of those for whom dysphoria gets worse over time, which does not bode well for the ""suck it up and be a man for the rest of your life"" plan. I feel like I am standing at a crossroads where both paths lead a mix of happiness and soul-crushing misery... either I lose the woman (and future family) I can't live without or I suffer this dysphoria for the rest of my life which seems like the cruelest torture devisable by man or god. 

There is no way out for me. I would never truly entertain the idea of suicide because I would never do that to those who love me (especially after having to go through the grief of losing my Dad) but I frequently fantasize about it... just the escape from the pain I guess...

I don't know why I'm writing this. I just need to vent I guess. It is after midnight and my girlfriend, who is the only person I am out to, is asleep. I know the advice I'll get here... ""dump her and move on, you'll find another."" Some people may be nice enough to at least acknowledge how painful losing someone you love can be, especially when you're looking at turning yourself into a fugly man in a dress and dooming yourself to a life of solitude as a result. And I know that the purely logical and emotionless thing to do is to move on and try and take a stab at being myself and being with someone who can handle it too. But logic and love don't often meet. The idea of losing her hurts as much as the idea of never getting a chance to try and let Amy out.

So here I am, in horrible pain and at a crossroads where both paths lead to more pain. I wish suicide was an option to me sometimes."

I don't know why but I just really felt the need to tell someone about it tonight and kind of just made the decision to do it on a whim. My mom was amazingly supportive and, even though I was in a puddle of tears the entire time, she kept a straight face and kept telling me how much she loved and supported me no matter what. She said that we needed to talk to my dad about it and then I can go see a gender therapist. I'm honestly not that worried about telling my dad because he has always been way more relaxed about these kinds of things than my mom. I can only imagine that she is internally struggling with this right now because she has always been kind of close minded and uncomfortable about lgbt issues but she didn't show it at all.


I just love her so much and can't believe I finally told her. I feel like I'm in a dream and can't stop crying.

I've only come out to one person that wasn't a therapist or a stranger on the internet. She was really positive about the whole thing, but this wasn't really a surprise. Her boyfriend is trans. That's really the whole reason I came out to her.

I have one other friend who I think might be ok with it, but I haven't talked to her.

I have no idea how anyone else will react. Most of my other friends despise my friend's trans boyfriend (they used to refer to him as ""thingfriend""). I don't know if this has anything to do with the trans thing, or if they just don't like him.

I also don't really know how my family is going to react either. I would describe my relationship with my immediate family as good, but very distant. I don't really talk about my feelings with anyone, including them.

I'm really worried because while my friends might be assholes sometimes, I really believe that they're people I couldn't replace if I tried.

Not only that (and understand, I'm not saying this to alarm anyone) if my friends and family do decide that they don't want anything to do with me, well, there isn't a whole lot else keeping me here. If no one in my life is going to care about me, I'd rather just check out and kill myself.

pixilsaturn,asktransgender,"MtF, 6 months HRT, went from being apathetic about my plumbing to very recently having recurring ""ickiness"" about it. has anyone else had that?","Hey everyone. 

Not sure if anyone remembers me, lord knows I've needed help a lot through my transition to this point. I've made a few posts about being unsure that I'm trans in the past, and if you DO remember me, the update on that is that I'm doing well.

I'm at almost the 6 month mark and have recently discovered the secret to ceasing my backward spirals into doubt and fear and suddenly-denying-im-trans-imposter-syndrome, which was a psychological dependence on porn and masturbating (an issue I developed by using porn and excessive masturbation to hide from bad feelings, going so far as to disrupt my own social plans just to be able to indulge myself). I've been getting clean of that, taking a hiatus from ""exploring the body"" and ditching porn altogether (go me!) and my ride through my transition lately has been calming and peaceful.


**CURRENT QUESTION STARTS HERE**

Except that a few times since discovering my ""trigger"", and doing my best to cease it... I'd had issues where I go to the bathroom, sit down to pee, feel... ""that thing"" touching the toilet seat or the tissue when I wipe and suddenly shaking and feeling very ill at ease, almost panicky. Grossed out. Squicked.

It feels like touching a gross bug. Or a pile of slime, or like pouring milk out that you know has gone bad. My face scrunches up and my body kinda twitches and I have the compulsion to squeeze my eyes shut and not look. 

The first few times werent too bad but today I had a little freak out at work in the staff washroom, where the experience was a straight-up ""WHY ISNT THIS A VAGINA NO NO NO"" feeling, complete with mentally imagining a vagina there instead of a penis and just wanting to stop looking at what was there. 

It feels so weird because up until I quit my triggering vice (which I eloquently now refer to as ""fuckturbating"", since I don't do it with any sense of love for myself, just the need for release and indulgence in porn) I had apathy towards my bits. They were there, and I didn't care about them. They just were. I never even bothered to tuck since it was never a confidence issue, I just wore long sweaters when my pants were too tight (and I was luckily very small anyway) so it wasnt an issue. 

But this? I get super grossed out by it. My life has gotten so much more real since I started HRT and now I feel like that ""realness"" is affecting the apathy I used to feel in this regard.

Is all this normal? Is there anything I can do to... curb the discomfort until I get far enough along for bottom surgery? Has anyone else ever had this happen to them??

Osricthebastard,asktransgender,Ummwut? Fuck. A story about being outed by serendipity to someone I didnt even know yet.,"So I put an add on craiglist: looking for metal musicians, want to get serious, cocknozzles need not apply. I got a response from a drummer, we met for drinks, we hit it off, then pretty quickly we were splitting rent on a jam room together.

Things ended up working out really well. Within a month we've got 2 songs written that we're really proud of. We're struggling to get other people on board (not exactly a rich metal scene in my neck of the south) but we're having fun and taking it seriously and it looks like its paying off. Of course the whole time Ive got this thing in the back of my head: he thinks Im a cis guy but Im 7 months into hrt. Its this nagging thing that wont let me just enjoy creating music with the first other musician Ive genuinely managed to be productive with.

So I started to figure out pretty quick that the double life is going to fall apart eventually. I made a second fb account and all too quickly several people at work had found it. I havent been entirely outed up there but I suspect word will get around pretty quickly over the next couple of weeks.

This is where it gets weird. I run into a gay guy I know from some queer gatherings Id been to. He knows me as Rose. He mentioned that he heard I was in a band. ""Uhh... Yeah we just started and it hasn't really taken off yet."" The big issue is that at this point its just me and the drummer and a jam room. No other people have really been involved yet. We interviewed one guitarist who flaked pretty quick. That was it. For my part I havent really been all over facebook with it so a small part of me is fixated with wondering how this guy knew so quickly Id joined a band. We'd just started.

Long story short he does work for a local charitable organization and offers to hook us up with stage time at local benefits once we get off the ground.

So I go back next jam practice and I mention to my drummer that this guy offered us a gig once we get a full band going. I mention that I had no idea how this person knew I was in a band though. Drummers asks for the guys name. I drop it. The drummer knows him. Its a friend of his sister's. The drummer mentions that his sister does work for the local Pride festival.

At this time Im actually starting to freak a little bit. Too many weird coincidences. Its all just a little too close for comfort.
Between then and the next two practices I ended up going to another queer function as Rose of course. Who's there? Gay guy. And ""oh yeah that girl over there is your drummer's sister."" fuuuuuuuuuuuuuucccccccccccckkkkkkkkk me.

So by the end of that function I pretty much knew what I had to do. If I didnt rip the band aid off he was going to find out one way or the other and better to hear it from me first. Band practice was the next day. Game face. Lets do this.

I go to practice. Feels awkward as fuck, but I put in my 3 hours. Then 3 hours is up and my heart is beating in my chest but I know I need to grow some backbone and spit it out soon. So I open with:

""So I actually met your sister last night.""

""Oh yeah? Where was this at?""

""At [queer function]. Which I was invited to. Cause Im queer.""

""Oh yeah? Huh.""

He's being infuriatingly nonchalant.

""I'm not gay though.""

""Okay.""

Is this dude serious? He's not batting an eyelash. Its like we're talking about our tax returns.

""Im actually transitioning from male to female"". 

""Yeah I kind of already knew.""

Dot.dot.dot.

So as it turns out BEFORE WE HAD EVEN PHYSICALLY MET he'd been showing people my boy mode facebook saying ""yeah this is the guitarist Im going to meet"" and someone there had recognized me and outed me. So from our very first meeting he'd known about Rose down to her name (he actually said ""I think you prefer Rose, right?"") and for a month and a half had not said a fucking thing and basically treated me like nothing was going on at all.

Nothings changed. If he was going to flake because of this I think he would have done so by now. He had ample opportunity to do so without me ever having to know why he was flaking on me. Im starting to get the impression that he's a pretty stand up guy.

Theres a lesson learned here though. My double life is unsustainable. Ill be out whether I like it or not pretty soon. Id prefer to have some semblance of control over my coming out so I think its getting close to time for me to have a talk with my human resources department at work. Ive got a therapy appt coming up in 2 weeks so what I think Ill do is wait and talk it over with my therapist then more or less plan to  be ""full time"" by the end of march... About 1.2 years sooner than Id originally planned.

So tell me your stories about being outed. Did it go as well as it did for me? Did it change how soon you went full time?"
MasterVizz,asktransgender,[NSFW] dysphoria during sex?!?,"I am a MTF woman, My partner is a cis female. It is uncomfortable having penetrating sex for her. I tend to get dysphoria in the process of getting hard.

I enjoy taking in the ass and my partner is willing to give it to me in said ass. I am not afraid to go down on her. 

We are drawing a blank on any alternatives for sex. Does anyone have any ideas for us?

thank you :D"

anita_kumar,asktransgender,GID or what?,"I felt I was better female in my third grade ( a day may be), then tried some women clothes, things in 7 th grade during which I came aware of transgender from newspaper until I didn't even no computers. I continued crossdressing till. My 10 th grade (age16) then I again learned of crossdressers and thought of I be a trans came in again but strongly. Then now college somehow I am at extensive dysphoria like after learning HRT,GID etc.. so I went to a therapist My therapist doesn't know GID or never read DSM. He heard me and asked my sexual orientation whic I replied it as bisexual with a doubt. He didn't tell anything about me but after three sitting called my mom and spoke which made her cry but I don't know what he told. My mom then after a session told me ( forcibly asked her) that therapist said it's just the thought of trans infesting his mind and asked to stop letting such thoughts near me. He also said doing so will bring myself (male) normal. My dysphoria was oscillating always and never steady minded. Second therapst opinion is on its way but no surity of him being dsm knowledge. All I can hope is some help.my current therpist says to continue my studies and if I was trans my dysphoria will kick my fem side out. So till that don't think trans and do daily work.
For better infor: Dysphoria wasn't constant it kind of went and came back greater in years.
I was attracted to females for kind of period then to males. Masturbation was extensive and found useless after I did it. Life was hard to be seen but I enjoyed a lot Had love had friends (mostly male) . Crossdressing and much things aroused me. Physical appearance isn't masculine (except face). Indian and transphobic religious yogic:( parents. Really what is going on with me?

Yum4pi,asktransgender,Dealing with dysphoria,"So I'm a 15 year old AMAB girl, and I was wondering if you guys had any input on dealing with dysphoria pre transition. 

I have a snowballs chance in hell of transitioning before I'm 18, becuase my dad is ignorant at best and intolerant at worst, and my mom is so transphobic that she won't even let me own basic makeup (foundation, concealer, etc.) Ive been able to sneak a few things into the house, such as a razor to shave my legs, some makeup that I can only really wear in my bedroom, as well as a small amount of clothes that I either stole from my mom's closet out of desperation, or the few androgynous things I was able to buy without raising suspicion. but I was wondering if you guys had any input on easing my dysphoria to managable levels. Even with all the things I already do and my somewhat feminine body shape I still have almost unbearable dysphoria day in and day out. Im so afraid that T is gonna fuck up my body beyond repair by the time I'm 18 and can start hrt that sometimes I don't feel like I can continue living. Also, not being able to present as my true self outside the confines of my bedroom doesn't help. What would you guys suggest as far as bringing things back down to an ok level?"
nadia_belle,asktransgender,What to say to Dr's to be put on HRT?,"Posted on transtimelines too but hopefully someone in a similar boat to is on here. 

I have my endocrinologist appointment next week and have read horror stories of people being denied HRT by many dr's until they find one that will or until they've ""proven they are trans"". I don't want to get into a debate over what trans is, I would just like to know how others have managed to get started with as little hoop jumping as possible, ideally for the non binary/agender trans people on here like I mostly identify with.

I am very honest and am not going to lie to try and get on them. The thing is, I refuse to subject myself to public ridicule or violence by going out in public en femme, which would likely get me killed. Having dysphoria about your body has nothing to do with clothing in my eyes. If you have the body shape to rock certain items of clothing then go for it, but I don't at the moment, and feel like a tomboy anyway. 

If anyone here has had experience with dr's in Australia or New Zealand and can part some advice that would be ideal. 

Thanks in advance, I hope you all are having an amazing journey!   "
lrki,asktransgender,Vagina prosthetics (yes this topic again),"Looking for info on what is available and specifically trustable reviews. I have found a handful of products in the direction but some seem questionable on material, or don't seem to have the right features. Others just not sure if they'de be any good haha.

Preferable features: Penetrate-able, I do like the idea of using the glans as sort of a ""clitoris""

I think the only two products fulfilling these points I found were ""Cherry Popper"" and CastleSupply's stuff.
But could not find any actual review for either. There was just someone saying CastleSupply's is uncomfortable and all, but then some counter-argument on how that was the old ones and the new ones may be better or the like."
TheGiratina,asktransgender,Should I come out at Wal*Mart?,"EDIT: My concerns are mostly that of what effects it would have on my social and direct management outloons. I'm concerned that coworkers will be verbally and, terrifyingly, physically transphobic, where management and supervisors will be harder on me and slash my hours under the guise of ""she isn't a good worker"".

I'm sick of being misgendered. I hate it more than anything, I hate the ""sirs"" and the ""(dead names)"" and the ""mans"". They seem to get worse everyday.

Big opportunity. I'm moving to northern South Carolina, thus transferring to another Wal*Mart, as well as hopefully starting the graveyard shit, although I am a truck unloader now.

Should I use this chance to try and come out as a transgender woman? I can't pass,  my facial hair, Adam's apple, and auto-pilot voice give me away too easily. But I'd honestly rather be regarded as a freak than just ""another guy in the back room"". Anything but ""a guy"".

What scares me is loss of hours, thus money. As of late I'm unsure of how much I'm gonna spend regarding towards my transition, but I know it's over forty-thousand dollars, although a big chuck of that won't be until GRS can offer at least a semi-functional uterus and set of ovaries, which I'm giving, at most, another two decades. I could be wrong, but I gotta have some hope. Regardless, I'm worried about losing hours and much-needed money, as well as social rejection, mockery, fear of assualt, and fear of risking hurting people associated with me.

I'm just unsure what to do. Should I bunker down and hold out until I can pass, or..?"
mogul26,asktransgender,I have a big fear about transitioning.,"I feel like this is a shallow fear I have, and that it isn't really a valid one, but I am going to divulge it anyways, because I am scared to death that I won't be passable. Is this a normal concern? I know this must be a common question, but every-time I see really successful transitions I just get hot flashes, and can't help but get really depressed. ""What if I don't turn out that pretty"" seems to be a very common re-occurring question in my head. I know it isn't the underlying key to my happiness, but it is a big fear, and it really hits my dysphoria hard.

Can any provide me some comfort, or re-assure me that I will turn out at least semi-passable based on my pictures. People tell me I am currently very feminine, but my brain keeps shutting it out, they must just be saying to be nice.

Anyways here is me:

AbbyWest,asktransgender,Con crash and how to deal with losing a safe space.,"So I spent the weekend at an amazing convention. MBLGTACC is the Midwestern Bisexual Lesbain Gay Trans Ally College Conference. 

During this weekend, I met so many amazing people, hopefully friends I'll have for years to come. I've never found myself surrounded by so many trans people who I could tell anything to, and they would be able to commiserate. Its a feeling I can't begin to describe.

I truly learned what it meant to feel safe. To the point where I was in a rush to make it to a panel, so I went into a gender neutral bathroom and used a urinal, men and women coming and going as I did. This is something I haven't done in over two years.

I had a guy tell me that he learned what it meant to finally feel safe. You can get used to using a public restroom in the real world, and you think that you're feeling safe. But then you find yourself surrounded by trans people in a place like this and you realize you were just getting used to being on edge, and that it never was a truly ""safe"" feeling.

I got back this afternoon, and already I'm feeling.... not depressed... not just lonely.... just crashed. Its not a good feeling.

How do you deal with losing a safe space like this? Of realizing what its like to walk around and be seen as.... normal... by everyone around you? Eventually I'll probably go back to that illusion of feeling safe, but I don't want to, and the time it takes to get there won't be smooth either I'm guessing. Anyone have any thoughts?"
Throwaway-1902,asktransgender,"Flying home from GRS - did you seek ""medical approval"" from airline? Did you use a wheelchair service?","GRS coming up pretty soon.  Yikes!  The airline has let me book a wheelchair for the return trip, but they normally want ""medical approval"" forms filled out by doctors for any surgery within a certain time window before flying.

Did any of you post-op folk fill out these forms, or did you just get on the plane and tell them to mind their own business?  

I hate to do that, because I don't want them to see me in a wheelchair and then refuse boarding because I haven't been medically approved.  I get that it's really none of their business (although technically it is their business - they're not obligated to fly anyone who has had surgery recently), but the fact that I need the wheelchair only on the return journey is a giant red flag that I've actually had surgery.

Thoughts on this?"

KKae,asktransgender,Dating with age concerns and worries,"So I have been talking to guys on dating sites for a few months good, bad, straight, CIS, chasers or just plain weird. My sexuality it’s pretty vanilla no 'strange' kinks to be honest.

One thing I have noticed though is my desire for younger rather than older men. I just turned 40 (My range is typically 28 to 38.) 

Quite honestly the thought of being with an older guy feels wrong. I feel like a teenager at times I look half my age and I feel I have so much to catch up on.   So much I want to experience and explore.

I want someone to do all that with, not a guy who has all the answers and has been there and done everything.  I'm pretty sure this is the HRT and second puberty causing this. 

Does anyone else feel like this? What your preference? more. Has it changed since starting HRT?
"
FraffoP,asktransgender,I feel like my therapist doesn't understand me... (rant),"I'm so angry and depressed right now. I've been in therapy for about 2 years and half due to different things, and just at the beginning of December I felt relaxed to talk about my gender identity doubts. Actually, around April of last year I told him that I like to crossdress, and I quickly labeled it as a ""fetish"" because I was too scared to explore more.
He isn't specialized in gender identity issues, but has a lot of specializations and he kind of helped me a lot in the past, but... I don't know, it's like he doesn't understand me at all about it.
We see each other two times a week, and at end of every damn session I get the ""we're exploring, we don't need to hurry"" thing that is starting to get on my nerves.

Everytime I'm about to enter the door of his studio I'm so confident, just to get out of there with my confidence destroyed. Of course I don't want to hear I'm trans/whatever or not, but... I just want a bit of support...
Sure, we are exploring... meanwhile, after 20 sessions since I brought up the argument and 675€ spent, I still feel like we're going nowhere. Then I read people that get diagnosed with gender dysphoria in a couple of sessions, or others that get their HRT letter after three... and I get so depressed. I feel like crying right now, but my tears just won't come down.

Maybe it's just me, but while he doesn't discard the possibilities that I'm trans, every thoughts he express seem to be leaning more to things like ""it's okay to feel feminine for a boy"", ""boys can be sensitive too"", etc. Is it okay to feel like a feminine guy? Of course it is, is just that I don't feel like that, nor I don't want to feel like that! I just feel I'm a woman and that's it, jeez... I feel like this ""we don't need to hurry"" thing is kind of a trial. Like I have to prove to him that I genuinely feel like this, that I'm suffering or something. A month ago, I told him this, and he replied with ""No, you don't have to prove anything, maybe you're feeling like you have to prove something to yourself"". Yeah, sure, because the suffering I feel doesn't matter.

I was also a bit concerned when I had to explain to him what transgender/genderqueer/genderfluid/and the other various etiquettes meant. At the beginning, he also come out with homosexual arguments, which made me think about the whole Blanchard ""autogynephilia"" thing (which he... didn't knew, actually :o) and the fact of being a girl to stay with men, which I think is kind of bullshit. I explained to him that to me gender identity and sexual orientation were two different things, and if I were to fall in love with a man, I can go with him even as a male. I mean, I don't have to resemble a girl to stay with guys, lol. When I also told him the frequent psychological effects that hormone therapy have, he said something like ""but you don't need that to let out your emotions in a positive way, you're already in therapy"" with a smile... Yeah, because I don't want to get hormones to match my outside with how I feel inside, right?
Since December, I started to observe his reactions. I noticed he is a bit skeptical whenever the ""I feel attracted to girls, but I also would love to have their body/shape"" come out. Like I can't be trans AND lesbian? What... 

In the past days, I've also wrote a letter to my parents (8 pages!). I still have to give it to them, because yesterday I had the wonderful idea to get a suggestion from him, and he told him to view it together first.
So today I brought it along, I have read it until page 4 (kind of), and he stopped me because time was running out and he felt like my letter truly deserved all the time it needed to be appreciated and because he wanted to know more of my motivations (really? After almost three months of talking about how I feel?). He complimented me, he felt like my letter was addressed to him to some extent (heh, at least he noticed), while also saying there's no hurry and we should be cautious. ""Absolutely."" I responded with calm, while inside me, my anger was growing.
How long do I still have to suffer? I feel like I wrote a beautiful letter to my parents... My mom already know that I have to talk to her about something really personal, and she said that whatever there is in that letter, she and my dad will always love me. But yeah, I do have to keep suffering because you know, otherwise I'm too hasty, after 20 sessions on talking about my feelings, and with my childhood/adolescence memories... And lot of money spent... While my body keeps getting masculine, my beard continues its development and so on.

Saturday is my birthday, I'm going to be 21... The idea of being referred as a son for another birthday really makes me feel depressed and uncomfortable... but hey, what can I do, I don't have to be hasty, maybe he's totally right...

Sorry, I just need to vent a bit, I'm really tired of this. "
continuityOfficer,asktransgender,"I came out to my mum, it went well... ish?","Out of suggestion of people here when I asked, i sent my mum an email telling her about it, and saying that since I need time to build up with this, that I want her to keep it to email for now.

So I sent the email, and the next day, I got a couple responses, I couldn't read them yet, I was scared, but planned to do it later at night, which is usually when I do this kind of stuff (only time I feel safe to, without people coming in).

But then she made me come shopping, and went out to get me some stuff (Female Pyjama's and some make-up mainly) despite me asking her to wait, then when she came home, she kept asking me to look at things with her, and I felt uncomfortable with the speed things where going at, I just felt like I needed the time to respond to those emails she replied with atleast first in my own time, when I can build up the courage to do those, but she would keep having me do things when I wasnt really ready for it (which also lead I think to me making some stupid decisions in the shops as I couldn't really say no to her or make my own decisions (i.e she said tight clothes would be fine, i knew they wouldnt be, because my body wont work with tight clothes :/))

I havent been able to get to those emails she sent me yet to answer the questions that I desperately want to answer so I can get things moving, but I feel like i've regressed back into a cacoon about everything.

I ended up sending her an email in my frustration, that in retrospect was more antagonistic then it needed to be, that stated that I was feeling annoyed and aggravated at how she ignored that part of my original email asking her to keep it to the emails and about how I need time after this kinda stuff to normalize. But now I think she might be aggravated at me. I mean, I haven't read the email, but due to how gmail shows you the start of the email, I do know it starts with 'what the hell, [name]?' (Its also notable that since I use RSS on my gmail, I know she added another message to this email thread later on), seemed annoyed the next time I went down stairs, and seemed to switch from the gender neutral way of referring to me that I mentioned me being comfortable with for now, to a male gendered way or referring to me (although, I may be being paranoid on that one)

I know she's being supportive, but she's going to fast and ignoring what I asked of her. I also find it just a little creepy or at least somehow insulting that my mum said (paraphrasing) that 'its good to have someone who wants to be a girl in the house, your sisters a tomboy [...]'. But I don't know... 

I'm scared, agitated, and frustrated. I want things to progress so that I can get on hormones and stuff as soon as I can because male puberty sucks, but at the same time, I feel like I can't again, and dont know what to do..."
PurpleHysteria,asktransgender,Really In Need Of Some Help,"This is a re post, I posted it here last week but no one saw it and it got lost from the feed but I still need advice. 

Hello, I'm looking for advice about coming out to family, and dealing with possibly losing people in your life. I'm 20, from Ireland, living at home with mum and brother cause I'm crazy poor. I do go to college presenting as female but not 100% of the time, mum thinks I'm just a cross-dresser, caught me at 15, she's cool with it, no one else in my family has any idea. I'm out to pretty much all my friends as Gender-queer, a word I thought suited me but I've come to learn it's more than just being okay with being in between genders or one gender then another. I've realized, I am a trans woman. And I'm so scared and sad all the time the way things are. I'm looking for advice about coming out to family and friends, not just parents, but also I've been thinking about like how aunts and uncles and grandparents would take it. Most wouldn't understand at all, and my grandparents wouldn't accept it, but I really don't want them out of my life. I am close with them. It makes me so scared to come out. Right now most people think I'm just a cross-dresser and even friends will refer to me as dude or man or sir, when I'm presenting as female even though they've been told about my gender identity. I have a girlfriend, she is more aware of me being a trans woman, and she's so supportive and wonderful, but says she just isn't attracted to me as a female, she's straight and that's fair, but it's an issue I feel, and I don't want to lose her or the two years we've had. Sorry this was so long, I look forward to hearing back. Here's a bun bun for making it through. &lt;3 http://tinyurl.com/c3w9mqj"
maybeatrans,asktransgender,Struggling again today,"So I posted on here a while ago, talked to my girlfriend about it, eventually I sort of came to the conclusion that I'm ""gender fluid"" rather than trans because I don't usually dislike being in my body. But you know, it comes and goes in phases. 

Last night I had a dream I was a woman. Or at least posing as one. This dream has reoccurred a few times. In this dream I've got beautiful long wavy hair and at some point I'm usually wearing a long gorgeous dress. It's never about what I'm doing in the dream, but rather the instant joy and excitement when I see myself in the mirror with long hair, beautiful makeup, and a gorgeous dress. 

Now I'm left with much less than that joy when I wake up and look at regular old me in the mirror. My hair is awful and nothing looks how I want it. I think of going back to sleep to find that feeling again. 

What's the matter with me guys? Why do I feel perfectly happy sometimes, and then why do I get so frustrated with myself?

I know no one can tell me what or who I am but these feelings are driving me insane. I'm becoming increasingly fearful that I am transgender. This scares me because I've built a beautiful life with my girlfriend whom I love of four years. I knew she loves me too but our relationship would not continue the way it is now if I transitioned, and I respect that. 

I just can't figure out what I really want. Do I want to be a full on woman? Do I want to be with my girlfriend I love? Do I want to risk either of those life styles for the other? Do I even really want to be a woman or am I fetishizing a fantasy? If I did transition what would I do about my job? What would my coworkers think? Should I tell my Mormon family or never talk to them again? Who would ever love me again?

Genderqueertrans,asktransgender,Do I have a reason to find myself offensed because a post-op trans woman misgendered me because I'm pre-op and have not had surgery yet?,"She says that she can't call a transsexual a she because she is a woman and I am still a transsexual . That's her explaination . I told her I was offensed and she was kind of surprised by it . Her response was that you can't call a car a limousine . 

She never even saw my cock so what can she decide based on that that she has the right to refer to me as "" he "" . I present as a woman in her presence and I'm on hormone replacement therapy . I met her a few months ago through a local LGBT . Never talked much with her until now . 
I kind of got furious when she called me he and I called her a miserable wreck who wants to destroy other people . 

Have I overreacted or have I had the right to do so? 
I just couldn't take the misgendering anymore . 
It's true that I'm only 2 months on hormones but that's not a reason to misgender me when I clearly present myself as a normal woman . I didn't misgender her and I'm not planning on doing so . That's kind of low . I think transition destroyed her the way she reacts ,...

Castagay,asktransgender,non-binary transition- help?,"Hey there. So I was on T for 4 months to cope with the voice and junk dysphoria and I've reach the end of that part of my transition.

gingerbread63,asktransgender,My friend came out as transgender (MtF) and then retracted it,"Disclaimer to say I don't know if I'm in the right place. I've browsed Reddit for years without making an account until now so I don't really know what I'm doing post-wise. 

Anyway, last year a friend of mine came out as trans (MtF). He scheduled an appointment with a gender therapist but before it came he started dating a guy who is not a good person. He makes constant negative comments about some of my friend's biggest insecurities, including his femininity. My friend's response, rather than to chuck his ass and live his life as his real self, has been to withdraw from us to spend time with him, grow a beard, stop styling his hair, wearing jewellery etc., and tell everybody that he made a mistake and he isn't trans. 

I can see in his eyes that he is really unhappy. I've tried talking to him but my concerns are brushed off and he changes the subject or turns it into a joke. I support him whatever he does; I just want him to be happy. I don't really know what I'm asking for here. I don't want to pressure him into leaving his boyfriend or admitting that he is trans, but I know this situation isn't good for him and I hate seeing him like this. I don't know what to do. "

StrikingDawn,asktransgender,No idea if what I am feeling is genuine,"Heya, first post on reddit; I've been lurking on this sub for a few weeks now and I feel like I'd benefit from a little outside opinion.

I'm 17, assigned male, in my junior year at an all boys high school. Over the past few months, I've been majorly questioning my gender. For weeks now, it’s been nearly 90% of everything going on in my head. I have become increasingly depressed and unmotivated to do anything, and my grades have all fallen into failing range. I’m scared because I feel like the realization that I might be trans are all so sudden and out of the blue; I never even really considered it as a possibility before, but it has just wrecked too much havoc in my life as of late for me to not take notice.

What i’m struggling with is that I’m not sure if any of these feelings are rooted in reality, or that i’ve somehow managed to convince myself that it's a problem when it really isn’t. I’ve always been overly sensitive and massively introverted, and while I can and have actively looked back for prior evidence of my potential condition, I still feel like I can’t know for sure. I’ve done some research as to the early symptoms of dysphoria and I feel like some match up and others don't; to be completely honest I don't think I really cared about my gender until I just started going through puberty. Starting in high school I felt that while everyone in my grade was working to become more masculine, all I wanted to do was become prettier and cuter. I’m unhappy whenever I look in the mirror, and I've just stopped looking at myself at all whenever possible. I hate all the hair on my arms, legs, and face; I hate that my voice isn't higher pitch; and I hate that my face is not “cute”. When thinking about the possibility of becoming a girl I always think that i’d go through with it and never look back.  

 I’ve never masturbated before, because the idea of doing so doesn't appeal to me and I’ve found that there isn't much that stimulates me in any way, but I originally thought that I had some sort of MtF fetish. I’d scour the internet for videos and pictures and fantasize about that kind of stuff happening to myself. I never formally crossdressed, mostly because I don't have access to anything I could potentially try on, but at night i’d often improvise and do things like stuff small pillows or socks down my shirt and pretend they were breasts, and then just kind of lay there for a while. I thought it was triggering some sort of sexual pleasure, but looking back on it now it seems like it just made me feel really happy and confident.

This past week I told my best friend how I was feeling, and he has been really supportive of me and has assisted me in dealing with some of my feelings. I also told my school counselor about how I feel, and she also is highly supportive and wants to refer me to a specialist ( I have never gone to any sort of therapist before in my life). I just really really really don’t want to be wrong about any of this, I hate the stress I feel on a day-to-day basis and I especially don't want to make the lives of my friends and family even more difficult for no reason.
There’s more to this than what i’m saying here, but it’s very difficult to go through what is essentially my life story in a single post. I know i’m basically just asking for confirmation of an expected answer that I just want to hear, but I also need to know if any of this is actually indicative of anything or if there’s even a slight possibility that I've convinced myself that I have a problem when I do not."
Lisafrankreynolds,asktransgender,Workouts that help flatten your chest?,"I only just got my requisite to see a Dr about getting top surgery, there is still a lot of waiting to even schedule a surgery date.

Coribelle,asktransgender,Need advice on mom,"I recently came out to my mom and stepdad (see last major post for context) and, to cut to the chase, she told me I could go to religious therapy or move out. Having a great counselor already and not wanting to go back to trying to repress my feelings, I chose to move out. That was Friday. On Saturday she sent a few texts to say how selfish I was being and that I apparently only care about my own happiness. Which kind of feels valid I guess. 

Then, yesterday, she sent a text that read ""I love you my boy. I always will. Your my one and only angel from heaven.""

Today I got ""I love you /u/Coribelle"" and a call from my real dad saying that I needed to call my mom. I guess she called him sobbing this morning. 

Here's the thing: I feel hurt. I opened up to my mom about the past decade and a half of suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety, and overall feeling of abandonment and she just didn't care. She didn't want my coming out letter. Even my dad, who I told earlier and who handled things a lot better initially, has told me that this is all in my head, that he doesn't support me, and that this ""isn't me"" but ""it's okay because you're still my boy and always will be"". Then he accused me of insulting and disrespecting their love. 

Look, I'm not mad at being misgendered. Sure, it hurts, but I understand how new this is to them. And I really do think they love the son they think they have. It's just hard for me to try to reconcile things when I know they still don't believe, accept, or support me. I don't know what there is to discuss until they come to terms with who I am. 

But it also breaks my heart to know they're going through pain because of this. 

I don't know, man. What do I do? Should I try to talk to my mom? 

No matter what I don't think I'll be going back to living with them. I've actually grown rather fond of the box spring I've been crashing on. I just need to know how to start repairing this relationship. If it's even worth repairing. "

TaraSFV,asktransgender,Changing Jobs,"So OK.  I currently am a Systems Admin for an adult entertainment company in CA.  Been doing this for about 15 years, I am 35.  I used to love IT, I used to geek out on building servers at home and all that fun stuff.  But over the last, IDK, 4 years I have lost all passion I had to do this job.  Infact im damn near the point where I hate computers all together (I know im posting this on the internet and the irony is not lost on me  LOL)

So, I started transitioning over a year ago, and still this job makes certain demands that I am just not comfortable in dealing with anymore.  Its one thing to fix computers, its a whole other thing when they expect me to run wires (Which I had NO experience doing prior to working here).

So long story short I want out of IT.  Period I am done, and to prove my dedication to being done I have dumped my windows machines, android phones and tablets and have moved everything over to Apple.  And you know I am 10x's more happy, I love my Idevices.  They makes everything just.... Better.

So I am wondering if any of you ladies or Gents have had any experience going from IT to Admin assistant or office admin.  I am looking for a nice mellow office job.  A job where I dont have to monitor emails 24 to make sure the server is still up.  A job where I am not constantly worried that something is going to break, crash, catch fire etc etc.  A job where my plans on Friday are not all the sudden cancled becuase the exchange server decided that was the day it needed to crash and burn.  What was the experience like gong from IT to something else?  did you have issues with being OVER Qualified for positions.  I have seen a few Admin assistant jobs (front desk) for IT companies, I was thinking maybe they would understand, and maybe I can hep with Light phone support etc.

Any input is appreciated.   "

askGEP,asktransgender,Need help - Seeking resources for helping with a Jewish funeral service of a struggling trans* teen,"Trigger Warning - Talk of suicide / loss / grief 

People of reddit, you are where we go when we find ourselves at a point where we don't have answers... we need your help. 

Recently, in a series of suicides in our community, we learned of a trans* teen who was in the process of coming out and had come out to their family and many friends as mtf / trans*, but were still wishing to be identified as male. Unfortunately, in their struggle in coming out, they ended their life far too soon. 

Our organization was contacted by the rabbi performing the service who stated that the family would like an inclusive and validating service that recognized their trans* identity while respecting their wishes to be recognized as male. 

Our knowledge of the Jewish religion is very limited at best, so if any of you have any ideas on best practices or ways you would suggest navigating this, we would truly appreciate it. 

And lastly, a huge thanks from everyone at the Gender Expansion Project for any input you can provide. "
mirin-chan,asktransgender,I'm suicidal again. I need help.,"After a suicide attempt that failed last year I was in mandated therapy. Things were OK for a while. I got transitioning on track. Life started to be OK. 

But now it's back. It's like my default state of being is wanting to kill myself. This is just what life is for me and I think I.  Ready to be done with it. 

I'm not gonna be who I want. I'm not gonna be the person I should have been. If I was born a cis woman like I was supposed to I would've been beautiful. But no I'm stuck in this androgenised prison. My family have rejected me. Half my friends abandoned me, the other half see me as a fetished freak. 

I'm not going to be happy. That notion came and went as fast as puberty. And hit me just as hard. I'll avoid mirrors for weeks at a time,  then I'll get back into my old habits of picking apart every disgusting thing about myself. I've compulsively picked my skin for the last dozen or so years so I'm covered in scars. 

I'm going to die soon. And I don't want to but I really feel it's for the best.  Just consumed. 

I dream about dying. And I wake up. Then I cry myself back to sleep because I remember I'm alive and exactly what that means. What kind of life is that? Why do I have to go through all this Bullshit and suffering,  only to go through more. 

I didn't know where to go with this. I'm sorry for posting here. You've just been so good to me in the past I feel like I owe it to you to tell you where I'm at. You don't need to worry,  because I'll tell you all when it's going to happen. And after I'll be free. I'm sorry again."
Jen-Ai,asktransgender,teeth stains due to sublingual E,"So I went to the dentist on Saturday. The hygenist asked if I used mouth wash (specifically listerine). I asked why?  She said finds people that use listerine end up with a blue-greenish stain over the years.  I said ""No i dont"".  She said, ""strange, you have a bluish staining. it's coming off though.""  
I then realized (because who keeps thinking about what they just did) that on the drive over I'd taking my little blue pills.  I wasn't expecting to go in so quickly.  Everything was dissolved as far as I was concerned. however having been taking E now for a bit past four months, I was surprised to hear it might be staining my teeth.

Master_Kush_117,asktransgender,Is there any way I can motivate myself?,"This is a long rant, but if you could read through it, i would greatly appreciate it.

Some background info: Im 18 MtF trans and I havent begun hrt or anything. I came out to my freinds and family around November last year. I really really want to start hrt, but i have no money, nor does my family.

Well for about the past hour or so I've just been reading posts on this subreddit. The more I read the more suicidal I've been feeling. I know that the whole process of transitioning is hard and long, and i have to be willing to put the time into it. But just being me- im forgetful, and its hard for me to keep doing something i started (like exercising everyday). I began doing simple exercises about a month ago, and ive done it almost everyday. I know that it's easier to lose weight before you start hrt, so i started. I try to keep it the same every night, but im not sure if im doing enough. I usually do 30 jumping jacks, 15 lunges per leg, 25- 30 crunches, 20 sit ups, 10 regular push ups(push ups are freakin difficult) and 10 girl push ups. My question is, is this enough? Should i try to do more? And what can i do to help motivate myself when im feeling lazy?

The other thing i guess thats on my mind is voice therapy. Ive read that basically the hardest part is keeping on it and doing it everyday. I havent started trying this yet, and im sure im just over thinking it, but what are ways i can motivate myself to keep doing it? (once ive started, of course.) And what would be some good tips for starting? Should i record my voice everytime, and if so what kind of recording apps could i use?( for android preferably)

As for money, i know i need a job. I want a job but i have really bad anxiety and i just havent looked for a job. Ive been trying to get enrolled at a technology college (its cheap and fafsa will most likely pay for most of it.) Does anyone have any tips on how to get past this stupid anxiety? And are there any jobs i could look for that will allow me to avoid people as much as possible? 

I know i have alot of questions. But all of this has led me to feel overwhelmed. Im really suicidal at this point, and i just dont know what to do. I want to commit suicide because i feel like i just need to start my life over. And believing somewhat in reincarnation, i think that suicide would help me start over.( if reincarnation is real, i wouldnt remember my past life, but i still feel like i would be starting over)

Simply, i wish i was just born a girl. I feel like if i end it now, i can be reincarnated as a woman. The likelihood of this happening is very slim, and i know that. I just want to be myself. Anyway, this is a long rant, but i thank whoever will read this. And id appreciate any insight. Thank you for your time."
Morrigan_Cain,asktransgender,For the MTFs out there... how did you find female friends to hang out with? Especially if you grew up doing typically male things,"I am not full or even part time yet, and most of my hobbies and interests don't have a lot of women involved (competitive video games, electronic music production, I work in IT, etc etc).  However, I've noticed that lately I always feel crummy and dysphoric when hanging out with my guy friends, and so feel much more drawn to hang out with the lady friends I have.  Unfortunately, like I said, I don't have a lot in common with them, and I'm not really on the same schedule as them.  

I'm open to looking into new hobbies, but I don't even know where to begin.  For what it's worth I live in Pittsburgh and I work 11:30AM-8:30PM weekdays."
SolidSpruceTop,asktransgender,It's so nice to have supportive friends,"Today I asked a friend I've been getting closer to how she feels about me transitioning. I've brought it up before and such, and she seemed ok, but I still have anxiety about it. Basically she just made my day &lt;3

Cmon
You've already transitioned, at least partly
In your head
I don't care much about male female thing
Actually when I think about that, we're more like girlfriends than boy/girl friendship
Me: eee really?
Her: A hahaha
Me: hahah
Her: Well
I'm sure there is friendship and with most guys I just can't speak that open as to you
Me.: oooo interesting
I'm horrible at being open with most guys too.. -_-
Her: So did you realise how stupid that question was?
Me: Sorryyyy I just worry about stuff like this...
Her: Cos you know
That I DON'T FUCKING CARE
Me: lolol
Thank yoouuuuu

I also ate some peanuts last night. Should I call my doctor?"
Bzttid,asktransgender,"I'm completely lost, help?","Hey everyone,

Fuck, where to start. As I begin to write this I honestly feel panic. Back when I was just coming into puberty I had this massive fascination with feminine sexuality and the science behind transitioning. I was super curious on how it worked and thought about doing it a lot, which sort of took me down a path of bisexuality and confusion. As I got older I found that the only person I fit in with really were the alternative crowd which was mostly girls. I loved hanging out with them and having that type of friendship. I really just felt like I fit in with them. The first person I ever really dated was a dude. He was crazy, we only dated for a week, at one point we were making out and his pants came off. He asked me to suck his dick, it wasn't hard, and nerves just got to me - I just felt weird and awkward so I said ""ehhh"" and sort of deflected.. Maybe it was the fact that I come from an extremely religious and anti-gay household, I don't know. This point was probably the peak of me questioning my sexuality/who I am gender wise until I stuffed it waaaay down after coming *so* close to being outed (word was going round that I was dating a dude) and I broke up with the dude. 

After that I started dating a bunch of girls, and having girl best friends. I moved areas and made a new group of friends, which were all girls and a gay dude. I dated girls there and that was great, but I always had eyes for one girl back home. She was a good medium - she was like me and liked to play video games and was also really into that whole alternative scene. I really liked how awkward she was too, and I realized now that I think I liked how unsure she was of herself, because I'm really unsure of myself. We became really solid friends and talked all the time. At this point I had suppressed all my feelings into oblivion and when doubts about my sexuality or who I was internally I would shut them out quick. 

I ended up dating that girl. We dated for a while, I moved back to where she was, and everything was great for about three years. Then those feelings began to come out when I discovered the idea of pegging. We tried it and I loved it. That was maybe three years ago. We didn't do it much because she used to be super awkward about her sexuality and she just didn't seem to be super into it at the time, but at that point it just slightly broke down some of that repression in me. Because of what happened I started having anxiety over my sexuality and if anything came up talking about sexuality between me and anyone I got super nervous and awkward. 


Fast forward two years (for a dating total of five years) and I married this girl. We've been married for almost a year and a half. Somewhere in the past three months though something broke the repression, and its all coming back. Writing this next bit out gives me extreme anxiety, but I really want to be her wife. I want to take care of her, I want to be.. beautiful and soft for her, I guess. I want to be cute. Here's my problem: I'm pretty manly. I'm hairy as hell, I'm tall, I've got a receding hairline, and a low fucking voice. Every time I look in the mirror I feel gross. I hate my exterior. I don't like being manly, its frustrating. So I just can't be that way, I can't even start being the way the I want to be. 

Anyway, back to the timeline: I told my wife when we were drunk on our anniversary (which was a few months ago) that sometimes I kinda want to feel girly, but I really kept it light and didn't say I identified completely as a girl or anything, I just tried to spin it like a fetish thing just to test the waters. She was SUPER accepting, and said that she would love me and be with me no matter what and really doesn't like gender roles and categorizing people at birth and I felt relieved. In the following weeks we played around with the idea (and hopefully this isn't too explicit, I don't know what the rules of this sub are so let me know if this isn't cool) and we started testing the waters in the bedroom. She would wear a strap-on and I would suck it. It was fun, it felt right being able to let go, and although I enjoyed it sexually I felt really content in my own head with who I was at that moment. After that I started lurking this sub on my not throwaway and I started learning a lot and realising that I might be.. maybe trans? 

We got drunk a month ago and she started saying how when she masturbates she thinks about what itd be like to have a dick and how it would feel for me to suck it. I really identify with that feeling of unsureness, and it got me thinking about just opening up entirely. So, last night I do. I tell her like 80%: that I feel like a 60/40 of girl and guy, and that being a girl seems great. I told her I wanted to be treated like a girl, and she asked me what that meant and she listed a few examples like getting ready together, or picking outfits together, or whatever and I just said ""I have no idea"" because while that sounds appealing I really kinda just want to... I don't know, be a girl and be treated like one. We tested that out for the rest of the night and it was nice - we just kinda swapped the way we treat each other and our roles to each other in the relationship. It felt really nice and I just felt content. I woke up this morning and browsed transtimelines for two hours and felt unbridled jealousy and large amounts of anxiety, and that's where I am now.

Anyway, sorry for the rant. There's just so much built up over time I really don't even know how to lay it all out. But, to the questions: 

what the hell am I? I want to be a girl, but I like girls, but I like dicks, but I don't really find dudes super attractive, but then again I don't really like girls for their bodies as much as their personalities. I mean, I like boobs and vaginas, but I could say I'd like a dick just as much. And how could I have gender dysphoria but like girls? Could I be a lesbian girl? Uhg. 

How can I ever be a woman, even to my wife? I'm tall and manly, with tons of hair on my body, a receding hairline, and a super strong jaw, and a quick growing beard. I'm grossed out by it, but thered just be so much work I feel like I could never get there even just if I'm only going girl-mode solely in my own house.

I feel like I could never transition. You all are so much stronger than me. Deep down I want to, but I don't deal well with people judging me. I don't think I would make a good woman. As much as I tried to look the part I feel like I'd be ugly, and that I'd never sound girly because of my voice. I look through the trans timelines and I'm jealous, it sucks.

Lastly, how do I get over my fear of myself? My over religious household and my anti-gay parents made me massively anxious about confronting my own feelings. Like.. I want to shave my legs just to try it but holy shit the fear and anxiety is so overwhelming I can't even bring myself to do it. 

Bleh. This was long and painful. I hope you all could provide some insight and comfort, because this sucks. Sorry if this is super long and all over the place. Thanks for taking the time to read my whole story."

Everyday I feel more and more uncomfortable living as a man to the point where I can't even go out except for class, because I am too afraid of people perceiving me as the wrong gender. It's also extremely uncomfortable as a woman living close quarters with a man that I barely know, but we just don't have the money for me to live in a single room. Our insurance is complete shit and won't cover any of the costs of transitioning. My mom tells me I shouldn't feel as depressed knowing that my family is in my corner but that doesn't fix what testosterone has done to me. I don't want to continue for four more years in this uncomfortable body and have my youth pass me by, but I also don't want to throw away my education. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel, because at this point I don't fucking believe that there is."

Things were much worse, but now they're looking up, as I turn 18 in a little more than 10 months and have living arr. Regardless, my mental state is really fucked up. School has given me a bad case of junioritis, my family is getting at me more than ever, and the wait just seems so close but so far away at the same time.

myusernamesistaken,asktransgender,Choosing a dress for a MtF bridesmaid?,"Personally, I am not transgendered but I'm looking for some advice on how to tactfully handle some questions without overstepping boundaries.

Long story short: Our friend began HRT last April to transition male to female. She originally had a very masculine physique (including very broad shoulders and pronounced male-pattern balding) which has slowly been softening to be more feminine since beginning therapy, but bone structure is not going to change. And, due to finances, no surgeries will be taking place any time soon either.

I'm going to be getting engaged at the end of summer and I would love to ask her to be a bridesmaid, but I have no idea how to go about picking an... appropriate(?) bridesmaid dress. I'm not too concerned about the appearance aspect (i.e. she is already presenting female quite convincingly and I know with another year or two of HRT, even more so) but how do I pick something that will be physically comfortable with broader shoulders and (will still most likely be) developing breast tissue? I'm guessing strapless won't work very well nor plunging backs, but I also don't want to make any assumptions. Advice?"
An_Android,asktransgender,"Spinal Implants, Estrogen, and Atrophy","A while back, I had spinal surgery, where they implanted segmented metal rods to keep my scholiosis from progressing. This procedure not only got rid of it entirely, but also made me grow 3 inches.

On another thread, I read that people can lose a few inches of height from the atrophy that comes with estrogen.
This got me thinking... Does atrophy cause pain where implants had previously been placed?

I realize that this is more of a question to be asking a medical professional, but due to other issues reguarding family, economics, a lack of a driver's license, and a housefire, I'm probably not going to be able to speak to any sort of specialist about this for another year, depending on how these issues unfold.

stormyab,asktransgender,Your experiences with outing,"Hey everybody, this might be somewhat of a strange and personal request, but I was wondering if some of you lovely people would be kind enough to share your experiences with being outed as trans (or gay or queer or anything of the sort) against your will. 

Recently I was outed as trans and gay by someone at my school who I only know of through mutual acquaintances and classes, and who doesn't go to my school's GSA meetings (the only place I'm openly out). This means that either one of my close friends gossiped and it spread (I doubt it, they've known for years) or someone at GSA blabbed. In response to this, I've been greenlit to give a presentation about how dangerous and shitty outing people can be to our GSA in a week or so. 

Luckily,  in my case one of those who was told let me know and I've been able to do some damage control. To discourage something like this happening again, I'm trying to be very blunt and serious about the potential repercussions of outing people. Because I'm on mobile and queer issues are banned at my house, research has been difficult. Any experiences or statistics regarding being outed would be very appreciated.  

I don't know how to word this, so I'll be blunt: if your story is particularly painful or tragic, it'll work the best for scaring potential outers out of harming anybody else. It could be cathartic to share it knowing it'll to towards preventing other incidents like yours.

And i have even started living full time as a woman, but, i am petrified to go ahead and medically transition because i am one of the most indecisive people you will ever meet/talk too. And my biggest fear is that i feel great for about 2 or 3 years on hormones and get surgery (that i feel i need) or even longer and then wake up one day and go 'what the f*ck have i just done'?! I mean, i am fully aware i can go on hormones and come off them if i feel the need too, but i am just not happy doing that, NO WAY!!!!!!


Not that this matters but i will tell you all anyway, i am not dysohoric at all. Well, at least not consiously (maybe indirect dysohoria? I have heard that is a thing!! I am ALOT more gender euohoric!!!). I know this is NOT a 'requirement' to be trans as there are NO 'requirements' to be transgender necessarily! I am just struggling with fear.

However in time I wanted to change my name legally to Alice and thought Ali would be a good first step.

kaoruneve,asktransgender,"Sexual arousal and crossdressing: if you had it, can you tell me your experiences?","One of the things happening to me right now is that the days I feel like *""I should dress up""* (I'm explicitly avoiding the formulations *""feeling a woman""* and *""crossdress""*) I can't tell much apart how much I want do to that because I feel like that, and how much I do that for sexual arousal.

Right now I feel for me it's more the former rather the latter because I can spend comfortably full days dressed up, while I get aroused only if I explicitly look at me in a mirror in certain ways, or the exact moment when I change. And the rest of the time I just *""feel good""*. So... some correlation, but slightly tipped in one direction it seems at least for now.

However, helped me a lot in the past months reading here about how, some of the people that transitioned, to some extent passed through the same initial confusion between crossdressing and arousal. It was a small ""a-ha"" moment for me.

But since after months I'm still in that stage, I'd like to see if anyone would like to share a bit more about their own experiences. I'm explicitly interested in people that were aroused and ""overcome"" it *before* HRT (because I'm still not sure about it), but not exclusively: I feel that reading any experience would help.

Thanks in advance. :)

(Also, I'd like to read about both FTM and MTF experiences, not just one. Variety of experiences would be valuable for me)."
r_cohen,asktransgender,Saving body or facial hair for transplant possibilities?,"If one is looking into removal of (say) chest and facial hair, but has some scalp hair loss and might be in the market for a hair transplant down the road, is there a reason to be concerned about conserving hair donor sites outside the scalp?

But first, two questions... You don't have to answer either of these, but I would be grateful if you did.

I'm under care by an informed consent clinic. WPATH states I need two letters from licensed therapists recommending surgery. Is there an easy way to get those letters, or bypass it entirely? Do I really have to waste time having sessions with a therapist(s)? If it matters at all, I'm very likely going to choose Chettawut in Thailand.

And...

How did you pay for your surgery? I'm currently planning on taking out a loan for mine, since, I'm impatient, and there's no way in hell I'll be able to save around $10,000 with the responsibilities I have, or am about to have (preparing to move to WA...) My insurance states that I can be reimbursed for out of country procedures, but I'll have to pay up front with my own money, and I'll have to send in a claim for reimbursement. It'll also be covered at in-network level. I think it only covers 80% of the cost, however. Should I reconsider that loan? I'm afraid I might regret it financially if something goes wrong and my claim won't go through.

Hopefully, if I'm lucky, after I've made my move to Washington, I'll have everything set for this year. The sooner I get this over with, the better. I can't handle this dysphoria anymore...

remimi,asktransgender,Does anyone know about altering your own clothes to fit your trans body?,"So. I’m having one hell of a time finding men’s clothes that fit me. I can deal with wearing oversized shirts, but it’s not the most flattering thing in the world.

lunchboxer,asktransgender,Tomorrow or never. When to give up on self-imposed deadlines?,"It's that time of the year again. A new semester starts tomorrow at my school and I'm unprepared for it's emotionally taxing challenges. 

Once again, I'll be forced to wear my fake male persona and muddle about in the real world where to everyone I'm a youngish, cisgender heterosexual male. And the weight comes tumbling back. And for yet another three months nothing changes. In my safe spaces: support groups, with friends, and at home, I'll be a girl. To the *real* world I'm deadname: the liar. 

And it's killing me inside.

It shouldn't mean this much to be acknowledged by strangers, but it does. I keep telling myself it's not lying, it's for my protection, but I'm a poor listener. After all, it's really no one's business who I am right? I'm passable in every area that matters to me except my voice. I only have a small window to work on it due to my volume. So, if I do present as female everyone will know I'm trans. 

Without a female voice, it's hard for me to not think of myself as fraud. That I am still lying, even with my voice because it's the voice of someone I'm not. It's so frustrating. I just want be me and I feel like doing so will open me up to harassment because:

* I haven't changed my name. (money)
* I haven't changed my gender. (also money)
* I haven't changed my gender marker. (money, money, money!)

I live in one of the most progressive areas in California, but since I go to a technical school a lot of the attending are blue-collared types who may or may not take issue with me. Is it worth ending one stressful situation if I'm just going open myself up to another? Especially when:

* I suffer from severe ADHD. (medicated)
* I suffer from GAD. (not medicated)
* I am fucking depressed. (seeing therapist)

I want to attend class as myself, I really do. But when I wake up in the morning and I'm eyeing my skirt, I'm going to be thinking about of the shit that might rain down on me. That I'll throw yet another barrier up to my social transition and settle for a baggy jacket and jeans that I don't identify with anymore.

So, should I give up? Am I making a big deal about nothing? Should I even care if people know I'm trans? Does being a girl mean I hop from one closet to another? 

**TL;DR I want to attend college in a skirt. But I'm scared as balls I'll be bullied or harassed while at school... and while peeing.**

BhiQ,asktransgender,FtMs - your thoughts on the male gender role/sexuality?,"Hey guys, I'll try to be as respectful as I can with this but feel free to tell me if I cross any boundaries. If so it's not intentional, I am here to learn, not to offend. 

To put the core of this question into perspective: I am a cis-gendered male. I like who I am as a person although I am unhappy with my gender, due to being bad at filling the correlating gender roles: I always wanted a type of egalitarian relationship but being a cis-sexual, heterosexual male seems to require the male to fill certain roles (aggressor, leader) and have certain personality traits (confidence, being outgoing). I do not have these traits so I regularily get friendzoned (they do see me as an actual friend though, they do want me around, they are just not attracted sexually). 

I read [this](https://www.geneseo.edu/webfm_send/3244) article some time ago and have since appreciated the perspective of trans-people. I've only heard from MtFs though, which means while they do have some experience being a male they have ultimately decided to give up on attempting to be a male and their desired gender is female. They have never had to become ""a man"". 

Now I would like to hear the opposite perspective: FtMs, how are you coping with the things that society expects of ""a man""? Certainly you have the added disadvantage of being trans (some people will be turned off by that but I doubt I need to tell that to anyone here) but are you guys trying to fill the male gender role? If not, do you still manage to be successful, sexually, with cis-gendered heterosexual women? Julia Serano mentions the alternative/queer/trans circles she socializes in, I guess it will be the same for many of you? I'm certainly biased by my own perspective  (which is why I'm coming here, to get a different one) but I'm fairly convinced that if you do not learn how to ""be a man"" as a teenager you will have horrible problems as an adult male.

Genderqueertrans,asktransgender,Can your dysphoria switch from one type to the other day by day ? For example from more social dysphoria to more physical dysphoria and vice versa ?,"I feel like this is my case .  Initially I thought only having physical dysphoria but now I also have social dysphoria I discovered . The stupid thing is that some days I have both but I can't exactly point which uncomfortable element in my daily life belongs to which type of dysphoria . 
It's basically like there is always something DYSPHORIC but some days I have more social and some days more physical dysphoria . 

Today for example I am comfortable with my body and face mostly but my social dysphoria is major . I hate everything refering to me as a former guy today . But still I fucking hate being comfortable with my physical appearence today . That's gender dysphoria in general , this last thing . Even though I'm comfortable with my body today I feel stress about my physical appearence so I also have physical dysphoria today .

izalex,asktransgender,Stupidly talked to a TERF and now I'm terrified that I'm delusional. Please tell me I'm not crazy?,"I had the bright idea of trying to reason with a TERF/radfem last night. I'm an FTM teenager, and her ideology was essentially that FTM people are usually butch women or lesbians who decided to transition because they didn't fully grasp that women could be unfeminine, or they wanted to forsake the label of ""female"" because it was unappealing to them. She said that dysphoria was a result of internalized misogyny and trans ideology. She also said that most people who transition, 10-15 years later, regret it and detransition.

I spent pretty much all night obsessively going through TERF theory, and now I'm just scared that the only thing that's made me feel like a *person* in the past year (socially transitioning) is a result of internalized misogyny.

Can someone please help me? Can someone who's been transitioning for a long time and doesn't regret it please tell me that it's not going to be ""the worst decision of my life?"" Or give me some good anti-TERF arguments? I feel delusional.

deliberately_stupid,asktransgender,How to pass it forward/be a role model(?) to someone who is looking to me for help?," Not too long ago, I met a very sweet and adorable person who really hasn't had any physical contact with anyone who happens to be MtF of her age group. I don't wanna give anything too specific, obviously, but she isn't a minor. She (female pronouns are okay in private, for now) confided in me that shit's been rough, quite frankly, and that she feels alone. She needs a friend and I wanna be there for her. Now, I *think* I know what to say as far as guidance goes: medical procedures, HRT, fashion, support groups, etc etc., but... I really wanna get this right and pay forward what so many of you both online and off have provided to me over the years. 

Even though I have already transitioned, I'm obviously by no means a guru on all things Trans*. If I may call on you guys again, I could really use some help on how to do right by her as it's my first time ever being in a position to help another Trans person.

WhirlwindThoughts,asktransgender,How long did your 'post-self-acceptance' relief last?,"I feel that now that I have accepted that I am trans, I am getting a tremendous amount of happiness from the mere possibility of a full transition. Currently, I'm kind of half-assed part time in that I crossdress at home, wear very mild makeup in public, and very occasionally go out in girl-mode in public. That said, I'm not out to anybody other than my girlfriend and therapist, am not on HRT, and only go by my girl name online). If I ever do the thought experiment along the lines of ""you have to get rid of all your girl stuff and full transition is no longer possible and will never be possible again"" I am often saddened and feel very down. Additionally, I have kind of 'mentally transitioned' (for lack of a better term), mainly in that I almost always think of myself as a woman and occasionally automatically respond to my girl name (which is thankfully extremely similar to my guy name so it can be chalked up to mishearing something if I do it in public). I even almost suggested that a female friend and I have a 'girls night out' which would have been very embarrassing given that I'm not out to anyone but my girlfriend and therapist.

It seems that coming to this acceptance and mentally transitioning frequently provides a substantial amount of relief to many trans individuals. How long this relief typically last? I'm sure it varies person-by-person, but I'm just curious to see what kind of range we're talking about. Ultimately, I feel that I am very clearly trans but doing ok dysphoria-wise, despite not being on HRT or socially transitioning (beyond the occasional trip to the mall by myself in girl-mode). I do want a female body but am oddly tolerant of my male body at this point, likely because I keep focusing in on the few feminine traits it does have (mainly manboobs, femish cheeks, plucked/shaped eyebrows, longish nails, and I'm growing my hair longer). I know that I'm probably doing so well because I'm in a way already starting to transition, but it kind of feels weird to think about making an earnest attempt to schedule laser, bank sperm, start HRT appointments, etc. when I'm doing pretty well already. Are there any tips on what to do at this juncture? Is this semi-transition going to sustain me forever, or will dysphoria come roaring back in a few years at which point a medical transition will be more difficult? Again, I'm sure everyone is different, so I'm just looking for the vague range of what other transpeople have experienced.

Thanks!"
ultravegan,asktransgender,So my high school bully and constant tormentor just messaged me on tinder... What shouldIi do?,"In my freshman/sophomore year of highschool I was a pretty heavy drug user (for a 15 year old) and that is how I met this person. He used to steal money electronics and drugs from me daily, not like sneakily take it out of my bag, he would take it straight out of my pockets and dare me to do anything. One time I tried to fight back and he punched me so hard that he broke 3 of my teeth. Long story short I get arrested at the end of my sophomore year and sent to an inpatient rehab, and haven't heard from him since now. I am 100% sure he has no idea who I am (new first/last name, new gender, 7 years older) how should I proceed? Block him? Fuck with him? Try to get an apology?"

I know that in itself wouldn't qualify me as being trans.  I also have been questioning since I was ~9 or 10, I've prayed to god, I've prayed to Satan...  I wished on my birthday.  If only it were that easy...

But at the same time I cant picture myself presenting as female especially with my current form.  I would love to have the right body, but I feel like that is something I can never have.

I guess the main question I should ask myself is, if I couldn't ever transition, would I be happy?  And I honestly don't know the answer to that.  Things have been somewhat ok, but there is definitely room for improvement in my life.

eabrmposr,asktransgender,Crying a lot lately,"I'm MTF and I've been on HRT for 9 or 10 weeks. I've heard that like the 2nd / 3rd / 4th month of HRT can be the hardest for MTF folks. I've definitely been feeling fatigued and listless, and crying kind of a lot. Like I'm sitting here at work crying - I don't know why but I know I don't really want to be here.

MysticSheik,asktransgender,How to deal with gatekeeping?,"Hi, so this will be pretty long I guess. 
I'm on the journey to get on hormones, and I'm tired. Tired of all the gatekeeping in Norway. Five months ago I came out as transgender (MtF) and went to see a psychologist, so I could be referred to the national hospital in Norway. After 2 months I got referred, and today, after 3 more months it was finally time to actually go to the appointment.

I talked with more psychologists there, and I left feeling really depressed. During the talk there, they asked me about what toys I played with as a child, my sexual orientation, how I could know that I am a lesbian (I'm attracted to females and so I just know it was not a good enough answer it seems) and stressing the importance of RLE on me (at least 1 year of RLE is required to get on hormones they said). I felt more and more disheartened as it all went on, and the answers to all their questions got worse and worse, since I couldn't see how all those things could make them tell my own gender better than myself. I am female, and I am sure of this. I know what the consequences of hormones is, and I know that it will most likely reduce my gender dysphoria and lessen my depression as a result. That should be enough if you ask me. 

But no. They need 1 year to decide what gender I am. What kind of system is this? If it after 1 year turns out that they don't believe I'm female, they won't give me hormones and will just leave me in the hands of a psychologist and leave me with a gender disorder diagnosis as they call it.

I have no idea what to do at this point. DIY is not something I can do due to a customs ban when it comes to imported medicines.

I just want to be happy and live instead of being a depressed zombie which spends my time trying to survive as good as I can. 

My question is if there is any way I can effectively deal with all this gatekeeping?"
SenioritaKiwi,asktransgender,The Danish Girl (Possible Spoilers),"I made my girlfriend come with me this Sunday so we could see the movie in theatre. I never got to the point of ""cry my eyes out,"" but we both shed a tear for Lili &amp; Gerda's situation; It also happens to be the situation that we find ourselves in at the moment.

I can say that I knew nothing of Lili Elbe prior to watching the movie except that she was the first person to have a ""modern"" SRS. Without Spoiling anything, the ending took me completely by surprise, and honestly, it messed me up a little. : / I've been thinking about it entirely too much.

I kept expecting their love for one another to wein. I kept expecting to be sad for the falling out. Ultimately I'm left not upset, but completely depressed for a different reason entirely.

The last line hit me in particular. ""Gerda Continued ..."" It makes me realize just how much of an effect Lili had on her wife. Gerda was by Lili's side, and after all that self exploration, after all that fighting to accept her wife. There is an heir of Melancholy after all that; it makes me think ""is it worth it to put others through this hardship with me?""

Like, I understand that our own transitions are positive. We become happier people, more at home in our bodies. Anyone who stands by your side and fights hard to embrace you in your brightest form is clearly deserving of happiness themselves in the end. That's what I'm having so much trouble with.

TL;DR: I saw The Danish Girl. I loved it. Didn't expect the ending and it has left me in an introspective funk. Have you seen the movie? What did you think? I have yet to hear many opinions from trans people.

Finally got through my questioning stage and decided that, yes indeed, I'm a transman. Now what? I'm pre-everything and I have no idea what I'm doing.

Right now I have no job (because of not-trans-related things) and no insurance. The best I've managed to do for myself so far is get a binder, find a local support group (that I've only been able to go to twice because life reasons) and, by pure luck, found a doctor I can see for HRT (which I'm apparently not remotely close to yet).

Apparently the doc needs a note from a shrink before I can even see her and I need insurance and a name change at some point so... where exactly do I start?

* Am I supposed to go: Insurance &gt; Shrink &gt; Doctor &gt; HRT &gt; Surgery?
* Does medicaid in Arizona even cover HRT?
* Where do I find out what is and isn't covered?
* Where in this process should a name change happen?
* How do I find a shrink that won't give me a hard time?
* How long do I have to see them for?
* When does working out seriously need to happen? Also I have a bad shoulder so... upper body work how?
* Am I missing anything that's super obvious to everyone else?

Captain-Nemo,asktransgender,My response to finding out that gender identity wasn't mentioned in my colleges civil rights policy,"Mr. [School Civil Rights Coordinator]

Having reviewed the civil rights section in the academic affairs notice, I was troubled to see that it offers no protection to students based on their gender identity. The lgbt rights movement has increased quality of life for gay, lesbian, and bisexual people significantly in the past 10 years, but transgender rights have been sadly stagnant and members of this community still suffer a great deal of harassment and discrimination due to the socially stigmatized nature of transgender issues.

To give some context to the issue at hand, many transgender people (myself included) remain closeted for years, even after starting treatment or having corrective surgeries, due to their fear of the social ramifications that coming out as transgender can have. The simple inclusion of gender identity as a protected group in the academic affairs notice can mean all the difference to some transgender people, as it means that the school understands this fear, and offers protection from unjust prejudices from staff members whose knowledge of transgender issues may be inadequate.

I believe it is imperative that we as a school make it clear that discrimination against people due to their gender identity will not be tolerated, and as a member of the transgender community myself this issue is very personally important to me. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have for me, and would also be happy to direct you toward more academic sources of information on the transgender community and transgender issues in general. Thank you very much for your time, and please consider amending the academic affairs notice to properly reflect this colleges opinions on discrimination and harassment.

Respectfully,

protodro,asktransgender,Folks pursuing medical transition: when did you realise you needed to medically transition?,"I love reading about other trans people's epiphanies, and I want to share my own too.

In the middle of last year I finally realised I wasn't as cis as I thought. I had always been interested in gender non-conformity and reading about transition, but I didn't think it applied to me until I read a post by a newly hatched non-binary describing the feelings that led them to believe they were transgender. Partway through reading it, I realised that it was something I could have written myself, and suddenly I had the epiphany that I was trans.

To begin with I thought that I was agender. I thought about being female and I thought about being male, and neither appealed to me. I didn't want to be gendered anymore. I wanted to go back to my pre-pubescent body and be absolutely neutral.

I realised that this wasn't possible, so over the past several months I have been experimenting to see what could help alleviate my dysphoria, and find a way that I could find peace in my adult body. I chose a neutral name and asked people to use ""they"" with reference to me. I started trying to buy clothes from the men's section as well as the women's. I cut my hair short and started binding.

That was the turning point. I still read as female, but I no longer look so overwhelmingly feminine as I used to. If I'm binding and wearing a shirt, I look relatively androgynous from the waist up. So all of a sudden, it became possible to imagine myself in a number of ways, and other people have started to look at me in a number of ways as well.

A few days ago I put up a photo of myself after my haircut, and people told me I could pass as a guy, and compared my appearance to that of various famous men, and generally just referred to me in male gendered terms. And it feels really good. I thought I would be uncomfortable with people thinking I was a guy, but it turns out that I really like it. I'm not exactly the most masculine person, and it still feels weird actually calling myself a man (I guess I think of myself more like a boy?), but it feels much better being called a dude than being called a girl.

And now I'm finding myself wishing I had less fat around the hips and thighs, broader shoulders, a flat chest, a deeper voice, a stronger jawline - you know, like, the whole testosterone package - and I'm really feeling it. Like I've suddenly been exposed to this whole masculine side of myself, and thinking that this is what I'm really meant to be. The more I imagine it, the more I become attached to it, and the more I start to feel confused when I look in the mirror and I see that my real body doesn't match up to it.

I think my real revelation came as I walked home today along a path going away from the setting sun, and I could see my shadow, and my wide hips, and it was really fucking upsetting, and all of a sudden I was thinking, ""Oh shit, oh shit, I'm actually a guy. Like I'm a full blown trans guy and I need to transition and that's terrifying."" Like honestly, I'm really glad that I've come to this conclusion. The uncertainty has been eating away at me. But also I'm shit scared and part of me wishes that I could have just been born with a dick and that I hadn't been destined to go down this path.

So for those of you who are opting to medically transition - when did you folk realise you needed to medically transition?"
carbonfiber12,asktransgender,How Ocd (HOCD and Trans OCD) has been consuming my life..ruining it,"Basically Ive been mentally ill since I was about 15, I was verbally abused since 8 years old, and was diagnosed with PTSD and OCD ( the hand washing till they bled, the locking of the door over and over) yes i had severe ocd and i didnt know till 18. I grew up a very normal boy, felt comfortable in my body, felt comfortable with my sexuality, hated playing with girls, hated girly things, loved playing war with the lads, I was was a jock, and a boy who knew he wanted to grow up to be like his father, muscular and like other male role models, I use to imagine I was like many futbol players i aspired to be like, David Beckham especially I really wanted to be exactly like him. All i ever dreamed about was how i wanted to have a nice car, lots of money to buy nice suits and grow a cool beard and be muscular, and play pro futbol.

It started with my cousins dressing me up in girls clothes at a young age, I didnt even know what was happening, it turned me on but I didnt know it. When I hit 13 it came back and the fetish for womens clothing started, i had no access to porn and the fetish was my escape from the abuse and stress my father gave me. So i masturbated almost every day, or more than that in a day, it was an addiction to the clothing, in which I usually imagined a girl I thought hot making me put on her clothes, after i masturbated I snapped back to normal, nothing more. 

Then I found porn, and lord almighty did it mess me up, i watched lesbian porn because i figured anything with guys meant i was gay, and i got addicted to that. Fast forward to year 10 in school, I didnt use the fetish all that much cause of porn but it still turned me on...until one day it popped in my head ""you like wearing women's items, you must be gay"". I spiraled into an anxiety attack and HOCD for the next two years, the checking for an erection to gay porn, seeing if i prefer men over women, my mind was consumed and it was ruining my life. I was so scared that I had been in denial, even tho i had not even touched the fetish for 2 years, i wanted to get it out of my head, and out of my life and i felt much happier without it, minus the HOCD. 

Then I met a girl for the first time i really liked, we went out, I felt this feeling of being her masculine protector, I felt so good, so happy, my HOCD was gone, it was something I had wanted since I started having a interest girls at 13, then she dumped me and i fell into a depression. Cue TOCD when the whole Jenner thing started. I remember the exact day that hell of ocd triggered. I thought to myself bloody hell I use to wear girls clothes and masturbate I must be trans. Started researching everyday, my anxiety was so bad I would throw up in the mornings, my ptsd gave me these nightmares, I had intrusive thoughts ""face it your trans, accept it"" . I have become so scared and unsure who I even am anymore, my mind has messed with my thoughts so much, other than the meds slightly lowering my anxiety my ocd is so strong I cant stop testing myself, looking in the mirror to see if i like my muscular body seeing if i like my penis, my beard, my leg hair, im so lost cause before all this I was very comfortable with myself, and I always wanted to grow old as a man. 

I have never liked makeup, it creeped me out when guys wore it, I have always liked short hair, it was always specific items that turned me on. When I imagine myself having sex without OCD, I am the one with the penis, the macho male, the one who is male role, being submissive was just a turn on kink when the ocd kicked in, but as a boy and man I always imagined grasping a women and picking her up and having sex with her standing up. I like my penis, dont want a vagina ( im straight but they kind of gross me out sometimes, no offence) I dont wanna grow old as women and have wrinkly breasts. I want to be an old man, and i was always sure of it. When I abstain from masturbating and the fetish i feel better and more masculine and happier, but its tough to abstain, the addiction is strong. Honestly when my mind says you must be trans I start to break down, i almost cry, i dont want that life, i need help, im so sick of this, i wanna return to my old self, not this fucked up person I am now. Help me please the reassurance is like a drug and I always feel better when I get it.."

Canadiannabis,asktransgender,Should I even be on HRT? warning rant/whining ahead,"So last night I cried for 2 straight hours and fell into a really deep depressive hole that reminds me of how I felt before I tried killing myself the first time. My girlfriend comforted me and I kind of pulled myself out of it but I still haven't been having a great day today.

I've posted before about doubts and uncertainty even after starting HRT, and while some people said that they had mixed feelings like me, most people seem to follow the path that HRT made them happier and more peaceful and whatever.

Well that hasn't been the case for me. My mood's been shooting all over the place and on top of that while I think that I am trans* I am terrified that I'm just delusional or fucked up or ruining my life and future &lt;-- with all of these separate fears mixing to make me feel like I'm crazy and have no idea what I'm doing.

Adding to this is that while I am seeing a counselor about my gender issues, have seen a different one prior to her, and I have had these feelings for 2+ years and on and off levels of intensity during my childhood/adolescence, I ended up receiving my HRT from an informed consent clinic.

The fact that I'm having doubts and that my mood isn't matching what its supposed to be if I'm really trans* makes me think that I could be completely wrong about myself. I know a lot of people need therapy letters and stuff but I figured that I was relatively sure and it would be a diagnostic. Now I just have no idea because the changes make me happy but the fucking overriding fear constantly pushing down makes me feel like an irrational reckless young kid whose going to permanently disfigure themselves and ruin their lives.

I'm through Charing X Clinic and am just about to have my second Psych assessment. I've had a year RLE and have been on HRT for 11 months now. So that time has come where I'm thinking about ""The op""

Major concerns include the fact I was circumcised as a baby and I don't have much length to play with (excuse the pun) so thats playing on my mind.

I'm liking the idea of Dr Rashid but as shes fairly new I'm wondering if anyone has any more advice? What surgery would you think is best? Thanks in advance for your help &lt;3 xx"

Harpoon385,asktransgender,How much should one expect their life to change after they transition?,"I've never been really one for big changes in my life, and as of now, the big(gest) change for me will be transitioning (which is essentially everyone's biggest change in life, puberty. And as I have barely began my ""natural"" puberty, it will basically just be normal puberty I guess, so I mean any moodiness, and whatever other side effects puberty causes won't be out of place). And I want to do this really badly, but I don't feel like I have the mental energy to go through with it, even though I know it will make me much happier. So will getting on estrogen make me less mentally exausted (as I have heard gender dysphoria tends to be a huge drain on your mental energy)?

It has been one of the hardest things I've ever done. I think the worst part about this is I still feel like I do not have permission to live out the rest of my life presenting female.

I have been seeing a therapist that specializes in gender issues and we have talked about this feeling of needing permission to experience happiness. I've had fleeting moments of gender euphoria but I can never seem to get them to last more than 5 mins before I find reasons to be miserable. I have been wrestling with needing permission to be happy wether it come from my spouse, society etc. I've been so wrapped up in making other people happy. Playing the games, following the rules that when I'm given the choice to be myself it's almost to much.

Does anyone else struggle with this? I almost feel like because I've weighted so long to accept this about myself that I'm unable or will never be able to give myself permission to enjoy my life.

How can I deal with figuring out that this is truly what I want, and then handling the fact that I can't have it for a long time still?","Long title I guess, but when I'm having trouble focusing my thoughts I tend to get lengthy and long-winded. Apologies if this post is drawn out much longer than necessary. I don't really know how to start this, but the degree of isolation I've been filling struggling through this without knowing anybody who's experienced these kinds of circumstances is getting unbearable, so I guess I'll just ramble and hope it comes across coherently.

Basically, I'm a second year student at a Military college. I'm fulfilling my dream of studying English Lit so I can train to be a pilot in the Air Force, and it feels fantastic, except for all the parts where it doesn't because my sense of identity has been falling to pieces around me and I've been grasping at jagged fragments of glass in the dark trying to pull it back together. After years of being unhappy with myself, I reflected on the characters I adore reading and writing, and how every character I've ever poured my heart and soul into and lived through as I wrote have been women, and in all the rpg's I've played, whether they be video games or DND around the table, I've done the same. That led me to question how I look at myself as a whole, and I came to a sort of realization that a lot of the self-hate I had for my body stemmed from the fact that I just... didn't care for any of the masculine aspects of it. For a long time I just stopped taking care of my body because I felt like it was mine, but then I realized how fucking stupid that was and stopped that. Moving on, I'm quite dense when it comes to a lot of things, but I'm well versed enough in the art of thinking that I came to a conclusion about what all that might mean about my self-perceptions and how I might want to live my life pretty fast. That was a number of months ago, and those feelings still haven't really changed, so I guess that means me wanting to be a woman isn't just a phase, but...

One of my english profs - she's the only person I've been open with at this stupid school - told me I should try and bring it up with family over Christmas. I talked to my mother a few days before I flew back across the country to go back to school. I didn't get disowned, which I guess was nice, but being told not to butcher my body and that I'm already fine and healthy and don't need to fuck myself up was unpleasant and I'm pretty sure that means I won't have a ton of parental support if I'm deciding to go forward and ever since that happened I've been second guessing myself - a lot. I've never known anybody who was transgender; I don't know how I can know this isn't just some phase; I don't know how I can know going through this wouldn't be something I regret for the rest of my life, and it's terrible because I'm pretty certain not going through with this *would* be something I'd regret for the rest of my life but I'm not certain *enough* to convince myself I'm certain...

Moving on, even if I was certain, I find myself in this terrible position of being caught between two dreams. In the one dream, I can live my life as a woman. In the other, I can be an air force pilot, flying helicopters in high-intensity low-to-the-ground operations or life-saving search and rescue operations. I think those dreams might be mutually exclusive, and it's killing me. I *know* that it's not a problem with the military. The military will pay for everything as a matter of fact - that's the main reason the lack of family support doesn't hurt more than it already does. But for pilots, they're really strict about mental health conditions, and medical health conditions, and having pilots be in peak health and form. I don't know that I can't have both, but the doctor I talked to about wanting all this (while being very supportive and not trying to dissuade me at all) said that although she couldn't be certain, since I might very well be the first case ever of one of our nations military officers transitioning if I do go through with this, there was likely a very good chance that for me, pilot and woman would mutually exclude each other.

I guess last point, and I'm aware that I'm tackling these in reverse-ish order and I hope you forgive the stream of consciousness, but the school I'm at has a cultural environment about 30-40 years behind the rest of the world with respect to social progressiveness, and it's not the institution's fault so much as the fact that the population is 90% adolescent males, but I'm absolutely terrified of being ripped apart here if I was to come out with any of this during my 4 years here (hence the new account and lack of finer details in this post), so I have to live with the fact that no matter what my choice ends up being, I have to live another 2 years like this, and I don't know if accepting what I want to do will make it easier or what to do to prepare things if I do want to go through with this in 2 years or who to talk to or anything because I don't know anybody who I can talk to that will *really understand* what I'm struggling to figure out.

I guess that's my post. I don't even know what I'm asking for, really. Advice? Suggestions? A detailed walkthrough of how to figure this out courtesy of somebody who's miraculously lived through the same set of events?

I think maybe I just want somebody to listen to this or talk to or something maybe.

TomorrowsPharmacist,asktransgender,Hello. Pharmacy Student here with some questions.,"Hello,

I'm a 3rd year Pharmacy Student, and so far, my college has not really covered transgender health topics, or told us how to give care to transgender patients.  Our ""actor"" patients that we train on have mostly been playing the roles of old cisgender straight patients.  Our brief discussion of hormone replacement therapy was not in the context of transgender patients, but cisgender men and women who did not produce enough hormones.  I want to serve my transgender patients as well as I do my other patients, and I don't feel like I've received all the information to do so, and so I wanted to know if there's anything you think I might find helpful, or anything you wish that your pharmacists had known.

I'm more looking for general thoughts, but if none come to mind, here are some questions you might answer:

What can I do to help you feel more welcome as a patient?

What have been some good experience that you've had with a pharmacist?

What have been some bad experiences that you've had with a pharmacist?

What are some things that you wish your pharmacist would have told you about your HRT (for example, side effects, how long it takes took to work, how you were supposed to take it, etc.)?

How would your ideal encounter with a pharmacist go?

I've talked with my parents about spending that money on forehead reconstruction and they are OK with it. They even told me that they'd be willing to put in 3,000 dollars for the surgery, and could even help pay for travel expenses with air miles.

I would like some help in considering surgery options. I have a strong preference to stay inside Canada/the United states. The doctor doesn't matter as long as they are capable of performing the surgery with reasonable results. Other than that, my options are pretty open, although limited by the budget  mentioned previously. (Although, my parents have told me that adding an extra ~$1000 dollars doesn't matter to them if it's required for travel or something else)

I don't want to go to Thailand either. I would have a panic attack.

Can anyone recommend me some US/Canadian doctors that will quote me online, and that you believe would fit my budget/criteria for a doctor? Thank you. Your help would be greatly appreciated.

Darkstarlight1984,asktransgender,Dealing with boys club stuff before transition MTF,"**Question is at the end, sorry for the text wall**


I don't really know how to describe this problem, but it is an irritation to me. About a year ago I came out to my wife that i am transgender, but I haven’t decided whether to transition or not. No one else knows about this except for a therapist I meet for a few appointments. With that out of the way, this week I was given a project at work that is completely different than my job, I run big machines and computers that create clothing pieces. This project was creating a 3d digital model of the factory work floor that will guide the workers in the installation of a new piece machine, organize the room, and create new architectural features that gives benefits the department.  I knew how to make the model, but the boss that gave me task didn’t know that I could do that. That is no really the strange part. 


My department has an assistant manager. She seems capable, but they gave the task to me and she understands what the rest of the department needs and work flow much better than me. They didn’t even tell her about the project, but I went and talked to her to get input on where things should be and what might be better. Besides the boss of the department I am the only other male in the department. I prefer that mostly because the Boys club Bro stuff just annoys me. I have worked in different departments at my work. I get along with anyone, but bro acting to fit in always annoys me. 


I completed the project using sketchup and the upper management set up two meetings. The first meeting was about the new machine arriving and the second was my plan being presented to the CFO or close to that. It was all bros. my assistant manager wasn’t there even though they were talking about things that are critical to the department, and on top of that I really noticed that I felt uneasy about the boy’s club atmosphere more than I use too in the past. Meeting start up, few jokes at the expense of someone in the room from the boss, random info that is somewhat interesting, and I can’t really explain most of the interactions. I learned long ago in college to fake some of the interactions, but it still baffles me.  I appreciate the opportunity to prove my skills but It felt weird being placed in the position over my assistant manager and not really wanting to be in that environment. 


**I’m not sure what to ask. I do understand that people will perceive you differently depending on your presentation but, How did you deal with the boys club stuff before transition and how did you deal with it afterwards or how much of a change in your workplace.**

First, I have a script from UNT that has a script I'm gonna use but I can't come up with a non-trans related reason to change my name.

I am afraid to come out because I am living in Mississippi.  I am trying to start hormones as soon as possible so I can go full time as soon as I am out of here.  I never have time to present how I want to because there are people within my friend group who I am not ready to come out to yet.  This means that I have not asked my friends who I am out to to use different pronouns or name or anything like that.  Because of how I present, I think they still see me as a guy, at the very least they still treat me like one.  I don't know whether to tell them or not.  I am very conflicted on how I want them to treat me.  Since they know I am trans, it is so much harder when they treat me like a guy.  I'm not sure if I want to be treated differently though because someone could find out.  I know I should just talk to them, but I find it very hard to open up to people because of being shamed for it in high school.  Even if I did talk to them I wouldn't know what to say because I don't know what I really want from them.  I guess I am just scared that they will always see the guy, the character I've been playing for the past 20 years and not the real me.

My university is obviously closer and more convenient, but likely doesn't have a ton of experience with trans issues.  The Mazzoni Center is further away, but still accessible by public transit and likely has far more experience with HRT for trans people.

Any recommendations about which avenue I should pursue?  My understanding is that the wait time and cost is similar for both locations - any differences would be in the quality of the care and/or knowldge/expertise of the staff.

My mother, asking for me to wait to start HRT, wasnt asking out of disdain for me but more fear of confrontation with my grandma. She told me if I still do it she will stand her ground against her.

calisthymia,asktransgender,Anyone else seen their ribcage shrink with HRT?,"As a part of my transition process, I've been monitoring physical changes in my body with a scientist's diligence, which has included taking my underbust and overbust measure once a week for some time now, with the purpose of tracking breast development. To my surprise, my underbust measure is decreasing faster than the overbust measure increases, at an approximate rate of one inch per five weeks. My question is, is this something seen by other MtF people on HRT?

I know that many other measures are likely to change with HRT, but I thought that the ribcage circumference is pretty much fixed by the bone structure right below the skin, especially at my age. It would appear improbable that the change would be caused by loss of muscle as my upper body has never been muscular, and changes in fat tissue should, if anything, increase the circumference (though I haven't been gaining any weight).

In any case, rather than worried I'm positively surprised by this development, and just wanted to ask because I haven't seen anyone else mention the issue."

atteleen,asktransgender,How best to respond if someone tells you they are trans?,"I have recently become acquainted with a colleague who appears to be in the latter stages of transitioning from female to male. As all our colleagues have only started working together this year we are not well known to each other yet, and this person has dropped hints that he may have something he would prefer to share with us once he knows everyone a little better.

For clarification, I am not concerned about whether he chooses to discuss his gender identity with us or not. That is his choice and I am utterly fine with however he chooses to express his gender identity and however much or little information he chooses to discuss with anyone. Obviously that is completely his prerogative. I have a great deal of admiration, liking, and respect for him as a colleague in a highly competitive profession which demands excellence, and also as a person who has likely had to overcome some monumental personal challenges and struggles with gender dysphoria. (He's also just a really nice guy.) If telling us about his transition is something he chooses to do, the last thing I would want to do is unintentionally respond in a way that could cause offence or hurt.

My instinct would be to congratulate him on his transition the way one would congratulate anyone on achieving a major life milestone, and thank him for sharing that personal information with me. I'm also happy for him if he is now able to live as his authentic self.

I'm wondering if any trans people would be able to give me some feedback about the best way to respond if he does decide to talk about it with me, as I certainly don't want to say the wrong thing, but would like to acknowledge what a significant event in his life it must be. I can imagine being hurt by someone downplaying something so important in my own life.

So the next day I tried to get an appointment with a doctor at a clinic but the emergency lineup was full. So I went to the emergency at the hospital (I know it's supposed to be for really urgent things but I was freaking out about testicular torsion at the time)(also yay free healthcare). 

After 7hours of waiting, the doctor got me in his room and tried to feel (fuck that was not only embarrassing but also I wanted to scream during the whole thing) if there was anything wrong. He then said there wasn't but that I was abnormally sensitive so there was definitely something going on. He went out to check if atrophy because of hrt could cause that, and came back saying it shouldn't but could.

He then said that it was most probably some benign infection as I haven't had sex ever and as I haven't peen punched there or anything lately. He prescribed me some anti-inflammation pills for ten days and told me to see a doctor again if anything changed for the worse or if it didn't get better

So a week later the pain is still there but is a tiny bit better and the pills only made it disappear from my lower belly.

(Why the hell CAN I even feel pain there anyway, those things don't belong there damnit)

Now that that embarrassing and dysphoric as hell bit is out of the way...

TL;DR: is a dull/mute pain in the testicular area normal at about 4 months or so of hrt (mtf obv)?! Can it be caused by hrt? Since it hasn't stopped after a week should I see another doctor or is this normal?

I know this sub isn't for medical advice but I'm pretty sure you'll give me a better answer on this than my assigned family doctor who asked me if I wanted to take Testosterone to stop my being trans... And my endo is super hard to contact directly 

I may be hypocondriac/paranoid hard here but my two grandparents on my dad's side died of cancer so I'm super worried as this pain doesn't seem very common"

Im shy like Im the tyep of person that is way to quiet at the drive through, and I'm too scared to talk to anyone in my family and my new best friend/ex girlfriend and I don't know what to do so I've taken to the internet for advice.  I've lately been thinking about a sex change and plastic surgery to get a more feminine figure but I want to keep my pennies, but I think I'm getting ahead of myself because I don't know if I really want to go with it right now."
Transthrowahway,asktransgender,I picked Dr. Chettawut as my SRS surgeon and have some questions for anyone that had work done by him?,"How long did it take for his faculty to get back to you after you emailed them?

How is Thailand? I'm kind of culturally unaware and slightly brainwashed that non first world countries are horrifying.

How long did you have to wait before you surgery? I'm hoping for June, but I know it's a short stretch. I'd like to have my surgery done before fall semester begins at university. What was his wait list like?

If there was something you would have brought, or done if you had to do it over again, and it would greatly benefit your trip/extended stay in Thailand, what would it be?

I've never been outside of the United States before, I'm slightly worried. I'll probably be going by myself. Any tips or advice will help.

Izzy10235,asktransgender,Can someone recommend some good ffs surgeons in the US?,"Hiya, Izzy here. 

So, I still have a ways to go in my transition (only roughly nine months in (minus like, 2 weeks when I either ran out, or fasted from meds...,) but, I feel like I should have a contingency if I find I really need to fix my face even after a year or two has passed. I've heard of Spiegel, Toby, and Zukowski. But... from what it seems, they might be a bit on the pricey side... If I can get a lower cost with roughly the same amount of skill and good results as the three I mentioned up there, it might make my life easier. I'd like to avoid having to put my self really deep into debt, if possible.

Bonus points if they're not too far from WA, since I'll be moving there soon.

Thanks!"
Uncomfortable_here,asktransgender,Is it normal to stay in guy mode until i think i pass? Do you think you pass?,"I am usually very reserved about how i feel about myself.

I know I'm transgender but if i dont pass I'm not sure I'll finish transitioning. Are these normal thoughts?"
beslinky,asktransgender,Dysphoria or frustration with sexism?,"This will be a longer post but there is a lot on my mind; thank you for taking the time to read this message.

Female in my early 20s and within the last two years or so, I have come to seriously loathe being a female. Not the typical “hate having periods, feeling less than a man, etc.,” but for deeper reasons.

As a child, I was always attracted to maintaining justice between boys and girls. If a boy could do that, why can’t a girl? And vice versa. I assumed that we were born equal. Was basically a tomboy. I felt like I had more of a “masculine” mind (still do) and befriended boys more than girls.

After I came to college, my interests changed. I felt like it was expected that I picked a more “feminine” major, and I realized after two years of being in my program that out of sheer interest and happiness, I want to be in STEM. Was a very enlightening experience that I suppressed for some time, and I am now preparing to change my academic and career path.

I despise socially constructed norms and have created a mentality where I want equality in all aspects, like the husband and wife both doing interior and exterior design, etc., for everyone.

I hate doing things traditionally “feminine” like crying or being more emotional… and it’s like I just wish I had higher levels of testosterone.I take pride in having a lower voice, and other ""masculine"" traits. If I could switch to being a male I would do it in a heartbeat, but not sure if it's dysphoria?

I love all things physically male, and there are definite times of penis envy. Its’s like if I could be male I would want to look like my partner. He thinks I am rebelling against being stereotypically female, but I feel more comfortable and confident doing masculine things.

Problem is, if I like all these masculine traits, isn't that perpetuating the stereotype? So why would I desire it, to feel more equal or what?

Thank you guys!"
user386,asktransgender,Should I lie to my therapist?,"A little background first of all:

I've considered myself agender (and asexual and aromantic, but that's another story) since puberty. I've always known that I was not a man, but never considered the possibility of being a woman. Or maybe I did and shoved it under the rug, I'm not quite sure about this.

Last year I confronted it seriously for the first time. I realized I was trans, battled myself for a couple more months, and since the beginning of this year I haven't had any more doubts. I can only understand myself as a woman, and I don't want to ever go back to being the emotionless freak I have been all this years. I can only see my future as feminine. This two months have been both the most painful and the most real in my life.

Now for the practical concerns: I live in Spain. Which is awesome in some regards, and I'll be able to access HRT through the public healthcare system for free (mostly). The problem is, they require some pretty shitty standards. I've seen the diagnostic letter for a friend of mine (a trans guy) and they quote the requirements, particularly a ""presence of a transexual identity persistently for at least **two years**"".

So. Here comes the question. Should I:

 - Tell my story as it is to the therapist, trusting that she will go over the standards given that I'm completely certain about my gender identity.
 - Lie a little bit, tell that I've known for a few years and was afraid to tell. Twist the truth and try to fall under their thresholds without lying too much.
 - Lie about everything, be an archetypal trans girl and tell that I've cross-dressed and all. (I haven't) (also I already had a preliminary interview, so I don't think I could make this work anymore)
 - Tell my story as it is, and wait two freaking years before HRT because you honestly believe that I'm going to fast. (?????)

I've to say, I've never been so sure about anything in my life. I can't ""prove"" anything, but my life has always felt fake, and for the first time ever I feel that things are real, that I have a future somehow. Everything is so mindbogglingly real and true that I can't conceive how it could be wrong.

I'm scared as hell, but I don't have a single doubt anymore. Only my body is standing between me and my happiness. And now that I know ( I *feel*) what I've to do, I just can't stand wasting two more years of my life trapped like this.

So yeah. What do I do now?

Thanks everybody
Iris

PS: There is one last possibility. There is an exception for the rules, in case someone is at risk of self medicating (or doing it already). I'm usually against this kind of things, but given the circumstances, this looks like a very real possibility.


Edit: My my, aren't you all a terrible influence?? xD But thanks for the responses, I'll probably follow the advice(s) and lie as needed. I could use some counseling so I'll stick to the truth mostly, but some dates will dance a little bit to give them what they want. Thanks for the help!"
fiercewolf0,asktransgender,"So, T-chasers are bad... we know this... But...","Ok, so, I'm trans (duh) and I've been seeing this girl for a while now, and i think she's the one. Since day one I've noticed little things, and I won't go in to them, but I think she may be a T-chaser. I plan on having a talk with her about it,  but if she is, could things still work out? Just because what I am is her fetish, she could still love me right? She says she loves me, and I know she does. Can love bloom from a Fetish?"
BBBTech,asktransgender,Anxiety getting worse?,"I'm about two weeks into HRT. At first, I just felt really fatigued and depressed. Now, I'm incredibly anxious a lot of the time. I've struggled with both anxiety and depression my entire life, and definitely prefer the latter over the former. My anxiety was manageable before I started, pretty much vanished when I started, but has returned with a vengeance. 

Is this normal? I was contemplating going on medication--my therapist suggests an SSRI--before I started transition but put them on pause to see what effect going full time and hormones would have. At what point in my HRT is it worthwhile to reopen that option?"
sixandsevens,asktransgender,"Not ""feeling"" trans when you're not dysphoric?","So I'm recently out to my mom. On the phone yesterday she started badgering me with questions about whether I'm sure about transition (I haven't started yet) and the like. In a nutshell, ""Why couldn't I just assume different gender roles without hormones and surgery?"" I actually teared up on the other end of the phone thinking about every dysphoric breakdown I've had about my body.

But the thing is, when I don't hate my body, I don't feel like I need to transition. It doesn't change my gender identity at all, I just don't ""feel trans""... I guess because in those moments I don't find anything worth changing? But my dysphoria has gotten pretty bad, and it only started to get better when I started seeing a gender therapist and was confirmed to start hormones in May (Yay!). I've kind of come to trust my judgement that transitioning with hormones is what I need.

Still, in my good moods, I'm convinced that I can put up with where I am now. Does anyone else have a similar experience? What did you decide to do and why?"

Syfygirl16,asktransgender,So... i uh... found out how many people I'd lose in my life if i transition,"I found out i'll lose: my mom's half of the family, probably part of my dad's side, most of my friends, and most of the people i know.

My dad's side will probably not understand me transitioning but still support me. I'll lose most of my friends as a few are against gay people and probably trans, whereas a few are accepting of gay but not trans, and then a few are accepting of both. I'll lose probably 3/4 or more of the people i currently know if i transition...

I was talking to my parents and they said that being trans will hold me back in things like jobs and college...

Between the finances of college and life it doesn't seem like i can transition for a few more years, how much does it actually cost?

*sigh* i just don't know what to do anymore. It seems like the closer i get to being able to transition, the more shit gets dumped on me.

EDIT: Forget all that behind this update. I just received a letter from the university I'm looking at going to. They sent a list of data about internships at local companies around them: Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc... the average internship is a year and pays at $850 a week, Transition is possible!!! (I'm going into the computer science world with a lot of experience and prior knowledge) I just need to work harder and get an internship!"
kt-silber,asktransgender,"Had a doctor appointment recently, blood pressure results weren't good","As the title says, the results weren't good. BP was 72/46. Now, I had just taken my spiro (100mg) about an hour before seeing the doctor on an empty stomach, so it may very well have been a sudden drop from that. While he's not familiar with trans issues &amp; treatment, he did seem a bit worried and ordered a blood test. Every other time I've had my blood pressure checked in the last few months it all came back perfect.

My question to you fine people is, how low can you expect your BP to get while on spiro? If there is an issue and I need to be taken off spiro, is there another powerful enough anti-androgen that can be prescribed in the US?

tanukib590,asktransgender,"Am I ""really"" trans? (Would like some insight)","**First post, please be kind :)**

Not a simple question, but after years of dysphoria, I am having huge issues looking outside my point of view. Sometimes you just need someone to give a different perspective to make things that much clearer.

Here are my biggest doubts. Can you give me some insight?

1 I have always been a happy boy when I was younger, but all that changed when puberty was soon to arrive. **why did it start at puberty?**

2 As a child, I never had a firm concept that men and women are so different. It was as if my entire childhood was mostly genderless. I always thought that all people had penises and even asked my mom why my little plush bear has no penis. The only part that was different was boobs, and my female friends didnt have boobs. It was only until mandatory sex-ED that changed everything, and I wanted even more fervently, to be female. **I cant understand how I never saw a naked female in all my younger years, but apparently I didnt**

3 I am afraid of being an unpassable trans female. I am 5foot 8, have a huge chest and ribcage(ribcages do not shrink). I feel like a true potato. But I have little choice, as being a guy is like a suicide timer. I dont want to die. I have too much invested in this world.

4 Even if allowed to transition, I would still struggle with intense body image issues and passing issues. My life would still be miserable, except a different kind of misery. I would still look at 80% of girls my age and feel dysphoric.

5 I have huge doubts about blending in socially as a female. My female age is literally 0 and every feminine social construct out there that I have to grasp is so intimidating and unnerving.

6 I am asexual currently. I cannot imagine having sex when I have a penis. Regardless of giving or receiving, and the gender of my partner. It is very painful to imagine myself sexually as anything but female. I always found that, in the situation in which I (male) am having sex with a female, I would be so intensely jealous of the girl. And then theres phantom vaginas, and vagina envy. But thats going too deep. (PUN :O)

7 Even if I do not socially transition and remain a guy, I still want to take estrogen. I will probably wear a binder, the irony. I feel that T is bad for me.

8 I cannot imagine how ANYONE in the world would want to be a guy. Seriously. To me, being a guy is socially, physically, and perhaps spiritually so disgusting. It hurts the psyche to even think about this. (But that said, if you wanna be a guy thats totally fine with me!)

9 Trick question: Is it alright if I end up unpassable/fugly, and end up presenting androgynous instead? This would be a much better way to present myself; my external representation would be more in line with my internal gender. I would be infinitely happier compared to now. Of course I would love to be a girl....

TDLR: I do not fit the ""usual"" transgender narrative at all. Wondering if I am not trans, but misguided.

Real TDLR: go read it, you lazy prick :D Just a little bit? if not you cant answer my questions..

**EDIT: You people are awesome :)**"
1ofthosetimes,asktransgender,Struggling to come out -_-,"I really hate this but i get a weird block and can't say it. Last night really emphasised it for me. 

I went out drinking with some friends, i'm not actually out to them but i really should be because it's ridiculous... So i was there in a dress and wearing makeup, only a little bit more femme than i usually am and obviously they all gender me as a man and call me a male name because well that's how i introduced myself to them when we met. Well, a random stranger ended up joining us at our table and he consistently gendered me correctly. It put me in a really good mood. Obviously people heard him and no one 'corrected' him which i really appreciated. 

Thing is i'm pretty sure, like 99% sure, they'd all be accepting but for some reason i can't bring myself to tell them to call me by my new name and use she/her. "

somniferist,asktransgender,"Trying to get an affidavit on a time crunch, please help? (Cook Cty IL)","(FTM, over 20, no job, basically $0 in my wallet now)

Okay, time for a full update.

I have learned the following and now I'm really starting to worry.

1) I need a ""Physician Certificate"" in order to amend my passport when i do the name update on it. I cannot get a full-validity passport, I can only get a 2-year.

What is a ""Physician certificate"" and how is that different from a notarized affidavit? Can I get one from an Informed Consent clinic such as Howard Brown or Chicago women's health center?

What do these limited passports look like? Do they only have the new gender marker, do they have ""Amended"" in any form, or any indication of my being trans? How can I even contact a doctor to eventually change it if I do not intend to return to the US before the 2 years is up?

2) I need a notarized affidavit from a physician in order to amend my (NY) birth certificate that says I have undergone ""sufficient treatment.""

The wording is intentionally vague so as to not gatekeep too much, but is it possible to get a letter like this prior to getting any kind of surgery or HRT (since technically nobody really -needs- to transition medically, right? Regardless of how I personally want to go in the future)?

3) I have an appointment with a therapist/counsellor on the 11th (that was absolutely the soonest I could get in, I asked).

What do I or can I ask of them on my first visit insofar as getting a letter declaring I have gender dysphoria? Does a psychologist or psychiatrist count as a physician? If not, can I get a letter from them to show my physician and do you think my primary would accept that as enough to write the ""certificate"" or affidavit?

I have also generally learned that all of this is going to take a whole hell of a lot longer than I have time for and I REALLY need to get out of the US by April 29th at the absolute latest. My court date for the name change is on March 28th, and I need to apply for my passport on the same day or the day after to get it ASAP. I'm already going to go directly to the Passport Agency for this so I can get it in 8 days.

I need all the advice I can get at this point, I'm freaking out."

Here is the context. I am a cis male dating a trans woman. Our relationship is developing really well and we are becoming pretty close.

So since we started dating I have always seen her 100% as a woman and always treated her as such, however I can see that she isnt comfortable in her own skin. As of recently she has been spending the night at my house and a couple of times in the morning she will wake up and have a small bit of facial stubble. I just ignore it because for one its fairly unnoticeable and it really doesn't bother me, but there have been a couple times that she has gotten very embarrassed about it. She has expressed that she wants to get laser on her face but she recently bought a car and doesn't have the money to do it. 
I want to buy it for her because I know its something that she is insecure about and it would make her feel more comfortable in her body, but at the same time I could see how it could be interpreted as me having a problem with her. What do all of you think?

user386,asktransgender,Anyone receiving /r/tOCD messages?,"I'm sorry, this is more of a warning than a real question. I just received this message:

&gt; You have received this message because you made a post that was identifed as potentially indicating that you have tOCD. The algorithem is not perfect so you might have received this message in error.

&gt; If you are questioning or freaking out about your gender identity, then it is likely that you have Transgender OCD and you are not transgender. If you are panicing with fear that you might be transgender, then you are very likey not trans and suffering from tOCD.
&gt; 
&gt; You should go to /r/OCD or /r/tOCD and share what has been bothering you. /r/OCD is filled with people with relentless tOCD convincing them that they are transgender. There is hope for this condition, no matter how relentlessly it tries to convince you that you are transgender.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a small possibiltity that you might be transgender and we will be open and accepting of that possibiltity and help you learn that if it's the case. Most users who believe they are trans are not actually trans though and are simply having severe anxiety problems.
&gt; 
&gt; As long as you have severe tOCD you are encouraged to stay away from transgender subreddits and websites. It's tempting to go ask if something disqualifies you from being trans, but the truth is that there are really no disqulifiers if you believe yourself to be transgender. Places like /r/AskTransgender need to exist for transgender people but they are absolutely toxic for anyone with tOCD. The users there are acting in the interests of trans people, not anyone with tOCD. They ask disgustingly loaded questions like ""Do you think cis people have these kinds of gender panics?"" and you will be relentlessly encouraged to transition for every shared characteristic or possibiltity that something about you could be a sign of being trans.
&gt; 
&gt; Transphobic agendas will not be tolerated at /r/tOCD. Transgender people exist and their condtion is not caused by any mental disorders. They do not fetishize women or plan to rape women in bathrooms or whatever insane things TERFs have said. It is very unlikely that any of them have transitioned because of tOCD.

&gt; Anti spam precautions are in place to prevent this message from bombarding users. You should not receive this message for the same post twice because all post IDs are recorded. If you make multiple posts asking if you are transgender then it is possible that you will receive this message more then once. This message is only sent to users who make posts that are identified automatically questioning their gender identity.



The community at /r/tOCD was created a day ago. I'm guessing that their ""algorithm"" is processing old messages, as a few months ago I made a couple ""am i trans"" posts.

That was a few months ago. Right now I've finally come to terms with being trans, and I'm afraid of what is to come, but happy that I've finally found myself. And this community has been an awesome support for that!

So yeah, I found this message simply offensive. Saying that most people questioning their gender are not transgender... That's not only wrong, but also probably dangerous.

If you are new around here and get this message... Well, **no one can really tell you if you are or not trans**. But if you want to take my word for it, I have a first person example of someone who was confused as hell and was helped in this same community. I don't want to think what could have come out of a message like this one if I had received a few months ago, when I was unsure about everything...

Any opinions? Is it me being too sensitive or is it as f****d up as it seems?

jaythrowawayk,asktransgender,A couple of questions,"Hi!

So I am a gender fluid teenager (18) living in Australia. I am biologically male. I have recently, more intensely, mulled over the possibility of being transgender. It's certainly been on my mind for the last few years, and I feel like I would be more comfortable in a female body than a male one. I understand this is the opposite of what trans people typically face and, that is, being uncomfortable in their own skin. I'm not so much uncomfortable as I am dissatisfied and often wish I was born as a female. *Is this irregular?*

I am also seeing a new psychologist soon who specializes in LGBT+ persons, and am hoping they can guide me through everything and help me find who I am, and the identity I fall under. *What can I expect to hear from them and what sort of questions will they ask me?*

Thirdly, and I'm not sure if this is any help, but ive felt more down than usual lately, socially withdrawn from people and experienced a loss of appetite. *As I understand, this can sometimes be a symptom of body and/or gender dysphoria?* I would just like to know so I can tell this to my psychologist. 

Also, hypothetically speaking, *if I were to be trans (I say this with uncertainty as I'm often uncertain about most of what I feel, hence why I want to see a psychologist), what sort of costs will there be?* I've lurked here a while and it seems that HRT is rather inexpensive which is a great relief.

*Lastly, what are a couple of hurdles that will present themselves in the transitioning process?* I tend to worry a lot but I know my friends and at least some of my family would be supportive of me. 

Thank you everyone, your help is much appreciated.

I really don't know where to start, so excuse me if this ends up being a wall to rival that of the Great Wall of China.  
But I'm wondering if I ask a community of lovely people their advice/personal experience/opinions perhaps it will help set my head straight, and help me better understand the way I'm feeling.


I'm 22, born male, but recently I've come to a bit of self realisation that I could be transgender.  
I've been struggling with depression (and other health issues) for most of my later teenage years and again more recently as my health has slowly declined from a disease that I suffer from. I'm currently on anti-depressants for my depression and it did help lift my mood and overall well being, but these last few weeks even though I was sure to never miss taking it, I just felt terrible about everything, overall emotionally numb and I couldn't figure out why.  
I talked with my girlfriend about the way I was feeling and it helped a little, however she's not brilliant with what to say, but she did her best to comfort me and make me feel loved/wanted etc, and I thank her for that.


In the lead up to those few weeks I shifted my time from gaming to watching a whole lot of YouTube, and seeing as I currently don't work, I'm sure you can imagine how much time went in to watching videos. Along the way I stumbled across a video by Stef Sanjati titled [""I'm Transgender""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ynvhmk_zgA), in which she talks about how she was uncomfortable with facial hair, and how she hated seeing herself in clothes ""like that"" but liked the way they looked on other people, and how she always used to be questioning what wasn't matching or lining up, yet she didn't quite see it as ""matching or lining up"" but rather she just felt confused.


I had started watching the video simply out of curiosity yet hearing those things put into words sparked something in me, like it clicked, if you will.  
I watched the video a few more times over the next few days, a couple of which I doubted myself as if ""No, I can't be Trans, don't be silly. You're a boy"". But during that time I did more research and read other peoples threads on this subreddit and around the web, to find some of the things I was reading and hearing made sense to me, in an odd sort of way I don't know how to describe.


I have always been uncomfortable with my facial hair and male characteristic body hair (Luckily I'm not that hairy anyway), which seems to be a common thing among trans women. I recall frequently looking at myself in the mirror and not understanding why I didn't like who/what I saw, both with and without clothes on. Particularly looking at my butt (is that something guys even do?) and being almost disgusted at the hair on the backs of my legs and bum, but I generally just shrugged off the feelings.  
I also never understood how clothes made people feel good about themselves. I've always just thought clothes as just a piece of cloth to cover yourself with.  
However through highschool I would find myself asking ""I wonder what it's like to be a girl?"", and imaging I had boobs, even as far as wearing a bra under a T-shirt, probably a little more frequently than your typical male (maybe?). And if I had that thought while in the shower or had a lack of clothes I would find myself hiding my bits and ""posing"", only to quickly be met with the thought ""Guys don't do that"". 


I also frequently have to be consciously checking my body language as I've been caught out several times crossing my legs ""incorrectly"" for a male, and placing my hand/s on my hip/s, to be told ""Guys don't do that"" or some response of similarity. Now I know I have a fairly feminine physique, and I've been commented on a few times for my wide hips and thin wrists mostly. But is this checking of body language normal?


This next bit is going to be a bit sexual, but it need be mentioned, I guess.  
I've explored my sexuality a decent bit, there was a point where I thought myself Bi as I find myself getting aroused when exposed to sexual material focused around the penis, and I would frequently think of myself being the female (or at least more so in the last year as I used to steer clear of material like that because (excuse the slur) ""that's gay"". But further exploring that I couldn't bring myself to meet up with a guy, as after exchanging photos and such, their body hair was such a huge turn off for me.  I also tend to find myself become more aroused while reading written sexual material, again, I end up focusing towards being the female.
I also have a bit of a thing for anal, giving and receiving, and if I am watching something of that nature, rather than watching it, I find myself imagining it, as if I was the female.  Am I the only one?


After doing the research mentioned above I decided I would try a few of the things recommended by people to try help yourself understand how you feel, such as shaving, cross-dressing, painting nails etc
At first I tried a few of my girlfriends clothes on and it felt a little weird the first time and the usual ""Guys don't do that"" came into my head. A few days later I decided I would shave the upper part of my thighs, and **oh my gosh**, I felt so happy. I don't know how to describe it other than it made me really happy to get rid of all that hair. The next day I shaved the rest of my legs (of which it took me almost forever) and I loved the feeling, but I was also feeling as if they weren't my legs, like I couldn't believe that they were actually mine (That's perhaps how best to describe it). Has anyone experienced this before?


It's been a couple days since then and I've since played with a little bit of make up of which I quite enjoyed applying myself, and it made me happy to see myself with it on. Even though it was a very simplistic look, as my girlfriend wears very little (she's a little bit of a tomboy ;P). I also applied some nail polish to my toes (I've never particularly liked my toes) and yet I quite enjoyed looking at my legs and feet after a fresh shave in the shower, and the polish on.  
But even after all of this, and the happy feelings I've had, I can't help but have feelings of doubt. Is that normal? Is there something I can try do to make myself more sure?  I suppose I could be doubting as I haven't really tried my best to make myself ""pass"". Would that help if I did?


And sorry if this is a mess, I very rarely actually make threads/comments on reddit.  
So if you've managed to read this far, thank you.  
If you can relate to any of it, or have any input or questions for me please feel free. Thanks!"
Beatlegirl65,asktransgender,I don't think I can do it anymore,"First off, this is NOT a suicide post, this is an ""I don't think I can transition post.""

First off, I am afraid of all the relationships I'm destroying or hurting. My dad and I are very distant, my mom had to quit her job because she can't handle the stress of the whole thing, and my grandma is in therapy because she is having a hard time with it as well. I feel like I'm distancing so many people that I really want in my life.

Second, this is monetarily costing me a shit ton of money.  I'm working 2 jobs (3rd coming soon) and I'm selling my HUGE transformers collection simply to afford this. And even after all of that it still doesn't feel like enough. I honestly feel like I cannot afford to transition.

Third, I greatly miss my ex fiance. We were more in love that I thought I could possibly be, and I'm not saying that to sound sappy, I'm saying that because it's genuine. the final year of our relationship we were having many many problems, and that's because I was really starting to feel like a woman. We still talk because we're friends but the amount that I miss her is so unreal its sickening.

Fourth, my feelings (or lack there of). I have been gun-ho about transitioning since October when I came out to everyone, then 2 days ago, those feelings just magically vanished. But I feel like that vanishing has been a long time coming. I haven't been on pinterest in forever, I have no desire to go to the mall, I rarely practice my voice, I don't eat like I want to to try and keep my body in shape for my transition (I'm not in bad shape, I just don't have any motivation to do more).

I am 100% seriously considering not transitioning. And the thing that REALLY throws me for a loop is that I was never unhappy being a boy. I enjoyed my life as a boy and never ever had a problem with it, I just like feminine things every now and again. I don't even really have dysphoria. I like to shave my face and the extent of my dysphoria is me feeling my penis against my pants and going ""ugh, women don't have that.""

Thoughts please?"
Lizasaurus2,asktransgender,Do I have hips or am I just fat? Or both?,"Hey folks! So out of curiosity I put my measurements into a couple of those body type calculators for a giggle. Pretty much all of them said I have a pear shaped body, which I find strange. I would have thought very few trans women have a pear body type because we generally have larger shoulders and ribcages and smaller hips.

Maybe it's my belly, I've gained a bit of weight recently :/. Anyway, I thought I'd upload a [picture](http://imgur.com/wYp0cG0) to see what you guys think. I don't usually upload pictures of my body like this because I'm overweight and I have bad stretch marks :/. I really want to hear what you guys think though and talking about my body will probably make me feel a bit better about it.

Thanks in advance!

Rhyanon,asktransgender,What actually happens in gender therapy?,"Due to being in the UK I have to wait like minimum 11 months for a gender therapist appointment at the GIC, unless I pay to go private, out of pocket, which considering im 1400 into a 1500 OD, isn't gonna happen. So after lots of experimentation with public presentation, pronouns, name, and coming out to people, lots of introspection and basically seeing how it feels, im pretty sure that im a girl, and as soon as my GP sorts my blood tests, I shall be DIY'ing. 

Naturally I have had moments of apprehension re: starting HRT without prior therapy, bc that's obviously what you're kind of meant to do in most cases. This, for me, begs the question: what actually happens in gender therapy? What do they talk to you about? Is it a lot like the youtube videos that have the various trans thought experiments (e.g. ""imagine if you had a button that could turn you into a girl/boy"" etc) but with more interactivity and guided introspection? Do these therapists have jedi mind tricks that allow them to deduce whether you're trans or not? I'm genuinely curious! 

And I'm not necessarily looking for UK specific anecdotes, though if anyone can tell me what I can expect when I finally get to Daventry, that would be lovely.

LisaLies,asktransgender,How did you change your name at work?,"I'm starting in a new department in a month, and I'm thinking about introducing myself to my colleagues as my preferred name. I'll have the same managers, so I'll probably give them the heads up.

SummerBun,asktransgender,Resources and preparation for coming out &amp; to those you know won't accept?,"Hello there. For context i am 28, MtF. Mostly independent of family (save for relying on father for car maintenance). I'll be graduating with an assoc in comp sci/ software engineering soon, and i have a good amount of supportive friends where i live (~Cleveland, OH)

I've had it with being closeted anymore, and life is short, so i'm finally going to do it. Not knowing where i stand with people is harming more than anything at this point.

I have a good idea who will accept me and who won't. I don't feel much towards extended family, so accept or not, it doesn't worry too much. My Mother already knows and accepts me, but my father will not, and i already know this. When i came out as 'a gay male', he was close to disowning me officially, and while we're somehow on good terms, the only reason for that, i feel, is that he can ignore that part of me. 

Anyway, i would appreciate if anyone has any advice, heads-ups, resources, etc, it would be appreciated."
DeadInside1993,asktransgender,"I'm lost in this world and I need some help, or advice on my situation. Anything is appreciated.","Hello everyone, this is my first post here and obviously a throwaway. I'm having issues that I have nobody but the Internet to talk to about. I'm not sure whether I'm trans or not. Sorry, this is going to be a bit of a wall of text. 

So a little bit about me, I'm 22, 6'3"", 315lbs. I have a very masculine face, facial hair, and overall a ""manly man"" appearance. I've had undiagnosed depression and anxiety for many years now, and in all reality it's kinda swayed me to my thoughts now. 

I personally feel like my mind is that of a Female. When I'm playing games and such where people don't have to see me or hear me, I present as Female. All of my online characters especially RP characters are all Female. My body though is that of a man. Beer gut, beard, and just overall unhealthy. I just don't feel like me in my body. 

I've had 2 girlfriends over my life, and nothing more. At the time they made me feel good, but also jealous that I couldn't be them. 

I wouldn't be able to transition right away because I want to lose weight first and I'm going to have to find a new job because right now I work at a car dealership full of homophobic and transphobic people. So transitioning while I work there is a bad idea simply because I need the money to live off. I also have no motivation to lose weight right now because of that. I feel like if I put in the hard work that nothing will pay off in the end because I can't transition. 

My family would be another huge hurdle. My mother I feel would be reluctant, but accepting. My father on the other hand I know is a HUGE homophobe/transphobe. My brother I'm not sure how he would feel honestly. I've not told any real life friends, nor online friends except 1. 

I also have no way of moving out right now because I'm in so much debt I can't afford to leave my job/house. Therapy is also kinda a far reach now too for the same reason. I could probably swing an appointment here and there, but not many. 

Sorry for the wall but I just need help. I don't know what to do. I'm depressed because I can't live as a female, but I can't live as a female because of my situation. Anyone have any advice on what I should do, or how I should approach this? 

Please feel free to PM me or ask any questions, I will do my best to answer. "

There's only one thing I'm not sure about and its kind of different since I've never heard of it talking about before but I don't have facial hair dysphoria at all. Like I really like my beard? It's weird cuz I will dress up and put on my makeup but not touch my facial hair. I think it looks pretty cool.

Anyways I was just wondering if that means I'm not really trans? I'm kinda confused but still want to take HRT anyway since it kinda turns me on. Will I get stares if I go out presenting with my beard? I don't want to get beat up.

SecretOfficerNeko,asktransgender,Cheapest places to get endocrinology done?,"Good day to you all,

I know that it isn't entirely necessary, but I'd really like it if I could have an endocrinologist, and proper bloodwork being to, to help me get the best possible results and feminization from my hormone therapy. 

However, coming out to my parents essentially backfired. It has become apparent to me that I'll more than likely have to transition on my own, and I don't have too much in the way of money. What are some good places or organisations to look for to get the treatment I need to transition successfully, while not going bankrupt in the process?"

I feel like my life is just passing me by as i am not living it as a woman. I get so upset because if i go out as a guy (i have to sometimes because things are still in my birth name) i don't like it because i want to addresed by female pronouns as i prefer those.
And if i go out as a girl i get clocked. I cannot win either way. I look at people on the street men and women and i get jealous of them because i cannot go out without being clocked and like i said the only thing that keeps me going is that one day i will be accepted/look/be treated like any other woman.

Trel1655,asktransgender,Need advice in current relationship with my trans boyfriend.,"Hi all, thanks so much for reading.

I am a cis woman currently dating a FTM man. I've identified as bisexual in the past but had a hard time acknowledging the side of me that wants to date women and mostly just had a few flings with them. 

Since being with him though, I've found that I really don't miss cis male penis. I'd be happy the rest of my life never being sexually involved with one. He is on T but hasn't had any surgeries and isn't planning on anything in the near future. 

I enjoy being with him and I can't complain about our current relationship. However, I feel like I'm being dishonest with him. I like the fact that he doesn't have a cis penis. I'm not saying I'd like to end the relationship, I just don't want to hurt him, and I'm not sure how to bring this all up with him without being hurtful.

I guess I'm posting this to see if anyone has had any similar experiences or advice. I know I need to talk with him soon and nobody here can tell me what to say, but any conversation on this would be helpful. Thanks so much for reading."

We worked out that it comes down to me thinking of transition as a choice. That I think being a woman is a choice, not just who I am. Now logically, that's not what I believe. We are who we are. But feeling wise, I still feel like it's a choice to transition, not a necessity (and I should know better, I already tried to not transition and it was not a good choice).

How did you or how are you getting past the ""it's a choice"" issue? Like I said, logically, I don't really think it's a choice, but I still seem to ""feel"" it is, and I'm not really sure how to move past that.

I am 19 years old and I have been living as genderqueer for I'd say the past 7 or 8 months. I am AFAB, but I definitely do not identify at all with female anything. I don't really pass as female or male, which makes me feel better than being perceived as female I guess. I guess what I'm trying to get at was that this was okay for a while. Being gender neutral was really okay for a long time. But I've recently got this itching feeling that it's ""not enough"" (not saying that anyone is ""not trans enough"", this is just how I feel about myself). I think it was a step away from femininity and that felt so good. I don't know what's holding me back from accepting myself as a trans person but it's really affecting every part of my life.

Undead_Bill,asktransgender,Can someone help explain dysphoria please?,"So I've been questioning my gender since early January, and (thanks in no small part to you lovely people on this sub!) at this point I'm reasonably sure I'm a trans girl. 

Thing is, I still have a lot of doubt based on dysphoria or rather lack of it. From what I understand dysphoria involves discomfort or dislike of ones physical male/female traits. I don't feel particularly negative about my body as an AMAB (though I definitely don't feel positive about my body either) and I worry that means I could be wrong about my identity as a trans girl. 

Is it possible I simply have the wrong idea about dysphoria and it can manifest more subtly than ""I hate my male body""? Any advice is really appreciated!"
MightBeMTF,asktransgender,"[update] ""How do I tell my sister?""","Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/45wy0z/how_do_i_tell_my_sister/

tl;dr I did it kinda by accident then my parents broke most of the news then we laughed about it for a bit and now everything is lovely.

I will not go over the specifics of how I told her and our conversation, because that would be unfair to her I feel, and potentially compromising to my and her privacy. But afterwards we spoke about a few things and we made some jokes and things. She has seen me presenting female now and said it is nice. She says she can give me advice on where to buy things like makeup properly next time she is home again. We spoke a little about my own self doubt and I asked her if she remembered me dressing when I was young, because I was afraid that I had fabricated the memories of doing so, but she told me they were entirely real. I no longer have any doubt not because dressing when one is young makes someone trans obvs but rather that before I was afraid I was convincing myself I was trans by making things up and now I know I made up nothing, I would be just as sure if no such memories existed at all as I would not suspect my trying to influence myself, if that makes sense.

Even past this, I still present male most of the time and when I present female I am only relatively rarely gendered as such by my parents, such is age and new-ness of things, though they are entirely lovely and trying their best. The dysphoria is ultimately no better, and if anything worse for the amount of time I have been aware of it, past 6 months now. But I just recently got my appointment at the under 18 UK GIC so hopefully I should be on blockers before 2017 and before I'm 18, though NHS, so no guarantees I guess.

But in any case, I feel I have progressed, in no small part thanks to this sub, btw.

Batsy22,asktransgender,Need some statistics on trans mental health,"Hey everyone,

I'm writing an article about trans mental health so if anyone has some statistics on how trans people experience higher rates of depression and anxiety. I have the study that says 41% of trans people attempt suicide but that's it. "
alyzb,asktransgender,Trans PSA: Grow your support network,"Hi everyone. 

I had a small epiphany last night that helped me to realize how essential this piece is to good mental health as a trans person. I feel a lot of times we hear the same things over and over so much that they become meaningless cliches, and we can forget just how important they are and just how much of an effect they have. 

So I wanted to discuss the idea of a support network and remind *everyone* to put some work into growing yours. It's never a bad idea.

There are many benefits to doing so, here are some I can think of to discuss right off the bat. Itd be cool if anyone wants to add to this list!

* Safe spaces: as trans people, we just don't have a lot of these. A safe space isnt just a place you go where you're safe from violence. It's a space where you can be yourself without criticism, negativity, judgments, microaggressions, and invalidation. Your friends, family, partners, etc, by virtue of being part of your support network, can instantly transform a space into a safe space for you. This is so important because for some of it, every space we frequent is hostile to our very existence.

* Validation: This is the one that really hit me last night. I stopped and realized that I just dont doubt my identity near as much as I used to. This is for a number of reasons but a major help has been my support network. Im talking people that actually *support*, not just tolerate us. I can spend days around friends and loved ones who don't misgender or judge me. They treat me as any other girl, and its auch a healthy mindset for me to live in. To them, my gender is as concrete as it is bullshit for those who hate me. Its astounding how much of a negative affect bigots and intolerant and ignorant people can alter our self perception even when we are strong. The flipside is the effect a strong support group has on bolstering self esteem and self perception. Its wonderful.

* Sharing: Having enough people to spread the support around is also good. No one person has to deal with the day in and day out of our sometimes very rough existences. That means each person we share with is better equipped to help and support, and that we can keep all of our relationships on good footing. 

Those are just some of the benefits Ive experienced, and without them, I would likely be in a very bad place.

So start working on this now. Get out there and make good friends. Like anything else, people are a numbers game. There are a lot of shitty people out there, good ones sometimes take work to find, and good relationships take effort to build. Find support groups, trans meetings and meetups, search for interest groups in your hobbies that tend to attract a more open and loving crowd, meet people in onoine communities, reach out to people on this board. 

Hopefully this helps at least one person, then this post will be worth it. "

BrienneEU,asktransgender,Is anyone available to help with my Transition Communication Plan for work?,"So, the background.  I am a ""VP"" for start-up firm. We have total 7 employees, with an additional one in the hiring stages. We currently have over 2 dozen clients, some of whom I am the Client Manager on the contract, and some of which I just assist on particularly deliverables for the contract.

My CEO knows that I am transitioning, and he has asked that I develop, with our Dir of Communications, a communication plan and timeline to: communicate to employees; communicate to clients and prospective clients; communicate on the website.

The communication plan to employees is easy enough, I believe. Our NDP covers gender identity and expression, and we have a small enough team that we will have a staff meeting, and I will come out to them, answer a few questions and we will offer to have a training specialist to come to the office for a workshop (without me) so they can ask questions in an open-environment.

kiewtycreamy,asktransgender,Is this relatively normal ?,I've been in hormones for 2 mnths and some days. 3 months on the 23 of Feb. I went for a follow up today and was told to split my 2 mg twice a day estradiol down to 1 mg twice a day bc my estrogen was at 1600. I don't know the measurement but he said over 1000 is risky for clots. Fwiw I had high estrogen before I even started hrt. I'm also on 100 MG spiro twice a day. i'm like afraid of having a low dose so �� help!

Amberglas,asktransgender,"Some questions-- I think I might be FtM, not sure?","Hi everyone!

I've been questioning lately-- I mean, I've never really been comfortable dressing femme, etc, but I was dealing with different mental health issues prior to moving away to college last year.  I've only recently begun to seriously consider the fact that I might be some flavor of genderqueer.

I've noticed a lot of things that seem to be pretty clear signs (I like wearing tight sports bras and get very uncomfortable if I think about my uterus.  Dysphoria, I think?)  But I also don't have strong feelings about pronouns and don't know that I would be any more comfortable in a male body.

I guess what I want to ask is-- did you have a lot of uncertainty about being transgender?  And what covert / easily reversible steps can I take to get more certainty as to whether I'm FtM?  Unfortunately, there are a few people pretty close to me that I definitely don't want to let know that I'm questioning, but I'm looking into buying proper chest binders and will probably be getting more male clothing.

Also, silly science question-- I have a pretty deep voice.  For reference, I can pretty comfortably sing most tenor parts.  I've read that more testosterone, developmentally, can lead to being trans; do you know whether that could be an indicator?

Thanks so much.  &lt;3"
BellaEllaElla,asktransgender,Why do people want to live? What drives us as a species (or any species for that matter)?,"


My depression and evaporated for two months, and has come back hard yet again. I feel like I keep spiraling down down and down. Last time my depression came back, I was burned out and thought that I couldn't go on much longer, but I persisted.

My religion has been shielding me from killing myself (it is a big sin in my religion and it has prevented me from doing anything). I have taken religion out of the equation

My family and loved ones have been preventing me from killing myself, I have distanced myself from them

What’s stopping me from killing myself?

I haven't started hormones yet, I really want to and hope I can soon. (Hopefully will get the prescription in the next week and a half, hopefully). 

Is it weird that I don't see a future? Like literally nothing. No plans past graduating, no plans with transitioning. Just doing.

Am I the only only one?

I know I probably come off as suicidal, and I won't lie, those thoughts are constantly on my mind. I keep trying to suppress them only to be overwhelmed by the thoughts of it. I'm trying to keep pressing on, but it's really hard.

Why do we live? What drives us to keep putting up with so much shit only to get shit on some more? It's exhausting and I don't know how much longer I can keep pushing on."
hiding_from_me,asktransgender,Journaling? Does it help you? Here's what happening in my head.,"Hello everyone! This is more of a get it out kind of post, and just want to see what everyone thinks of kinda situation.

So recently I came out to my wife, before I was ready. She found a letter I wrote to myself (she found it in my email, she wasn't snooping just looking for something else, anyways). I had planned on talking to a therapist and seeing where it lead before I said anything to my lady. So there is that. (already did a post on it)

I've been writing a lot lately, pages per day. All thoughts on gender, anxiety and other goings on. But it's predominately about me questioning my gender and who I am as a person. The gender part is what scares me the most. Everyday at work I have these thoughts. I see all kinds of different girls and styles, and it just makes my head spin. Parts of me wishes I was them, just being female and being a woman. Then there are other parts of me that enjoy being a male and a man. 

Reading about genders I'm starting to fall to the genderqueer ideal. Being able to switch/flow back and forth, and be able to enjoy both sides. I've been reading about low does HRT as well and that interests me, not full transition but partial. Would that even be possible? Is that I door I want to open? 

Have another appointment with my therapist this week and will bring this all up. Just curious on if anyone else feels or felt the same at one time. "
LizzieIsTheAftermath,asktransgender,Do I Have OCD Or Am I Transgender?,"I sometimes feel like i have OVD instead of being transgender. I will list the reasons why i think i am trans and why i think i have OCD. I will also list why i think i am not trans.



Reasons why i think i have OCD: 

1. Sometimes i check doors two or three times before i walk away, but then other times i don't.
2. I repeat things every night. Because i can't sleep, i go on reddit everynight browse look at questions and ask questions on different forums.

Reasons why i think i am transgender:

1. I would rather have been a girl at birth.
2. I don't like mens clothing (i just prefer to be able to wear low cut tops and show off my body as i feel better this way) and i live as a woman and surly if i was cis it would make me feel uncomfortable.
3. I prefer being percived as a woman.
4. I would prefer to have breasts and a vagina (but i don't mind what i have now at all)


Why i think i am not transgender:

1. Severe anxiety and depression runs in my family and i have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression disorder. So in my head i feel i have just created this idea that if i transition everything will be fine.
2. I didn't ever 'figure out i was trans' until i was 16. And even then when i started on going out i got an awful lot of attention and i loved it. And i thought, oh i am not trans i just like the attention. So it got me thinking."

As much as you can throw around catchphrases such as ""they weren't your real friends if they cant support you through it"". It echoes some truth yes, but people are people and are afraid of things they cannot understand by default. It doesn't make them shitty friends.

I'm scared of this: My friends and family are not assholes. They will accept whatever i choose to do. But i fear the acceptance will only run skin deep. An outward display of approval whilst oozing distrust/awkwardness/standoffishness. The culture i live in is not sufficiently socially advanced to support a bombshell like this. 

Now, i'm fully aware of how unanswerable this question is, all im asking for is insight. Is the disphoria worth putting up with in the long run to avoid becoming a social pariah? Are my fears misplaced in your experience? Will i even give a shit about any of this when i'm comfortable in my skin?

I've been waiting for a while to see any progress, and it appears it is moving on (She's in the bargaining stage of grief, asking for me to talk to a gender psychologist, as well as seeing a seperate psychologist for my aspergers), but the thing is, even though I'm confident with how I identify and feel depressed with being a male, I'm hesitant that having a mental disorder will be enough reason for me to be refused to transition. I'm scared of this because no matter what I say my mother still strongly blames it on me possibly having aspergers and still doesn't seem comfortable with me being a girl.

Do you know if having autism is a valid reason I can be refused treatment? Also, do any of you think having disorders that effects your view on gender may effect your identity, or is there a different biological explanation?"

My best friend came out to my wife and I a month ago as having gender dysphoria and is transitioning to being a woman.  We've been friends since high school in the late '90s... I had *NO* idea!  We're totally cool with it, we still hang out frequently, and she's now a woman all the time except for in the office.  

I find it incredly fascinating but I'm trying to keep my curiosity at bay.  She's not a science experiment; she's my friend.  This question has been floating around my head for a few days now.  About the only thing I could find on the web was that post I linked above... which pretty much said 'depends on how she feels about it'.  Needless to say; didn't really quell my curiosity.  

I keep telling myself it doesn't *REALLY* matter, it's maybe even rude to ask, but for some reason I keep thinking about it.  

Is this just some part of my psyche coming to grips with this?  Is it my inner, nosy, bigot trying to rear it's ugly head?  

EDIT: TO CLARIFY MY QUESTION

I should have been more clear.... when she fully transitions is she still transgender? I mean would she then be ... a woman? Or a transgender woman?

footworshipper,asktransgender,I'm not really sure what's going on... (MtF),"I started questioning my gender fairly recently, and began going to a gender therapist in the hopes of figuring all of this out. 

I have been dressing on and off for about a year now, but since New Years, I've come home from work every day and immediately gotten into girl mode (I'm MtF). Typically it's just putting on panties, yoga pants, my breast forms, and a tank to, nothing too fancy. 

But, I noticed that when I started questioning everything, my libido died. I mean, I had the occasional sexual thought and urge, but I just stopped acting on them. I stopped masturbating, watching porn, everything. But, after about a month, my libido returned, and I've fallen back into my old habits...

Except one: I do not want to have sex anymore. I had a FWB situation going on before everything happened, but even at that point, I just wasn't into it anymore. At first I thought it was a lack of kink in the bedroom, since vanilla sex can bore me. But... I no longer want to have any type of sexual relations with another person. I'm still attracted to people, but once the thought of having to explain to someone that I'm MtF or going to therapy for it, I just... lose all interest? I'm having some difficulty putting this into words, but I feel like it comes down to this: I no longer want to have sex as a man. It just doesn't feel right anymore, and I don't understand why. 

Has anyone else gone through this? Would you be willing to share what it was like for you? Is this normal? Is my body trying to tell me something? I just don't get it..."

So, what I did was just start referring to myself using masculine terms. For a little while. 

You see, what happened to me was that I would constantly FUCK UP MY OWN PRONOUNS. I would say things along the lines ""I'm not that type of **girl**"" or ""I'm a **girl** who..."" shit like that. 

And it confuses the fuck out of me. I'm pre-everything (actually going in for my first hormone blood check thing tomorrow) and when I betray myself it makes me have doubts that I'm doing the wrong thing. I even tried to look up trans-regret stories to psych myself out. 

Can my misgendering of myself be my self-conscious trying to tell me I'm making a mistake? Or does this happen to you guys too and I'm just overthinking it?

Beastachu,asktransgender,Questions about birth status in remembrance,"A friend of a friend died last year. His name was Blake Brockington, and from I've heard he was pretty great. A few of his friends got together and made a wikipedia entry in regards to his life and death, and it's pretty awe inspiring. You can read the wiki entry here &gt;&gt;&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Blake_Brockington

The question I have involves the sidebar involving his name at birth. My friend is bent out of shape because they included his birth name under the ""born"" subject, although he is never referred to as such throughout the article. She refers to this as ""bullying"" of the trans community, and that this tarnishes his name just by recognizing that at some point in his life, he was named LaShonda.

This bothers me a great deal, as I view the birth name to be equally as important to the history and character of a trans. While I appreciate, and to degrees can relate to, the idea of embracing a new identity and a stronger representation of one's self (perhaps that's worded sloppily), I think it is offensive to attempt to unwrite a part of the person's life, even if they didn't identify to that part of their life. It's a representation of the struggles and the strength that made them who they became. They were in transition, it's not a be-all end-all to everything the person accomplished or was. As my ex-girlfriend used to say ""I am not Brandon, at least not anymore"". It is of my understanding that someone in transition isn't trying to erase something, but rather correct it to what feels the most natural for them as a human being.

But, perhaps I may be pigheaded. I just don't understand the significance of trying to eradicate something Blake had no control over. What are your thoughts? Is recognizing the birth name of a person as far as historically a transgression against your transition?

Idon7be1ong,asktransgender,How has gender dysphoria presented itself throughout your life?,"Trying to think about this in a differentway and this helped me to do that.

0-5: not aware enough to really understand what was going on.  Just lived life and didnt care, like most kids.

5-9: Didn't really pay much attention to it.  When there were things that guys and girls did differently I always wanted to be with the girls, but was afraid i would be made fun of so i generally stayed neutral.  There are some other things of course, but that is the jist of it.

9-13: Discovered I was trans, this is also around the same time i was allowed to be home alone.  I didn't quite understand what was going on but i knew what i wanted.  I would wish i could be a girl, and when that didn't work i decided that wishing i could transfer my soul with another girl would be more likely to occur.  I started to cross dress at 9.

13-20:  I discovered how to please myself, and my crossdressing quickly devolved into something like a fetish.  I still wanted to be female, but it was easier to forget about after i had masturbated.  As i approached 20 i started to give up cross dressing because it lost its appeal.  It actually started to make my dysphoria increase because it started to take more effort to pass.

20-24:  Gave up on transitioning, felt dead inside.  Somehow managed to make it through college.  Started doing better when i stopped trying to hide it.

24-present: Realized this is not going away.  Tried to start HRT on my own.  Rsn into dome difficulties with that and started to see a therapist.  Dysphoria is at its worst now.  Before it was all something i could do if it had to come to it.  Now i realize that i need to do something, but feel like i should have done it earlier.

I'm still waiting on some data, but I found something a bit wierd. By reigon, the American Midwest is the second or third biggest supporter of trans women using the women's restroom. However it is the strongest reigon against trans men using the men's restroom. I have no idea why. No other reigon splits like this. 

Do any of you, particularly in the Midwest have any ideas or insight about this? I'm really confused."
Lorie_love,asktransgender,What are the best known tricks to cope with dysphoria when transitioning is not an option ?,"Well, for now, it's not an option for me, and I see no turning point where it could reasonably change (although it's not impossible that it could), but that's not the point here.

What are the best ways to cope with these near to constant depressing thoughts and this feeling of dying day after day ? I know the only good answer is to transition, but maybe there are other much less efficient alternatives ? It's getting hard to have a hobby or something as everything seems to have lost any interest. I feel apathy (apart from reading this sub :-/ ).
Thanks !

homelessapathy,asktransgender,TL;DR: Help with a feminine name?,"Basically, my only preferences as far as pronouns go is that I don't want to be introduced as male when I'm obviously portraying as the opposite. Aside from just being uncomfortable with he/him and what naturally comes with that. 

I guess why I'm here is because I'm about to be in a series of situations where my name will be announced in front of a lot of people while I'm going to have curled hair, a dress and 6 tons of makeup on.

 In these situations I'll be standing next to a girl who's barley 5' while I'm about 5'10, or two heads taller, so when a generally female name and a generally male name is announced people will probably just assume that the super tall one is actually a male despite looking as I will. 

So in an effort to avoid several people thinking ""why's that boy in a dress?"" I'm thinking of asking the people that can probably help to have me announced under a different name. My issue being I have no Idea what I'd want to be called. I've talked to some friends but the only names I kinda like are names of people I've met through this program and it just seems weird to me, or the name of someone that's hated amongst the people this name would be for. 

So I guess my question would be how have you picked a name you're comfortable with or If I could just have a bunch of people that don't know me look at a picture of me and say what[name wise I guess] I look like?"
maybeayri,asktransgender,My mom thinks this whole transgender thing is just me looking for a group to belong to. How do I assure her otherwise?,"It's not like her believing this will stop anything from actually happening, but it's a frustratingly consistent theme with her every time we discuss it. It's usually phrased something like this:

*""Corey, I think you were looking for a place to belong and found just enough in common with these very accepting people. I know you've felt out of place almost your entire life. I know all sorts of people, even transgender people, and they usually fit the story. You do not.""*

This is almost always followed by the typical *""you never showed any signs""* and *""I think you'd be throwing away things important to you, like having a family in the future""*. We're usually pretty open and easy going with each other (aside from the usual parent-child spats every so often) so not being able to really discuss this with her kind of hurts. I want her to understand why I'm seeking this out, that I feel it's correct for me on a fundamental level, and I'm not leaping into this blindfolded but every time I try to explain it all to her, she just repeats the above. I'm just not sure what to do about this. She's known for over two years now and I'm just now getting to the point where I can afford and am willing to talk to a therapist about it to get started.

I'm hoping I don't need to basically force the issue for her to start actually thinking it's real and worth her actually realizing this is more than a flash in the pan, but I'm afraid that will be the case.

Has anyone else ever run into this specific kind of argument - ""I think you're just wanting to belong to some group and these transgender people are fit just enough but you're not really one of them""? "

itsmecara,asktransgender,Sexual orientation questions relevance for medical transition....,"C/p from my Facebook

I've had two consults/dr visit who've asked about my sexual orientation(not in a gate keeper way). I kinda don't see the relevance, and maybe it just sticks out to me because I kind of lean asexual if anything and explaining this takes a lot longer than explaining wanting to transition.

FjornLux,asktransgender,I don't know what to say to my family about my ex-fiancée (MTF),"Hello everyone! I am a straight male guy with no hate on LGBT, friendly, peace and an ally. &lt;3
I learned about the MTF and FTM through my ex-fiancée (she is MTF) I really don't know if it's rude to call those words and I am sorry... 
I don't mean to offend people like this... The reason why I puted ""ex"" is because we both had so many problems in the past (long distance relationship) yet we care about each other and I want to fix those problems immediately.
My biggest issue is here: 
I am as a religion Orthodox. My whole family are sometimes strict about it but are only thinking with the ""Male and Female marriage"" thingy.
Like I said, I have really no hate on LGBT community, I've been for so long with my ex-fiancée that I really don't have a problem with that and when the times come, I want to introduce my girl to my family but the problem is... I'm afraid to make her more sad because of her situation that she is transitioning and she is not ready yet... my family were always wondering how your girl looks like? Why don't you show her? Do you even have a girlfriend?
Only my mom know how she looks like and she sees her as a girl which I and her found that really positive and good feeling, but unfortunately she passed away 3 years ago...
I don't know what to do.. at some point I have to show them but in the same time I don't want to make her sad... I am very lost. :(

CharlotteAurora,asktransgender,All-consuming self-hatred and doubt,"Quick summary of myself. 27 y/o AMAB. Thoughts of being trans appeared around 14-15. On and off-denial phases. Crossdressing and experimenting with my sexuality continues. At 22 denial drives me into hyper masculinity (i go from 60kg to 120kg raw muscles, steroids and everything) and I genuinely enjoyed life, for the first time ever it felt like. But the thoughts of ""this is the wrong way to go"" still showed up in short periods. Twice I tried ""stopping"" the macho-phase and considered getting help about the trans-thoughts. But I didn't manage to get help untill summer 2015. I then stopped all the macho-things and started my transition. Lots 35kgs so far, and started hormones in january (5 weeks now). I grew my hair out and all that jazz. Still presenting male.

Now, on to the point. I fucking hate myself. My self-esteem is non-existant. I don't think I'll ever be a ""pretty woman"" to outweigh what i'm ""throwing away"" (in a society where looking good is important, most my friends are 8+/10s easily and I'd call myself the same when I was in macho-phase). I've had two sessions of laser on my face. 4 months ago, I was happy I was finally moving forward with this. But to this day, when it's all become real. I really doubt myself. I just miss my old life. I miss feeling confident. I miss my beard (i'll never have it back and ... as stupid as it sounds it makes me want to kill myself for having laser). I miss my muscles and I really wish I never told anyone anything about any of this. Am I a narcissist? Possibly. But I never felt attracted to myself, neither as full macho guy-mode nor when dressing girl-mode in earlier years. It's just about feeling well, being able to actually look at yourself in the mirror without disgust.

Has anyone been in a similiar situation?
Most people say transitioning is hard - but I sincerely doubt that my doubts and regrets will go away in time even if I go through with it.

I've drawn a flowchart for de-transitioning vs continuing and I'm weighing pros and cons, I will show it to one of my therapists tomorrow and another one on friday. Hopefully this will help me clear my thoughts up a bit. But to this day I just really wish I'd not wake up when I go to sleep tonight. Halp."
bluehat3,asktransgender,Trying to figure out if if my trans feelings are just a sexual kink or something more. [slight NSFW],"Im sorry if this is just a kinda of a mess of thoughts I just really have trouble correctly expressing my feelings in words sometimes.

Ever since puberty, ive had a thing for crossdressing. It was just a sexual thing but when I dressed or was in the frame of mind I have more of a gay orientation, I imagined I was the girl in a m-f encounter and enjoyed the fact that the the idea (and later the act) of being with a guy made me feel feminine. Outside of that I have mostly straight orientation. This was kinda confusing for me but is was fine for a couple years. The more and more I was exploring and experiences crossdressing the more and more I enjoyed it and wanted to try to be passable. A couple days in recent months Ive dressed up and just hung out at home and did nothing sexual at all, which was a first for me and it just really made me feel good. Happy really isnt the right word for it more of a just pleasant feeling.

Im just trying to make sense of all of this, its really confusing to me. Ive always thought crossdressing and feeling feminine was just a sexual kink for me and I was some form of bi-sexual. However, Im getting to the point where I just would rather dress and have my body more feminine. Its not an overwhelming or burning desire but its definitely become the preferred choice over masculine things. I was even trying to plan out a trip to another city (after I wrangle the wild west that is make up) where I could try to spend a couple days trying to pass as a female in public. 

I was wondering if anyone else who has gone through something like this could help me make sense of my feelings. Im not sure if im slowing become/embracing a new me that is trans or just that its some new hobby.

whitegold42,asktransgender,Thoughts on Kenneth Zucker?,"Hi everyone. As the title implies, this post is going to be about Kenneth Zucker, the GIC, and gender ""reparative"" therapy in general, just so you are warned. I've been feeling pretty shitty as a result of the topic, so you may want to avoid the article I'm about to post if you have been feeling down or invalidated lately.

So, a friend, and a very good ally, posted this article the other day:
http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Vox+Sentences+2%2F9%2F16&amp;utm_term=Vox+Newsletter+All

TL;DR: The investigation that led to the lead researcher at the GIC in Toronto, an institute that focuses on ""helping children feel more comfortable with their gender,"" getting fired was shaky at best and maybe this approach to children that might be trans is more legit than the trans community wants to admit.

Like I said below, I felt pretty shitty after reading it. Floods of doubts and what not. I know Zucker is one of the most hated people in our community, and I know that ""reparative"" therapy has generally led to much pain and misery, but this article makes a convincing argument that the case against him was essentially a witch hunt. I started looking for more info, and I just couldn't find any sources that I felt like I could point to and definitively say, ""There. Zucker is hurting children."" Anecdotally, it is clear as day. But deep down, my intuition is undecided. On one hand, let children be whomever the fuck they want. On the other, social transitions are a huge decision. At what age or severity of dysphoria do we say someone is ready to make that choice? Do we even have the right to say? Should we be doing full scientific research on the ""best"" approach?

I just have been having trouble settling my mind on the topic. I don't want to put down personal experiences or emotional responses, but I guess I would just feel so much better if the guys investigating him had actually rigorously demonstrated that what he was doing was wrong.

In any case, I'm not defending or endorsing Zucker, I'm just really hoping to get some more thoughts or context on the whole issue to help me wrap my mind around it. If anyone knows of a good study on the long term effects of reparative versus gender affirming therapy on children (yeah, I know, talk about a small sample size), I'd love to see it. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

Edit: typos and confusing structure at one point.

Edit 2: Thanks everyone, this was the exact response I was hoping for. Sorry to bring up the shitty article, but for whatever reason I'm still apparently easily sent into a rut by stuff like this."

My rib cage is fucking huge,  My shoulders massive. I know some cis girls have those two but not in normal ranges. 

Or maybe what I'm doing is sabotaging myself. Now that I'm finally getting over my hate of my face and think maybe I'll pass,  I'm finding another terrible thing I can do nothing about to punish myself.  

But then again I just realised I'll never be able to strength and weight train how I want because of how my muscle groups will develop.

kirito1342,asktransgender,I need help I locked my self in my room and I'm scared.,"I'm a 15 male

My therapist that I was seeing in secrete thought I should tell my dad I was seeing a therapist. Also to tell my brother that I was trans so he can help tell my parents. So over Facebook I ended up telling him. He talked on how he will help me through and we all feel different inside.

I specifically told him to not tell my parents and he said ok. An hour ago I heard my dad screaming at my brother on the phone. Then I heard him talking in a whispering voice about me telling him I was see a therapist. Also asking if it's all in my head or if it's something serious. 

So I can tell he told m dad. When ever I came out to my dad b4 he usually got mad and screamed at me. He hates my brother for being bi and acting to femine. So I'm scared on what he will tell me.

So right now I'm locked in my room so I don't have to see him. I don't want to start a awkward conversation about this. I'm scared what if he kicks me out. He hasn't tried to talk to me yet.

Any advice please I'm scared.

UPDATE he just knocked on my door telling me in a angry voice that he wanted to talk to me. Then I said I wanted to be left alone. So he screams at me saying that ""ok remember that when you need I'm not going to be there""

Should I have let him in to talk. But it's embarrassing and he will probaly make me feel bad about it.


UPDATE
I really need to pee and I'm starving but I'm still to shy to leave my room. His room is down the hall from mine. So he can see if I leave my room.


UPDATE

I need to know should I run downstairs grab a lit if food and run back to my room? I'm starving"

sensitiveasfuck,asktransgender,I realized yesterday that I am a weak person,"I picked up a temp job last week in the I.T. Department of a local cities public schools. Everyone that worked in the department seemed very different from what Im used too, aggressive, loud, and just different. I guess that's probably because the city is known to have more ghettos, a lot more dangerous areas, and just generally unsafe area for everyone.   
   
I thought nothing of it when I accepted the job, because I really needed the job bad. When I went in my first day that treated me like one of the guys, calling me man and dude constantly like it was my name. They were nice people just carried themselves very differently.  
  
That first day I had to drive to a high school and ive always been uncomfortable around high school kids probably because I didn't make it past 10th grade. I was in a school full of terrible kids back then and my mom took me out for my safety. So I had to get my G.E.D.   
  
In the highschool I could just feel the kids staring at me, and It was then I realize how confusing my appearance is. My hair was tied in a ponytail with a hair tie I made certain matched my shirt. My eyebrows, were thick unplucked and mangy. My lips bright red covered in a layer of chapstick that might has well have been lipstick. The stubble of a goatee covering my pale face, my glasses presses close to my wide eyes. My small breasts traced out under my tight polo.   
   
I wasn't commiting to either gender stereotypes. I was unready and those mean kids could see it. There was giggling in every room I walked into as I checked each computers and I couldn't stop thinking to myself ""forgive them"".  
   
Once I was done checking everyone computer on the third floor I was issued another assignment at a elementary school. Approaching the school I thought ""children are adorable, I bet theyre sweet"", but each entry into a new classroom was accompanied by laughter. I heard some calling me he, some calling me she some teachers were even unsure what I could be. I took my seat infront of the computers and realized I was envious of these kids. I wish I could start over unwrite all the wrongs and not look the way I do.  
  
I left that day thinking I did well, however, the laughter and stares ate away at me until morning. Where I lay in my bed I decided to call in sick the rest of the week. That Friday I called the temp service to try to get out of ever going back there. They told me I could put in my 3 day notice Monday.   
   
I spoke with my family and they tried to increase my moral. My sister insisted I try to make it through the week. So I tried.   
   
Monday morning I woke up early and drank my coffee smoked my cigarette that I felt I needed and got in my car and drove. I had built up an imaginary happiness in my head to prepare for this week. As soon as I walked into the first high school all the happiness left me. I fast walked my way through a library of insults pushing boxes of computers. I was broken down. The worst part is I had to walk through again.   
   
My will was broken, I couldn't even see the kindness that was shown me by the teachers and supervisors. The evil minded kids who may not realize what they've done had brought me down to their level. I had to leave, I quit the next day.   
   
I let the experience beat me instead of rising above it. People are taught to hate, its learned early in life and it only gets worse. Some of us were even brought up to hate ourselves.   
  
I don't have an agenda writing this, I just like to write. I could have entered this into my journal but id rather share my experience with others."

Kacie38,asktransgender,Disappointment with Laser Consult and Electro vs Laser,"I'm disappointed with the consult for laser.

From what the laser technician told me is that I would need about 8 sessions, 1 per month and that it would target my dark hair and within 7 days it would grow back and fall out and that after 3 weeks of it falling out that it would grow back.  She said that my full beard could grow back.

So did I miss something or maybe I misunderstood.  I would much rather do electrolysis but the nearest place that I could get it done at is two hours away and I'm afraid I won't be able to make the trip often enough.

WhirlwindThoughts,asktransgender,How long did it take for you to come out and why am I having so much trouble?,"I came out to myself about two months ago.  In so doing, I realized that I ""knew"" I was trans since I was very young but only managed to crystallize/accept it recently.  You know, big things like desperately wanting a vagina, 'inventing' tucking, absolutely hating getting masculine haircuts, frequently wanting to paint my nails as a small child (and of course being punished for it, which pushed me further into the closet), and many more. 

I've even kind of started to transition in a half-assed way including:

* Wearing women's underwear and a lace cami under my clothing almost every day
* Wearing women's jeans in public/at school most days
* Wearing exclusively women's deodorant
* Plucking and shaping my eyebrows
* Shaving my beard that I had for 5 years
* Growing my hair longer
* Stopped a 15+ year nail biting habit so I could have longer nails (yes, as a 22 year old that means I've been a severe nail-biter for virtually my entire memorable life)
* Practicing my feminine voice at home
* Going to trans/questioning support groups
* Making an email account and some online friends under my new name
* Starting a skin-care ritual
* Wearing a little bit of makeup every day, even in public/to school
* Living in full girl-mode (breastforms included) when I'm alone at home
* Made a list of doctors, projected costs, timelines, etc. for my transition
* Ordering lots of women's clothing (casual, formal, cute, plain, all types!) to the point where half of my dresser is dedicated to it

Cis guys don't do all of those things - right?!

Everything that I do to express my femininity makes me so happy, and I feel so much peace, tranquility, and inner harmony when I accept/express/present my femininity.  I've hated and felt disconnected from my body for as long as I can remember, but all of that goes away when I present as female.  I think it's safe to say that the thought of transition has given me the most happiness and positive outlook on life as literally anything in my existing life (including having a significant other, getting into my top choice for undergrad and medical school, and a lot of things that I feel fortunate to have, but just haven't made me as happy as the thought of transition). 

Honestly I haven't done more in the realm of medical transitioning because my girlfriend is going through a difficult mental health crisis recently and doesn't have the emotional resources to process a medical transition at this point.  Long story short, she is completely ok with a social transition but has either a full panic attack or depressive/psychotic episode when the topic of medical transition comes up.  She's getting intensive treatment for the underlying cause of the problem, but at this point it's really not healthy for me to even bring it up with her.  She's pretty open and liberally accepting, so I have hope that she might be ok with a medical transition once she has the mental/emotional resources to process it.

I have an FTM friend and several openly gay/lesbian friends who are very accepting.  I figured I'd try coming out to them first, but I just can't seem to do it.  When it was time to get a haircut, my hairstylist insisted on giving me a new hyper-masculine look so I told him that I was trans-questioning and wanted an androgynous to feminine look - I just couldn't tell him that I'm trans, even though I know it in my heart, and I think the writing is on the wall as far as objective evidence goes (especially when the null hypothecis is considered!).  My girlfriend also thinks I'm trans-questioning, although I know that I'm holding back telling her until her mental health improves (or at least that's what I'm telling myself). 

My weird mental block is starting to make me question whether I'm really trans...

How long did it take you all to come out?  Of course it's typically a stepwise process, so feel free to share as much or little detail as you'd like.  Did anyone else have trouble coming out as 'full trans' rather than 'just trans questioning'?

lovepeacehappiness04,asktransgender,"Weird place, help needed","So, basic background.  I'm nearly 19, haven't started HRT (have had a few sessions of electrolysis so far).  I work at Starbucks and I'd say 60-65% of my customers read me as female.  And this is without makeup or earrings and in the Starbucks hat so the visual cues like hair, jewelry, and makeup aren't there.  My voice is pretty feminine too, I've been read as female on the phone since I was about 12.

I posted my picture in r/transpassing and I was told I look masculine and would need FFS.  It's strange because the prospect of changing my face or even needing to seems a bit like a sign that I may be fooling myself or I don't know.  I worry about doubts and then my family is largely, you're just really a feminine gay guy, and I've recently discovered that I still have quite a bit of transphobia to unpack (poor reactions to pictures of other trans people that I thought did not pass).

I've just been worrying a lot and feeling strange about my face.  Before I thought other than my chin, I was pretty on the right path (although then I feel like that's mean and hypocritical of myself to even think because I know better that there is no right path and every trans person is beautiful in their own way and passing should not have to be done ideally anyway).  Perhaps it's like, because my family isn't so accepting of this as I'd like them to be, it's as if every single box has to be checked super neatly or else it's like maybe they're right and I'm just a quack.

A lot to unpack, but I would really like some help.  Also, here's my picture.  Do I look like I'd need FFS? Do I look overly masculine (no makeup or anything in the picture, just my hair was done and a selfie at a strange angle).

directaction,asktransgender,Best way to concisely explain to someone what it feels like to be trans?,"Hey all! I was recently having a conversation with a group of friends and the topic of trans people came up tangentially. One friend in particular articulated that he doesn't really understand the perspective of a trans person. This guy isn't mean-spirited, and I've never heard him say anything really bigoted, homophobic or transphobic, but he was raised in the Southern U.S. and he implies some kind of borderline things at times. However, he's also inquisitive and the way in which he approached the topic during our conversation gave me the impression that he truly wanted to know what it feels like to be trans. 

I want to be a good ally, and I realize that the best way to answer his question would be to let trans folks themselves answer him (I'm cis, and straight to boot), but while he's inquisitive, I'm not sure he'd be up for reading an entire interview or two or some blog posts, and something like that doesn't work so great in a free-flowing group discussion anyway. He was looking for a clear and concise answer, so I told him to imagine that he wakes up tomorrow morning and everything about him that makes him unique is the same, but when he looks down he sees that he has breasts and his penis and testicles have been replaced by a vulva. I'm aware that it's not that simple, but in lieu of something more comprehensive, what's a better concise way to articulate what it's like to be trans day to day?

**EDIT**: Thanks so much to everyone for the excellent responses, some of these ideas are really insightful! One theme I'm picking up on is that while there are drawbacks to employing analogy, asking a cis person to imagine him- or herself with gender dysphoria is an even less effective way of communicating these feelings to someone having trouble empathizing with them. In any case, if the same scenario comes up again in the future, I've now got a lot more -- and much more descriptive and accurate -- ideas to work from. Much appreciated yall &lt;3"

eldritchterror,asktransgender,Suggestions for more feminine/andro looking hair styles?,"Hello! So something I can't really get over is my hair. I hate how it looks mostly because of how it naturally sits. It's very straight and flat and honestly kind of just disgusts me in general. I got my hair cut/styled a few months ago into a disconnected undercut and I was pretty happy with how it looked. I probably need to get the sides and back of my head shaved again by now but something that I've run into really bothers me. Whenever I style my hair myself it ends up looking ok for the first half hour or so and then it looks COMPLETELY different. 

I'm not really sure how to describe this so I'll just go through step by step what I normally do.

* soak hair and then dry it off enough with a towel to where it's not dripping anymore
* use a comb to pull it back and towards the center a little to get a more defined, prominent shape on the top.
* use about a nickle sized glob of hair gel and spread as evenly as I can through my hair 
* repeat step 2 with comb while blow drying to try and get less of a wet-look and more of a natural/wind blown look

At first it looks fine, but... after a while it ends up just kind of turning into this Wolverine style hair mixed with a mullet. The sides puff out and the top just kinda splays out. I'm not a very high maintenance person and I have little experience doing anything with my hair to begin with because I don't want to have to be spending an hour just to make my hair look ok. Is there something I'm just doing wrong/not doing? And is there really anything else I can do with my hair to make it look more feminine in general, like parting it a certain way, ect.??

I'm not very versed with cosmetics, the extent of what I use is a comb, brush, some gel, and a hair dryer so you'll likely have to talk to me like im a 1st grader "

Right now, I'm still stuck with wigs due to my male patterned baldness. I'm growing my hair out and hoping that HRT and maybe propecia will help my hair. For now it's wigs. I've been waiting to go full time until I can have my own real hair and not have to wear wigs. 

But, at work, I feel frustrated that I can't be there as my real self. I can't express myself the way I really am, I feel bottled up and repressed. I long to just be me at work. I work for state government and there are tons of LGBT protections. I legally can't be discriminated against at work, though I do worry there might be some difficulties despite the rules. 

I feel like I might be ready, even though my scalp hasn't yet caught up with me. I could do wigs. I could. It's not my ideal, but I could.

aweebthrowaway,asktransgender,Brainwashing therapists?,"There might be questions similar to this that show up often, but I haven't found any-- sorry if I'm regurgitating anything.  
I'm fourteen, came out as transgender to my mother about a year ago, and have known for a couple of years now.  
Finally, about a month ago, she decided it would be a good idea for me to see a gender theapist. For weeks I thought I would be seeing someone that specializes in the field--  you can imagine my surprise when at the appointment I found that they had no experience with transgendered people whatsoever.  The understanding he had came from an old study and a document scrawled on fading notebook paper. What attracted my mother to him was that he shared the same views as her and shared her same religious beliefs.  
One of the views in question: That most gender theapists speak to a supposed transgender person for a session or two, give them the transtamp of approval and send them on their way with a bottle of hormones. Most of the time, they say, the therapist is mistaken or could've opted for an alternate treatment.  
OK. I haven't seen statistics that show this to be true or false, so I can't really say anything either way.  
The method this psychologist uses is critical thinking-- a fine method, indeed. At the end of our first session, he gave my mother an article to read, one that I wasn't allowed to see. OK.  
Part of this critical thinking process is that I give him a pro-trans article and he gives me an anti-trans article. We both write out pros and cons of the articles we were given from the other person. OK, that is a great method.  
The problem comes from this-- the anti-trans biased article he gave me to examine was actually the article he gave to my mother the week before.  
The article pretty much says this: Allowing any kind of transitioning for teenagers is a terrible idea (except for blockers, which it says is a good idea if the patient is severely self-harming), and transitioning (HRT or HRT + SRS) is a dismal idea that is hardly effective.  
He gave me this article to think about and question, but he gave it to my mother to read and consider as truth.  
I hope I'm not the only one that sees a problem here.  
I'd like to see an actual gender therapist, but, you know, the supposed brainwashing.

 * What do you think about the idea of gender therapist brainwashing/negligent treatment of transgendered individuals leads to high rates of regretted/fruitless transitions?"

Problem is I can't even get HRT or socially transition before at the very least 5 to 10 years, so for now I have to find ways to cope and I somewhat manage to do so. I'm okayish with being socially a man for now (it's causing me depression and is making me suicidal but I can survive for a few more years if it just social dysphoria or dysphoria caused by secondaary sex characteristics) but not having a vagina is horrible and makes me seriously consider self-harm as a first option because my sick mind tells me that doctors would give me what I want if I destroyed my parts (I know it's not how it works but it's not a rational thought). 

So I have two questions because I don't think I can make it past the next couple of months.

BlondeNinja182,asktransgender,A trans MTF friend of mine has reached out for some support in a very unique fashion; I need some help with ideas. What would you guys do?,"First off, I do apologize if I am breaking any formalities as this whole situation has just came to exist within the last few days. This friend of mine, let's call her Kate, was someone I knew from high school but never really talked to. She was in the theater and I in the band so we often would see each other in musicals and such. We are both off in college now and she reached out a few days ago asking if I was willing to do something for her; I said yes. 

So, in short, she has been struggling with self image and tends to see herself as big and masculine which leaves her feeling pretty awful. She has asked me to tell her things that exaggerate how small she is and left it up to me to decide how. Basically make her feel super tiny. Kate knows it doesn't change anything about her body but said it makes her feel better about herself. 

A story has evolved in our conversation the past few days where, in our story, she is a very very tiny human living in a mansion where her entire world fits on a dime. We talk about her crazy fantasy adventures always emphasizing how small she is ie. riding on the back of an ant down an ant hill. 

Some pretty interesting pictures have arisen from this whole adventure as well. Since her entire fantasy world fits on a dime, she has asked me to model a dime in various locations such as the palm of my hand or at the base of my feet. 

I honestly know how strange this all sounds but I don't have a problem doing it for her. I have just let this whole idea develop into what it is now with no general direction for the future. So I'm asking you all: what's the next stop in Kate's fantasy land to help her feel small? Also, what are some other things I can do/say that will help with her self-esteem?"

I'm 20 in college I'm going to do this stuff ever now and again when I hang out with friends I've known sense 3rd grade. So why is she so adamant that I stop using?
 
Anyways I went in depressed one day and told her I'd thought about suicide a lot recently, it was mostly derived from transitioning/working 30 hours a week/15 hours college/almost never doing anything but homework on off time + getting hugly rejected by someone who I didn't even mean to let into my life. She flipped out saying she was going to hospitalize me and told me I a. had to go to a support group b. Had to go get antidepressants(I'm against them, never helped only made things worse and have tried at least a few dozen different ones) or c. Be hospitalized and lose all the work I've done for school along with a few grande.

Ok so Im against the anti depressants because I know I'm not depressed been fine for a couple of weeks now that the person who kinda popped up in my life is gone, everything's back to normal. And b I don't have time to drive into town when I need to study for test/do hours of homework or be at work and c. Like wtf?

 Anyways I left and  as I was since I was trying to get away from her persistent no using ""drugs"" (weed/alcohol once in a blue moon), Go to the hospital and she told me she was calling my psychiatrist to tell them to change my meds.

Ok I left irate, when it comes to my hormones, Youre not going to hold it over my head like a fucking bargaining chip for me to do what you think is best when I know its bullshit and explained why multiple times. Yes ok I got sad cause I got rejected and kinda pondered the idea of suicide due to real world stress and transitioning anxiety and what I really needed was an ear I could vent to and be done with the feeling(which is what happened), not someone dictating my life. Yea I had a set back but literally seeing the positive sign that transitioning is having on my body and mental state overall has reduced my thoughts of killing myself easily by 95% (use to every day of every month of every year.) And for someone to just decide "" no more"" fucking pisses me off. 

Tldr: pissed off when therapist called my psychiatrist to lower my dosage when its already low. 

Sorry for ranting just thinking about its making me livid. Should I find a new therapist or am I being ridiculous? 

I know she feels responsible for my wellbeing but this is counterproductive if she's going to lower my dosage b/c I have a set back then I'm not going to use her for the help I actually need, what goods a therapist who thinks she's my fucking psychiatrist when I need therapy? Ugh."

I would listen to the radio, country songs about love and emotion and wished i could be the girl that guys looked at that way. I was never really attracted to guys sexually but i couldn't really.. Stay up.. with girls. It was a huge blow to my self confidence. I wasnt the most girly I'll admit. I would always just get sad and i dont know why.

Fast forward a few years and it hasnt really gone away.

About a month ago i was driving home and i was thinking, it would be so easy to just list to the left into incoming traffic and end my life. I dont know where that thought came from. It scared me.

aspiringtobeme,asktransgender,How could I tell if my electrolysis technician is bad at their job?,"Really not a question that I like to feel like I need to ask, but I'm already about $300 deep into electrolysis after laser, and I'm paranoid.

feelthebernaccnt,asktransgender,So what is going on? (NSFW),"I know my best option is to seek out a therapist who has experience working with transgender individuals (I've been reading quite a bit, perhaps too much). Despite that, I'm turning to the community to at least get some perspective. And I'll be greatly appreciative of anything offered in terms of that. I could go through all the details and provide specific instances, but I'll give a shorter version for today. 

When I was younger I played with toys of both genders, although I suppose it was primarily with those stereotypical of boys. I remember as a child, I don't remember exactly when, but perhaps around 10 or earlier and feeling strongly that I wasn't in the right body. There were many nights I remember praying (when that was something I believed in) for God to make me a woman. I know I didn't realize what this meant at the time, so I never told anyone about it and I didn't have the access to Internet that is so readily available today to research this. 

I can think of a few examples during my pubescent years where I had feelings of being the wrong gender, but I mostly don't remember what was going on with me then. I know I followed male tendencies, but that's about it. I also know I tried crossdressing a few times in private, too.

I can probably think of a few instances from my early college years of these feelings, but again my memory is a bit fuzzy. (It's also super late and I'm beyond confused right now.) However, it's only in the last few years since finishing college that I've noticed an increase in these feelings. They'll wax and wane, but each time they seem to come back a little stronger.

Most notably they've been pretty intense these past couple of years. Once I found myself out of high stress situations (a story that would add significant length to this one), I found myself better able to focus on me. I've never really liked or felt comfortable in my body, and it wasn't until these past few weeks that I think I've started to realize why that might be. 

About a year and a half ago I started to try and get myself into shape because I thought that might make me feel better about my body. It may have slightly, and I'm still doing the whole losing weight thing, but I'm actually slightly disappointed. When I started I had hoped that I would retain some of my fat on hips as some sort of proof that I was, in fact, supposed to be female. Unfortunately I haven't. 

When my feelings of being the wrong gender came back again a couple weeks ago they were intense enough to the point that I had to do something about it, so I went out in search of information. I found, through this subreddit and many other places, stories that sounded like me. Like me in that I think I've realized that I likely am experiencing gender dysphoria, and have been for some time without knowing it.

I apologize for having another post of this nature, but I fear I may have stumbled down the wrong hole and ran into some bad information. I fear that stumbling across the transvestic fetishism descriptions has lead me down the wrong path. Because while I have, possibly in the past, and recently have had arousal while testing the waters of femininity I'm not sure it fits. Yet, I simultaneously worry that perhaps it does? Some quick browsing through here makes it seem like this isn't a very popular concept. I suppose what I'm getting at is, is it natural to have those feelings of arousal?

Like I said, I'm confused and tired (sleep has been hard these past couple of weeks). So I apologize if this is too disjointed. I just couldn't deal with the confusion anymore and I needed to talk to some people about this. On one hand I'm relieved to have some sense of what has been going on with me for years. On the other, I'm nervous about the future. I hope some of you can shed some light on my current confusion. Thank you all so much, and I'm sorry if this was longer than I said it would be."
SmurfsAreTasty,asktransgender,"Before HRT, when deciding to go through transition, how did your way of thinking differ from the way it was in the past?","I've am going thought therapy, but before I even found a therapist, my entire way of thinking about how I treated myself changed literally over one night. I still can't quite explain it other than it was over night and even my mom still doesn't quite believe me. My therapist is trying to find something that made me change, but there's nothing. I don't know what it was, but I just changed.

So I began to take care of myself. I stopped eating so much junk food. I stopped drinking soda like it was water. I stopped with all the energy drinks on a regular basis. I started eating fruits and vegetables I had always brushed off, or actually didn't find tasty. Im eating Spinach of all things. For someone that pretty much ate meat and potatoes type meals, this still confuses me. It confuses me because the person that I've been my whole life, and the Thing I was for the last 16 years of hell, just changed over night.

I exercise a lot now. Before, never. Unless I needed to walk somewhere to get food. The exercise, better eating, and different ways of thinking about myself, have changed me in ways I didn't believe were possible without surgery or some weird procedures. Waist size is down. Hips are bigger. Dress and pants size go from size 12 to a size 8-10. All before HRT.

All this, over a 7 month period of finally learning to accept myself. It's far from over. But as I look back and try to picture the person I was at this exact same time last year.... I can't even remember... I was that far gone.

To anyone just coming to terms with who they really are, take it from a 35 year old with PTSD related to being who I always knew I was, things get better. They don't get magically, tv/movie, perfect. But just being able to accept the person you are means so much. Not everyday is fun, but it's a LOT better than it used to be."
oxfordquestionmark,asktransgender,Female role models and doubt. [FTM],"When I was still doing my best to be a woman, I was always looking for strong female role models to copy, and women who's style I liked to base my own fashion choices on. I was actually worried that I was copying people too much and didn't have a sense of who I was and what I wanted.

Now I'm transitioning to male, I've got a much better idea of who I am and what I want. However, I still find myself looking at women who'd have been role models with the same old ""I want to be/look like that"" instinct. It's only a temporary feeling, but it's been bringing doubts up.

This is more of an ""am I normal"" question than a serious concern, but has anyone else experienced anything like this? My guess is that it's just a leftover habit that I'll get over as I become more confident.

EDIT: Thanks everyone, you've given me some great advice and stuff to think about!"
Worldofmoths,asktransgender,Should I tell him we used to know each other?,"So a guy I went to high school with has just joined my course. We talked a little and it seems he doesn't recognise me which is the way I'd prefer it. I currently have him blocked on Facebook just like everyone else I went to highschool with who I wasn't close friends with, however, I'm thinking he may try to add me or ask me to add him (pretty much everyone in the course is connected to each other on Facebook and our pracs are close by a group of us including me and him Sugested meeting up after prac work because our prac agencies are close together). In that event he will likely see that we have a number of mutual friends from high school.

Would it be more awkward and weirdif he found out that we went to highschool together and I didn't tell him or if I outed myself to him? "
Timeyourtake,asktransgender,I was told it would get better?,"Around 4 years ago (Jan 11, 2012) I came out to myself.  

Around 3 years ago (Sep 24, 2013) I started HRT.  

Around 2 years ago (April 27, 2014) my parents kicked me out of the house for being a woman.  

Since then, I've been on an insane journey of self-discovery and ridiculous luck.  I have been in and out of the hospital, I've lived in four different places, and I met the love of my life.  

I have not been misgendered (aside from by my relatives and parents) in over two years.  I was very fortunate to be intersex and to have the ability to modulate my voice into a female one with little trouble.  

I should be living the dream.  

But I'm not.  My depression and anxiety have spiraled out of control.  I've lost almost every friend I ever had, be it to distance, my transition, or my mental illness.  I can't go to the grocery store without my girlfriend or roommates present.  I have panic attacks regularly.  My therapist recommended I go to a trans support group in my city.  

Oddly enough, I was an outsider.  The group is made of predominantly older women, with a few younger ones and trans dudes thrown in.  They discussed bathroom laws, impending divorce, and keeping their identity under wraps.  

Honestly, none of this really impacts me.  Even if my state were to pass a bathroom law (and I hope they don't) I would be able to use the ladies' room with no problems.  I'm only 23, never married, and long since gave up on my parents ever seeing me as their daughter.  I have been presenting female since I left my parents' house in 2014.  

And still I can't do anything.  All my cis friends have jobs and lives and plans.  All my trans friends either disappeared or went into kink/poly stuff that takes up all their time.  I feel like I should be *doing something*.  

Honestly what kills me the most is that I have literally no friends aside from a few people I play games with online and my girlfriend.  And I can't connect to other trans people around here because my experience and situation is just so different.  

I'm rambling.  It's 5AM and I feel so alone and useless, and I just don't know what to do.  Asktransgender really helped me when I was coming to terms with myself back in 2013 or so, even if I did delete my old account.  I just want someone to talk to, I guess.  


**For what it's worth,  It does get better.  I haven't spent time thinking about my gender in months, and being gendered properly is extremely confirming, especially when it's all day every day.  I'm just stuck in a rut and want friends.  DON'T GIVE UP!**"

ToaNL662,asktransgender,Metabolism changes after SRS and hormonal cancellation questions,"Hey Reddit o/

So I'm coming up on 7 months of hormones (MTF) and I'm having trouble with some stuff. 

My main issue is that I'm a rail, about 5'11"" and maybe 130 pounds (Idk the actual weight), I really want to get more plump. The rules I know for eating are eat more, eat often, try to drink your calories and work up an appetite with exercise. I've had a long and annoying past with food and other events associated with food and those issues caused me to basically step into anorexic habits. Honestly I've only just admitted it fully. I have what I call ""fat drinks"" now that have 530 calories each and I have upwards of 3 of those a day (because of money factors I try to limit myself to 1 per day) as well as normal amounts of meals. My real question is, will being post surgery help me gain weight? Will my metabolism change that much? I feel like my boy bits are blocking me somehow in this respect.


My other concern with HRT currently is that what I feel like is a rock bottom of sorts. By that I mean is it possible to reach a point where the low T and the growing E sort of cancel out and leave a person feeling empty and emotionless? I've always kind of been a ""hard nut to crack"" to put it lightly but now I kinda just feel dead, like I can't truly feel or something. Crying is still very hard and though I've had some tears since starting it still feels like I'm just a robot.




Thanks much in advance


EDIT: Clarification that fat drinks aren't only source of food
"
Chel_of_the_sea,asktransgender,"Ho-lee-crap, you guys. Two years HRT.","I don't usually indulge myself in this sort of post. But I'm feeling celebratory, and I suppose it's always good for the newbies to see some success stories, so what the heck.

I first came to this sub back in September of 2012. I was lost and confused, trying to navigate bizarre waters that I'd never even considered but that felt too natural to ignore. A lot of you know me [as](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3dhz9j/ireland_passes_law_allowing_trans_people_to/ct5grgg) the [crazy](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/3s85v2/how_does_the_red_pill_feel_about_trans_men_ftm/cwv6vs6) copypasta [lady](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/367d1j/cmv_being_transgender_to_the_point_of_wanting/crbe7vj), but back then I was a scared boy who'd never seen a single one of the studies I've linked several times a day for the past few years. I had a giant unkempt beard, a fundamentalist roommate, a repressive conservative upbringing, and an uncertain academic and professional future ahead of me. I'd never even heard of Reddit! My very first post was right here - a [little tentative question](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/zbpg7/having_trouble_separating_gender_issues_from/) about how I could separate sexuality and gender as issues.

About a week later I got up the nerve to make [a more serious and thorough post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/zk0v2/fairly_sure_im_mtf_need_advice_help_avoiding/). If you're a questioning newbie yourself, take a look: it's not much different from the 'am I trans' threads posted on this subreddit once or twice a day even now. If you feel scared and alone, if you feel like there's no way you could do such a crazy thing, if you feel you can't possibly make an educated decision on such a question - well, I felt that way too. I could, and did, and you can too.

Hilariously, the first time I asked for studies, I got [three replies](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/16ho9v/looking_for_peerreviewed_articles_on_the/). How times have changed!

Over the months and years after that, I kept questioning - a flip through my post history will find quite a few things that, in retrospect, will be (a) quite familiar to regular readers/posters here, (b) a bit cringy, or (c) both. My life hit quite a few non-trans-related bumps, too - [a chunk fell off a tooth without warning](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15j317/how_do_i_know_if_i_need_emergency_care/), leading to an *extremely* unpleasant few days, [the T.A. position I thought I had at my university evaporated](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/15w9mr/life_advice_i_have_absolutely_no_idea_what_to_do/), delaying my education for a semester, and (although I didn't post about this one) I ultimately ended up disowned by my family. Once I finally did get into grad school, [I feel flat on my face for a while](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1nf41a/ive_been_a_grad_student_for_five_weeks_and_my/) - but I got through that, too.

Ultimately, it took me 18 months to finally settle on a path ([wobbling all the way!](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/192adx/going_out_of_my_mind/), and I [finally started hormones](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1x55p1/so_after_a_year_and_a_half_of_back_and_forth_i/) on a trial run in February 2014. I felt [a little better at first](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1x55p1/so_after_a_year_and_a_half_of_back_and_forth_i/), and a whole lot better later! It was around this time that I started my whole trans-evangelist thing.

Six months after that, [I went to the beach in girlmode and no one noticed a thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/2bpwvp/bathing_suits/). I went full time a few weeks later, and started really passing once I paid attention to my voice a few months after that. I finished my Master's degree, reconciled with my family, moved 3000 miles away to my new home in the Pacific Northwest, realized I like boys, [ended up homeless because okay maybe moving 3000 miles without a job lined up wasn't a great plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/chel_of_the_sea/comments/3i3ttm/to_anyone_watching_my_profile_ill_be_absent_a/), found a job, and stabilized.

Today, I'm not the scared boy who first posted here. I'm a woman who can barely remember I was ever anything else. I pass without effort, put on a stupidly large grin when I look in the mirror, and couldn't pass for a guy these days if I actively tried. No one I've met in the last eight months has known me as anyone but the girl I am today. Transition was, without a doubt, the best decision I've ever made. It's improved every aspect of my life: I'm warmer, happier, more confident, more social, more comfortable, and able to consider sex without freaking out. There are a lot of scary barriers to transition, and there are some sad stories to be sure. But for those of you who are thinking ""shit, can I do this?"", ""[are any trans people actually happy?](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1fw3ji/are_you_actually_happy/)"", or any number of the thousand legitimate doubts one might have about transitioning: don't be afraid. I'm happy, and you can be too."
Ayra45,asktransgender,Why is this all so unfair?,"I wish I was born a girl.  I wish in high school I had girl friend's who I could spend time with.  We could talk about makeup.  Or look at clothes.  They would be kind and friendly and we'd support each other.  We could go to dances together in beautiful dresses and have fun.  

I wish I didn't feel so ashamed of crying, or liking cute or pretty things. I wish I wasn't so scared of being myself or being happy.  I feel like I missed out on such a huge chunk of my life.  

I wish my first kiss was something romantic not something frightening.  Maybe my life would not have fallen apart so badly if I was who I was meant to be instead of a shell of a person.  

I'm really having a hard time not hurting myself.  And I'm really feeling hopeless.  I feel like I've missed so much.  I feel like I'll never be who I want to be so why bother.  I'm really really tired of fighting everything and I just want to be happy and I don't understand why that has to be so hard. 

I wish somebody loved me, I wish somebody would save me.  But that isn't realistic and it isn't going to happen.  I really want out. 

I don't know anymore.  I'm just scared of doing this anymore.  I'm tired and scared and alone and I'm so done. I don't understand why life is just pain and suffering.  This is awful. 

Edit: I'll be alright for now.  I really love you all ♡  I'm just exhausted and instead of falling apart I think I'll go to sleep like a responsible human being..."

wicked_caty,asktransgender,When should I transition?,"Hi there \^\^

I'm 16 years old, mtf, pre-everything, and from southern Germany.

I want to start HRT before my body gets completely f\*\*\*ed up by testosterone, so I'm in a bit of a hurry. My shoulders and muscles and my face are yet not too manly and I really don't want it to become any worse.

There are no laws which would regulate access to HRT, but there is a voluntary framework. Not all doctors stick to that, but the vast majority does. That framework suggests a RLE from 6 months to up to 3 years with 1 year of therapy *(it's a bit more complicated, but that's basically how it works)*.

I'm living in an area where LGBT-related things aren't accepted, though. The people are way too *(far-)*right-wing for that. I've heard of gay men being beaten up and threatened simply for being into men. And it's impossible to go out en femme without anyone knowing about it when you live in a village with barely 2000 inhabitants where everybody knows everybody.

That leaves basically three options for me:

* Doing RLE right now. I would get beaten up severely for that most certainly, though. Not to mention that I'm vulnerable to harassment.
* Waiting for 2 years until I can move to a more accepting area where I won't be subject to severe harassment. That'll make my body even more masculine, though. And I doubt I'd survive my dysphoria for such a long time.
* Searching doctors who don't demand RLE and starting HRT soon. I could hide it until I can move out, wouldn't be beaten up, and I'd have the best results. Downside: There are very few doctors who don't demand RLE and I'd spend hundreds of € on doctors who want me to do things  I can't do...

t-away4me,asktransgender,Any dating advice for someone new to the trans community?,"I am a CIS man who is starting to date a trans woman, and this is how it all started.

I would like to say that the reason for the throwaway is that my friends who have met this girl (we will call her Emily) know my reddit account and Emily doesn't want to tell them that she is trans for fear of being judged. 

About 2 weeks ago I started talking to Emily on okcupid. Initially when we started talking I had no idea she is a trans woman, (she passes very well) but when we were talking about meeting in person she told me that she was. As a cis male who had only dated cis women in the past this was a bit of a surprise to me, however I was very attracted to this girl and I have always been open minded and decided to see how our first date played out. We went out to dinner and talked for hours, laughing and enjoying each others company, we didn't want to end the date so we ended up sitting in the booth at the restaurant just talking. Basically a great first date.

Fast forward to this past weekend, Friday night we met up for coffee and ended up back at my house to watch a movie while cuddling on the couch. We had a good time talking and getting to know each other more and I told her I really wanted to hang out again. 

Then on Saturday we both agreed we couldn't take it and had to see each other again so she came over to my house and within 5 minutes of being at my house grabbed my hand and took me to my bedroom where she put on a movie and jumped in my bed. It started as cuddling then escalated to kissing and hands wondering. I had my hand down her pants when she suddenly grabbed my hand and told me to stop. It was a bit abrupt which confused me because I didn't push her to do anything, but the way she said to stop made me feel as if I had done something wrong or taken advantage of her. 

I really enjoy spending time with this girl but I fear that my lack of knowledge about what she has gone through will jeopardize this relationship.

I realize this isn't much of a question and kind of ended up being me gushing about a girl but I cant talk to any of my friends about it and I think this community could help. 



UPDATE: First I wanted to say thanks for all of you giving me helpful answers. We talked last night and she was just feeling overwhelmed when she told me to stop that one night. We discussed what sex would be like, how we would move forward and I suggested that we wait a little bit on anything sexual so that she doesn't feel rushed. She was very happy with this idea and was very thankful for me understanding. Again, thanks so much, and you might see me again on here in the future with any additional questions."

If you are up to having an actual discussion about this, I would absolutely love to talk to you, as I have been trying for a while now to find someone who is part of this movement who will speak to me and not just get mad at me for asking these questions.  While I know that some people may get upset about this, that is far from my intention--I just want to understand, and maybe talk to you in a civilized way!  Please note that if you cuss me out, I will ignore you, as this is counterproductive towards what I am trying to achieve here.  Unfortunately, more often than not, however, when I've tried to talk to someone, they have reacted that way.  I'm letting you know, right now, that reaction is a waste of energy on me.
Okay!  Here we go!

- What is it that makes you believe that ""die cis scum"" is helpful?

-  Have you ever had a conversation with someone about your ideals work in your favor when the person you were speaking to was cis and/or not part of the movement?

-  What are your personal experiences being apart of this movement?  How has it effected you and your views?

-  Are you open to a civil discussion and/or debate where you and I go back and forth on our beliefs and views on ""die cis scum?""  Would you be able to remain objective?

Thank you for your time!  I really look forward to reading your responses.  And remember, please keep it civil, regardless of your willingness to participate in a constructive debate and/or discussion."
brokenlight90,asktransgender,I want to try reparative therapy.,"I know this wont be a popular thing to talk about here, but i have no other choice. Transition is not an option for me, but i'm willing to try anything else to get rid of these thoughts and feelings.

Unfortunately, it seems like most people who offer this sort of thing a religious figures rather than actual trained psychologists. I'm an atheist so a religious-driven type of therapy would not be effective at all. How can I find a  legit and qualified therapist who would offer this type of therapy?"
SevenFates,asktransgender,Wipe or Shake?,"Okay, because I apparently have no mental filter, a question for all of the pre-op transladies popped into my head while I was going to restroom. When you're  done peeing, do you usually find yourself wiping yourself clean/dry with toilet tissue, or do you still find yourself giving yourself a little shake before tucking yourself back into your panties?

In my case, I found that once I started wearing panties mostly full time, I actually started caring about my underwear, and I didn't want that extra bit of moisture clinging to or hiding in my foreskin getting into my panties and possibly staining them. Didn't really care about that moisture when I wore boxers.

So I'm curious, wipe or shake?"

SeniorAtSchool,asktransgender,Is there anything important I should know about the Female to Male transition,"Hey. My best friend is going through the transition from Female to Male. I have been in support of him for a long time so I'm pretty excited he finally is going to get his dangly bit. He has been on testosterone for a while and estrogen blockers to. 

Like I said I have always been supportive and at time protective of him during the transition. I want to know if there is anything as a friend i can do to support him through this? Or if there may be changes to him that I should brace myself for. I have been trying to research it online and I want to try and get some information from people who know those who went through this process or those who went though it themselves.

FrumplePumpkin,asktransgender,How to have the HRT talk with my wife?,"I've been 'questioning' my identity for some time now. I am now confident in who I am and am ready to start HRT. However, in the early days of figuring all this out, the wife and I came to an agreement: she could deal (somewhat) with my exploration, but the line was drawn at HRT. If I feel the need to start HRT, then she can't stay. She doesn't want to see me 'modifying' my body and doesn't feel like she is strong enough to observe physical changes in her no-longer-husband spouse. How do I even re-approach this subject? "
sillyhorsethrowaway,asktransgender,Still not sure what I am. How do I figure it out?,"I've been meaning to post something for ages but I've kept putting it off.
Oh well, here I go…

I started to really question if I'm trans a little less than 6 months ago, and while I've made some progress in figuring myself out I doubt a lot and I'm not sure if I can find ""*the answer*"".

Maybe I've known ""something"" for a long while, but I haven't even considered asking myself the question until the last year (or maybe sometime the year before).
If I think back it I can find fragments of what I would consider to be transgender feelings and experiences maybe as long back as when I was about 8-ish, but I have always pushed those feelings aside, thinking they're just silly impossible dreams with no real-life relevance.
For instance I've longed to dress up as a girl since I was a teenager (maybe? Can't pinpoint anything).

The last year I've got to unburden some of my feelings to some really great friends (MtF going through HRT, etc), and I've found I share a huge lot of experiences with her and other trans people, and I think I have mostly accepted what I am, but still feel a lot of doubt and uncertainty a lot of times.
Often I feel almost completely certain one day, to have it all ground down to nothing again another day.
It's been really taxing on my mentally, I sometimes feel like I really wish I was, but I fear I'm not. Or I feel like I'm just silly and my mind is playing tricks on me, and I just wish to find myself and grasp on to this.

I guess I've always felt like if I have to choice to push a button to rewrite history so I'd been born into a female body I would not hesitate a second.
Maybe this is my best ""for argument"".

Unfortunately I'm have pretty bad self-confidence and social anxiety which make me fear what might be if I go through with transitioning. Maybe it's the only thing making me doubt, or maybe not.

I know nobody can give me the answer for me, only I can. But I've seen how much it helps to ask people who've been through what I'm going through right now, and maybe I can find more clues here.

Phew, that was nice finally getting to write this post.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you all! &lt;3

VioletBarbie,asktransgender,Unsure of what to do,"Has anyone else been in this situation? I've known for years that I am not meant to be male, but didn't quite grasp just how desperate I would become. I'm now married to a woman. I've tested the waters and she would not be okay with me transitioning. I love her, but the thoughts I've been having are getting way too intense and I'm not sure what to do anymore. Even my dreams are getting insane. I keep wanting to just leave for a man who will treat me like his play thing. My submissive personality mixed with my desperation and vivid imagination is creating these obsessions that I can't seem to shake.
So, I'm just wondering if anyone else has been in a committed relationship, but has become completely desperate to transition. If so, how did you handle it? Did you have a talk with a partner who was understanding or did you end up leaving?"

I'm scared of starting to to do vocal training because I might end up still sounding like a man when I'm done since I have a very deep voice and I dont have anyone around me to help me practice nor do I really know how.
I'm scared of LOOKING like a man when it's done because despite all the MtF transitions I see where they come out looking amazing I dont have the most pretty face in the world already and I have seen a lot of people who STILL look like men 3 years on the treatment.

Worst of all I'm scared of any of this leaking to other places I hang out online, online I'm Rose and I have friends+fun, I dont feel the need to say ""I'm trans"" because that isnt me, the real me IS a woman, a slightly lonely lesbian and a gigantic nerd, the me offline feels like the fake one and I hate this feeling.

Nina1701,asktransgender,Do you struggle to talk to your former self?,"Recently, my therapist asked if I had anything to say to my former self. She brought out a chair right across from me and asked me to switch chairs and switch roles, ie. sitting there in that moment I was a boy and in the chair I was a girl. I thought at first it was an odd request, and I laughed as I switched seats. I said hello, boy name, it's me, girl name. And then I froze. And then... I cried. Like a lot. Very real and very hard. As I struggled to keep from sobbing, I managed to get out a few sentences. 

My conversation with myself proved to be quite overwhelming. I've since tried to repeat the exercise and each time, I break down into tears. I'm not sure what that means. I'm not sure what I need to say, or if I need to say anything at all. I don't know what to expect.

UPDATE: She was cool with it! I worried for nothing... We're putting off the details of my trans-ness for now because she's really stressed and will be for a couple weeks, but at least she's okay with it, even if she is still pretty shocked, since I kinda slammed this down in front of her all of a sudden.

1. I shave my legs and have tried to for the past 4 years and whenever people would say things regarding hair on my legs i would get rather embarassed. Sometimes i let them grow in because it grows in so quick after i shave so i don't see the point.

2. I plan what surgeries i want to feminise and remodel my body.

3. I don't like talking to people in the morning as my voice sounds the most manly then.

4. I don't like going to the door unless i get called 'sir'.

5. I am very self consious when i go out because i am afraid that i look to masculine and i don't look passable.

6. I don't like to see people in the morning in case they think in their heads 'oh my god, she really does look manly'.

7. I used to cry and get so upset and still do sometimes when i put on makeup and don't look different.

8. I get rather envious of other girls. Even if i know they are great looking it is very rare that i will say it.

9. I look up virtually on a daily basis women's body's and face's that i admire and the ones i wish i had.

So as of right now what I have is.
* Name change forms signed by the court or whatever.
* My old state ID
* Doctors note that states I have gone through ""Irreversible Change"" however it does not explicitly state that I've had surgery. (because i haven't""
* Social Security card that says my new name and female
* Birth Certificate with M but also my new name.

The problem right now is that even with all of the documents I currently have they still wont budge.
[here are their rules] (http://web01.dps.louisiana.gov/omv1.nsf/58c968bd569b099986256cdc000806eb/bf53b205455ad9d0862564ae0058feab?OpenDocument) about exactly what documentation I need..
I'm wondering if there is any possible way to get this to work without getting surgery right now, because honestly I don't have the money at this exact time.
My lawyer said if I got a Passport that said female then they would let me get a new state ID, but I'm starting to think that might not work either considering the new Social that says female along with my current letter wasn't enough for them

I hope someone can give me some advice!

Trying to transition into being more feminine feels like more effort and energy than I can really afford.

I don't know, I guess I really just want to be able to fit in somewhere, but as it is I feel like I can't. Does anyone else have this problem?"
earthpushedback,asktransgender,Here's my dysphoria life story,"I'm pretty new to reddit and I lurk this sub a lot so I decided it's time for my life story to be posted in hopes of some advice or something.  

I'll start off by saying that I do know that none of you guys can give me an answer. I know that I have to work through this myself, etc etc. But I just want to see if anyone has anything that can help.  

I'm 19 and assigned female at birth. I grew up like the stereotypical ""tomboy."" Never liked the color pink, liked boy clothes, played in the mud, collected bugs, etc. I guess I would fall under the category of ""I've always known I was trans"" because I've never really associated with typical female stuff. But I never really reflected on my gender seriously until recently.  

Until about a year ago, I felt like I just had to play the cards I was dealt and live as a girl. After an emotional breakup at 17 , I cut all my hair off and really liked it. My voice is pretty deep for a girl so sometimes I'd be mistaken for a guy which I also liked. I realized that I don't like being called a girl and I don't like my name. About a year ago, I made my they/them pronouns Facebook official and my close friends and partner (who is also probably trans) started using neutral pronouns.  

I was pretty satisfied with how things were. I'm not particularly dysphoric about my body and I told people I was non binary when they asked about my gender even though I lean more male.  

Then I moved away to college and my roommate is a trans guy (it wasn't a coincidence, we both put ""transitioning"" as gender on our housing application). He was 100% female until he moved here. He changed his name, started T really quickly, and overall seemed really confident and happy about his situation in just a few months. It made me really jealous because I'm struggling more than he is.  

I really wanted to make some progress so I changed my name with my friends (my family still don't know and think I'm a really gay girl). I was really happy about this change for like a week but then it complete backfired. I'm the kind of person that needs all my online accounts and social media to all be the same so I started changing my name on most of my stuff, except Facebook and email because family. Having some accounts under one name and others under a different name made me sad and made me feel like it'll be basically impossible (I know it's not) to change everything and have everything nice and orderly.  

On top of that, after about a month of coming out with a chosen name, I realized I felt really disconnected with it. I felt like ""oh this isn't my name."" I'll still respond to it but I just don't like it anymore. Now I just introduce myself to new people as my birth name just to keep it simple. I've also changed all my online accounts back to my birth name too. I know I can always pick another name and I know my friends and partner will support me, but I just don't think another name will fit and I also don't want to feel like a burden.  

I'm going to a gender therapist but not as often as I'd like because I can't afford it. I guess this whole thing will solve itself in time and eventually I'll find a name I like but for now, I'm pretty unhappy. I'm not sure if I'd like to live as male and transitioning with hormones sounds scary right now. Any stories, feedback, or advice anyone would like to share is really appreciated. It was nice typing out my whole story and getting it all out.  

TL:DR: I'm 19, assigned female at birth. I present pretty ambiguous now and I like being mistaken as a guy. I don't like being called a girl and don't assisociate with female stuff. After seeing my roommate successfully transition FtM really quickly, I changed my name but started hating it because I don't connect to it. Now I'm stuck and not sure how to get past it. Help?  

Edit: I thought of a couple things after I finished writing. I feel like another issue of mine is that I'm not assertive enough about my gender. Whenever people ask, I just tell them ""ehhh just call me this, I don't care that much."" I guess it just goes back to me not being sure what I want. I want to be confident with my name and gender.  

Another thing is that I'm really mostly unhappy with how other people see me. I'm pretty okay with how I act and how I present, but once it comes to labels and passing, I get sad. I want people to know how I feel but I don't have the labels (or even a name) yet."
beahaus,asktransgender,"Is it normal to feel like it's not worth the trouble, expense, or ostracism?","Preface:
My body is already femininely shaped, but I'm 6 foot 3, hairy AF, and don't have the most masculine face; just long and thin, kind of like an alien horse. 
Chapter 1:
I have so many drawbacks because of my appearance not starting at an ideal place, the expense that's involved, or the apparent ostracism that I'll face. I have started growing my hair out and am trying different styles, but the other day someone compared me to Jim Carrey on In Living Color in the work out skit :-/
It wasn't a pleasant picture, (I was unfamiliar so I looked it up and almost cried)
I don't know if it's such a crisis for me personally that I transition compared to the majority of the problems I'll encounter in process. 
Not to mention the expense. Omg. I choked when I looked at average transitioning costs. 
I don't know if I'm alone in these feelings, that I'm just being insecure, or if there is an in between that I'd be happier with. 
I like being androgynous, but I always wish my appearance was more feminine in the end.

Fairlady31,asktransgender,"[NSFW] Testy Blockers. Can't get an erection for masturbation anymore, is this common?","Okay this has to have been discussed by others on here before, I am on 50mg cypro, my T last time I got tested 2 weeks ago was 29 ng/dL. 

I'm a virgin who's not ready for sex but still likes pleasure once in a while, so I used to masturbate. Now though I can't even maintain an erection, and when I can it's not a full one (still part soft). Even if I keep trying, I can't reach an orgasm anymore. Masturbating doesn't even really feel good anymore, it feels like ""why am i doing this?"", like the sensation has gone down or something. The last 4 times I tried pleasuring myself I just fell asleep without achieving an orgasm or anything at all really. 

Is this normal when on testy blockers? I'm okay with this because it's a lot more comfortable of a libido than mine was pre-hrt, but I worry that when I do want to have sex that I won't be able to please my potential partner :( 

It makes me feel self conscious too because I have trans friends that do anonymous hookups and stuff, and i've been on HRT for less time than them and feel no sexual desires at all, not even for self pleasure anymore. Can someone on here validate this experience?"
scalingheaven,asktransgender,Frequent bathroom usage at work,"First of all, I'm slightly drunk, so I'll try to make this quick, and sorry for the poor writing. I recently got a new job at a supermarket, in the deli. I like the job (and pay =P), but I've been on HRT for a little over four months and I need to go to the bathroom a lot if you know what I mean. My place restricts bathroom breaks to two per eight hour shift (I think that's the number) with exceptions for emergencies. I'm new, so they've been granting my bathroom breaks with no question, but I worry that the longer I work where I do the more questions will be asked about my bathroom usage. How do I go about it without imposing too hard or looking like I'm difficult? Do I talk to Human Resources, or just my supervisor about a ""medicine"" I'm taking that makes me pee a lot? I don't really know, but I know I need to pee a lot =P.

Edit: I'm still totally working in boymode (that's how everyone there knows me, none of them know anything about my trans status), and anxiety has restricted me from telling anyone about my trans stuff, even though I totally (via mannerisms/ect.) am attempting to, albeit slightly, present, or at least feel, like a girl. 

Edit 2: Ok so I brought it up with my boss when we were alone. It took all of 20 seconds; couldn't have been easier. I said, ""Hey ***** can we talk in private for a second?""  ""Sure""  We walk into a empty room ""Ok, so I've been taking a lot of bathroom breaks. I don't want you, or others, to think I'm just taking advantage... I'm taking a medication that makes me need to pee a lot. That's why."" ""Oh, that's fine. I'll let the other supervisors know, don't worry about it.""

Didn't need to say anything else, or have any other effort. I *should* be completely in the clear now. Thanks, fam. "
Orendor,asktransgender,Feasibility of transitioning during grad school?,"Howdy. I'm applying for a PhD in biochemistry later this year. 

I've been questioning my gender for a long time (assigned male) I'm currently growing my hair out and presenting more androgynous and I'm considering HRT. 

So I have several questions before committing to doing this right now. 




* 1) Finances. Stipends are hardly above the poverty line and while my parents can pay for my expenses, I have not come out to them at this time. Is HRT cheap enough that I can pay for it out of pocket? If it helps, I live in Texas. So far the data says yes, but I would like your input.




* 2) Emotions. Does HRT cause additional stress or side effects like mood swings in the beginning? Grad school is already going to be the highest stress point of my life, I'd like to keep away from burn out. 

Right now, as an undergrad, I've failed several classes due to worries about my gender keeping me up at night, but I think I have that sorted for the most part. (Though apparently tonight is an all nighter. I have three assignments due in the next 12 hours). 




* 3) Academia and being trans.
I know presenting as a woman is going to reduce my chances of being hired because of institutional sexism. In general, how are US graduate programs in terms of LGBT friendliness?

* 3b) I'm about to publish a paper. I'm pondering how to make sure I still get author credit should I change my name later. 




* 4) Hiding changes until the right time
My family is Russian, and while I don't think they'll disown me, I'm not ready to be out to them. Are there any negative effects I should worry about in regards to growing breasts and hiding them occasionally-often? Also, I've seen HRT take anywhere from months to years for really huge changes, how easy is it to conceal those?




* 5) Regarding parents and work
My parents are very close to retirement age, and my sister is not making enough to support herself. I need to be able to make enough to support all of them, so I'm not sure I can even BE a research scientist at a university and do that. Is there a list of trans-friendly workplaces anywhere? I've been thinking about the EPA since it's a government agency and equal opportunity laws ought to be enforced there . . . I hope. 



* 6) Reversibility of HRT.
I'm still having doubts about this.

I'm fairly sure that I will be happier with my body during HRT, but since I'm not completely sure, what is the average amount of time I could be on hormones before there would be no turning back?

 All I know is I see myself as female when I'm alone and studying with my best friend, coffee. And I ache for it when I'm skating. Those are the only times I feel free. Writing about myself with female pronouns pleases me on a deep level. I've so often felt trapped for an indescribable reason, that I now believe is associated with my gender identity. I am scheduling an appointment with the counseling center at my university tomorrow to help me be more sure. 



* 7) For kicks, here's a current image of myself: http://imgur.com/jUwMeUk I am currently 21, so I'm hoping I will not require surgery to get where I want to be.



* 8) not really a question . . . I'm actually terrified right now because of society, not because of who I am. I'm faking it till I make it in terms of confidence. I really hope no one I know finds this outside of the one or two people I'm out to. Any tips on dealing with the stress? 



* 9) trigger warning here for assault: I know caution is best. But in cases where that fails. Well, bluntly: will carrying a gun help keep me safe? I hate the fact I'm probably going to need my head on a swivel for at least a few years.

tatsmazzers,asktransgender,Organising a talk on trans people and feminism; need suggestions and advice,"Hello all, trans rep for a UK university feminist group here.




I’m doing a talk about trans people and feminism in like a week and a bit and I want to see what sort of things folk here think need to be discussed.




The talk will mostly be for cis feminist women; I want to start by defining important terms but this explicitly isn’t a trans 101, we’ve already had two of those this year.




I’m planning on talking about trans-exclusionary radical feminism and why it isn’t feminism and why it needs to die.




I’d like to talk about trans feminism but I’m very unsure what needs saying. Beyond having read *Whipping Girl* I only know a few names and I have no idea how to present the concept beyond ‘this exists, read Julia Serano’. I suppose I could mention the campaign for the removal of GID and its replacement by gender dysphoria though any advice here would be welcome.




I know a nonbinary person who works at the students’ union who said they’d be willing to talk about nonbinary people not feeling included in feminist spaces. I’m also friendly with a trans man who could speak to the same. Given how women-centred feminism is this makes complete sense but I was wondering if anyone here could explain this and why it is an issue in a way that a cis person might understand? I don’t want to speak for people who aren’t trans women.




I want to finish by talking about how feminist groups can support the trans community. I have a few statistics on trans women and the wider trans community’s experiences of physical and sexual violence and I want to make it clear that these are issues that deserve recognition alongside the experiences of cis women. The state of trans healthcare in this country and how it represents a violation of our rights to our bodies is also very important. Obviously inclusion and challenging transphobia will be stressed.




Considering I only have an hour and a half and I want to leave time for questions and discussion I have absolutely no idea what the final talk will look like at the moment but I really want to know if I’m missing things out or if any of the stuff I’ve said here is stupid or needs rethinking.




Thank you for any and all replies!"
BlueGreen185,asktransgender,Carecredit financing for FFS,"I'm doing preliminary research into FFS surgeons, and I've noticed that many list carecredit financing. I've used that for various home improvement projects before, and I've always gotten a promotional 0% interest period for 12-24 months in those cases.

Has anyone looked into this? Is it the same sort of promotional 0% period in the case of FFS? Is it typical for surgeons to offer a discount if things are paid for in full upfront? Thanks!

jeflint,asktransgender,"Mtf exercise help, general fatigue","Hey everyone,

I've been a long time lurker here and this site has been amazing for information gathering. I've been on estridol and Spiro now for a few months it'll be 6 months on April 26th.

I was a solid built guy before I started, 315 which with diet alone cut 40 lbs, about three months before I began HRT I joined an intense sports performance program through a hospital in Richmond Virginia because my goal is bottom half surgery, supposed to be 210 before that.

I've noticed mostly that I've been loosing grip strength, I used to crush the captain's of crush 2 with little work, now I barely move the ones, so yay!

My concern is I'm still big linebacker type, and haven't lost much weight. I teeter totrer in the mid 290s. I have a lot of work left to do. I'm trying for 150 to 160 which will take time I know.

I work out three times a week forty minutes weight training 20 minutes interval cardio. My problem really started this week where I workout and I'm just not recovering and its impacting my potential workout.

I know about the loss of endurance the muscle loss, I'm looking for ways to help with recovery. If I'm going to lose muscle that's fine but I don't want to go to each workout half dead and injure myself and really mess myself up.

Any thoughts, suggestions or ideas are welcome. My personal trainer has interns learning the system and ate the big trainers so how can I help them help me lose weight healthfully and not tear stuff in the process yet still be ready for my every other workout routine?"

My T levels below female range, I take 50 mg of cypro a day."
StrikingDawn,asktransgender,I'm doubting myself so much; I feel even worse than before,"About a 3 days ago I made a post here asking for an opinion of whether I was trans or not, and got a lot of ""Yes that seems pretty indicative to me"" responses. The problem is, over the past week,after having told many friends about how I feel, I'm beginning to feel an increasing amount of doubt over the legitimacy of me actually being trans or not. My only ""signs"" were mostly fairly late into my life, during puberty, and i'm only NOW beginning to feel what I guess would be dysphoria. I can go back and grasp at straws all day, and it often feels like I *want* to be trans and am constantly seeking validation of that. I've done some things that cis men who were comfortable with their gender would *never* do (fantasize, stuff things down my shirt, commit so much headspace to just the idea, etc), but at the same time I always think that I just *want* to be this way. I'm so confused by everything that I've been feeling lately and I especially don't want to project this as a cause for the depression I have if it just isn't. And above all else, I don't want to make my friends and family's life absolute hell and put them through further stress for something I don't end up having. Every time I think of the transition process, I first think about how i'd enjoy it and *likely* be happier because of it, but then my mind always shifts to how it'll affect everyone around me and if I really wanted to go through such a long process.

I have my first ever appointment with a therapist on Tuesday, and he's already been clued in to how I feel by my school counselor, who made the referral. Regardless of what I think, i'm going to tell him everything about how I feel, but i'm so unbelievably nervous/anxious about it that it's driving me insane.

Sorry for just rambling, but I absolutely **have** to know: Is there any way i'm just completely wrong and what I've been feeling lately is just a fluke?"
thr0waw8m8,asktransgender,Not really sure what is it with me.(M/20),"Hi. This is a throw-away acc, so I'll just assume I can tell you my story without consequences.

When I was very young (pre-school propably) I found out that guilty pleasure and need to get through my mother's stuff when everyone went away. No idea why. If it was would be about role models, I'd rather be like my father, a really cool guy with his shit together.

And it got me an erection. So I instinctively did what one does with a boner. And it continued pretty much forever.
I literally just thought about these things and got hard.
  
It kinda ""evolved"" into browsing internet for pictures of such nature (cartoonized mostly), when I got an access to it. I also found some definitions of ""transvestitism"" and multiple stories of people dealing with it. I never told anyone.

For years I would find these things to get me hard, and not many things besides that.. Direct contact with a girl ""worked"" though.

I just assumed I was some hopeless fetishist, and it would be best to just keep it for myself. In some time I started to feel disgust about it and myself.

I've read a lot about people changing their physical sex, about HRT, and lots of other things. But most of the time i just fapped to it.. I don't know if I was thinking with my dick for all these years, or if that dick got in my way everytime I was onto something.

Especially lately I've been having these thoughts. 
Recently, I wanted to do a crossplay for a convention in my country. I got really into it, and didn't want to get a boner involved again, so with all my willpower I just ingnored it. 

But I still wanted to do that 'play. Wanted to do the best I can do, planning 6 months ahead. Looking for a way to be as passable as can be. I got really into it, even if with no desire to fap to it.

At this point I thought more and more about the GID. Maybe that was the case the whole time, and my dick and fear of being rejected/ridiculed stopped any thought about it? 

I found myself a bit frustrated about the already wide shoulders and already developed male skeleton, which any hormone couldn't affect at this point. Whatever I was at this point, there is no going back, and not every option is still available.

I guess I wanted to try that crossplay thingy to see if I find myself comfortable like this.

Any and every response is very much appreciated.

mrlanon,asktransgender,Not sure who I am,"So, I am back from a therapy session as I'm writing this. I am a bit distressed, but otherwise happy that I tell someone personally my feelings.

Now I am making this post because at this point I'm heavily confused as to who I am. I've written out my backstory too many times so I'll just [hand one here](http://pastebin.com/cHDajmRY) as a point of reference. 

Now I'm not sure what I truly feel gender wise. I don't mind my genitals being there but I do mind my physique.  I figured losing weight would solve it, but it didn't. I can't really bring myself to lose more weight as I'd begin to dabble to underweight levels. I at least know that's not a solution.

My mother disapproves of femininity(I once hinted during my last weight loss attempt(71+/- kg to 60-67 kg @ 1.78cm) that I'd tried to look more feminine to which she negatively replied.)

So I personally don't feel completely like a woman(mentally), but too some degree do(on scale 3-6/10 depending on the day) and preferred to look more feminine than masculine in most circumstances.

I feel that I don't particularily care about what sex I am born as. I feel I'd just have comparable issues(if I had the same mind) as I have now.

I don't know yet fully how I feel about more drastic(HRT or anything in between) things. I wished I had more information on it, as I now have only basic information on it. I know of some repercussions, but don't know if that's always the case or it can be done in a light manner. Say you have a headache. Both morphine and paracetamol can relieve the headache but morphine is far stronger/dangerous than paracetamol.

This happened all suddenly and I'm not sure whether this has been boiling up and I've simply been repressed by myself and my mother, or if it's something else.

Now I have a new appoint with my mom in 2 weeks to discuss this."
Countdown2Control,asktransgender,"Full time job, high school work, 3.9 gpa and violent transphobic mom. Can't handle this shit.

Also, MN laws says you can't kick a 16 year old out legally. 

Anyway, my grades have been suffering lately because I'm a little bitch with untreated dsyphoria who gets overwhelmed. Untreated because again although diagnosed mom is a violent transphobe. 

Now, I have this cashier job. It pays well and I work the max 30 hours per week minors can work (according to company.) Mom doesn't want me to work there because she knows I'm saving up for gender reassignment surgery and to get the hell away from her. 

My school life suffers due to all this. 
She continues to be violently transphobic and honestly she has abused and ruined my life enough already. (I'm not talking about 'wahhh mom won't get me a phone.' I mean she has locked me in exorcism room for 5 days and paid 500 dollars for it while encouraging them to beat me.)

I am one more thing away from stabbing her. I'm fed up. (Yeah yeah violence not the answer but that's her native language.)
What should I do I'm failing. I can't stay here anymore without snapping or her snapping and killing me.
But CPS is a bitch to deal with. They'll take all of us away not just the tr*anny problem child. She doesn't hurt the other ones. I should just die honestly. The solution to this shit is obvious. Either go or be gone.

helpmestopmyselfpls,asktransgender,I just debated a red piller...,"I felt like I was arguing with a TERF. Has anyone else had this experience? My main reason for posting this is that I was addressed with bizarre arguments. I was that if trans women could become women, they'd have female privilege, which in the west is what's running rampant. Male privilege in the west does not exist and is the product of ""third wave feminist lies"". Their reasoning was because men are drafted for war, fight and die for war and all of women's freedoms, etc., while they get pampered and objectified like queen's. Men also die more in the work force and have more suicide attempts than women, including trans women, so I was told. His second point that baffled me was that gender roles are making women unhappy, not because they're here, but because of ""gender equality"". Some PsychologyToday article about women generally being unhappy was cited, probably the first result on Google. Basically, women are happier in the long term being cared for and not being in places of power or having any dominance. He said this is why women, despite having ""more rights than men"", do not often peruse positions of power in government. He said being ""weak/dependent and subservient"" is in a woman's biology, and not entirely cultural, so a trans woman couldn't possibly understand that. Apparently, gender roles are also ""80%"" biology, so hence us trans women being ""faux women"" or ""manginas"". 

So, how do you guys feel about this? What would be your logical retort, beyond ""bullshit tactics to invalidate us"", because that's really all I could say. I cannot fathom gender roles being innate and necessary for women to function. "

[deleted],asktransgender,I just can't handle this anymore.,"i hope this makes sense because i'm on the edge of crying now so idk if i can be rational but basically:

so my situation is that my identity is mostly agender with some femininity and it heavily involves distancing myself from anything masculine. but i'm amab and not out yet irl, although i'm out online. because of this, i need to kind of pretend to be at least somewhat masculine irl which is... i just feel like it's hurting me more and more and i can't take it anymore. i was always a sensitive person but now i angrily explode regularly because i just can't how i have to hide my identity plus it's reached the point where i sometimes miss out on socialising just to come online where i can be myself and this really hurts me. i just can't take the stress and i feel like i'll become worse and worse and angrier and angrier if i don't come out but i also got to hear how many of my friends think that trans or nonbinary identities aren't real so if i come out then my social relations will be severely hurt which again isn't a viable option because it's very hard for me to make new friends and i feel like i can't believe i'll find friends even though this is what i keep saying to any trans person asking for similar help but i can't get myself to believe it

so essentially my options are losing most of my friends or slowly losing my mind as the stress eats me and i have no idea what to do and i can't handle this

ohgoshthis,asktransgender,North Carolina doctors?,"Last year, I came out to my mother and general practitioner as transgender (ftm). We want to get started transitioning me asap, but my GP said he's not qualified to handle that sort of stuff. He called around and someone at Chapel Hill told him that they work with transgender transitioning, so my doctor set up an appointment.

We drove two hours only to find out that the doctor I was supposed to see told me they didn't know anything about transgender issues, they told me repeatedly that I needed a sex therapist and made some very insulting generalizations about me, along with some other things that were very unprofessional. We told my GP, and he apparently went off on the people who talked to me (one of the many reasons he's awesome, he takes me seriously and sticks up for me), but now we're not sure what I can do. 

I'm not in charge of my medical care because I'm disabled (I'm an adult, but I've got autism bad enough that I have severe trouble dealing with people), but my mother never secludes me from making any decisions, she just gets the final say, so I'm not entirely sure exactly what we were told. But apparently before I can qualify for any type of surgery, I need to see a doctor that specializes in transgender psychology for a few months to make sure I'm serious about this, but we can't find any around the west Piedmont area. Currently, our search is on hold because of other issues, but does anyone know of any good psychologists or doctors in general in NC who are used to dealing with my sort of issues? I'm very nervous about trying again because of how bad my experience at Chapel Hill was, but if it's what needs to be done to get me closer to what I need to be, then I will put up with it.

I'm sorry if I rambled a bit, I wasn't entirely sure what all was necessary to include. Also, this is mostly a throwaway because some family members know my normal accounts username, and they don't know I'm transgender.

Edit: Thinking back, I think it might have been Winston-Salem I went to instead of Chapel Hill. It was early last year, and I've had a lot of other stuff I've been dealing with lately, so the memory is a bit fuzzy."
sasashimi,asktransgender,my speech therapist showed me that i have a mental block holding me back at the moment - are there any methods that i can try to help me get past this faster?,"i've been seeing a speech therapist for a couple of weeks, and i'm making some progress and doing the exercises fairly well, but when it comes to actually speaking ""in the wild"" i often revert back to a more male sounding voice. last session, she measured my voice pitch while reading some phrases, and i measured in the upper male range at first. however, she then had me do it again while crumpling some paper beside both of my ears so that i couldn't hear myself speak, and i immediately measured squarely in the female range - it was like magic. has anyone else had this experience, and was there anything in particular that helped you to move past the subconscious self-adjustment to the male range? i'd also be curious on theories as to why this self-adjustment occurs in the first place - is this simply a result of being socialised as male?"
CharlotteAria,asktransgender,Interesting question one of my friends posed me on the definition of being trans,"What defines being trans? Is it the need for transition to pass? My friend asked me a question that stumped me. 

For context, she she a religious family friend who had a daughter. A cis female, who ID`d as a female. They had wanted a son, so they forced her to dress as a man and bind and the like. Now, she has to go through the process of coming out to everyone she knows and continuing life as a woman. Would she fall somewhere under the trans umbrella?

I told them I`d get back to them, but the person would most likely ID somewhere underneath the genderqueer/nonbinary system."
linguinee,asktransgender,Correcting others when they misgender someone?,"When person Z misgenders person A (who is out), and person A isn't present, it's straightforward to correct person Z (""person A uses &lt;insert pronouns here&gt;"" and move on). However, what do you do when person Z misgenders person A, and person A is present?

One situation I've been in is where I was in a large group of people divided into smaller groups. Someone in my small group (person Z) misgendered someone in another group (person A). Flailing at the right thing to do, I glanced over at person A and I'm pretty sure they heard person Z use the wrong pronoun. I froze and didn't say anything – I think I should have done the same thing in the situation where person A wasn't in the room, right? I think everyone in the small group just froze because we didn't know if the best thing would be to call attention to person Z's pronoun usage for varying reasons/fears.

Another situation that is probably dependent on person A is when we're all in a group and someone misgenders them. Would the best thing just be to ask person A beforehand on what to do in those situations? What if you don't know person A well and/or haven't asked them beforehand, and the situation occurs? Best to take their lead on things and then ask them afterwards if possible?"
Idon7be1ong,asktransgender,Will I ever be 100% sure?,"I'm convinced that I'm going to start HRT, is there any point in me waiting around to see if my life will magically change overnight and I will be a normal cis male?  I know the answer to that question, so its kind of rhetorical.

After all this time of doing just that you would think I would have learned by now that it is **not going away**.

I keep asking myself if I'm sure I really *need* to do this, and saying ""no I don't"" just leaves me feeling empty and void of hope, void of a future.  Saying ""yes I do"" leaves me with a sense of hope and happiness, but it also leaves me with a sense of urgency as well as some anxiety.

Do you think starting HRT will help me answer some questions and help me gauge whether or not this truly is the right path for me to take?"

baneofthebanshee,asktransgender,How to address transgender issues with a friend?,"To start off, I am new to this sub. I came here looking for some advice on how to address transgender issues with one of my friends. I would consider myself an ally (as I do not identify as transgender myself) but I am very pro transgender rights. This is why it bothered me when I found that one of my friends had posted a link to an article about bathroom accommodations in public space. I apologize if this a tired topic for this community, but I'm afraid I don't quite know how to tackle this issue. The article talks about people exploiting laws that let people use restrooms that line up with what they identify as a means to rape.

Here are my thoughts on it: 

-Rapists will rape, no matter the setting.

-Rape does not just happen from one gender to another

-It's not ethical to take away someones right to something so basic because of basically fear mongering

Anonymootrans,asktransgender,Do transwomen ever fully grow breasts?,"This sounds super shallow, but I really wish my breasts were larger and more womanly I guess? I want to feel sexy!

Buuuut I haven't really seen breasts on a transwoman that look similar to a ciswomans. At least when they haven't got implants. They always seem to be shallow and small.

I guess I'm just worried (that much never changes) that mine would just be ugly and small forever. Unless I get a BA, which I'm not totally keen on. 

Like I've been on HRT for a year and a half and they barely fit in a 12a bra. Like I know that theres still more time but it seems like people who grow larger often have already done so at this point. It doesnt seem fortunate for me. Like are there even any cases where someone is an a cup for this long and then they suddenly get growth?

I guess being underweight doesnt help, but thats more to do with fat. I do eat enough. I thought my HRT results would be good if I started at 16 years old. But I guess YMMV. Damn I hate this body of mine. :/"

livelovelifelike,asktransgender,tone of voice at work.,"hi friends,

i stopped estrogen a few weeks ago. i decided, i am happy with being genderfluid for the time being. at work, i speak to girls &amp; gay guys in a feminine (sort've even gay) tone but i speak to straight guys in a more guy-ish tone. i've been really anxious starting a new job that people think i'm really fake because i talk in different tones to different people. my co-worker brought up a recent NPR podcast episode about a transwoman who jumped back and forth in gender, in a very subtle way to me to almost compare me to that person. my gender doesn't really jump back and forth. i'm just a very feminine male person but in front of straight guys, i am more comfortable talking in a more male tone even if they know i am gay and/or genderfluid. and i know that they feel more comfortable that way too.

am i just being really insecure?

kirito1342,asktransgender,I might fake my death or fake run away.,"So I'm a 15 m, I had pretty bad dysphoria while my Xbox live expired. My parents refused to buy me another one so I could talk to my friends or play games. I earned some money by selling my stuff on craigslist. 

So a few days ago I bought a membership and Xbox money. And my dysphoria was completely gone while I played. I felt good and still wanted to be a girl but I felt a lot better.

But I keep feeling deppresed each time I think of my parents knowing I'm trans. Just today I was going to put in the code for the Xbox money. So I left it on a table over night and in the morning it was gone.

I literally searched all day for it, lifting up the couch, looking under everything. Checking each room. So I ask my parents if the saw it. They said that they threw it away it looked like trash.

So I run outside grab the trash bag and get something to cover my hand with and I look through the trash. My dad says that he will help me look. So he sits there while I look though trash. He starts telling me how a smart person wouldn't leave there stuff out in the open. Also how it's all my fault that it was in there. 

He just sat there saying that stuff so I tell him that if he is not going to help like he said then he can leave. That got him posses of and he starts screaming at me telling me how I'm wasting my life away. How he hated me. 

So that kinda pushed me over the limit. So right now I'm thinking about waking up early and going in my shed to hide for a while. Or making a fake murder.

I'm 8 months into HRT, and while I have seen plenty of changes, I'm no where near reaching anything like ""male-fail"".  I just look so freakin manly.  All estrogen has done physically is make me look younger, and give me boobs and soft skin.  I still have my upper body muscle, I still have my giant forehead and brow ridge.  There's absolutely no way I will pass without FFS. I also need a hair transplant, or at least wigs.  I kind of had this feeling when I started, but it's so frustrating that I have to wait till I can afford it.  Still, I worry that all I'll ever see is a guy in the mirror, and I worry about my mental health if/when that becomes a reality.

It's not productive to compare yourself to others, so I try to avoid that.  But it's frustrating seeing people who get to full-time after just 6-12 months of HRT.  I'm so happy for them, but I'll never know that.  It's years away for me.  Maybe a decade.  I imagine at 3 years HRT, I'll just look like an odd dude, but still definitely male.

I made a thread about a month ago about coming out to my dad. Short version: Had to move back home to save up some cash for college, came out to him, he said he would be supportive but ended up going a bit loopy about it but we managed to smooth things out. 

Well here's an update: I had to buy his truck a new set of tires (eating most of my savings) and now he's kicking me out in about a week and a half now because he's decided that he just can't/won't deal with me being trans. Fun. 

I'm from Cali but am currently stuck in bumblescrew Mississippi in a campground (we've been RVing). The nearest town is and NOT LGBT friendly and isn't big enough to have any shelters, all it has are a few churches. 

I've got no idea what to do? I work a few microjobs but they don't pay very much and as a writer but I don't have time to put in any bids for any jobs because I have to worry about where I'm going to be sleeping soon.

Any ideas? No, there isn't a chance I can get him to change his mind. He's been fairly abusive to me off/on over the years and I know he'll have no issue throwing me out and then telling everybody that ""he did everything he could for that boy but he's just useless"". "
bebopbaloobop,asktransgender,Question from cismale dating MTF (Update),"It's been a few weeks, but I wanted to let all of you that offered input on my situation know how things are going.  I included a link to the original post below.  Hopefully, if someone else is ever in a similar situation, they might find my experience beneficial to them.

https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/44iozr/question_from_cismale_dating_mtf/

If you've read the original post, you'll know that I discovered my girlfriend was a transgender person, MTF, and you'll know that we had somewhat of a strange period after the secret came out.  Fast forward to now...

So far, at this point, we are still good.  And we have both learned a lot from the situation.

One thing I would like to clear up, because I was telling a mostly one sided version of this story to begin with... The way she 'told' me that she was a MTF person.  It's partly my fault, we were in the heat of the moment, and me being a guy probably pushed her into moving faster than she wanted, I pulled her pants down, not her.  We've discussed this, and while it was not her preferred way of telling me, she told me that she wanted to tell me for sometime, but as time went on she became more and more afraid to bring it up, she said sometimes she thought I already knew because of her breasts(I only knew they were fake, huh? Is there that much difference between cisfemale and MTF boobs? I sure can't tell), and after the first couple of months she was absolutely terrified to tell me because she feared that her lying about it would cause me a good amount of grief. First off, I don't consider it lie, it's not like I ever asked her if she were female or male or transgender or whatever... Did not cause me any grief either, just a good bit of confusion.

She said she wanted to tell me, but just didn't know how after so long, and was relieved that keeping it secret was over.  She was scared when it happened, shaking and looking at me waiting for something bad to happen.  She spent a lot of time talking about how scared she can be because of that way people have reacted over being told way earlier in the relationship than we were, and even at first meeting.  She's 34 and has been presenting as a female since 16, HRT since 19.  In that time she's been ridiculed, humiliated, belittled, beaten, threatened to be killed.  She figured after knowing me for so long, that I would not be the type to freak out and hurt her, maybe leave her, but not treat her poorly.

She said at one point she thought about never telling me and eventually leaving me before I found out just because for one of the few times in her life she felt completely female.  It nearly broke my heart to hear her say that, not because she would leave me, but because I started to understand what she goes through on a daily basis.

We kept moving forward, opening up, asking each other questions.  Exploring what we are comfortable with physically.  Me having strict instructions to always treat her like a woman, the same way I did before I found out.

I've gone to her support group with her twice since this all happened, I've met several of her transgender friends.  I'm gaining a lot of insight into her life, and her thoughts throughout all of this, and making quite a few awesome friends in the process.  I'm also starting to understand why so many of you commented that I was a pretty OK guy for being as accepting as I have been.  I have heard so many horror stories, and have been compared to an angel by pretty much all her friends.  I don't like it, but I understand why you say it now.  

As far as intimacy goes... That was my biggest source of confusion... I have learned so much.  As for her, she likes to be treated like a woman %100 of the time.  But on occasion... There may be moments that require some adjustment on my part.  I learned that normally, due to her HRT, that her 'outie' doesn't always stand to full attention like that way it did the night I found out.  She has said over and over that she is very embarrassed that it happened, because normally she tries not to acknowledge that it exists.  But sometimes, it happens, and she does like to release the tension, or even have someone help her release it.  As a straight male, I was happy to hear that she usually pretends it doesn't exist.  Also, as a straight male, I was horrified to know that she would appreciate my help in taking care of those needs if the occasion should ever... you get the point...

This is where she became standoffish, distant, difficult, and unable to express how she wanted to be intimate.  Once again, the fear of rejection.  She knew I was cool with her being MTF, she just wasn't sure how I was with being hands on with her bits when they overwhelmed her.  I wasn't either.  All I can say, I'm pretty ok with what she's told me she would like... so far... I have no idea how much more she is hiding, if anything, about her sexual preferences.  Maybe she does want to poke me?  LOL... She says she doesn't and I've made it clear, I'd rather not go down that path.  

Other than physical intimacy, we are still discussing new things everyday.  Children came up, what to do about children?  Did I want them, did I not?  Would I adopt, find a woman to have one, etc..  

It's not so simple, at least not to me.  Especially when all these things confront you at once.  I have honestly never thought about children.  I've never thought about having to please the male part of my girlfriend.  I've never thought about a lot of the things we are discussing right now.

Is it always this hard?  I know it's tough for me, because so much of this is new to me.  How is dating in general for trans folk?  How do you approach and get past these issues?  We've figured the sex out.  Now we're trying to figure out everything else.  All the easy stuff is taken care of, we like being together and hate being apart.  The plus side to all of this is that from this point on, most of what happens is a first for her as well.  Sad, but true, this is the first time she's had what she is calling a real relationship.  

I want to hold her tight and tell her I love her... I still think it's too soon for me to know if I do or not.  My heart pounds every time I'm near her... I'm starting to think it's not just the physical attraction doing it to me.

MissHalina,asktransgender,Electro Blues - Input Requested,"I'm getting run down lately and looking for help. I'm running the same gauntlet as many of you in the seemingly never ending endeavor to rid myself of facial hair. 12 sessions of laser adn &lt; 10 hours of electro and the shit still won't die. Let's cut to the point, I'm apparently a wimp and unable to handle the pain as she works on my face. I take 3-4 advil liquids an hour before and tried 2 different numbing creams that have been mostly ineffective (they dull it ever so slightly, but not enough). I have this electrologist working on me like ""oh this usually doesn't hurt this much""...well thanks a lot for the comfort. And now she has to start working on the nether region in prep for my Nov 2017 surgery day and I'm terrified of what that's going to entail.

Have any of you found a more effective way to deaden the pain than wishful thinking? It's 2016 and the line that ""oh the pain is part of the experience; you need to weather it"" feels like utter bullshit."
CwnAnnwn,asktransgender,Is androgyny a trap during transition?,"I'm MTF and I've been transitioning for 8 months now. I've fallen into this safety net of dressing androgynously. Jeans, plaid, etc. I look good just androgynous.

Anyway I've bern dressing this way since the start of my transition and its kept me quite safe. People don't know my gender and so they kinda just leave me alone. Point is, I feel safe but not womanly.

I've worn dresses out only twice and while I love them the anxiety was overwhelming. For example I was unable to bring myself to speak for fear if getting clocked. I spent an hour or two out then had to go home due to having a panic attack.

Everyone I know and strangers tell me I pass in person. Everyone. I cannot see it though. I'm starting to think my androgynous safety net is holding me back. What are you're thoughts?

(this post does not refer to genderqueer people but simply presenting androgynous for safety not identity)."
defsophiaray,asktransgender,What's are good approaches to gender-specific spaces for pre- and mid-transition folks?,"The context is that I'm newish to the world of being a trans girl. I've bought some clothes and such online but I find it quite expensive and time consuming to buy clothes that might not fit (even if I measure) or might not look great on me.

Last weekend I worked up the courage to go shopping for clothes with my wife. I've seen a number of couples go into dressing rooms together and I'm still very much between male and androgynous in appearance (I thought I was making some progress but it's difficult to know in boy clothes and this story doesn't make me feel much better). So I thought going in together would be a decent approach for entering the ""Women's fitting room"". 

No such luck. We get to the counter where they count the number of items you bring into the rooms to make sure you don't steal anything and after counting everything up the woman tells me ""You can't go in"". I sort of stare at her like she's making no sense even though I'm pretty sure I know exactly what's happening and then she explains ""It's 'women's' "". Which is just crushing. 

But mostly my question is, how can I get out of this Catch 22? In order to get into a fitting room I need to look feminine enough. And one big part of looking feminine enough is finding (non-boy) clothes that fit and look good on me. Should I be more patient and stick to online stuff until I feel good about passing? Are there certain stores to avoid or go to (This was at Primark in Boston)? Should I just stick up for myself? I *really* considered making a scene when I was staring at her wondering if she was actually going to misgender me. But my voice is somewhat borderline masculine right now and it becomes really masculine when I get riled up. Also this was my first serious misgendering in public and I didn't have it in me that day."
Adapt_Evolve_Become,asktransgender,Should I go to the UK or Canada to finish transitioning?,"Hi, my name is Jason, I'm 26 year old FTM, currently living in Australia. There are scarce GRS surgeons in Australia, there are little to no reviews of the ones that do exist and much to my dismay, the one or two surgeons who do perform FTM phalloplasty here, they do not do RFF. They do ALT or public flap, neither procedure is the one I desire. To top it off, I hear many local folk preferring to go overseas to Dr. Miro in Serbia, Dr. Crane in USA, Dr. Lee in the UK or Thailand. 

Why UK &amp; Canada? They have free health care, specifically free transgender health care. I don't care about the waiting times for either country, anything is better than struggling to save 50k on my own in Australia and that is not even counting the extra expenses of flights, accommodation, food, prescription and other hospital fees if I choose an overseas surgeon. Whichever country I go with, I intend to become a citizen of said country.

With UK, I have a grandmother who was born in the UK (now resides in Australia), so I may be eligible for Ancestry Visa. I finish up graphic design studies, intend to complete Diploma this year and Advanced Diploma next year. I may or may not spend 2018 gathering experience working as a graphic designer in Australia (most likely Melbourne or Sydney, as due to the isolated nature of Perth, there will be little jobs available.) then I will take flight to the UK beginning of 2019. Since the Ancestry Visa will allow me to both reside and work in the UK, this will allow me to access the NHS.

With Canada, my grandmother's sister (also born in UK, now resides in Canada) lives with her husband. She has always said she would love it if I could move to Canada, she'd be more than happy to help me by letting me stay at their place while I get on my own two feet, show me around Calgary and so on. I am unsure about the process of transitoning in Canada since I flooded all my research into the UK the last six months. Can anyone from Canada pitch in?

So I guess it's a matter of whether I wanna fly solo to the UK or be with relatives for a short time in Canada before getting my own place? Is there any help or advice for me?

My gender psychiatrist, gender therapist and endocrinologist are more than happy to compile the paperwork for me to help me with completing my transition overseas.

Thanks!"
oyveythrowavay,asktransgender,Transitioning FtM Q's,"Hi all, 

Posting this on behalf of my partner who is transitioning from female to male. Arguably the hardest thing he'll ever do in his life, and he's got a ton of questions but is afraid to ask, so I'm doing this anonymously on his behalf to help.

He's a late 20s female transitioning to male in Northern California, with full health care coverage under Blue Shield CA.

Questions are as follows:

1- Where does he start ? Whats the initial process? Speak to a therapist then get goin' along? HRT? There's very little documentation I've found in my searches that clearly outlines a solid and safe path.

2- How much (if any) is covered by healthcare/insurance? I'm sure others have blazed this trail before and I'd love insight into it.

3- Any / all advice, tips etc would be GREATLY appreciated.

I do apologize if I'm using the incorrect terms/process, but this is a learning experience for the two of us, and I want to make sure he's taken care of every step of the way.

Thank you.

p.s. if this already exists in a WIKI or something, please let me know and I'll delete the post."

Anonayer,asktransgender,Emotional challenges around pregnancy in cis/trans lesbian relationship,"This is my venting account now, I guess, but I'm not writing to vent I'm writing to ask and process and troubleshoot here so that my wife doesn't need to explain it/live through it all again/etc. I know, I've read many books over many years, we've spoken about this specifically, and I'm even trained in clinical counseling to round out my understanding about how painful it is to be unable to bear children for many cis women and many trans women; however, in this moment I'm unable to pause and be more compassionate without help. I'm newly pregnant (knock on wood) after two years of fertility treatment. It's even both our biological child, which is more than a small gift. We've planned this pregnancy more carefully than we've planned anything in our lives. Everything is there, everything is...amazing. In truth, I wished for her, and us, that she could carry in the beginning (if it were only possible), but it falls on me and we've even managed to work around a serious illness I live with so that I can carry safely. So....

My question(s):

How can we both celebrate this beautiful gift together without it causing her this pain?

How do I support her so that I get to share my physical, emotional, etc. experience of this pregnancy with my dearest wife without that very sharing acting as a hurtful reminder of what is so painful to her?

More selfishly...when do I get to demand she get therapy to deal with this specific ""limitation,"" as she sees it, so that we can celebrate this miracle of nature?

Should I just stfu, share with cis girl friends/others, and deal?

Anyway, the obvious answer is ""just go talk to her"" but I figured I'd ask for wisdom from the Reddit community first.

Also, I've been off the Reddit world and know how things change so quickly. What other subs would enjoy supporting this question? Do you recommend I repost other places?"
acheyshakey,asktransgender,Speed up learning things you should have learned in childhood?,"You know how during transition you learned things you should have learned many moons ago, about yourself, about the world, about society?

Is there any way to speed this process up? 
Or to supplement it other than just normal daily life?


One of the main things I'm noticing: 
When women look at me with emotion (i.e. rage, fear, jealousy), those emotions act like a current that run through me and into my own life. 

I've watched other (cis) women do this to each other and it's like they learned during puberty to automatically reflect back what another girl throws at them. 
 
So if girl A looks at girl B with rage, girl B will just return it on autopilot so it doesn't infiltrate her reality. 
I haven't quite learned this skill, so I'm essentially taking everything home with me.

Note: I'm using women as an example but this, and probably other cues, aren't necessarily gendered but I just didn't learn them when I was presenting male. I just kind of stayed inside.

georgemitch,asktransgender,Should I try conversion therapy if I see no chance of ever being able to pass at all?,"1.I am tall. My height is in the 99th percentile of women in my country. 2.I have a big head. Theres no womens wig for my head size. 3.My parents are extremely conservative. They would beat me if they ever find out I hide women clothes. 4. I also have the deepest voice in the world. Today I looked into the mirror and found mysekf looking more masculine than last year. Hormones are destroying my body and I cannot do anything about this. Maybe I should give conversion therapy a try and if Im lucky I would stop being trans and live up to everyones expectations. Life is easier this way. "
CharlieThePaperLady,asktransgender,Hey! I know we all look for trans-related media that's good and not about being trans (at least I do!) So I wanted to suggest a book series to you!,"Hey! So, are you looking for something to read? Or somebody to kind of identify to? Well this book series is really, really, really good (like, I cried a lot reading it but also got the ""whoa this is fucking awesome"" butterflies)

The series chronology is way complicated though:

1-the farseer trilogy (Fitz)
2-the liveships traders trilogy
3-tawny man trilogy (Fitz)
4-rain wilds chronicles quadrilogy
5-Fitz and the fool trilogy (Fitz)

That's the chronological order. I'm writing it down because most people don't even know there are books after the first trilogy.

And now onto why this a super cool trans story:

This is mainly about Fitz, the bastard of the heir to the Crown prince. He has some magic but I'm not saying which type. The story revolves around him in the first, third and fifth trilogies. What is ""trans about this"" is his best friend/almost only friend/companion. Their name is The Fool, the snarkiest and most fabulous jester ever. And he is androgynous as hell, presenting male but sometimes failing at it at first. In the second trilogy, far away from Fitz, he is presenting female. She comes back to Fitz and goes back to male. He also switches between the two, and we meet another, younger gender fluid character which the Fool take under their wing. The fool also feels much of the same things we all do, and sometimes, but rarely, talks about dysphoria in his own subtle ways (mainly later in the series)

There's also romance, love, betrayals, magics, assassinations, mind games, manipulations, war, pain, intense and overbearing solitude, and intense kinship.

So yeah, if you're looking for something to read, try this world-book. I have never been as hooked into a world before, simply because I got so, so attached to Fitz that I couldn't drop the book. I know I haven't talked much about him, but this is my favorite character from anything ever. You follow him from 5 years old to him having gray hair and oh so many responsibilities.

TL;DR: read The Farseer series, because the Fitz and the Fool (with a certain canine companion) trio is the love of my reading life"
SockRobot,asktransgender,Can I get discussion and advice?,"**TL;DR How do I know I'm actually trans?** 

This seemed like the most appropriate subreddit to post this in. Honestly, I'm just looking for someone to help point me in a decent direction, or at the very least listen to me.

I've never been an overyly masculine guy, and I've always hated falling into manly stereotypes. I've had loads of people tell me I might be gay over the course of my life, including my parents. I've always envied the female body, and for years have often wanted to know what it's like to be a woman. I've recently been experimenting with crossdressing, and I honestly think I might love it. For the past few months, the concept of ""switching sides"" has crossed my mind more times than I can count.

But on the other hand, I'm comfortable with who I am. Being a guy is cool, it's easy, and I have tons of friends and a solid family that know me for who I am and accept me. I don't necessarily love who I am, but that could be a product of my low confidence rather than some form of dysphoria.

I know I should see a therapist, as that seems to be the most common advice around here, but how would I even go about finding a good one? And what if this is all some form of ""the grass is always greener"" type phase, and I waste money on a therapist for nothing?

Or, worse yet, what if I am trans? What do I even do? How do I pay for transitioning and surgery? What if I'm too old and it's too late for me to be passable? All my life I've cared so much about what people think of me. I know my parents, girlfriend, and some friends will accept me, but what about everyone else? I couldn't handle having anyone suddenly think lower of me for something like this. And what if I go through SRS some day and end up regretting it?

I just don't know what to do. It seems a lot of people here hated their old selves to the point of depression, and are confident about moving forward and changing their body. That makes me incredibly conflicted. I so badly want to at least try to change, but I feel comfortable with where I am now, too. I feel like there's something wrong with me for feeling this way, but if I talked to anyone in person they'd judge me (except for my girlfriend, but she has so much going on right now already).

Where do I even begin?"
Satan_Gang,asktransgender,How do you travel on plane with meds?,"So I think I might leave on a business trip(sort of) to the East Coast (I live in California). The details aren't set yet but from I'm hearing it could be as soon as a few days when I end up leaving. So does taking your hormones on a plane work? Also if I left the RX scripts at Walgreens and get a monthly refill can I just go to any Walgreens over there and get more refills if the trips ends up lasting longer than a month??

My other question is about dosage. So the doctor who prescribed me the hrt continued the same dosage I was on while DIY, and after my results came in she thought I was ready for an increase in dosage. I'm now taking 4mg of E daily and she said she might even get me up to 6mg. How much of a difference might that make after being on hrt for 10 months. Like I'm already used to the changes right now. At first when I started feeling different it took a lot of getting used to, but would that make a big impact? Also she prescribed me 200mg of Spiro daily and said that if I felt I wasn't ready I could just do 150mg and gave me the choice to pick, from 100mg Spiro daily to go to 200mg seems like a big jump. What kind of changes should I expect if I decide on taking 200mg daily. I'm mainly scared because the changes emotional changes were definitely something I had never experienced before and had to learn to manage them because on my conservative family and blue collar jobs, but now that I'm used to it and I love it and wouldn't trade it for anything but will the dosage increase make such an impact?

Sorry for the long questions, I still had a few more but I'll just leave it at that for now. Thanks(:"

maybe_trans_I_guess,asktransgender,Told my parents about being trans!,"...and it went well! As I knew it would, they are very liberal, pro-lgbt people and I am very lucky to have them :)

But now I feel very weird- on the one hand, I am ridiculously euphoric and happy to the point of dizziness :) :) :P But on the other hand, I kind of don't believe it- this has gone from something I had just been dreaming about to a very real possibility. I am now kind of scared that I was wrong, that I'm not trans, despite everything to the contrary- I have convinced myself in the past but now it feels like I stepped into an alternate reality, where constants in my life have totally changed.

So I guess what I am wondering is, how do I find the determination to keep going forward? And maybe more specifically, how did all of you go from just considering trans-ness to actually starting transition?"
Kastoli,asktransgender,How much of a pain is it to get an 'official medical diagnosis'?,"I don't even know if diagnosis is the right word, it sure as hell sounds wrong in my head, but I hope you can get the point.

At this point i've got no idea what I am, and I just sort of want to get a confirmation either way so there is something solid to push off from I guess.

I've recently moved to a much larger city than where I grew up, and mental health professionals are quite readily available, but I don't want to really want to have to jump through hoops like a circus animal to get any sort of diagnosis.

I suppose what i'm asking is, if it turns out I am actually trans, how much trouble would it be to get to a point where I could start something like HRT?"
IagoLemming,asktransgender,"I think I want to be a girl, what is my next step?","Over the past few weeks, I've given this issue a lot of thought and consideration. I've experimented with cross-dressing, and talked about my feelings with my wife, and I feel that I am coming to the inevitable conclusion that, all things being equal, I would be happier with myself and with my body if I were female.

Going forward with this conclusion is a difficult step for me. There are still a lot of doubts and confusions that I have about all of this, and a lot of ignorance about transgender issues and identities in general.

While I've been lucky enough to have a partner who is completely supportive of me as I start this journey, I can't come out to any of my peers, and I can't afford or access the services of a therapist trained in gender-identity issues.

So, now that I am able to at least admit to myself that I have these feelings, what should I do to explore them and the consequences they have on my gender identity and expression?"
Lizasaurus2,asktransgender,Self conscious about my rib cage.,"Hey folks. So I've been fretting over my rib cage recently. I think it's a lot bigger than normal. I have permanently flared ribs. They're less obvious now because I'm overweight but they were quite obvious when I was thinner and I imagine they'd be very obvious if I was at a healthy weight.

A side effect of this is it looks like there's a massive gap between my breasts which is quite distressing. Also, it's generally dysphoria inducing because I don't think my large rib cage is all that feminine looking :/

What should I do? Should I see my doctor? Or should I talk about it with my therapist?"
b7d,asktransgender,I'm not sure how to stop...,"I'm a raging addict. Not to any particular substance, but to every substance I can get my hands on. I've done it all, and given the chance I'd do it again. Every mixture you can think of I've pushed through my veins. It's how I gain respect, it's how I gain a sense of self, it's how I have some standing among my friends. Of course on the inside it comes from having absolutely no care about my physical body. In fact, I enjoy pushing it to the limits hoping that one day it will give out. Al it's done is disappoint against some (what I thought were) insurmountable odds. 

The only thing I like more than being high is money and having the freedoms it brings. Now I've never had much, as substances tend to deplete resources pretty quickly, but it's been relatively stable until recently. Recently I've gone off the deep end. Now my finances are in the red, I'm sick, years of abusing my body are catching up with me. I don't care about the body, it'll pull through, it always seems to... :/

But I need to get my finances back on track or else I'll be on the street. And while I've been very very slowly working towards transition (I'm more of the mindset I'd rather just end it than try), not being able to fuel my habits as I please is bringing to light somethings that were very long buried and very well hidden. 

People are saying it's good for me, that I should work towards transition and away from drugs. I'm out to my parents and close friends (have been for a while) but I'm on my own financially, no one to help me out. I'm young, inexperienced with finances and loans and everything, and I wouldn't trust myself with a loan even if I managed to get one. 

I'm trying the option of getting off substances, but it's a loosing battle. I can't do it by myself, but I refuse to go to a anonymous group and get a sponsor because I don't want to have to tell anyone the reason that I use so heavily. The reason being I'm running away from the dysphoria and the anguish I have from being a big male bodied closeted trans woman with a lot of transphobia towards myself. I will support others, I will believe in others, I will love others, but doin any of those things to myself I refuse to do. I don't know how to do. I fee like if I eventually did so it would be some mix of defeat and pity and quiet resentment aimed at myself for the rest of my life. 

I don't know what to do, but I'm falling off the deep end. I'm making more and more plans by the second and Im pulling away from the friends I once had... The real friends that wanted me to rise above being a drug addict and be a beautiful girl. They can see it (at least I used to believe they could) even though I never could. I'm lost and I'm wandering towards the end of this dark night and I'm not sure how to find any light in my stumbling."

gamingvirtue,asktransgender,Is it normal to feel this...scared?,"So, I'm extremely new here, as this is literally my first post on this subreddit and probably my...I dunno, tenth post or something on Reddit as a whole? Irrelevant, but yeah...I finally got up enough courage to even come to the board, and dear god, that was really hard.

I moved out of my parent's house about...just about nine months ago, actually, and I finally had the chance to come out and be myself. I was finally happy with myself and felt like my honesty was cutting down on the...well, existential torture that my dysphoria tends to be sometimes. Not completely, but I can actually say it isn't a constant feature of my life now.

And for reasons I'd rather not disclose here (I'd rather not speak ill of people I've cut out of my life), my boyfriend and I are **finally** moving into our own place this weekend. And, while that makes me excited because I can finally get my address changed and everything and get a job and insurance and stuff (insurance is cool out here, almost everyone covers HRT and trans stuff), and yet...

Thinking about it, I should just be excited. There shouldn't be a ""but"" or a ""yet"" or anything. However, I find myself becoming increasingly terrified, and I don't know exactly why this is coming up so suddenly. I make it a point not to worry or really even concern myself with the unknown beyond trying to make it known as best as I can, but I'm starting to get to the point that I'm losing my shit a little.

My ex had me a little worried to tell my current boyfriend, as he'd given me the ultimatum of ""stay a guy or we're splitting up"", though not quite that offensively. Yet, I felt it would be shitty to lie to him, so I told him a few weeks after we got together that I'd been considering this for a long time, and he accepted it as simply as if it were a normal, expected thing. My parents, siblings, aunt, uncle...everyone that knows about it has been nothing but supportive, so I know it's not that I'm scared I'm gonna lose anyone I care about...

So, like I asked above, is it normal to be this scared by this? Like, I know for a fact that it's because my transition is actually gonna start and I'm finally gonna get to be me, but I don't know why that scares me so badly.

Luciaquenya,asktransgender,Are photos at all good guidelines?,"Hi all,

so I am into my transition (I started about 11 months ago but only got a good dosage of E in my body 3, going on 4, months ago - I use this as a benchmark, wisely I hope) and I am rather fretting about how I look. Now even before transitioning I could take what I would describe as beautiful photos, and my face has changed quite a bit since starting (having no T shifted things about on my face, making it thinner, having E in my body has started to fill things out a bit), that being said I am not remotely near to looking how I feel inside, it is like there is a great deception in those pictures I take. It is not even about passing, I could certainly weave a life being androgynous or whatever I turn out to be (I am naturally very femme). On a side note, I am kinda afraid that my face has done all of the changing it can, though I think this is part of the compounded anxiety!

I've got a long way to go in my transition, lots of things are still to come, I guess what I am trying to ask here is this: how much of a good guideline are my little moments of happiness when I can see myself appearing? I hope one day I will get closer to these! Perhaps others have some experience of being in a similar situation and can offer a few words, perhaps some support. 

My timelines are in my post history, if you fancy a gander :)  

Lots of love,

Never-be-Ashley,asktransgender,Dealing with doubts,"Hey beautifuls.  Forgive me if I ramble, I don't know exactly how I feel.

Background, 27, pre hrt, have come out to my partner and 2 best friends.  Just started laser hair removal... For a long time I thought I would never be able to transition, now that is looking like its a valid option for me but...

For the first time since working out I was trans I have been having doubts.  All the years I thought it wouldn't be possible it hurt so badly that I couldn't do anything. But the other day I  all pretty (make up, dress etc) for the second time with my partner and the next day I just felt like... What the fuck am I doing...

I felt like I am wasting all this time and money and for what... Chasing a foolish dream. , I don't feel any better about my body right now but I know I could survive as I am.

I don't know the first thing about living as a girl.  I sit wrong, stand wrong, talk wrong... I thought I was so sure... But now... What if I go through all this pain and money and time and all I achieve is having wasted a pile of money and time and have gained nothing.
The first time I dressed up it felt amazing, the second time it was just my dress didn't sit right and my wig itched like fuck and I just thought ""do I really want this to be my life?""

My laser has turned my body into a pimply disaster zone too.

I guess I'm just wondering... How do you deal with doubts about wether or not you really are trans... Or wether or not you should bother with transitioning?

I hate that I am having doubts, I was so sure, it hurt so badly that I thought I couldn't transition.  I wished so hard for the thoughts to go away and now I am on the brink of starting down a road and I'm not sure anymore. And after wishing so badly for the desire to go away and now I'm scared of losing it.

Help me please"
Alexisunderwater,asktransgender,TIFU by attending a baby shower as a woman expecting like 5 or 6 coworkers. Ended up coming out to my entire department. Whoops,"Obligatory this happened this past Saturday. I wanted to wait untill Monday was over to see the fallout. 

It went so much better than I had expected. 30 women were there and they were mostly really supportive. I even got a few compliments.... And some cake in my hair...


The hair was admittedly my fault. Stupid bangs...


But I'm lucky, I moved to a state where I can come out to people, even if there not 100% on board and not be in danger of losing my job. Moving from a state with no protection to here, I can highly recommend it. 

Out of 30 people only like 5 knew, and I trust them.  They probably didn't say much to anyone else. So I come to this house with my biggest ally and best friend, my wife. I'm in my cute heels, plaid button down, wearing my pushup instead of my sports bra and proceeded to shock a good majority of them. Out of the group only like 1 had a real issue and she was shut down real quick by my chiwawa of a friend (who's also the pregnant one). Some suspected and were thrilled to be there during the reveal. Some had absolutely no clue but didn't care at all becuase they have trans friends too. No men there to be freaked out. It went better than expected.

But God was I scared. I'm such a chicken at shit leaving my safe areas sometimes. If I had been alone I might have turned around when I saw all the cars in the drive way had I been alone. Pro tip - bring someone if ever do this.

I emailed HR on Monday. Becuase at this point rumors are going to start flying between salaried and non-salaried folk (around 300+ people, my job is really visible). So we're officially moving up my full time day at work to the end of the month. So much for getting FFS befor coming out at work and going full time. But you know what?

Fuck it. I'd rather be the visible trans girl.  I'm over this whole boymode bs.


Edit: Fixed typos

Edit 2: Also I should add that the baby shower was for my friend who requested I go as my authentic self. ""No guys allowed"" and ect. The woman who was upset about me was partially upset because she felt this wasn't an appropriate time to do this. But I am not going to piss off a pregnant woman. Nope no way.

TL/DR: Baby goats are really sweet and act like puppies when you hold them."
[deleted],asktransgender,Has anyone here who has undergone GRS had complications that required surgical intervention?,Curious how common such things are as there seems to be a disconnect between what is advertised and what I have heard/experienced
Worldofmoths,asktransgender,How long should it take before I get worried about post GRS pain and discomfort.,"I'm at a bit over two months. Basically it's still hurting when I sit down for a reasonable period. It's fine if it's a comfy chair, but if it's an office chair or something like that I can't take it, I have to periodically stand up due to the pain. I still feel pain if I'm up and walking around for too long too. 

I thought I'd be done with the pain and discomfort by now. Should I be?"

throwuhway78,asktransgender,Handling Doubts (Again),"after about 5 months of really questioning, I just this past weekend really accepted that I'm a trans woman. I am currently identifying as non-binary around most social circles I'm a part of. I'm planning on coming out to my mother when I see her in a little less than 3 weeks.

But even as I type this, and even after I've talked to many friends, and even as I genuinely discuss being a woman with my gender therapy group, I still cannot believe that I am a woman. I sometimes think *maybe* I would be okay living as a man. But why would I have such a strong pull towards being a woman? If I wasn't a woman wouldn't I have quit painting my nails, wearing makeup, and trying to think of myself as a woman long ago? It just doesn't feel real, even though I am able to type it out and have been very open and honest with many friends about being a woman. What gives? I feel like I just don't understand what it *means* to be a woman so like part of me thinks I'm trying to just pretend I'm a woman to like feel special or something but that doesn't really make much sense to me. Anyway, doubts feel worse than dysphoria than me, because at least with dysphoria I know where I stand. But even dysphoria, when I don't really feel it, feels like something I was just making up so I can play the victim or feel more connection with my trans friends. Weird doubts. Thoughts?"

IndoSilver,asktransgender,[19MtF] So does HRT have any effect on your voice? Because I've heard conflicting information.,PS I also have a 2nd question. Does HRT slow down the growth of facial hair and/or leg hair?
Learntoeven,asktransgender,"Husband has recently told me about his feelings of gender dysphoria, hoping to get some help on how to go forward?","Hi r/asktransgender, I'm 26 years old and I have been with my husband since we were 12 (not married, of course.) We got married a little over a year ago. When we were teens, he told me that he thought he may be a woman. I stood by him then at 16, and he eventually told me that he had reached some personal resolution over those feelings. 

2 nights ago, he got drunk and told me that he's been lying about that for several years. I'm not really angry, I know he was keeping this secret as much from me as himself. What I feel is more a brick of terror in my gut, that this is the beginning of a slow, but inevitable march to the end of our relationship. 

He says that he's terrified of me leaving, that he will change nothing if it means we can stay together. I feel like that's just staving off the inevitable changes that are necessary for him to be happy, but are mutually exclusive to us being together. I want him to feel safe, but I don't think it's fair to lie and say that I would remain with him after he transitions?

I'm willing to be with him for everything up until transitioning. I am very ignorant on if that step is always necessary for a person with gender dysphoria? I want to be with him, but I don't think that I would be able to be romantically involved with a woman. I'm not sure how I should handle this? I'm hoping that maybe some of the kind people here can give me some guidance on how their partners helped them, or what they wish someone would have done to make something so difficult, and at least for him, scary, a little bit easier?

emask33,asktransgender,emasculated by my wife or transgender?,"I'm with a woman who is very demanding and emotionally controls our relationship through her emotions.  I have been with her for years and during this time we had a child who I love very much. during this time my wife has become more and more and more ""her way or she wants a divorce"" so I cave to everything for the sake of the family. I apologize, cave, give in, what ever for the sake of harmony in the house. 

At the same time I have been my whole life very feminine in nature, and I love the idea of being feminized and becoming a woman, including cutting my balls off, doing HRT, growing boobs, wearing feminine clothes, etc. 

I'm concerned that I have become emasculated by her completely. I'm concerned this is not only affecting my decisions about gender, but also may be affecting how our child perceives relationships between people.

I have tried counselling with this person and they flat out deny they are this way, they also say that I am always wrong, which I'm not.

So.what should I do at this point? 
"
ConfusedQuestioningG,asktransgender,Can I vent and get some advice? (Minor NSFW),"I'm not exactly sure what I'm asking for but I feel like I need to vent and talk about this without being judged before I lose my mind. My assigned sex is male and I'm 17 years old (soon to be 18) but I'm not completely sure about my gender. I have always been incredibly indecisive about things from where to eat to what to do. When I play video games (rpgs especially) I spend so long deciding about what class or what stats to roll or what moves to take and look up online the best builds but sometimes I get through a chunk of the game and regret not taking something else which I don't want to happen with gender in real life. I also have a problem of letting other people's opinions influence me too much. 

Back to the gaming, one thing that I don't take long to decide on is what gender to play as. I always play as a female in games (unless it's a fighting game and I like a male character's style better although I generally try out the females first). I don't know why but I just feel *weird* playing as a guy in a video game.  Like, I try to pick one and play as one but then I just feel awkward and switch back. It wasn't always like this but I've done this for as long as I can remember. I try to play it off to my friends, saying that I just like looking at females and that I'm a pervert (which has a bit of truth) but recently I'm not completely sure. In real life, the choice isn't all that concrete although I've done things that are questionable:

* I used to bond more with girls than boys.

* When I look at porn, I try to find female POV or gender bender stuff and imagine myself in the female role (I've always played this off as a fetish as when after I'm done, I feel like a guy again).

* I've stolen my sister's panties and worn them.

* I learned how to make my voice sound like a girl after watching Youtubable's videos on youtube as a ""joke"" to mess with my friends.

* When I see an attractive women, I get jealous and want to be her although I do want to have sex with her too. 

* When I look in the mirror, I constantly imagine myself with breasts.

* I masquerade as a female online occasionally. 

With all this stuff, it seems obvious that I should transition but I don't exactly hate being a guy and honestly, I'm scared that my fantasy won't match up with reality:

* Being a guy is comfortable, I absolutely love my muscles and being pretty strong, overpowering my friends is awesome.

* I'm not harassed by anyone.

* I don't have to worry about walking alone at night or sexual assault.

* Being a girl isn't something I think about constantly throughout the day.

* I feel like I would mess up make-up and I enjoy getting ready quickly.

* I would hate not passing.

* I don't feel like I would make a pretty girl with my masculine features especially since I'm black and I don't really grow long hair but going through surgeries to fix all of this seems weird and costly.

* Speaking of hair, I'm pretty hairy which would be weird on a girl.

* I hear guys in the locker room constantly objectify girls and trans-phobia is crazy. I even heard one guy say ""if you don't want to be the gender you're born with, how fucked up are you?"" Not to mention the Caitlyn Jenner jokes. There are also people out there who are adamant that transitioning is a mental illness and that they should be ""fixed"". I'm not sure I can deal with all of that without becoming depressed.

* I'm terrified of what my family would say. Although I think my dad's side would be accepting (I'm not sure about my dad himself), a good amount of people on my mom's side pretty much disowned my cousin because they are gay and refused to go to his wedding.

* I feel like I would be more alone if I transition. I have a hard enough time getting a girlfriend and making friends now, how much harder would it be if I transitioned?

Sorry if this seems like rambling, I just had to put my thoughts down someone where someone can see. If I was born female this would be so much easier. I'm not sure I'll ever transition, I'm more no than yes right now but thank you if you read all of this."
Hutttyluttty,asktransgender,Guise... Guise... Listen... gals too... this is gonna be fun,"Okay, by now many of you may or may not have heard of the South Dakota Bill regarding where transgender people can pee, right? Okay so here it goes:

_________________________________

**Project DakotaPiss** 



Now you can be cis or trans and still participate in Project DakotaPiss. That's the beauty of nondiscrimination, you have more people who can play.


So this what you do - 


1) Find out how you get 'caught' and ticketed for being in the 'wrong' bathroom.



2) Grab your iCam or w/e you can record video with and go into the 'wrong' bathroom but record everything you do.


3) Here's what you're gonna do: you're just gonna go in, and ""clean"" the bathroom. Wipe down a sink maybe. Dust the towel dispenser or something. Then just walk out. Recording everything you did. 



4) Get 'caught' and ticketed. 



5) Take it to court. Tell the judge you didn't ""use"" the bathroom you just cleaned it.



6) Now the judge has two choices:


    



*a) Throw out the ticket giving every trans or cis person an excuse to use later OR just keep doing the 'cleaning' routine till they get tired of wasting their own time.*



   



*b)Uphold the ticket and now, if the bills don't mention employees as an exception every company in the state will need to have a employee of each birth sex who is only allowed to clean their same sex bathrooms or be guilty of breaking the same law. And I'm sure every company in the state will just LOVE that limitation on their workers and requirement to hires.*

___________________________________

eh? ehhhh? See, we can all play silly games about stupid shit and waste each others and tax payers time and money on stupid bills. And the beauty is this can be done in any state that tries to pass a similar bill.

ShackledPhoenix,asktransgender,Laser AND Electro?,"I've been to 6 laser visits every 4 weeks now.  And I honestly can't complain, I've seen significant hair loss for little time and not a whole lot of money.
But... I feel like the laser isn't very effective at this point.  The upper lip and parts of my chin seem to be virtually immune to the laser.  The rest of my face LOOKS pretty clear, but there are blond hairs there that are rough and stiff.
My laser technician says it will eventually be completely smooth and gone and that it takes 10-12 visits, occasionally more.  I'm not that feeling that patient or confident about laser finishing the job.  

So I'm considering doing Electrolysis a couple hours a month in between laser sessions.  Would that be a waste of time and/or money?  Also would doing both cause problems for each other?   "

sasashimi,asktransgender,"presenting as your birth gender when you ""fail"" at that (can no longer pass) - anyone tried this? i'm thinking of trying it until i get FFS..","i'm mtf and i've presented ""full time"" for around a year and half now, hormones for 2.5 years. i don't get gendered as male and haven't for quite some time, but i *do* get strange looks all the time. i presume that i get read as trans nearly 100% due to the combination of my voice, posture, and facial features. i will be getting FFS in the relatively near future (2 years at the absolute most), and from speaking with friends who are in my age group and have had it, the weird looks stop - it's almost like a switch has been flicked. i am aware of the facial features that are almost certainly causing it (brow, and jaw/mouth area.. my nose / cheeks / eyes are fairly OK), and it will be getting resolved soon.

the thing is - in the meanwhile - i am just incredibly tired with dealing with people looking at me strange and being viewed as a trans woman. my boyfriend mentioned to me that i can no longer pass as a cis male, and i more or less agree with that, but i think that would be OK with me. my reasoning is that if people view me as a trans man, at least the transphobes of the world would see me as a woman pretending to be a man, and not the other way around. and i'd be OK with that - because i am a woman and i'm secure in that.. i'd rather be seen as a manly woman than a womanly man. part of me wants to try presenting as male again so that instead of being disappointed when people give me strange looks, i can feel happy that i'm making progress when people give me strange looks when i tell them my name is --whatever male name--. or at the very least, people will leave me the fuck alone and stop staring at me!

has anyone tried this? my boyfriend seems to think it's a bad idea and i agree it's kind of like going back into the closet and ""giving in"" to society, but i sometimes have moments when i'm just so fucking tired of being a visible trans woman and all the transphobia that people have."

ChibiOne,asktransgender,"To those struggling with ""is it a fetish""","Every day I see so many posts in trans forums with the theme, and usually title, of ""Is this just a fetish or am I trans?""  When I bring this up, I frequently get jumped on with ""Hey transition is a big deal you want to be sure"" type responses, but the legitimacy of that question continues to become more and more questionable to me in any context.  I mean, everyone generally seems to agree that autogynephilia is BS, and this idea is simply autogynephilia without using the word.  But somehow there’s still this pervasive idea that *some* people might actually *be* something like autogynephiles, and everyone should be very careful to make sure they aren’t one of them before they transition.  

It seems tied in with the misogynistic idea that women don't want sex, and so if you want sex or are in any way aroused by the idea of having a woman's body then that must totally preclude a female identity.  But to me it only supports the idea of a female identity, not acts as a counterpoint to one.  It just kills me to see sooooooooo maaaaaaany people tearing themselves apart over this, because of course they *almost certainly* do get aroused by the idea of themselves as a woman having sex.  I don’t think that’s uncommon for women in general, and there’s no reason it would be *different* for a trans woman.

Also, getting aroused by your own self-actualization could be seen as a superpower, not a character flaw. ;)."

Sissy_Slave_Jenny,asktransgender,Confused...,"Hi all! Just wanted to say first, thanks for this sub, reading it the past few days has givin me some sense of direction and calmed me down some... I'm making this post because like many posting here, I believe I might be trans but I'm not sure. A little background of myself first, I'm 26 and have had thoughts of wanting to be a woman since puberty. I always envied the woman in my life since before then and always wanted to join my sister and cousin in the girly activities they would do. I was arround them more often than not and didn't have many male friends growing up around at younger ages. 

I distinctly remember when I was probably around 5-7 seeing a man in church with a very pronounced adams apple and realizing I would have one, one day caused a lot of anxiety and I just didn't understand. When puberty came for me, It always felt odd. Like I didnt want it to be happening. I would see what changes the girls were going through and I wanted that instead of the gross things happening to me. After puberty I had guy friends, but none of them really close, I felt I coulndn't relate and never had an interest in doing ""boy"" stuff. I would sit with all girls during lunch in highschool because it felt more comfortable, and during cross country practice I ran with the varsity girls instead of the JV boys.  

All of these things I've always questioned, and honestly I always was scared I was gay or something and repressed a lot of these thoughts. During this time I discovered transexual pornography and would go through stages of being really into it, to feeling guilty and having to stop looking at said things.
   
I experimented with dressing very little through my teen years, about the time I discovered trans porn, I tried on some of my sisters clothes and loved the way it made me feel but only made a sexual connection to it. I would go through the same stages of excitement and willingness to dress, then guilt and disgust. I once bought some lingirie from Victorias Secrets and wore it in privacy while living at my parents house. My dad caught me one time and it was one of the most emberrassing moments of my life. 
  
All of this was happening very subtly and passively untill I meat my now wife. I confessed to her my ""fetish"" for crossdressing and told her about my fantasies. I had never been into femdom or bdsm at all untill I thought about trying it with her. We have experimented with it, and it's been fun but it's always leaving me wanting more.
   
Since puberty I've suffered with depression, ongoing swaying from an inconveniance to debilitating. It became extremely strong in college when I felt this extreme feeling of not belonging. I've been dealing with this depression quite extensively as of late. I've seen a therapist and have been taking an SSNRI. Just last week reading through this sub I discovered the ""button question"" and if I could I would without a question. The thought of taking hormones and transitioning is very appealing to me. 
  
A few days ago I told my wife about these thoughts, which was not easy. She has a ftm brother, so I knew she would immediately know what I was talking about and what it meant. I feel horrible for all of this, I feel like I used her to cover up my feelings and thoughts. Maybe if I get married and try and live like a normal man then this all will just go away and I'll be happy.  She was the first woman I had sex with... all other attempts were disastrous. I would usually go limp from too much alcohol and anxiety, not having lost my virginity untill I was 23 really hurt my self-esteem... realizing I'm really rambling now, but anyways I just needed to get this out there. I'm going to be finding a gender therapist as soon as possible to talk to about these feelings and thoughts, but I wanted to talk to someone now... 

Thanks for reading my novel! Hope you are all well :)"
Genderqueertrans,asktransgender,Would it be realistically harmful to inject your breasts with saline every 48 hours in attendance of hormonal breast growth ? Could it interact with my HRT regimen ?,"I think about buying a saline pump and saline . I read that it can give you realistic fully developed breasts for 48 hours. While I have some breast tissue already and while my nipples are painful as hell ( good sign I guess ) I miss fully developed boobs . I know I need to have patience but I see how people see "" chicken fillets "" and "" self cohesive prostheses "" as fake . Even to myself the prostheses don't feel good . I want developed boobs in an artificial way while waiting for mine to naturally develop on HRT . But as someone else pointed out to me I need to count 7 or 8 years before my boobs will be at their maximum . I'm only 20 and 7 or 8 years is hell of a lot of time at 20 ! So I thought about injecting myself with saline every 48 hours but I'm scared it will interact with my hormone regimen I'm on . 

Can someone tell me if it would be harmful or not to use saline consistently to create bigger boobs ? "

LukaRuka,asktransgender,Anxiety with Shaven Legs (MTF),"Recently I shaved my legs and I am not coping too well with it, I don't think it's because the hair is gone, but because the idea of having to shave a lot is an idea I really don't like. I try to limit my time in the bathroom as I like to get stuff done and the sooner the better, so shaving my legs would make me stay in the bathroom longer, unable to do stuff.

I was wondering if you lot have any ideas on what I could do to help me.
I did come up with some ideas, such as getting my leg and thigh hair removed permanently, shaving my legs the same way I shave my facial hair, not all the time, just when I need to (such as when it's starting to get obvious, or I am going out)"
eldritchterror,asktransgender,[MtF] Questions about body hair,"So I'm going to be starting HRT very soon, and I've been trying to get into the habit of shaving more often (typically every day). I am very hairy. My legs and arms incredibly so, underarms, chest and face not as much, but the issue is it grows fast. 

When I shave my chest, I have 3 issues. My razor doesn't really get all the hair so I end up with this weird stubble where it's not sticking out of the skin but it's dark enough you can see it. Then I have this issue where the razor literally can't reach the hairs on my sternum; i've tries everything with it, shaving at different angles, trying to move the skin to be easier to get too, it just doesn't work and idk why. I end up with hairs only a few MM long but it's so obvious because everything else is shaved. Lastly with this I've started getting 'pimples' on my chest. idk if they are pimples or ingrown hairs or what but idk if it's because I'm shaving, or because of the razor being dirty maybe? 

With my face I dont know since I haven't paid attention to it yet, but I might have to shave twice a day. I normally go once with and then once against the grain and it gets it all no problem, but there's still that kind of greyish hue left over - specifically on my upper lip. Idk what any of that is about.

I haven't shaved my arms or legs yet, but I'm worried that the same things will happen with my chest and I'll just be covered in disgusting little pimples all over. I also don't want to have to be shaving literally every day because if I don't I know it will look obvious and stick out because my hair is very thick and very dark  and it'll end up just being really uncomfortable. I've thought about waxing but I don't really know much else other than you're just ripping hairs out. Do you have to do it often, every couple of days, weeks, months? I've also looked into one of those personal electrolysis devices (you can look them up on Amazon, one I'm looking at specifically is the 'Veet Infini'Silk') and thinking maybe that might be a better route to go down instead? They can be pricey, but In the long run I think it might be better.

windlep7,asktransgender,Do people recognise you after transition?,"I wonder if there's any awkward situations where you're talking to someone you knew from years ago but they don't recognise you lol. You could use it to get revenge on people who wronged you, kind of like Emily Thorne from the TV show ""Revenge""."
ts_curious,asktransgender,any MfF transexuals that felt that your sexual orientation changed during or after transition?,"I am a male in my late 30's, and am struggling to figure out whether I am transgender or not. There is a lot of things that point me in that direction, but I am still not sure. I am married, and in a weak moment, while trying to make sense of all these feelings, my wife asked me what was wrong, and I said that I was struggling with my identity. My wife had a strong reaction, as one might guess, and she said that her biggest fear was of loosing me, and that if I was transgender and transitioned, I would want to date men, because that is what happened with Caitlyn Jenner......(and the whole process with my wife is another story). Now I have have never been interested in guys, and so I highly doubt that I would change if it turns out I am TG and if I would transition. Any who can identify, or have other experiences? I would love the feedback."
Princess_Catherine,asktransgender,[Wall of text] Mom came to me with psychic information,"My mom came to me today. She has never been a source of support on my identity, first year after coming out was awful, second year wasn't as bad, now it's relatively quiet. Today she said she had recently gone to two psychics (she also has one who she's seen all her life) who both concluded that I am a [sensitive](http://manchesterparanormal.org/Are-You-Sensitive-.php). That just means I'm intuitive and aware of other people's feelings and absorb(?) those feelings, which might make me feel overwhelmed.

I guess I understand that because that's just how I am, a sensitive person, and I easily pick on other people, so it doesn't seem that out of the ordinary, especially considering the fact that she probably gave them a lot of facts and anecdotes about me, bringing them to this conclusion. However, she went on.

Apparently one of the three (or maybe the two recent ones) said that there is a feminine shift in the universe or energy or something, and a lot of people are following it. I'm assuming it is the supposed cause of modern movements or something similar. Then my mom asked if my journey in life was to be a girl and either the psychic she has seen throughout her life said no, it was to be a man, or the two recent psychics said no. If it was the two recent ones, that seems a bit more worrying.

She is no longer forcing me to live according to her beliefs, but at the same time she is. I've been feeling doubtful and unsure of myself very recently, bringing my confidence way down. I haven't felt like a girl, nor the desire really. I've just been apathetic and angry. This whole thing is playing right into my doubts and fears, and I feel like a fake. I don't know what to think anymore, but I am quickly falling into a bad depression, I can feel it.

I don't know if I've been lying to myself this whole time about who I am, I'm so scared I have been. All of those doubts I've had seem like the most important things ever. I think I'm a fake. I don't know. I don't feel like the only one in my head anymore. None of my thoughts are safe anymore. I don't want to continue on with such a stressful life. I don't think I care enough anymore.

I don't know."
windlep7,asktransgender,"Connection between being trans and ""nerdiness""?","I've notice a out of trans people here seem to have nerdy interests, like anime, video games, etc. It could just be that the trans people of Reddit are nerdy, but some the trans people I know in real life are nerdy too. I don't mean ""nerdy"" in a bad way btw (I'm a nerd and proud!). 

There seems to be a connection between being trans and having Aspergers.  People with AS also have nerdy interests (I'm one of them). I've also read that a lot of trans people tend to work in IT, engineering, which also has a high proportion of AS. 

Is it possible the processes involved in causing transness also causes AS and/or ""nerdiness""?"

princess_ozma,asktransgender,So I signed away my ability to have sex as a male and impregnate women yesterday...,"Part of the form at Dr Chett for srs had a section basically saying ""I know I won't be able to have sex as a male or impregnate a cis female"" after srs.  

I haven't had any panic attacks yet out here, but this got me the closest.  I think it was the whole ""no impregnate"" thing""... Not that I could anyway (5+ year hrt) but it makes me feel weird because I want babies someday.  I did freeze sperm (12 vials) so hopefully I'll get at least one munchkin :)

Kit-ra,asktransgender,ATTENTION: Follow up to Big Brother Big Sister discussion! I need YOUR feedback!,"Hello again!

Firstly, I'd like to thank all of you who participated in the Big Brother Big Sister program discussion (original post can be found [HERE!](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/47gzf6/attention_my_therapist_and_i_are_working_together/) )

You're responses helped so much! After working through everything, I've come up with a list of things that everyone would fill out before being screened and paired with a sibling. 

I'd like YOUR feedback on this list! If you think something should be added/removed/combined PLEASE let me know. Your suggestion could have a direct impact on the experience other trans people are going to be having when they come seeking a Big/Little sibling. 

The below list is a combination of things a “Little Trans Sister/Brother” might seek from a “Big Trans Brother/Sister”. Likewise, it a list of things a “Big Trans Brother/Sister” might be willing to provide a “Little Trans Brother/Sister”. The idea is that during the pairing process, each would be given this list and go through it and check off what they are willing to provide (Big) or are seeking (Little). There would then be a screening process and Bigs and Little’s would be paired based on the screening and how well their lists match up.

**The list is meant to reflect both what you are willing to provide/seek (checked) as well as express limits (unchecked).**

Support: Someone to talk to who can relate (Dysphoria, struggles of being trans, etc)

Support: Nutrition (Eating for a changing body)

Kornyoko,asktransgender,Trying to understand my standing. Help?,"Well ill skip most of the mindless chit chat and get to the point. Im pretty sure im coming downt to being transgender. Ever since i was a kid. I would always feel different but didnt know why. I draw a lot and watch anime. When i draw anime stuff id tend to draw myself but very feminine looking or female entirely. Anyways i made a questionaire. For my self. And if someone reading this wants to take the questions for themselves please go ahead. Also if i cause offense to someone i apoligize in advance. Anyways if you can pleae read the questions and answers and comment it would really help. I just need an outside view to me possibly being trans and opinions thank you.

Questionaire -------

A:  yes. Why though is hard to explain. I just feel i would probably be more happier. And ""normal""

2.Does My penis annoys me? Why?

A: It does annoy me, because of the way it feels, and that i feel that it is not natural for it to be there

3.would I rather have a vagina? Why?

A: yes i would rather have a vagina, simply because it would feel natural. Nothing being there, just smooth flat flesh. Also i find that i would rather have one since ive always dreamed of carrying a child

4.Do I wish i had a female figure such as big thighs, wide hips, big butt, breasts, etc? Why?

A: yes, i do wish for those. The reason i do is that i always dream of being feminine and when i crossdress i mimick those qualities and that makes me feel calm and happy.

5.How do i feel when people say i have masculine features? Why?

A:  i feel slightly uneasy since i do feel feminine daily but at the same time indifferent since ive been a ""guy"" all my life.

6.Growing up did i always liked girls better then boys as friends?

A: deffinitely. As a child i enjoyed playing with all the girls. Esspecially house and other stuff girls did at that age. But due to being seen as odd i stoped entirely and did boy things.

7.Did not normally like to take part in boys things such as football or rugby? Why?

A: no i didnt cause i find them to be unfun and too agressive.

8.Have you Almost every single day sat down and think about myself being a beautiful woman, walking down the street?

A: yes a lot of times i catch myself day dreaming or dozing off and thinking of doing things as a woman

9.Did I always prefered when i was growing up to play female characters in games?

A: yes when the option was available i almost exclusively picked female characters or eg-(fable) you can make the mc (male) wear a dress. Soon again due to being seen as weird i exclusively had male characters and called it ""gay"" or weird to use female characters. (Oviously dont feel this way anymore)

10.Do I prefer being called 'she' and 'her' It is the best thing to me?

A: yes i do prefer being called by those pronouns. When i was younger before my voice deepened (sutble cringe) i was often mistaken for a girl over the phone. Even in daily interactions if i wasnt.dressed boyish was mistaken for a boyish girl.

11.When i watch porn, do i want to be the girl.?

A: yes i do want to be the girl. I feel like that is my place in a situation like that. Feels most comfterable. Particularly i always feel a deep jealousy of them that i didnt realize till recently. Also my ""attraction"" to these woman was from what i have seen to be superficial in terms of me being excited cause i wish i looked like them or was them. (Also i am attracted to men)

12.Everyday do i think about remodelling my body into what i want, so it will look beautiful and feminine?

A: yes i day dream or zone out and think about this.


13.Do I often wish i was like any other girl my age? Why?

A: yes. Because i have a deep longing and feel left out. Hurt. Sad that i cant have fun with other girls and be like any ordinary girl.

14. I wish i could do what every other girl does my age?

A: yes. Well dont know much here since i dont hang around alot of girls. So dont know much about what they do but i do know i wish i could be doing stuff like looking for a prom /grad dress. Doing my hair, make up and nails. Going to prom. Talking and hanging out at the mall. ""Typical stuff""

15. Do I envy some other women because the way that they look or there body type?

A: yes i do generally get very jealous of most woman because they get to flaunt their femininity and be proud woman while im kinda stuck being a guy. (Hurt a bit to write that)

16. How did you feel about haircuts?

A: i dont like them. Feel sad when getting it. Unless its a touch up and its left long. But generally am forced by my family to cut it to keep an appearance. Which sadens me.

17.How did you feel about body/ facial hair?

A: hate hate hate hate hate. Itchy annoying wish it would go away.

18.Have I have always been very girly?

A: not entirely sure but generally since i was a kid i was always very passive. Emotional and always just assumed it was normal to be. What i later found was ""girly""

19.Do i feel uneasy as a guy? And calm when more feminine?

A: yes i feel uneasy a good majority of the time and generally feel out of place. Constant anxiety cause my body feels off from how i feel. Which is mainly that i feel like i have breasts wide hips and a vagina. (Dont know how to say but its like the phantom limb thing but with breats and vagina). On the other part i feel pretty calm and fine when i dress up in girl clothes."

Harpoon385,asktransgender,I have a question about hair.,"I know this probably belongs in a different subreddit, but I forgot the name of it, and figured I would get a faster reply here as it is more active.

So I have this curly hair, but I really prefer the look of straight(er) hair. I was considering using a hair straightener, but would that work very well on it? I don't want to spend too long each day straightening it.

SnoodSpiritt,asktransgender,Shaving is painful but not shaving is worse?,"When I shave with an electronic shaver on my face, nothing happens except I might get red bumps and white flakes around the hairs (which don't go away at all).

I've tried shaving cream, moisturiser, even using nothing, and it doesn't really work. I'm so bad at it and I don't know how to get rid of my face hair.

The thing is, if I don't get rid of it, I will literally want to rip my chin skin off. What else is there? I heard there's a cream that dissolves hair, and some other things, but I don't know. Can I get laser or something similar at 17?

I should mention that my facial hair is patchy and sparse, but it's still there and it's really itchy. I don't know if this will affect anything or not."

violaceous_trogon,asktransgender,I have feelings again. Please help me.,"Years of suppressing my feelings and taking emotion-numbing depression medicine basically left me without the ability to feel. Transitioning is bringing them back and I have no idea how to cope. I skipped class for two days straight because I just couldn't deal with how I was feeling. Skipping class was a major symptom of my depression back when I was suffering badly, and I'm terrified that it's coming back at the worst time. 

From what I can remember of testosterone puberty, I had volatile emotional outbursts, struggled with suicidal thoughts and barely passed junior high. I don't know how much of that could be explained by my dysphoria; I'm afraid that I'm just going to be an emotional inferno forever. It's nice to be able to feel love--and to feel *loved*--again, but I don't know how well I'll deal with feeling hate, anger, and crippling sadness in the future.

Tropius-,asktransgender,Didn't really experience dysphoria as a child,"Since I began puberty at age 13 I've wished I was born a girl; my feelings of dysphoria and desire to be feminine only got stronger as I grew older and my body developed more. But as a child I always felt comfortable identifying as a boy, and didn't care much for the stereotypical hobbies of either gender - I hated sports, competition, violence, etc., but that was about it - I never wanted to play with dolls or wear dresses. However, I have had intense genital dysphoria for as long as I can remember, particularly around age 9-10. 

Now I'm seriously considering starting HRT (may be doing the blood tests very soon), but I feel like my experience has been atypical of most trans people. I don't know. Maybe I'm just a masculine girl?"

Obviously, I will be making sure I get my usual tiny patches next time but after almost 2 weeks I am still struggling to keep them stuck(one from last night now already needed to be taped flat with micropore) and I am still struggling to find flat space below my abdomen to put the big ones(let alone alternate; my skin is not too happy)

We have a lot in common, we boths like music (he's play the bass in a band and I play the piano), the same books, and videogames. He's a nice guy and awesome person. But the thing is I don't know how to date with him. I have 26 years old, and my only experience daiting was with a only cis girl (and she was of the initiative). I'm shy and I suffer of anxiety problems, special when I'm nervous. So I don't know how to approach.

Loki42013,asktransgender,Need help hopefully finding new job and place to live around the Portland metro area Oregon,"So I'm a 23 year old (juuuust had my bday ha) MtF pre everything. Im really new on here so I apologize for how long its gonna be but ive been needing to sort of get this out and i think it helps explain what im looking for and why. I also apologize for onconsistent punctuation i'm typing this on a galaxy s3 browser and it's really shitty. I only really became 100% sure about 2 weeks ago but the idea had been flip flopping around in my brain with more and more frequency and urgency the past few years. I've already started wearing woman's clothes and make up and have even gone out briefly and plan on going out longer soon because all of my friends Ive told have been so unbelievably supportive. It makes me feel so happy and complete when I can be she with them. And therein lies the rub. I still live at home because I've been suffering from depression for a long time thanks to unrealized dysphoria. Now that I know, I have to get away from this house and my dad in particular. More backstory.  My dad is a semi successful small business owner so I've been working for him FOR. EVER. I have a Ton of respect for him as hes started and kept two (small) companies allll on his own for decades, no schooling, in and out of foster care and on his own at 16. I really appreciate the work experience ive gotten in maintenance work and restraunteering. But fucking christ he is an unbearable asshole, especially when he's drunk. The whole family knows he's bipolar but je refuses treatment.  Ive had a toxic relationship with him for damn near my whole fucking life and im sure a chunk of it was the the unrealized transgenderism. Hes always been pretty conservative and religous and I knooooow even more than gay or lesbian or feminist, transgender is just something outside his worldview. And you CAN NOT change his world veiw I swear to god I have never seen anyone do it. No one. When he's right and you're wrong that's it. The definition of dont argue with fools. He's also just nosey as fuck. I hate the sound of my phone ringing due to the amount of times hell call me in a day. Every time I come home from an incredible and fufilling time with my friends its like I rip my heart out and leave it by the front door. I thought I'd hated it here before but yeeeesh. The dysphoria gets so intense now that I have some clothes hidden in my room and I dress up as soon im sure I wont be walked in on (mom, dad, a brother and sister) which means im usually up pretty late to do it and it really just adds more stress. That and the fact that both of the jobs I work at are sooo fucking masculine its crazy.  Even the chicks who work at the bar only add to the weird masculine vibe rather than subtract from it. But it is in a hick town right on the freeway so it is sort of expected. Expressing myself there would just be met with mostly total confusion,  disgust, and probs ridicule too. I just really need to get away and hopefully find a good safe space to stay but really as long as its better than here i'll be down. I love the rest of my family.  My mom especially,  she's literary an angel. I know she'll support me but I cant tell her while she's still living with my dad. Im hoping my leaving will spur her toward getting the divorce she's wanted for years. One snag for me is a have a dog, one considered ""big"" by most people. He's a 100-105 pound white swiss shepherd husky mix. Coolest most mellow dog you'll ever meet :) EVERYONE who has ever met him has considered him one of if not the coolest dogs they've ever me.

Loki42013,asktransgender,Need help with job/housing in Portland metro area Oregon,"I think I posted this in the wrong spot earlier so im posting it here now cause it's where i meant. :/


So I'm a 23 year old (juuuust had my bday ha) MtF pre everything. Im really new on here so I apologize for how long its gonna be but ive been needing to sort of get this out and i think it helps explain what im looking for and why. I also apologize for onconsistent punctuation i'm typing this on a galaxy s3 browser and it's really shitty. I only really became 100% sure about 2 weeks ago but the idea had been flip flopping around in my brain with more and more frequency and urgency the past few years. I've already started wearing woman's clothes and make up and have even gone out briefly and plan on going out longer soon because all of my friends Ive told have been so unbelievably supportive. It makes me feel so happy and complete when I can be she with them. And therein lies the rub. I still live at home because I've been suffering from depression for a long time thanks to unrealized dysphoria. Now that I know, I have to get away from this house and my dad in particular. More backstory.  My dad is a semi successful small business owner so I've been working for him FOR. EVER. I have a Ton of respect for him as hes started and kept two (small) companies allll on his own for decades, no schooling, in and out of foster care and on his own at 16. I really appreciate the work experience ive gotten in maintenance work and restraunteering. But fucking christ he is an unbearable asshole, especially when he's drunk. The whole family knows he's bipolar but je refuses treatment.  Ive had a toxic relationship with him for damn near my whole fucking life and im sure a chunk of it was the the unrealized transgenderism. Hes always been pretty conservative and religous and I knooooow even more than gay or lesbian or feminist, transgender is just something outside his worldview. And you CAN NOT change his world veiw I swear to god I have never seen anyone do it. No one. When he's right and you're wrong that's it. The definition of dont argue with fools. He's also just nosey as fuck. I hate the sound of my phone ringing due to the amount of times hell call me in a day. Every time I come home from an incredible and fufilling time with my friends its like I rip my heart out and leave it by the front door. I thought I'd hated it here before but yeeeesh. The dysphoria gets so intense now that I have some clothes hidden in my room and I dress up as soon im sure I wont be walked in on (mom, dad, a brother and sister) which means im usually up pretty late to do it and it really just adds more stress. That and the fact that both of the jobs I work at are sooo fucking masculine its crazy.  Even the chicks who work at the bar only add to the weird masculine vibe rather than subtract from it. But it is in a hick town right on the freeway so it is sort of expected. Expressing myself there would just be met with mostly total confusion,  disgust, and probs ridicule too. I just really need to get away and hopefully find a good safe space to stay but really as long as its better than here i'll be down. I love the rest of my family.  My mom especially,  she's literary an angel. I know she'll support me but I cant tell her while she's still living with my dad. Im hoping my leaving will spur her toward getting the divorce she's wanted for years. One snag for me is a have a dog, one considered ""big"" by most people. He's a 100-105 pound white swiss shepherd husky mix. Coolest most mellow dog you'll ever meet :) EVERYONE who has ever met him has considered him one of if not the coolest dogs they've ever me. Not exaggerating. Totally potty trained and well behaved. I can probably leave him at my house for around a year but I'm afraid of my dad trying to keep him if any longer-term leaving is done. I understand how much of a wrench that can throw in things but I love my dog with all my heart hes been my best friend for three plus years now and being seperated from him would suck.

StarkMidnight,asktransgender,Stigma about my Adam's Apple,"So I find myself in a very odd position at the moment. I have been in HRT for 6 months. I have also adhered to a strict exercise regimen and I have always ate very healthy. I have reached the point where I'm mostly passable including my voice.

The problem is the fact that I have Mt. Rushmore for an adam's apple. My adam's apple is ridiculously large. And I just don't mean ""in comparison to other women"" i mean in comparison to almost anyone.

I go to the store and other places completely as a female but have been noticing that my self-esteem is starting to drop because of it. Because it's something that I don't have the ability to fix at the moment. If my body isn't exactly at the spot I want, I can just think about all the progress I've made on HRT and keep on striding forward. But with my adam's apple I can't afford surgery so it's just sitting there annoyingly.

I don't mind the fact that people know I'm transgender, I'm open about it. It just vastly bothers me that there is this vastly masculine trait about me that doesn't fit in with the rest of my body and completely ""outs"" me to anyone I meet. I'm wondering how other transgender women has dealt with this issue."

Lil_goobie,asktransgender,"Almost got chased out of club bathroom last night. How was your night, ladies, gents, et al.?","I was wearing black jeans and a black dress  under a ladies letterman-style jacket/ hoodie with a bigger hoodie over for warmth. So it might have looked like a tunic or something. I had on some many hours old makeup, but just concealer and mascara. I kind of look female or at least androgynous at a distance, but maybe not so much up close. My hair is just below my ears. 

Anyway I was drinking with my girlfriends downtown and had to pee reeeally bad. I'd never peed in a club with lots of other women. Plus I'm nonbinary, so there's that. These 2 women were kinda like on guard as I walked up, they were like ""wait are you sure you're supposed to be here? I think you might be in the wrong place"". I don't remember if they sirred me. I said something like "" yeah I'm in the right place."" I mighta sounded bitchy. And my voice is not great. It felt like it could have become a scene or otherwise catastrophic. There were a dozen dudes who could have come to the rescue and beat me up just a few feet away. So i peed, got the heck out. 

I think I need a few more months in the oven at least. And it'll be warmer so I'll be forced to present less androgynously. Maybe i need to show my tits for entry into crowded club restrooms? Baby steps, I know. I have a weird profile so I worry about ever being able to blend fully if at all. Granted, I was banking on my androgyny letting me by.

Bournemouth,asktransgender,Trying to figure it out - last thing bothering me - role models,"Hey folks,

It has recently come to my attention that I am a total dumbass and may have repressed transgender feelings my entire life (MTF - I'm almost 23).  I thought it didn't bother me at all - I thought I didn't have any clear signs of dysphoria, just a kind of excitement gained from crossdressing and I had what is known as ""autogynephilia"" to Ray Blanchard (guess what I used to reassure myself I was male for years and years!!)

Aside from having only a couple of very subtle signs I can recall from pre-puberty youth (imagining it would be nice to have long hair, wearing tights and make-up once or twice), one major thing is bothering me/making me think this is all a fetish and I'm going nuts - the fact that almost all the people I have idolised in my life have been male.  I've also been friends with many more men than women (I'm less bothered about this).

This ranges from my uncle, my father, famous scientists, comic book characters, etc.  Is this just the result of ingrained misogyny - any other MtF women here able to relate how they felt about this?  Thanks."
Woodsie_Lord,asktransgender,"Is there any difference between transmean and transwomen and their struggle of transmen vs. struggle of transwomen? Kinda hard to word it right, see the post for further explanation.","Obviously, transpeople in general share a common struggle because they were born into a wrong body. But are their struggles a bit different even if they have shared commonalities?

Basically, we all know that transwomen are male-bodied persons who feel like a female. Similarly, transmen are female-bodied persons who feel like a male. Let the train of thought go further.

Because transpeople have a specific assigned (by the society) gender, that means their struggles must be different. Let me explain this on an example.

Take into account walking alone in the night. Transwomen need not be afraid when they walk alone in the night because they have been assigned male gender by the society, thus they're viewed as a man and also stronger gender by the potential attacker/rapist, even though transwomen themselves feel a different gender. However, transmen should have it different because they're seen as female by the society (and the potential attacker) and thus weaker. Especially if the transperson in question is pre-hrt (I actually don't know, it could be different with post-hrt because society starts to see them as a gender that transperson identifies with)

Extend this example onto fields such as pay gap between transwomen (who, due to their male status in society should have a higher wage than transmen) and transmen or onto such fields like conscription (transmen aren't likely to be conscripted because they're seen as females and thus not able to fight).

Am I on the right track? Does the world perceive transmen and transwomen differently? Do transwomen struggle differently from their transmen counterparts?"
Keira-Is-Real,asktransgender,MTF Surgery Advice?,"Really would love some open honest advice from my sisters (brothers and non binary welcome if you have something worth saying of course) I'm coming up to my 1 year of HRT, and my second GIC appointment which means I can get my first surgery signature from the GIC psychologist. So of course my thoughts have turned to surgery and my options more recently.

When I started transition I didn't want bottom surgery. I never believed I'd be feminine enough to want it, physically I never thought I'd be able to pass and thought it was an effort in futility to even think about it as an option. I had always known my genitals (27 years) and had a strong connection to them. Over time and over transition that has changed to the point where I dislike having a bulge (leggings) and would love to be able to have flat underwear and be able to wear swimsuits and I have always fantasised about having sex with female genitals. This want has become stronger the further in I have come.

Here is where it starts getting tricky.....I identify as a lesbian but I dislike vaginas. I don't like the look of them and the idea of a vagina is not a pleasant one. (Not that I like my genitals either) I have recently decided I want surgery under Dr Suporn in Thailand (One of my best friends is 11 days post-op and her results are amazing)....so theres this disconnect between what I want and what I want it to look like I guess. 

Before I make any set in stone decisions I guess I'm just scared of having the surgery and then hating the result. I'm aware its a big and scary thing for anyone but this disconnect is really stumping me. 

It makes things harder as I have a disorder which basically means I have no self identity and pick it up from those around me, so never truly know if what I want is what I want or if its something I've picked it up from someone else.

I know this has been kinda rambly and probably doesn't make much sense. Have any of you girls had surgery? How did you decide? Did you have doubts? Have you regretted it? "

evendeathmaydie,asktransgender,Apology to this sub (and some thoughts),"I have come to a realization within the past few weeks. I can't fully articulate this yet, but I have a feeling that transgender subreddits have been under coordinated attacks by radfems for quite some time. I have the same creeping feeling about many real life support groups I have been to. 

I think a lot of the negative things I believed about the trans community are the result of a coordinated infiltration attempt on the part of radical feminists posing as trans people online (and, sometimes, in person). Because the nature of this abuse is that of gaslighting, triangulation, and subtle misdirection, I can't fully articulate what is happening, I just vaguely know that it is, which is rather crazy-making and confusing. 

Apparently, this is called astroTERFing, wherein radical feminists will pose as sockpuppets on transgender forums and in support groups in order to subtly encourage in-fighting within transgender groups. So anyway, I would like to offer an apology to any fellow trans people I have hurt by responding to this kind of triangulation. I believe it is much more common than I thought it was, and I think radical feminists have much more free time and hatred than I gave them credit for. "
FUNKYIMPACT,asktransgender,"First time buying a binder, what is best recommended for a plus-sized person?","Greetings!

Some background information first-- I'm a dfab Transmasculine NB being, and I'm finally taking the steps in taking my transition seriously, so after getting my hair cut short, I'm going to be looking for a binder.

I'm fat (Guessing 250lbs to maybe 300) and very large chested, and my chest is the biggest source of my dysphoria. I got properly sized for a bra at a plus-sized clothing store so my chest size is 46DDD (usa sizing).

So far, I've looked at two sites for my options.

Option 1 is [Shapeshifters](http://shapeshiftersinc.storenvy.com/). I was sold on the fact that one of the models is around my size and weight, and I looked through the pictures that others would post on their reviews, a majority of them being plus-sized. Not to mention that the patterns and everything look quite cute and stylish.

I'm just not certain if it would entirely provide the flattening that I am looking for.

Option 2 is [Underworks](http://www.underworks.com), which is a site that I heard a lot of positive reviews on from a lot of transgender resources, including from one of my friends. There's two binders that I looked at on there that I'm curious about.

One is the [Ultimate Chest Binder Tank](http://www.underworks.com/product/productinfo/ultimate-chest-binder-tank/325?cid=4)-- Very nice looking and a great price... A few reviews talk about it restricting movement since it will as well compress my stomach area. I work in retail which often involves a lot of upper body movement.

The other is the [Tri-Top Chest Binder](http://www.underworks.com/tri-top-chest-binder). It also looks nice, but the reviews state that one of the major problems is the end rolling up. Looking at my body size, body shape, and the gap under my chest, that'd *might*... become one of the problems quite quick.

I have a bit of a low chest and a belly, so I am wondering which of these, or any others, would probably work best for my body type? Thank you!"

The thing is, I'm not normally awake at 9am since I don't have school and I can't find a job, so I set an alarm to wake me up, i take the medicine and go back to sleep typically. 

For the past 3-4 days, I'll wake up again around 10-12:30 with a HORRIBLE migraine. It has me feeling sick and rolling around in pain. I've heard the Spiro can dehydrate you so I've been drinking lots of water, but I'm not sure if thats just the problem.

Then within a few days something happens (could be fear?) and I just...shut my brain off for an extended period of time. I go on auto pilot for a few months and then start the whole process over again. I'll come out of auto pilot and start with the thought process of ""this isn't right. I don't feel right with how I'm living."" etc. and over the next couple weeks or month or so I'll get back up to the ""I'm probably trans"" step and it starts over again.

The phases seem to be questioning, acceptance, auto pilot, repeat. The questioning phase seems to be lasting between two weeks and a month and a half (excluding the first time I started questioning, which was longer), the accepting phase lasting a week or less usually (though this most recent one was probably a couple weeks) and then auto pilot for two to four months.

I'm currently in an acceptance phase and I can kind of feel an auto pilot phase coming on. I want to get out of this cycle.

WhyMustIBeAHuman,asktransgender,What is my Gender?,"First,to start off I am a 14 year old female. My entire life I've liked very little girl stuff. I always thought ""girly girls"" were stupid. I grew up in a ""independent"" household,but they were more conservative.
 I remember my first thought after learning what transgender meant. I related but not to the dysphoria part. But something I related to 100% was the term bisexual. Around July of last year I became actively involved in the LGBT community,I learned the term genderfluid,and I stuck with it for a few months,until for some reason I literally forced myself into thinking I was FtM. 
In November I decided to do one of those FtM hypnosis videos,after I did it my brain went into denial,it felt as if my brain split in two and the sides disagreed. I can't get out of the constant thought that I am FtM.
The thing is,the only really masculine thing I like is video games. Well I like a lot of TV shows geared towards guys. I've started to notice that I can't picture myself growing up as a female or FtM,I've considered I might be agender because I don't relate to either boys or girls. But I just don't know,my brain can never agree on one thing,I've asked my mom without including that it's over the transgender thing,and she says it's probably because of my mental health/illnesses and raging hormones,and I don't do well with them together. 
Should I try and go back to do an MtF hypnosis? Maybe I'll go back to normal,I'm just scared I'll become *shivers* a girly girl. Or maybe am I truely a FtM that doesn't feel dysphoria towards my gender? Maybe I'm agender?
Honestly I just don't know and I need a little help. 
Also I'm totally fine with you using she,her pronouns.

I'm having trouble with going out in public, because I start acting really feminine. I've been trying to dress more masculine, but also trying to keep my parents from noticing because they are extremely transphobic. Despite this, I really want to be more confident and appear masculine to strangers. I live in a small town in Texas, so I'm very self-conscious and nervous about coming out and trying to be a boy. How can I build my self-confidence so that I can come out and express myself in difficult situations? Did these things happen to you when you first discovered you were trans?"

Randamirin,asktransgender,Social transition issue?,"I tried looking for previous posts to find more on this, but I'm kind of new to reddit and I had trouble finding what I was looking for. 

I have been on HRT for about two weeks now, mtf currently living as male.  I have no issue with my pending physical/mental changes.  However I feel weird about being referred to by what will be my new name, and new pronouns.  I don't know if it is fear or anxiety, or something altogether different.   When I was younger I remember my voice always being more feminine, and when I would answer the phone sometimes I would be referred to as ""young lady"" and I ultimately remember feeling angry about this (usually hanging up on the telemarketers).  I dont hate my male name, and im not supremely bothered by male pronouns.  I definitely notice when people use ""him/his/guy"" and I do notice a slight negative feeling when hearing it.  But besides that small feeling I guess I don't mind so much.

Does/did anyone else have a similar issue about socially transitioning?  This is just the latest doubt that popped up into my head, I think knowing that other people had similar issues will help with acceptance. I dont really have any friends to attempt a sort of trial run so that's out for me.  I had an online friend using female pronouns and it felt different, the feelings are so hard to place."
OverConsciousCat,asktransgender,"Does it get easier to ""forget"" that you're trans?","I started HRT very recently and am sort of freaking out.  Now that I'm ""really doing this"", it feels like my entire life is being filtered through a pair of glasses that add something transgender related to everything I do.

""Oh my nails are getting long, should I be more 'manly' and trim them all the way?""

""I'm here talking to this coworker about something.  Are these sorts of conversations going to change when I tell them?  Will I even still have this job?""

""Do people judge me for liking this sort of movie because it doesn't 'match my gender?' Do I even care what they think about something trivial like that?""

Those sorts of thoughts on their own seem fairly mundane and normal, but taken as a whole it feels constant and oppressing right now.  It seems like there's nothing that isn't colored by transitioning.

Then I get into the sort of ""meta"" spiral of anxiety where I'm thinking *about* my thoughts like, ""Why am I thinking about this all the time?  Is this my life now where everything is trans-related in some abstract way and I can no longer just be in the moment?""  At least I can recognize this as not a healthy line of thinking and stop, but that does nothing to prevent the constant fleeting thoughts throughout the day.

So... is this just (a maybe slightly extreme form of) something normal and it gets easier to forget you're transgender and just ""live""?  Or is this something I need to really work on now before I go crazy?"

snrnsl,asktransgender,Do you guys think I may be a trans male?,"this is my very first post on reddit and i haven't been on this site too often so I apologize in advance for any format errors or something that I'm doing wrong.

Even asking the question or thinking about being trans scares me as I was brought up religious and I'm afraid in general about the way society views transgender people currently..
uhm so to start off I'm a 16 year old female that has ever since I could remember had a little voice at the back of my head that disagreed with me being a female.
My mom told me that when she was pregnant with me her and all my relatives thought I was going to be a boy as my sister, who is 4 years older than me didn't kick and was very calm while I was very rough and kicked a lot.. I know this is following stereotypes but I feel like it's relevant..
I never watched princess movies when I was young and I only watched Pokemon, Digimon and Beyblades while growing up and I never just got along with other girls especially around my current age as what they talk about just don't interest me. 
I've always been one of the ""bros"" since I started school in Canada. All of my elementary, middle and high school know me as the girl that hangs with the girls and is a complete ""bro"". People have told me many times that they just look at me as one of the guys due to what i do (always hanging out with the guys, skating, playing video games, etc)..
I specifically remember this one time where I was in the bathroom with my sister while we were getting ready in the morning and I just blurted out ""I wish i was born a boy"" and my sister responded in a very surprised way.. She was in grade 9 at that time and her reaction wasn't disgusted or anything.. but I remember she acted very surprised and there was some sort of negative reaction that came out of her since after that I never stated that ever again or thought about it, I just believed i was a tom boy. A lot of girls that were tomboys in middle school/elementary school had all changed when high school came and I was the only one from our middle school that stayed this way and still didn't care about how I looked, makeup, gossiping about other people or other boys. 
I don't dress like a complete guy, at least I don't think i do. I dress pretty gender neutral and only buy clothes that look gender neutral or are boy clothes. I've always disliked the idea of being a flowy, feminine girl and I've always wanted to be that rough guy.. there are also many photos of me as a child where I would not have my shirt on..
I know a lot or all of what I have mentioned is heavily stereotyping genders and that's why I'm not sure myself if I'm just a very masculine female that's going through a 
phase of wanting to be a guy.. and I've researched a lot about the stereotypes vs transgenders and one of the reoccurring points was that a girl that likes ""guy stuff"" likes guy stuff and doesn't feel that she wants to be a boy, she just simply likes guy stuff.. yet I don't just like guy stuff I sometimes really do feel like I just want to be a guy, be accepted as a guy and be seen as one..but I'm afraid that it's just a phase, that I'm sinning and.. I don't know I'm just confused and scared.. which is why I've always put away the thought about being a transgender whenever it came up.. but now I just don't know.. 
Dating and relationships are also a part of why I believe I may be trans? Although these are specific stereotypes I just want to be the guy role in relationships rather than the girl roles.. and I believe I am asexual and one day this girl just asked me ""you're asexual right?"" and I just blurted out ""yeah"" since that's the truth and she didn't respond in any negative way and that caught me off guard but after that whenever people are talking about that stuff I just state I'm asexual and they don't bother me about that stuff.. But i have a feeling that maybe it has to do with my gender identity? The idea of that as a female steers me away but I feel like it would be different if i was a guy.. if that makes any sense..maybe more demisexual than asexual? I don't know..
Thank you for reading and I know that people on here aren't professionals; I just wanted other opinions on this matter. "
Gothymoon,asktransgender,Last night destroyed my confidence,"I was feeling great, I had my coming out letter had, I was going to give it to my parents Friday. 

But then dinner happened. My sister jokingly said my skinny jeans and long hair made me look like a girl.

After she finished I twirled my noodles for 5 minutes so it woyldnt be suspicous when I left saying I ways full half way through dinner.

Then I went upstairs. I mightve killed myself if parents werent up so late. Buy the time parents were asleep long enough for me to go down stairs without waking them I had collected myself enough to the point where I wasn't suicidal. Also some time last night I deleted my coming out letter.

It just really hurt. I couldnt sleep untill about 2:00am and I have to wake up at 5:30. Ive just felt really terrible today because of lack of sleep and what happened last night.

AlternateAlysoun,asktransgender,I'm not sure what to do.,"So this is a bit of rambling. But I am not sure what to do anymore. 

I'm tired of going through the dysphoria, it's like a tide that constantly wears me down just after letting up. I'm 27, I have a good career and great friends. My family is awesome, my SO is amazing. A good number of my friends know and are supportive. But I never feel happy in my own skin. 

So frequently I feel totally fine. But then I get hit with this dysphoric feeling and it spirals from there. Usually triggers my Bipolar and then it's months of picking up pieces and getting back to where I was. 

I'm not suicidal, I'm just tired. 

I know I can't change this, but I just want it to go away. I don't feel the traditional ""girly girl"" side of things. I just know that my body is wrong, I hate being jealous of women for being born the right gender. 

I hate watching TV and wishing I was the girl. To the point that I have to choke on tears just to hide them. 

I'm so close to so many goals, student loans are almost gone, I can save for a house. I can start freelancing once I have a few more projects under my belt. 

I just hate that I feel this way. Like I've accepted the inevitability of it all. I want so badly to feel happy in my own skin, but I feel so ashamed and childish at the same time. I see the makeup and clothes and I wish I had a clearer picture of who I was. 

But I just see me, same clothes, same everything just as a woman. 

Is this normal? Is this dysphoria? Why do I feel so ashamed of myself. I feel like in the long run the transition is just a phase and I can get past it, but it's been 5 years. 5 years of coming to terms with it, 5 years of wanting to find a psychiatrist but thinking I can do it on my own. 5 years of ups and downs and crossdressing and experimenting. 

Shaving, growing a beard. Weight lifting, stopping, vowing and breaking and losing sleep. 

I wish I never took that Molly. It could've all stayed buried, where it belongs. 

Is it normal to experience dysphoria like this? To be so reticent to accept it or skeptical of it? "

confusedtransdude,asktransgender,Possible Transphobia in School?,"Hi, I'm a pretty confused trans dude. I'm a senior in high school in California, though the school is located in a pretty conservative area, though there's about an equal balance in staff here that's both liberal and conservative.

I'm pretty closeted at school. I'm only out in one class (not the class currently in question) and to a handful of friends, though I was planning on coming out to this teacher. This is a really tough situation for me, since this happened just today and by a teacher I trusted. (my teacher says she's a feminist, and for some reason I thought she accepted the LGBT community)

However, in class today, we got a notice of a dress code change, which included the statement ""all students are allowed to dress how they wish to express themselves (within previously stated school dress code guidelines) regardless of gender identity""

This sparked a debate within this class, though it was actually started by my teacher.

""There was a student a while back that said he wanted to be- or was transgender, and he was uncomfortable with using the boys bathroom and wanted to use the girls one but the school said no so his mom went and sued the district and blah blah, so now students have to be able to use the bathrooms they're 'comfortable with.' That's the problem though. Minority groups stand up and demand rights and the majority stands back like 'oh nothing I can do to stop them' which is bad. The minority shouldn't rule. There's going to be boys who go 'yes, I'm really transgender' and say that just to use the girls locker room. Should young girls have to deal with that? Undressing while a boy watches? There's such a low percentage of transgender people that this shouldn't even be an issue brought up in the schools. If you want to go and transition or whatever in your private time fine but don't make it my business as a teacher. We shouldn't allow boys the freedom to watch girls undress.""

This is why I'm confused though. I feel like, in the classroom setting, it was such a subtle show of transphobia it wouldn't 'count' since it wasn't targeting any particular individual, but rather a 'concept' of something that could result from this.

Several people have told me to report it because of how much it affected me, but I feel like, since it didn't explicitly target me directly and wasn't a show of ""no, you're *really* a girl"" or something, it would be pointless to even bring up. 

I don't know. I don't know if I'm just overreacting. I don't know what I should do."
maxine_stirner,asktransgender,"Alternatives to the ""button question""?","There's a thought experiment you may have heard of.

Imagine there's a button in front of you that, when pressed, will turn you into an X. No one would ever know you were a Y and they would see and treat you as a X. Would you press it?

Personally I'm not sure whether I would press that button, but a few weeks ago I thought of a twist on the scenario:

Imagine you see the magical button but before you can decide what to do, someone comes along and presses it for you, forcing you to become an X. After a few months, you find the button again. Now if you press it things will go back to the way they were before you found it the first time. You would turn back into a Y and everyone would see and treat you that way. Would you press it?

My answer to that is, ""fuck no, I'm not pressing that button."" I'm still thinking over why I have such a visceral reaction to one but not the other.

Are there any other thought experiments of a similar nature that you know of?

JocelynWonderland,asktransgender,"Just made drastic changes to my regimen, have some questions.","Prior to my doctor's visit today I was just on 200mg Spiro and 6mg Estradiol in pill form taken orally. Today I was switched to injections (1mL of Delestrogen weekly) and was also put on progesterone (pill form, orally).

First, about the injections. I think I did it just as it was showed to me how but I'm not sure. Actually injecting the estrogen was really difficult, it didn't seem the needle wanted to injected. I had to push it really hard. And the needle was pushed all the way in as its supposed to be because it's intramuscular. I was told the only pain I'd feel was the pinch during needle entry. While that did hurt, there was also a sensation that my leg was being blown up like a balloon. And now my leg is sore at the injection site (outer thigh).

As for the progesterone, I'm just wondering how long it takes to start noticing effects? I have 5 refills on the prescription but after hearing the positives and negatives to taking it I don't want to continue it for a prolonged period if I'm not noticing any of the positives, much less if they're even happening since it seems everyone has much different results with prog. I'm also concerned because I read that prog combats E, and yet my E dose was not increased. Maybe because I'm on injections now my doctor assumed the E would be more potent anyways so upping the dose was unnecessary? I don't know &gt;&lt;"

So I've been on HRT transitioning for 4 months tomorrow (24th). Yay! - and despite the dysphoria of my male characteristics and everything, HRT has been going swimmingly. I love my boobs that are coming in, I love my skin getting softer, I love my hair thinning and lightening, and having estrogen in me is THEBOMB.com. Lately though, I've noticed something different. I still feel the want and *need* to transition and am still going through with it, with no intent on stopping. I know who I am, what I need to do, and I don't have many doubts anymore. Im uber greatful for this because I know a LOT of us struggle with doubts but in a way I have my own...thing. I love the path I'm going on and I'm definitely trans, but something has been seriously bothering me. 

It's kinda like dysphoria, except that it doesn't hurt in the same way. It almost feels like being let down or disappointed or rejected or hurt somehow. The weird thing is, recently I've been wishing I was a cisgendered male. I can't figure out why but it almost makes me sad that I'm not. At the same time though... I'd never want to live my life as one. I was born male, and I remember looking at my body when I was in good shape before starting transition and liking it, but not in a ""Yeah that's me"" way. In a ""damn that's badass/hot/super cool* sort of way. **So I am a trans girl, but I want to be a guy. Wtf?**

Amidst all this other turmoil and dysphoria and everything else... **Am I a freak or a masochist or just crazy?!** Because **I'm starting to feel scared that I'll never be happy in any sort of Gendered body.** Because apparently I'm a girl's brain trapped in a body with the wrong sex characteristics... That wants to be cisgendered. Wants to be male.

Im probably not making any sense... I'm sorry. Any advice or insight you can give from whatever you make of this post would really help this... whateverthefuckiam out.

Pashow,asktransgender,A long ramble--my uncertainties about gender identity,"As the title states, I apologize if this is rambly/incoherent/without a real point. These are just thoughts I've been collecting.

This is something I've been thinking about more than I'd like to lately. Gender has never been a big part of who I am, and it still isn't, in fact, but there have been some odd experiences that have made me question myself.

For a bit of background, I'm 16 and born male. Ever since maybe about two years ago, I'd never really considered the possibility that I might be anything but. When I was little, I would lock myself in my parents' bedroom, hop on the king size bed and play pretend, usually doing some sort of ridiculous acrobatics. When I did this, I always interpreted the role of male characters, be it from the latest Dragon Ball episode or whatever. As a young boy it made sense--because, well, who'd want to be a *girl*, right?

Strange that whenever I get the urge to play pretend today, I'm almost more attracted to the idea of interpreting female characters.

It's really been like that in all things relating to gender (which, again, there aren't many of in my life). I went from the seemingly normal distate that boys have for girls to rather liking the idea of being a girl. This confuses me because it seems that transgendered people tend to ""have always known"" they were a different gender from the one they'd been assigned.

I don't think it's possible to *become* transgendered, but I might be wrong in that. I've even had the odd day here and there where I woke up feeling like something was... off. Not really inherently wrong, just different somehow. A very slight sense of disconnect, like an out-of-body experience.

Now at the same time, I feel no aversion towards the idea of the male gender. Nothing about my body disgusts me or feels wrong--it's what I've got and have always had. I like aspects of my body, such as my hair (though it is true that it's pretty long and feminine). I don't like how skinny I am, though, and wouldn't mind putting on some muscle and looking *more* masculine... just like I wouldn't mind shrinking down a bit more and becoming more feminine.

So I'm sure that this confusion can't have anything to do with any actual dysphoria--you can't be cis and trans at the same time, right?

Of the two, if I had to pick one, I would probably go with presenting as female, but I'm not going to. Seems like taking hormones and going through surgery is too much of a hassle for what I would only consider a very slight improvement.

It's 40/60, more of a preferential thing than anything. It's like picking between two different foods. One of them I'm probably going to like more, but I would happily eat both. Does that make sense?"
Izzy10235,asktransgender,Any quirks you had when you were younger that you later discovered were probably linked to dysphoria/ being trans?,"Just out of curiosity, what are some quirks or tendencies  you had when you were younger, that you later discovered were probably linked to like, being trans, or having dysphoria.

These are my most memorable ones. They're all things I've done when I was like, 5 to 6.

Ever since I was a child, despite being called a good looking *eugh* boy, I always thought I looked ugly. Looking in the mirror just felt... wrong. I didn't have anything specific to nitpick on, just, my entire face looked ugly, and off to me. I recently did I realize that I very likely looked at myself from a female perspective, rather than male.
 
I was also a bit awkward with fitting in. This one should have been blatantly obvious to me... I preferred hanging around girls rather than boys, mostly because I felt like I fit in better around them. Most of my friends were also girls. I still perfectly remember how, during recesses, the kids would start up some stupid boys vs girls war, and I would be that odd one to ask if I could join the girl's team. No one ever questioned it, either.

I'd also regularly try to copy feminine movement patterns, and act in a similar manner. My parents would joke and tell me to stop whenever they saw me do that.

But anyway, those are my most memorable ones. What are yours? 

Also, sorry for the long wall. I'm not even sure how much of this is coherent... I'm trying to calm myself down after being smacked in the face with heavy dysphoria. I took some selfies, had them unflipped (my tablet saves photos as flipped,) and witnessed horrors. I even managed to unflip my tablet's front face camera. That made things so much worse. My face looks so asymmetrical and bleh. But I digress..."

truthinanswershelp,asktransgender,"How, do you as individuals of the trans community, answer to these arguments?","Throwaway for neutrality.

So, almost every single medical and dictionary definition defines gender and sex as the same thing. Your sex is in your chromosomes. How can trans women be women then? Some have argued gender is about appearance as a social construct, so we're supposed to call people their pronouns just because of how they look, as opposed to what they actually are? Am I getting that right?

There is no scientific consensus on being trans. The few journals that exist, only a handful are peer reviewed. Being trans was classified as a mental disorder until the 5th installment of the DSM, which has been cited to have been to avoid controversy and legalities, so most psychologists don't agree with it not being a mental disorder. 

I think there's a reason most porn websites don't distinguish between ""trans women"" and crossdressers. Because what is the difference if sex/gender are the same thing? We know it's not actually possible to change your sex, so what gives?

BeyoneInYouITrust,asktransgender,Am I Transgender/Does This Sound Like Gender Dysphoria?,"I am planning on going to see Dr Curtis at The London Gender Clinic (WWW.TransHealth.Co.UK) and before i waste time and money i wanted to know if what i feel does sound like Gender Dysphoria?

1. I wish i was seen as a woman in public.

2. My penis annoys me. Everytime i have to tuck it hurts. It gets in the way and i would rather have a vagina. But, i do not mind touching my penis.

3. I wish i had a female figure such as big thighs, wide hips, big butt, breasts, etc.

4. When i put on makeup in an attempt to feminise my face and i do not see a difference i have a tendancy to get upset and even angry.

5. I get worked up at the fact that when i have to go to things like the doctors, etc as a guy (because it is still in my male name) i get chest pain, rapid heartbeat and get rather stressed out.

6. I have been living as a woman for almost 2 years (using female name, pronouns, public restroom, etc). It will be 2 years in a couple of months.

7. I seem to get offended when people say i have masculine features as i am very quick to say something about it.

8. Growing up i always liked girls better then boys as friends.

9. Did not normally like to take part in boys things such as football or rugby.

10. Almost every single day i sit and think about myself being a beautiful woman, walking down the street.

11. I always prefered when i was growing up to play female characters in games.

12. I prefer being called 'she' and 'her'. When i am called 'ma'am' i love it. It is the best thing to me.

13. I sometimes lie in bed on my side so then the fat on my chest folds over and looks like i have cleavage.

14. When i watch porn, i want to be the girl. I want to have that womens genitals.

15. Everyday i think about remodelling my body into what i want, so it will look beautiful and feminine.

16. I google images of women such as Nicki Minaj or Kim Kardashian and wish i had there body shape (big hips, feminine face, big butt). I even look up on google what i can do to get there body shape.

17. I push my arms together so it looks like i have boobs and cleavage.

18. I often wish i was like any other girl my age. I wish i could do what every other girl does my age.

19. I envy some other women because the way that they look or there body type.

20. I used to run away and hide when i knew it was time to get my hair cut.

21. I have always been very gentle and very girly."

DataPacRat,asktransgender,Writing scifi with unusual gender themes: How do I avoid screwing up?,"I'm currently building a science-fiction story based on the premise that by 2040, it's possible to scan the neurons of a diced brain in sufficient detail to build a computer program that behaves as the original brain did - memories, speech, behaviour, skills, and so on. This immediately leads to gender-based complications that are potentially interesting to write about, in that the brain-emulations, or ""ems"", can generally choose whatever avatar they wish to experience in their VRs: male, female, intersex, neuter, anthropomorphic animal, abstract shape, and more. Further, simple adjustments to the simulated brain can imitate various states, such as various chemicals, drugs, or hormones.

I'm trying to be more ambitious than that; taking all of the above as a baseline, I want to focus on a particular ""em"", who starts out in a state that could be called asexual and aromantic, and could also be called weakly-gendered or cis-male-by-default. Then, due to Complicated Plot (including being completely isolated from anyone else while on Jupiter's moon, Io), he creates copies of himself, who he tries to nudge into having as diverse a set of thought processes as possible, including by trying various experiments and tweaks related to gender and sexuality.

Given that I'm already aware of terms such as 'aromantic' and 'cis-male', how many pitfalls might I still be missing, which could still make me mess up a story that would otherwise be worth reading? As I try to figure out the state of the world in 2040, are there any aspects that I should tread cautiously on, such as, perhaps, how the relevant terminology would change over the next 25 years? Is there anything that I seem likely to cover that might make you cringe or wince, that I could improve on?

I welcome any and all constructive criticism, comments, or advice. If you're curious, the current draft of my story design-doc can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XcgNwELHCU-r7GuYUgDNDDIviThd8Y7Bdto_kMIcmlI/edit).

Basically what the title says. I am currently transitioning MTF (about 2 months on hormones) happy with the changes and excited for the future. Feeling very much like myself. What throws me off is that I don't really feel in a rush to change my presentation or pronouns at the moment, my parents and most friends still refer to me in male pronouns (for now) and thats okay. It doesn't hurt me and I almost feel a little awkward making people I have known so long make that adjustment. I am looking at transition as something I am doing for me and my internal mental health, and the external effects will just come with time. Is that weird that I am not in a rush to live full time or change pronouns?

SteveJackson22,asktransgender,"My college roommates think I should be involved in the LGBT community since I'm genderqueer, what do you think?","I'm a 20 year old guy and its been about a year since I first came out as genderqueer. My roommates are fairly liberal and have been really cool with it, but at times have questioned whether I actually am genderqueer. 

To give you an idea I started off my college career looking like the typical white guy with short brown hair, I was homecoming king in high school and am a very outgoing guy. 

Then something hit me as I decided to kind of test out my androgyny as I had gotten compliments when I had crossdressed at halloween one year.

Now I'm 30 pounds lighter I have a very small frame and waist, my hair is straightened blonde with a side part with shaped but thick eyebrows. I wear makeup sometimes and dress like a woman or  a man depending on the day. I work out a lot in the gym with a sports-bra on and had all my body-hair laser removed. 

I go out clubbing a lot dressed as a woman wearing full makeup and a couple of the dresses I bought. 

But my roommates think this is unhealthy because I seem to act like nothing is different, I act like a guy still even though I have sculpted my body very feminine. 

My roommates have been begging for me to start going to LGBT meetings to see if maybe I'm transgender or anything else.

I dunno I just like looking like a woman, but I really don't want to chop of my penis.

They're afraid Im too much of a narcissist and even though people seem to accept me as I am right now as looking like a girl, the moment they start to perceive me as a guy again my ego will plummet.

Honey_Wasp,asktransgender,Is 25 too late to get meaningful changes from HRT?,"I've seen people use the age 25 as the point at which puberty has definetly finished and that afterwards effects of HRT will be much less potent.  Like, it always depends, but you can mark the difference between younger and older transitioners at the age of 25.  I've seen people say that if you're under 25 then getting on HRT is always a pretty urgent matter, but afterwards it doesn't really matter when you start.

I started asking for profffesional help with my gender issues when I was 22.  I turned 25 a few weeks ago and I feel bad about it.  I am finding it harder and harder to cope with my body and no thought is stinging more than the thought of how much change I could have gotten if all the therapists and doctors hadn't been, and continue to be, so slow and useless.

Mephisto93,asktransgender,Are antidepressants bad for people who are on HRT?,"My friend, Amelia, is afraid of taking antidepressants for multiple reasons that I can't convince her otherwise of, and I'm wodnering, are these fears legitimate and something she should worry about?


1. she's been on HRT for about 2 years or so. She's used to having to take pills all the time.  But she doesn't want to have to take more.


2. She saw her mother take zoloft and she was on a pretty high dose from what I gather. Her mom was unemotional, manipulative and would forget things almost immediately. Obviously they were not a good match for her. But that scarred Amelia so much that she is worried that will happen to her. I take zoloft myself and show her that I'm perfectly fine, but that doesn't soothe her fears. She doesn't seem to realize there are multiple types.


3. One friend told her he didn't like the way it felt and didn't want to be dependent on them anymore. I've told her some pills just don't work right for people, even I had to do some switching around to see what worked well for me.  What upset me is she varely knows this person, only kniws them online, and took his word for it immediately even though she knows Ive been taking pills for my depression. She just doesn't want to even try.


4. ***This is the number one thing shes worried about. She's worried the pills will mess up her hormones and have adverse reactions. I told her that's why you tell the doctor you're seeing everything yore taking. He's pro LGBT so I know there's no issue there, and he knows what she's taking. I've told her I know plenty of transgender people who take antidepressants and it made life a lot easier for them. She's still worried. (If there are some known side effects I should know about, please tell me. She couldn't give me any examples)


I want to say that I'm not trying to force her to take antidepressants. It's completely her choice. But she's angry all the time, gets sad a lot, refuses to eat/eats till she's sick, sleeps too much, and the smallest amounts of things make her cry. She's had a hard life, I get that. And I can't imagine what she goes through every day, especially since we live smack dab in the bible belt so there is limited support. I want her to at least talk to her doctor about it and have the option.

I'd like another person's point of view. Maybe even get a better understanding where she's coming from."
sadtransfraud,asktransgender,I feel like a fraud for not taking HRT,"I am 30 years old and live in Europe. I've been formally diagnosed as transgender (MTF) by some pretty depressing gatekeepers after 2 years of convincing them. I changed my legal name, came out to all my friends and relatives, no huge drama. Even my grandma took it very positively. So, in a way, I'm all set.

In december 2013, I was prescribed estradiol and cyproterone acetate. I was basically aware of what to expect, but it was honestly pretty terrible. I had thought about HRT for years, and I knew I'd get mood swings and would probably lose my ability to get erections at some point.

But it was so intense and so instant. I did have mild pre-existing depression, but it got instantly intensified a hundred-fold. To the point that I just cried and couldn't get out of bed. And after just two weeks on HRT, I was completely impotent.

So, I stopped taking HRT after two weeks and called my doctor to inform her, to cancel my followups.

I freaked out so much about not having erections and getting such massive mood swings that I surprised myself. It's been over 2 years since then, and I seriously don't think I can do it again.

That said, I don't feel like that has any bearing on my gender identity. I still identify as female, or atleast very strongly trans-feminine. Female is an easier concept to come to terms with, so I just tell other people I'm a woman.

And I've been full-time without HRT for two years now. I can pass ok on an average day, with my clothes on. I'm pretty androgynous to begin with: short by male standards, and relatively... lithe?

I think about retrying HRT every day. Since that experience I've been in therapy and made progress with my depression. My therapist basically just shrugs at the subject and says ""you do you, no-one can decide for you"". And I guess that's true...

But when I read about other MTF people's experiences, to everybody else it seems like HRT to is the culmination, the very foundation of their transition. Like it's the primary means to their end. Even Julia Serano in *Whipping Girl* mentions something along that lines of ""gatekeeping is unnecessary and silly, because a trans woman will instantly know if they are really a woman once they get on HRT, it just feels so fundamentally right"".

I know that I'm trans and I'm a she and I present somewhere between androgynous and femme depending on my mood, but it doesn't hinge and it wasn't confirmed or disproved by my experience with HRT.

When my doctor was prescribing me my meds and informing me about the effects, she gave me a chart about what effects to expect from HRT. It was divided into two columns: positive and negative effects. Under negative, it said stuff like ""increased risk of blood clots"" and under positive ""erections will end"".

So when I asked her how likely it was to still be able to achieve erections and if something like Viagra would be applicable for a trans woman, so kind of just shrugged and went ""I have no idea, most people I see don't want erections"". Then she looked around on PubMed for 20 minutes and sent me on my way. I felt like talking to IT support about a problem and getting an annoyed answer like ""that's an unsupported use case, go away"".

So... I feel stuck. I'm single. When I'm just living my life for myself, I can get by the way I am. But it feels so unrealistic to find a partner who could respect my identity and intimate needs, when I'm this... freak. I feel like I'm arrogantly redefining agreed-upon notions of who can claim to be female, if I don't take HRT.

Am I a fraud? A coward? A failure? Does Viagra work? Can you take a smaller dose of antiandrogen to retain erections? Is that unhealthy?

I should call for another laser appointment tomorrow. Maybe it'll make me feel better...

I know this is probably completely unrelated for most people, but I feel like for a long time I've subconsciously attached my assigned at birth gender to that feeling because the feeling of discomfort is such a similar one. It would be interesting to see if anyone else has experienced a similar thing, or even with different phobias/fears."

KarmannGhiaGirl,asktransgender,"Patches vs injection, is there really a difference?","I asked to switch to injection a couple months ago, and it's been fine, but I am finding that I am not good at sticking to an injection schedule since it's a fairly annoying thing to do. I am thinking of asking to switch back to patches since those are a hell of a lot easier to do. Is there really any difference?"

aliceintreble,asktransgender,"St. John's in Los Angeles, CA","I just got back from this clinic and I thought I would write up a little review since I have the flu and am otherwise bed ridden.

This place is awesome. If you are being gatekeeped or having a hard time in the Los Angeles area, this is your place. It cost me $120 for a three month supply of hormones, a blood and STD test, and consultation. The doctor was really awesome, knowledgeable, and compassionate. All the staff were very friendly and kind to me. Some of them looked like trans men and women who had just started their transition. I had no problem with people using my preferred name either.

My only concern when recommending this place is that the pharmacy is a different building in a rougher part of town. The clinic itself is downtown near LA Trade Tech which is obviously not a bad area. The pharmacy was at 58th and Slauson and I walked there for some odd reason. I stuck out like a sore thumb. No one messed with me, but I did have people get a little too into me and that made me uncomfortable. The pharmacy itself was not a bad deal. It only took fifty minutes to fill my prescription and they were really crowded. Just bring a game or something and you should be fine. I just recommend given your level your comfort that you go with someone. And don't walk there in the heat with the flu like I did.

I forgot to ask if they carry FTM hormones. I'm certain they do. They also have social workers, behavioral counseling, name change clinics every two weeks, and a support group that meets on Fridays. I highly recommend this place if you are having problems. I haven't tried the other services in this area. I got what I wanted today and that's what really counts."
TransGirlIcon,asktransgender,this is dumb but do you tip at laser hair removal?,"im going in for a consult in a few weeks for a mix of electrolysis and laser and i dont know if im supposed to tip or not. i definitely dont want to be rude, what do you all do?"
StarHime,asktransgender,"What could be another reasons to wanting to be (or thinking wanting to be) the other gender? (Not questioning, just curious)","There are doctors who want to ""check"" if you're trans or ""another thing"". What are these things? Why would a person want to be another gender if he/she isn't trans?"
frankieb97,asktransgender,FFS paid for by insurance? (blue cross),My insurance (Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield via Starbucks) covers SRS and BA with some caveats (those notes from a therapist and what not)... but is noticably mum about FFS? Would it be a stretch to have this covered with an adjoining therapist note saying it contributes to my dysphoria? How would I go about doing this?
SoNotReady,asktransgender,"If you're newly post op and dilating, can you sleep for 8 hours with the dilator in?","Like let's assume I'm getting SRS, I don't know jack about dilating except what the surgeon tells me to do. Let's also assume I'm good at being uncomfortable and I can sleep through an earthquake anyways. 

Now if I wanted, could I put the dilator in or even a larger silicone or glass toy in, pull on some tight undies to keep it in, and sleep? If not why not, and is there a solution to that problem? 

tl;dr Can I sleep with a dilator it in? "

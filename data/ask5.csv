BaileyGray420,asktransgender,Residual tucking pain,"so ive been tucking for a while now, and it normally doesn't hurt. Recently when i untuck, i get this sharp pain in the left adrenal gland area. standing up doesnt hurt but stretching out my legs and bending down makes it hurt. I dont think it is a torsion, but i cant be sure. Anyone else experiencing this? What could it be and how do i help it? Thanks - Bailey"

katya_del_rey,asktransgender,I need some help in regards to beginning my transition,"So to begin with, I'm 18 and mtf. I've known I was trans since I was around 14/15, but have only recently had the opportunity to seriously pursue my transition.

I see a lot of differing ways people have gone about starting their transitions, but I just want some help/advice relating to how I could begin mine. I'm planing on seeing my pediatrician soon for my yearly checkup, and she usually asks me questions relating to how I'm feeling about life and such (mental health related questions pretty much). Last year I pretty much lied and told her that I was feeling great and all, but now I'm more than ready to tell her about my gender dysphoria along with my desire to proceed with hrt. 

But I guess my overall question is, will telling her be a good first step? I know she isn't a gender therapist, but could she still be helpful even though she's only a pediatrician? And have any of you had any experience related to telling a doctor about being trans/pursuing hrt?

helpneededndplenty,asktransgender,"HELP how do I have ""the talk"" with my boyfriend [NSFW-ish]","So I really, really, REALLY like him. We just met so I've been able to avoid it for now and I haven't disclosed my trans/intersex status, but he's starting to send me ~~dick pics~~ signals that he's ready for more.

So how do I bring this up? What do I say? Thanks  

Edit: Ughhhhhhhhhh. I got a bit of support and I tried to bring it up after getting myself ready, but I cracked before I got there. I ended up telling him he would be my first (which is true). Then he said he still wants me. Which is great, I'm happy, but also AHHHH!!  "
ilbcaicnl,asktransgender,Does being trans confer an advantage in the labour market?,"Someone told me that companies nowadays have quotas for gender and that being trans is desirable because it makes the workplace more diverse. 
Is there any empirical evidence for this? Maybe anecdotal accounts by any of you?

I don't really know how to set something like that up. Does it just require talking to the HR department and telling them I'm trans? Does it only work on certain companies?"

FtMthrowawayask,asktransgender,Any positive experiences with not transitioning?,"Throwaway account.

I see a lot of people who have/had to wait to transition (medically, socially,  or both) and those who regret not doing it sooner and people who can't/don't medically transition. Is there anyone here who has chosen not to transition at all and is actually happy with that choice?

I've spent the last couple months reading everything I could find and thinking deeply about my gender identity.  I have read so many times that some people choose not to transition either medically or socially and some choose not to transition at all. The writings are always positive and reassuring that not transitioning is okay but I've never read or heard a personal experience that validates that. 

I am a 30 year old FtM, pre-everything and only recently figured out that I am transgender. I have a lot of reasons for not wanting to transition medically or socially. My girlfriend thinks not transitioning is not only a bad idea but also very harmful.  I haven't been able to find anything that contradicts her stance. In fact, everything I read points to her being right. 

Any thoughts?"

Finallyquinn,asktransgender,progression or lack of,So I was on a low dose of Spiro and e for a year and I just got bumped up in dosage I was just curious if that's why I feel like everything is going so slow is because I'm still not on full dosage.
[deleted],asktransgender,marriage / dating?,"so im wondering, for you mtf women out there who are looking for guys.  Is it hard finding people to date?  I know that a lot of guys would get turned off by finding out you were transgender and not want anything to do you, yes its wrong but its very true.  Was it hard to find someone to marry or have relationship?  I mean like most girls just have to not be hideous and have guys all over them, is it similar or harder for you?  I dont mean to be offensive in any way i am just genunily curious."
continuityOfficer,asktransgender,Sometimes I forget how much better things are now,"You know, I think the thing that keeps me going whenever I have doubts is just thinking about myself before I realized I was trans.

I was a depressive person, locked up away from everyone, unable to get excited for anything, my only escape was when I could get home and lock myself into a fantasy, and I was incredibly sarcastic.

And now I'm just sarcastic!

I have yet to be able to get on HRT (Australia sucks for young trans people), but even from just realizing, I was already able to start accepting happiness as a thing, I cared about my body and started exercising, and I started caring about my future and realizing it was worth focusing on my dreams instead of just getting through life.

Escapism doesn't consume me anymore, and i'm just consuming the media I actually enjoy, and instead, i'm spending my time gaining skills and making my own media.

Yeah, things get hard, and sometimes I just want to give up and not exist for a while. But I know it's right because I am simply a better person now. I've added years to my life, if not just from not committing suicide down the line, from being health conscious. I can actually feel happy every now, and I take my sarcasm that I have garnered over all these years and started using it for good (projects and stuff).

And sometimes I forget, but life is simply better now."
how_r_u_doin,asktransgender,Am I trans or is this a phase?,"Hello r/asktransgender, I am a long time lurker but I felt the need to get others opinions so I made this account to give my situation.  First post, sorry for formatting errors.  With that said, here goes.

*long post, tl;dr at bottom

Currently, I am a male(19).  Scratch that, actually, I don't know.  I have grown up as male and have grown up as such.  Up until a few months ago, I hadn't questioned my gender but I feel as though there were hints through my life that I might be trans.  Since middle school, I started noticing girls clothes as more visually appealing and comfortable, particularly in winter, when the style of Uggs started becoming popular.  But then in the spring and summer, I dismissed the notion as weird, and that as a guy, I shouldn't feel the need to desire feminine clothing.  But this cycle happened every year in middle school, where I desired and shunned.  Of course, this was all internal.

In highschool, I moved to a different school where I was busy attempting to make friends but unfortunately, failing to do so.  I had a particularly rough patch during sophomore and junior year especially, which may have something to do with the way I feel about myself (were I a girl already, that may not have happened).  During this time, I ""discovered"" the erotic side of the internet and found myself wishing I could be the woman rather than the man in said acts.  I found out that I loved wearing my mom's and sister's clothes (2 years younger), because they were cute but there were a few things going against me.  
1) a bulge down there ruined the look
2) body hair (I have always disliked my body hair)
3) I felt bad as I was wearing their clothes without their permission.  I think my mother suspected something as well but I covered my tracks.
4) was going through puberty and acquiring a masculine body.  Ruined the experience for me

Senior year is when my life started getting better and this crossdressing/gender thing subsided.

Enter college, where I was thrust in a all-male dorm last year.  I admit that I had fun and made many friends, but when I pleasured myself (which wasn't often) I still had to imagine myself as a woman.  I found myself wishing I could wear feminine clothes, or at least have the choice to and not be ridiculed.  Same applies with make-up.  Last summer I studied abroad in Korea, and apparently, this desire to be a woman strengthed a lot, to the point where I think about it regularly.  Currently, I am a sophomore at the same uni but I don't know which gender I am.  I refer to myself as male, but only because I look like a man.  

Here are some other things that may be helpful.

1) I like the way I am and how I am treated.  I like interacting with guys as a bro.  I enjoy vulgar language in sarcastic contexts, although gender slurs tend to turn me off.  
2) I have a few girl friends who I am very close with (one of whom I have done make-up with (I enjoyed it.  Very difficult tho)).  This same friend knows that I may be trans (I guess I came out to her?).
3) I have told my parents and they are willing to do whatever will make me happy, but they want me to check out other options before saying I'm 100% trans.
4) I have always enjoyed the idea of lesbians, but as a guy, I can't engage in it.  I find myself wishing I was a girl so I could engage in such a relation.  
5) Perhaps a reiteration, but within the last 8 years I have been drawn to women's fashion and make-up/etc.  If I see an attractive woman in public, I think to myself, I want to look like that, either with what she is wearing or have her body type(sorry if that sounds creepy)
6) I feel as though I would prefer breasts on myself and women's genitalia as opposed to a masculine phallus.  I am fairly certain that if there was a button or something to make me a girl, I would press it.
7) PERHAPS THE MOST CONFUSING THING IS that I have a good male body, objectively speaking.  I am not dissatisfied with my body as it because it is a good male body.  I just wish I had a feminine body.  I feel as though I could live the rest of my life as a man, but I would just enjoy it so much more as a woman.  

If you read all of this, thank you so much.  I greatly appreciate any advice or words that you have for me.  I still feel like there is more to say but that can wait.

TL;DR Grew up as man, desire to be woman but not completely dissatisfied with being a man the way I feel I should be.

RockerBoyGirl,asktransgender,Need help deciphering if I'm possibly Trans,"I'm a 20yo AMAB and questioning whether I'm MtF. I understand I should and I will see a therapist but I'd like anyone that's willing to play s therapist for a day. I'll take every answer with a grain of salt so be honest and outright with what you think. I just need to get a feel for what I maybe am. I list reasons both for and against being Trans.

For Trans:

I've only ever fantasized as a female w/ female body in my fantasies. It's my only turn on.

In last couple years I've had mostly dreams as a girl including one that said I needed to be a girl. Slit of them have been sexual though

Have possibly felt some jealousy of women

When I see pretty women I am both attracted and imagine myself as them. Often to imagine what it'd be like, sometimes to get turned on and others just naturally.

I used to pray and try to use magic spells to be a girl in my mid teens.

I identified w/ about half of the signs in the ""am I Trans"" YouTube video

I've used female avatars, though mostly for sexual rp

I've set up email accounts under a female name

I've had bad social anxiety throughout my teens

I hated bus rides, locker room, general immature guy talk


For Cis: 

I don't think I have negative body dysphoria. I am generally comfortable w/ my body. I am good looking and like looking in the mirror, trying to look good, etc

I'm not depressed, in fact relatively happy

When I imagine my future I've always imagined it as a guy and it's hard to imagine as a girl but it has become more appealing recently 

I don't remember having any signs before puberty except for possibly one. I was fascinated by gender bending themes in cartoons and movies

Around the age of four, I got a doll as a present and threw it because I rethought it was girly

I've always have very masculine interests though some more feminine quiet interests. 

I behave and appear rather masculine

I don't know if I have any dysphoria at all


I just need to figure this out soon so I can eventually start my career after college and eventually get a family w/out this ruining it one day. Any help is much appreciated, thank you!"
zzumn,asktransgender,How can I portray a FtoM character that's also a minor?,"I'm pretty new to Reddit so excuse any mistakes in the post. So, I want to write a story involving paranormal elements on webcomic format, and the protagonist is (for the moment) planned to be between 12 and 15 years old, and FtoM. I have got some resources someone shared with me to do my research, however, being cis (and this being the first story I properly do on comic format), I don't feel at this point I could be prepared well enough to do a transition/discovery story.

I acknowledge that I could be able to write a good character (and at some point I might come back to ask again for some sugestions), however, before I keep writing the script and all I wanted to ask if there's a proper way to address this kind of character, and what elements I could include without writting a transphobic message. 

As far as said character goes (and please excuse me once again, this time if I'm doing a purpouseful mistake without recognizing it as such), he would have mostly problems from his mother accepting his identity, yet she won't voice them too much (and, for any 3rd character that saw them from outside, it wouldn't seem as they have any family troubles). The father accepts him, and, for plot sake, I want to involve some minor form of amnesia so this main character can't remember why their family moved and why his mother seems distant. This amnesia I want it to be medical related, rather than paranormal related (thought script can still change).

On a second note about the main character, he would have long hair (for plot reasons), so I wonder once again about how this could be adressed.

I would thank any advice and any extra resources, so I may avoid as many unfortunate implications as possible.

Backandwaiting,asktransgender,Am I trans or just depressed? the longer than it should be question.,"TL:dr; Am I even trans/cis?

longer short version: I have struggled with a lot of things that I just felt were part of who I am for a long time. There wasn't a lot to connect anything to something specific, but I had a few trans friends as a teen, so the idea was in my head. But I always had excuses or doubts. Briefly I strongly identified as trans, but I got into an abusive relationship that tried to convince me I was just a gay cis dude. Who liked dresses. I outwardly am a cis straight dude. But I always feel a bit sad when someone says that. Like, ignoring my body is easy, but being reminded I'm whatever I am sends my skin crawling. I'm always a little sad to not be labeled a woman.
I cross dressed a bunch in high school, but in my head it was for shock value. Secretly I really loved passing, but feminine as I am compared to most guys, I'm a pretty masculine guy with kind of strong features. I had a large problem overcoming the ""it's too late to pass now"" mindset. Basically, I just told myself I was probably just a cross dresser or a trans chaser or whatever and tried to ignore it.
And on many days I can. Which is why I think I might be right. I can ignore it, which doesn't sound like it's a thing most trans people can do.
But I've never felt wholly here. I've never felt like this was anything but a meat suit I pilot. The only bit I feel particularly attached to is my eyes and hair, but I've forgotten what color mine are more often than I remember.
I tried seeing a councilor, but we focused on important things like ""career guidance"" and ""am I an alcoholic?"" ( Both answers are no, sad/thankfully) and I never had any professional help since.
I've said things like "" I used to have gender disphoria"" or ""I have a personal investment in trans rights"", I zero in on stories or media that have stories about mind body or body gender disconnects, no matter how good they are. I get in heated arguments with friends (usually gay ones) and have to back off once they ask ""how do you know?"" There's a flurry of ambiguous and unhelpful thoughts I've had over the years that keep me bouncing around the topic.


But, for the last few months I've been feeling more and more like I did years ago. When I was ""trans"" and not ""a dedicated cis ally with hidden baggage"". I find myself thinking about it at work. Debating how I'd tell anyone. Wishing I could go back in time and transition back when I had a) financial support b) less dramatically mature male features. Wishing there was a pill that could just overnight me to a similar but very different body. But, like, why?



I realize ""find a therapist"" is the only really advice but I was just wondering:


Has anyone else felt not trans enough to be trans?


Anyone ever decide they weren't actually trans?


Are depressive people who are prone to boughts of guilt from deceptively conservative but kind familys something the trans (or gay, I guess there's a jury still out there) community knows how to unpack?


How do I calm down and just learn to love my messed up self instead of ignoring it or pretending it doesn't matter to me?


And last: can you all forgive me for wasting your time? Thank you if you did. I needed to write something."

I don't even care about estrogen at this point I just need testosterone out of my body to even start putting my life back together.I keep telling my self ""It is just for another month until things get stable"" But we never seem to have enough money for me to see a doctor, never mind to start therapy from scratch to get another approval letter. I was stable at my old dose.and was only needing to see a doctor once a year for a checkup. But now without it I am getting sicker and sicker... I just want to get back on Spiro but I don't know who to trust. I used to order my extra stuff from clickremedy but they don't carry spiro anymore (perpetually out of stock,inspite of having on their store)
Is there any where that is actually legit to acquire spiro without a prescription anymore? If so I am begging for information...

TL;DR - Oklahoma doctors are dumb and I need a place to order meds from to fill the gap until i can get things sorted out (again,not even really concerned about the Estro,i can deal with the fatigue.just not the world shattering migraines)"
Elsie_97,asktransgender,Cant go on like this.,"Hi guys,

So I am a 19year old transgirl, from the UK. I have reached a point where I have been questioning my gender for the best part of 3 years... Although in truth the signs have been there since I was about 5 years old.

I am fucking miserable the way I am going on. Feel like I'm leading a fake life. Constantly feeling inadequate as male :( I just want to get started now, finally come to terms as who I am. I'm not a boy, I'm a girl. Feel so down at how long it's taking me to come to terms with this and the childhood and adolescence as female Ive missed out on.

It would be such a radical change coming out as trans. How have others coped? I'd be a 19 year old at uni with a male group of friends. I'm so miserable. What do I do? Who is here to help?

Drunk when I type this, drink to make the pain go away. Please help I want to know more trans people in the same position as me. So annoyed I wasn't just born a girl. Please help and guide me.

Sorry I couldn't be as articulate as I could be, I'm just miserable and drunk... "

So, first thing's first: I'm looking to change my name. I want to change the whole thing: first, middle, and last. When deciding what your name would be, how did you ""know"" that's what you wanted?

Second: I'm contemplating top surgery to help with my dysphoria, but (again) I'm afraid of making the wrong decision (weeeeee anxiety disorder) and want to see if I'm comfortable with presenting as such in my everyday life before committing to a decision like that.

Katie_Deely,asktransgender,What to do when you can't delete old accounts?,"Sorry to post this here, but I figured you might know more about this.

I have several accounts on various websites with my deadname, pictures of me, texts of me, and so on. Obviously I'd like to get rid of them asap. There are difficulties though.

I don't have access to them anymore. Sometimes I just went inactive and forgot the password. Sometimes I deleted the email to it and can't recover that password anymore now. Sometimes websites don't co-operate.

A famous example is facebook. I have 2 old accounts here. I have forgotten the password. The email accounts *(and the email service)* don't even exist anymore. Facebook ignores the EU-law for data protection. Facebook ignores the right to be forgotten. Facebook does not even answer my requests. And so on.

Now there are 2 accounts of deadname-me with pictures of old me that won't get deleted.

FollowMoralOrders,asktransgender,Please hear me out (Seattle),"Hey everyone. I lived in Portland since I was 2. I'm now 20, was homeless for the last 7 months of being in Portland because of my parents, and just moved to Seattle. I spent the entire time I was homeless in Portland looking for apartments and roommates and for some reason that is making me despair, they all one by one fell through. Being absolutely too far from work, expensive enough where I literally couldn't afford it even if I  sacrificed food, or just politics getting in the way... Nothing worked. It was agonizing.

So now I'm living and working in Seattle through Starbucks. I hoped that a fresh start would give me better luck. I work at Starbucks, get a pretty decent wage, and need a place to stay or possibly even live for a while. I'm starting to get really desperate because I'm basically alone here with the exception of a friend of mine who is also homeless and an hour away... But she has a different path and so we won't be rooming together despite how awesome I think she is and how much I would love to. 

Its starting to get cold and while I have a few blankets in my 2000 Oldsmobile intrigue I live in... The solitude, cramped conditions, lack of bathroom or kitchen or even somewhere to spread out when I sleep and not be in the fetal position, is starting to make my mood fall and my hope that things will get better die. I had a really rough childhood but never thought life would go this way after highshool. Being trans was miserable at first but Ive learned to accept it and despite the dysphoria, talk to people and gain some smidge of confidence. I've been able to interact and feel like I have a chance at being accepted...but being homeless has taken a lot out of me and I'm afraid of what I might start doing to survive should this go on. Things that scare the hell out of me like selling myself to spend the night in a room, warm and with company, come to mind. 

I didn't think my life would go this way. I thought I'd get out of highschool, go to college, get a degree, and help people through things like I went through as a kid...but instead I feel as if I'm barely surviving. I want more than this... I can't waste my life just surviving or die like this.

I'm a good person. Responsible, friendly, courteous, hard working, after a lot of hard work- well adjusted, willing to pay rent and do my part. I love people and animals and just want to some day go to college and help others. I don't want to end up addicted to drugs, full of diseases, used for sex and half alive... But if it means eating decent meals, having a bed to sleep in, feeling wanted, being warm, and surviving to see myself as the girl I am- even if she's horrid by the time others recognize her as one- I'm starting to think I'd do that. And I never would have before. I need help. Guidance. Someone I can rely on if only for a floor to sleep on with my stuff in the corner. I don't need much room. I'll even pay rent and utilities and do your laundry and other chores. I just don't want to lose myself. I had over a thousand dollars a week ago... But I have to get my car fixed and make sure I can at least rely on it because without it and the things inside I have nothing. 

So please... If I can stay with you or rent a room I would appreciate it beyond words.

Drturtledove,asktransgender,"Breast augmentation, several questions.","Hi all

I am considering breast augmentation and would like some advice. For background I'm a trans woman, Australian, 25, been in hormones for over 3 years, 10A-10B in cup size 178cm and maybe 57kg

I'd like to know where it would be best to get this done, I live in Perth, Australia but I am willing to travel anywhere in Australia, Thailand (anywhere in South East Asia) Korea and Japan. Is there a place that is good quality and inexpensive? Ideally I would like to spend less than 6000 on the surgery itself, can I get good results for that amount?

I have had all other surgeries done by dr chettawut, is he a good option for this?

I am anxious at the idea that breast augmentation is not permanent and I may have to get it re-done at some point. Is this still true of modern implants? What would it mean if I needed to get it re-done in the future but could not afford to do so.

What is a good estimate for recovery time? How long would it take for me to comfortably do everyday activities. If I travelled, how long would I have to spend away from home?

Thank you.

xerox13ster,asktransgender,Missed the team meeting tonight. It's a good thing too.,"They were discussing who would be off the floor tonight for online training courses, and my name came up.

The training coordinator called me and a friend of mine, but she rightly called me Heather. My floor manager corrected her and called me deadname. The training coord. Corrected her and they went back and forth over it two or three times. Finally the training coordinator had to tell her ""Her name is Heather, now stop.""

My friend told me it was at this point that the room went quiet and one woman (who has been generally ignorant but not necessarily malicious previously) piped up and said ""It's just a dude pretending to be a girl anyway.""

So. Glad. I. Wasn't. There.

She'd be dead and I'd be in prison. I've been crippled by dysphoria all day. Social, physical, reproductive. I'd been stressing about that gunman running around up here somewhere because I'm still living in my car, and I almost decided not to come into work because I've been such a wreck.

I don't even know where to begin to go to address this since I wasn't present to witness it. :/


**Edit:** I am not going to do this without telling the manager, but she has a habit of addressing me as deadname, and I always forcefully correct her. One night she got short with me and said I would have to give her time because I came to work in boymode at first. 

Thing is, I came from the corporate office and people seem to forget that. I have contacts there that can and will make their life hell. The training coordinator knows this as she handled my transfer and was the one to onboard me. 

I'm giving them each one more chance. Then I'll let the Director of our division tell them what my name is.

5637throwaway84,asktransgender,"Passing, but eventually getting figured out at places you frequent","So, the first 5 times I go into say a coffee shop everyone's demeanor says I pass. People I haven't seen in years are blown away and say shit like ""I'm glad you look so good because it'd be awkward and weird if you didn't pass."" Whatever. That's kind of shitty I know but it's mildly validating... Which I hate myself for. Anyway generally if I start going somewhere a lot they give me lots of compliments on my hair, makeup, outfits etc. Guys check me out and ask me out... I felt like I kinda made it but after a couple of months full time I feel like there's always one person that'll clock you and next thing you know people are smiling at you weird and treating you with kids gloves. Everyone is nice but it's like fuck, I'm tired of getting exactly what I wanted 99% of the time and then one asshole has to ruin it for whatever reason. They never indicate that they know and call me she, still compliment me... But I know what's going on. I've had to tell guys I'm trans after a few dates so even they don't realize it. Is this common even if you're in the 1% that pass 99% of the time? I mean I've had guys fucking break their necks to check me out in a dress and give me that fuck me smile. I mean I used to do that and i know what it looks like - I'm not imagining it. So why why why can't it just be all the time? I know this is a whiny first world trans problem but i hope it doesn't get downvoted to oblivion because it's still valid. I still need support. So I hope everyone out there isn't a dick. Thanks."
in_an_egyptian_river,asktransgender,What's the first step?,"Hi everyone! Not really sure how to ask it so I'm just going to stream-of-thought my question if that's OK.

So I'm 22 now, but for the last 15 years or so I've heard voices, one of which was that I was meant to be a girl - that was the first one and it never really went away but younger me knew that wasn't quite right so I sort of ignored it.

Anyway fast forward to a month or so ago and the voices in my head got real bad, I'm terrified of my reflection and can't look at myself or go outside or anything (yay!) and I finally went to see the GP (I'm in England). Couple of urgent referrals later and I'm on some dope antipsychotics and the voices are all gone! Except for the one that says I was meant to be a girl. That's just still hanging around getting in the way.

So it gets me thinking - maybe it's not a voice and maybe it's just the way I am - over the years the only way to get rid of it is to dress up (for lack of a better word, sorry!) and for a brief second everything's calm and I'm happy... and then I end up feeling guilty and carry on ignoring it.

Anyway, I'd quite like to work on getting this thought better or doing something so I can feel normal/happy again - it all feels so close - but I don't know what to do. Believe me when I say I read most of the posts on here but I still don't know quite what to do.

So I guess my question is in the title - what's the first step? Who do I get in touch with or ask or anything? There seems to be a lot of you who worked out this first step and it's just really bloody confusing innit.

Thanks for reading! :)"

um.... My odd question is that is it normal to have 5 o'clock shadow on your chest and dose that get better when you start hrt? ( pre everything)   As currently I am a hairy Winston atm and its not a particularly nice feeling.  "

yfbb,asktransgender,had first counseling session,"had my first counseling session this morning. had to get up early, and walk 30 mins to get to it

i think it went well. he asked a lot about how i came to the conclusions that i was trans, growing up, experimenting with dressing up, etc. i dont know how helpful it was, but at least i told someone outside of anonymous internet people. 

i am curious how these sessions and such usually go though. i dont know if mine was different or anything, so id like a point of refference"
debraMckenz,asktransgender,Anyone else worried about the repercussions for us if Donald Trump becomes president?,"Is anyone else worried about what will happen if Trump gets in office? I mean a ton of bad things obviously but I'm talking about more for the trans community. 

In some ways, being mostly stealth and living in Seattle, I'm not really affected.....but I still worry about it.....not just for myself but for the pure injustice of it for anyone who is trans.

Bathroom laws, medical/insurance, reparative therapy, just all kinds of things that could be affected by an ignorant nincompoop in office.

Is anyone else worried?"
carefreearchgeek,asktransgender,How you felt about your sexuality prior to even questioning,"Before I even started questioning this I always felt a little off about my sexuality. I was never in any doubt about who I was sexually attracted to, women, but ""straight"" just never felt comfortable. And I don't mean the word, it's just a word, I mean the idea of me with a woman as a man never sat right with me, while the idea of me with a woman as a woman just felt right. I've come to realise that obviously this would be because I'm not a straight guy, I'm a lesbian (probably, barring orientation change under the effects of HRT).

I'm just wondering if other people went through similar stuff? or did your sexuality factor into this differently? Or is this something unusual?"
YungStirner,asktransgender,"Realistically, when should I start considering FFS?","So I've finally started HRT (yaay!) and while just being able to begin this journey has improved my mood and eased my dysphoria it's also forced me to put its limits into perspective, particularly the ones that I won't be able to work on myself.

For context, my face isn't *too* bad, but it's certainly not great. Thankfully my chin, cheeks and jawline are fairly androgynous aside from the beard shadow and I feel that HRT will do wonders for it but things aren't so good above that point. It's not quite as extreme as the stuff some trans women have to put up with but I have some fairly noticeable brow bossing and feel like it's always going to be a strong male signifier unless I get rid of it. More importantly, my nose is AWFUL. Too long, nasty flared nostrils, slightly hooked and with an ugly bump in the bridge. Even before accepting transition as an inevitability I was planning on getting rhinoplasty anyway, despite the amount of judgement people throw at you for even considering it. From what I've seen those two areas aren't going to be helped by HRT at all and the only way of actually dealing with them is through surgery.

Anyway, given that I'm going to have to have FFS at some point to deal with these problem areas and already have enough money available to spend on them, is there really much reason for me to wait for this? I've seen a lot of people saying to wait after two years of HRT for optimal results but can't really see much reason to, especially not for my browline. I know that I should count my blessings that most of my aesthetic issues are possible to fix and that passing/attractiveness isn't everything, but I don't really relish the thought of spending a couple of years not passing just in case a little bit more slope on my nose bridge would be a bit more flattering in the long term or whatever. The only other areas that I might need to get dealt with head-wise are a tracheal shave (which our health service will possibly pay for and that doesn't bother me much) and my hairline (which isn't too bad really and could get fixed by HRT if I'm lucky). Given that these facial features are really eating into my confidence and will probably continue to do so until I take care of them, should I start looking into FFS sooner rather than later, or suck it up and play it safe for a year or two?"
Transgfthrowawayway,asktransgender,What are some sensitive subjects I should be aware of?,"As a bit of background - I (cis man) recently started dating a pre-op mtf Transgirl. So far it's been great, she's sweet, funny, smart, etc. And she's fairly open about the subject of transitioning, but the entire subject is a bit difficult to discuss as I'm kind of navigating blind and don't have a good concept of what might be a particularly sore subject that should be treated with extra sensitivity.

So I was wondering what specific subjects within the scope of dysphoria and transitioning as a whole would be potential landmines. Some of it is clearly not too bad - the whole thing with pickles comes to mind. But there are other things that are or could be important to discuss that would impact the relationship, and I'm just trying to figure out when I should really spend the extra time rehearsing what I'm going to say. I'd rather not say something that seems innocuous to me, but is actually particularly hurtful to her.

Also, if there are any resources on dating transgirls or trans people in general as a cis person, those would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance."
TempestSwift,asktransgender,Anyone else..,"So  work at a grocery store that is not as big as walmart but they are our competition. The store is pretty good now about policies for transgender folks, some in part thanks to me I assume..anyways I work as a service coordinator/service desk and cashier at times. I have got to the point where I correct people that use the wrong pronoun.. But it is obvious the correct one to use.. Female voice, female name CLEARLY visible to the customer.

 I'm just wondering, does anyone else do this at all? Correct people that you can practically tell are doing it to be an asshole? I had some lady, after I corrected her, look at me so upset that she apologized the entire time her card was processing. And I only corrected her because she was right behind someone that even called me ma'am and a coworker did as well. 

 Like.. work even told me that if someone makes me uncomfy I can refuse to service them. and the funny part is.. I am one the best for customer service according to a large percent at the store.

Sorry for the rant I am a little off the last few days, lots of stuff going on. "
princessluna3000,asktransgender,"Hey I'm an cis woman and I have an couple of questions for trans man, if yall don't mind.","I had an perception of trans men, an negative one in which they were selfish assholes. I honestly don't know where I got that perception from but I had it. While my perception of transwomen were and still is postitive. Nonetheless I met an trans guy at work who was really sweet and whom I got along with just fine. He ended up getting terminated before I could form an close relationship and ask such questions to him. Since I haven't met any trans men (from my knowledge). I consider myself pansexual and am opening myself up to to trans men and being sexual with them, and romantic as well.

The questions are even if one gets top and bottom surgery, do you have to continue to take hormones/testosterone? 

How likely will it be you will get bottom surgery and why or why not?

How common is it for transmen to perform oral on an cis -woman; would it be considered repulsive to put your mouth on something that you didn't want on your own body?

For transmen who haven't the desire for bottom surgery, how do you feel about being penetrated/ or penetration in general? 

I read some post on FL about transmen cumming more than cis men in volume; is this true? Once you get bottom surgery, can you cum/ejaculate? 

Is it possible to get an woman pregnant; I'm assuming this one is no since the chromosomes are still xx.

Thank you all for reading this; I also apologize if I said anything offensive or ignorant. I don't really know if it's okay to say transmen or ftm-sorry in advance. 

Edit: Thanks a lot yall for the responses. I saw the r/ftm but didn't see much interaction which was why I posted here. As for the ejaculations part, I'll see if I can Google it or research it to find out. 

Edit 2: I found answers in regards to the ejaculation part. It is rare but apparently if the secretional glands are kept when creating the testes, it is possible. And yes the pregnant part, I was asking if transmen could get women pregnant. Not transmen getting pregnant-I know that one =). I am also aware of the experiments with female getting other females pregnant in various other species. Once again, thanks yall =)"
Questioning250,asktransgender,Possible to have dysphoria w/out being Trans (at least binary)?,"My situation is this. I feel I might be genderfluid due to enjoying being a guy, enjoy my body, etc. Though I feel I have some desire to be a girl and feel I would enjoy it about equally (especially sexually). I didn't think I had body dysphoria but for awhile now I've had this intensifying feeling of something missing in the chest area (phantom breasts), to the point where when I wake up in the morning I'll use the blanket/pillow to act as ""breasts"". 

Is it possible to not be Trans or be genderfluid and have dysphoric symptoms like these? If I don't want to transition then what do I do about this dysphoria?"
desperate_and_weird,asktransgender,I'm dangerously depressed and I'm not sure what to do... I have a lot of questions. (MtF),"It hit me fairly recently that I really don't feel like a guy, and that is one of the reasons I've always hated myself. I'm not sure why it took me so long to figure that out since I've been roleplaying girls since I was a kid, and I've almost always pretended to be a girl online, but there you go. I'm also mildly autistic, so you can imagine how miserable my social life has been: I've never had any friends, or relationships.

I'm 23 now, and I've been in serious depression for the past 8 years or so, to the point where I dropped out of school, and don't go out anymore. I see a psychologist, I take antidepressants and all, and it helps to an extent, but I still don't feel like staying alive for much longer. I know I'll never feel comfortable in my own skin like this, but I don't know if it's worth going through with a transition. It sounds like a LOT of time and effort for something that might not even yield any satisfying results.

I'm worried about a lot of things...
First of all, how successful it would be. I've seen pictures of MtF transitions going wonderfully and all, but I've also seen a lot of MtF people that look honestly really off. You can tell they used to be guys, they look bad, and I really don't like it. It's gonna sound super offensive to a lot of people I'm sure, and I'm very sorry about that, but to me they look like failed experiments. If I end up like this, then no, I don't want to bother, I want to be an actual girl, not some weird mix between the two. I don't want to see confusion and uneasiness in people's eyes when they see me, I don't want everyone to be able to tell and try to politely avoid the subject.

My second big worry is about my family. Since I'm unemployed and autistic, I still live with my parents and siblings, and I'd feel extremely uneasy explaining that to them. I'd legit never be able to talk to them again I think... I'd have to be 100% sure that transition would be perfectly successful before I go through the trouble of coming out to them. I'm not even worried about them being accepting of it or not, if anything I'm sure they'd support me, but I just... couldn't look them in the eye again, personally. It'd be way easier if I lived on my own, but sadly I'm nowhere near that.

So like I said, I have a lot of questions...

First of all, what makes a transition more or less successful? Why is it so seamless for some people, and so obvious for others? Is it because they haven't gone through the full process yet? Is it because they're naturally less masculine, what in the shape of their face and all? Is there a way to tell how it'd look in the end?

Second of all, what needs to be done exactly? I've heard of estrogens and all, but of course there's more to it than that... What's the process like? Regular surgeries? How often? And how long does it take to reach an acceptable result? Is it painful? Are there any common and nasty side effects?

I'd appreciate honest, no bullshit answers. I don't want to be pushed to go through with it for instance. If it's long, complicated, painful, and I end up looking like shit, I want to know.

Is it worth it, or should I forget about that and try to do with the cards I've been dealt, even though it makes for quite a crappy hand?"
CelestialSeraphir,asktransgender,self care tips,"Times can be rough for everyone, but especially for us. So I thought I'd share some self care tips and hope you'll share the ones that've helped you too.

-Take a bath, warm water will help your body relax and in turn, help your mind. And feeling clean is a good feeling.

-Call someone that cares about you. It can get lonely going through things and they'd like to hear your voice too.

-Get into bed with a book or a movie and let go for a few hours. Snuggle under the covers, with someone if you can, and just let your mind be taken away from life for a moment.

-Stop thinking all those anxiety inducing thoughts about your future. Instead focus on what does make you feel happy now and build up those things, focus on what would make you feel accomplished by tomorrow."
somegayguyistaken,asktransgender,Is it possible to be trans without dysphoria?,"I've been questioning things for a few months and so far everything's pointing towards me being trans, however I don't think I've ever experienced gender dysphoria. I've hated my broad shoulders and rectangular frame for a while but I feel like that's a whole seperate issue (I was deffinitely confident about it earlier in puberty when I had more of a thin hourglass shape and was really lean). I've also enjoyed the feeling of tucking and giving off more feminine body language as well as liked the idea of living as a female.

So is this normal? Not really suffering from much, if any, body dysphoria while still having most other things pointing at me being trans? Am I actually trans?"
SolitaryOrchid,asktransgender,Existential Crisis,"I can't help but wonder what the point to all of this is. I'm in college and my anxiety keeps beating me down. It's only been a few weeks in but I keep having to skip classes because I have a nervous breakdown. And my depression is starting to rear its ugly head again hard. I just keep wondering what I'm doing any of this for.

What's the end game if I keep going to college? Get a job? Then what? Spend my existence working for a weekend that I'm too stressed to do anything useful with and just binge netflix all the time? That's what I do now and I don't see why that would change. I want to have a real life where I can go out with friends and travel but I'm restricted to the God damned house because I'm such a ball of nerves. It's not like having a job would be any less stressful than college. Is this meaninglessness just going to be the rest of my life forever? I've been mentally disabled for the past 6 years and am just going back to college and only taking two classes to try and ease myself in but just that's enough to have me falling apart.

And what's the point of transition? My hips are so friggin' wide and my face so feminine and my breasts so big that I can't see how any amount of HRT is ever going to make me pass. I have a fucking hourglass figure and my waist is 10 whole inches skinnier than my hips which are huge and there's absolutely nothing I can do about that. My proportions are 43 inch bust, 37 inch waist, and 47 inch hips. I look like a friggin' pom bottle. I had such high hopes for HRT but I just don't see how it can do enough for me. I can't change my bone structure.

I used to be ok with there being no meaning to life but now it's really getting to me. What's the point of all of this? I can't do the things I want to do, I can't go the places I want to go, and I can't be what I want to be. I'm just a woman to them all and how can I honestly believe they'll ever see me any differently? How can I believe that I'll ever see my real self in the mirror rather than this lump I posses that has bumps and curves in all the wrong places?

Someone please talk me out of suicide. I need help and I have too much voice dysphoria to call a hotline. If I have any more dysphoria right now I think I might just jump off the nearest bridge. I don't know how to keep going."
SelfLoathing91,asktransgender,"I don't know how to feel, happy or.. what? But I'm also scared.","So even before hormones my body has always been rather androgynous, my body is awkward for both male and female. I hate/love that my passing is my voice... So people usually hesitate to ma'am or sir me until hearing my voice. (I don't dress over the top feminine.. but not exactly masculine either)

Honestly I want to ask for opinions but I'm too scared to put my photo up on this reddit or transpassing considering I'm one of those who wants to sink into deep stealth and just acknowledge they had a trans past and will do what they can to support others who were in their position. Especially because my dysphoria isn't fun to cope with as is and I need to fool myself as much as possible. (What I mean is, my dysphoria strongly desires.. to transform into a cis woman which is impossible, transwomen can get close but my dysphoria won't accept it. But ugh.. I don't want to go too deep into it for risk of driving myself insane and offending others.)

I'm scared because of the fact of my body being androgynous that it's going to hurt the effectiveness HRT is going to have on me. Or the changes will be so subtle I'll still be androgynous... I'm either 5'4, or 5'5 and I wear a 8 - 9 in Women's shoes, no real hip definition and I have the body shape of a banana according to my measurements. My weight's in the healthy range.

My hands aren't dainty and small but they're not massive and rough either. Only real masculine thing about them is all the hair on the sides but it isn't that noticeable unless you bring your eyes right on my hands...

I know HRT functions differently for everyone but I just.. I don't know what's wrong with me but all the problems with my body aren't ones that FFS and the like can fix. Plus it doesn't help I started later then I should of, I guess it helped I didn't start puberty until I was 15 but... I'm 25 now and I started HRT at 25 so I'm sure puberty changes were locked in stone.

Also.. what I'm saying is the view points and opinions shared to me by my trusted circle of friends who at first didn't even know I was trans. I suffer from Body Dysmorphic Disorder as well as Gender Dysphoria particularly genital dysphoria.

I just.. I don't know maybe hearing from someone who started androgynous and looks female without a doubt now. Started in their 20s or 30s even and after years of hormones looks female... I just feel like, I don't know what I feel like. By no means am I considering detransition but I am confused and frustrated especially since I can't visually see myself.. I see the image that my parents and family engraved in my head when I was younger and they were transphobic and wanted to lock me in a masculine role."

OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,What should I look for in a therapist?,"Okay, so my dad and I are gonna look into a therapist soon. But I live in Bumfuck nowhere and Gender therapists are something I know don't exist around here. 

So, what should I be looking for? I don't want one that is ""day 1 Hormones now"" without actually talking, but I also don't want one who is like ""I know you want them, but I don't think you should start HRT"".

I want one that will work with me and listen to me while also not taking the easy way out and just start me on Hormones no matter if I truly need them or not. I also need Said therapist to educate my dad. He's said no matter how things will go he'll support me but that I shouldn't jump to rash decisions too soon(which I agree with). He'll need to learn more to understand and support me. 

I actually tried shaving my Arms, which I now regret because I could never finish and now it looks awkward and people at school make fun of me. He doesn't want me shaving or doing anything that will draw huge attention, which is reasonable. But if through therapy HRT starts becoming more of a NEED, he'll need to learn and understand that I'll have to start doing that stuff regardless of what kids say.

Anyway, I don't want names, just more general tips and signs for finding and dealing with REGULAR therapists.

I also hate being and feeling vulnerable. I don't like talking about my feelings. I'm seeing a therapist who is helping me with my transition, and I don't know if a support group would help me. I think maybe it would be a good way to make friends, but...

Mistress_Impervious,asktransgender,MTF Need help please!!,"Hi there, I’m new to Reddit, but I’ve kinda been lurking around for the past few months being envious of you beautiful people!
My friend who is also trans suggested that I should turn to this part of reddit to help myself, and maybe some of you could help me out with this problem. She’s been very supportive of me for the past year, but lately I’ve just been so lost even she doesn't know what I should do. I’m going to explain a lot in depth, so I can hopefully have none of you in the dark about what I have done/haven’t done. 

Obviously I am transgender, main reason I’ve come to this part of reddit looking for answers. I just turned 19 five days ago, and I haven’t taken any hormones yet at all. I live in Indiana, and have five younger brothers. I’ve known that I’m transgender from a young age, but I didn’t really push the issue a lot. It wasn’t until a year ago when I started having really bad dysphoria that I explained it to my parents. Their reaction was less than stellar, with a LOT of yelling and threats to kick me out even before my 18th birthday. They didn’t carry out those threats, but it was frustrating. 

My parents have never been to church (that I know of), and my mom only brings up a god when a disaster happens (ie. A housefire we had in February) so they aren’t particularly religious. They are from hardworking families, my mom being raised in the country and my father being raised in Indianapolis during the mid 70’s and early 80’s. Both of them had a parent who left them at a young age, and were the youngest of their family. My mother has an engineering degree from Purdue, and my dad has a highschool degree, but has an RCDD license. Mother has been a stay-at-home-mom since I was born, and my dad works a lot. They now own their own business, and compete against larger companies in national jobs (ie. They got a contract to install stuff at Google HQ in California). Only explaining them because I know that for some of you this info may help. 

I myself, was homeschooled until 7th grade. When I transferred to an out-of-county school, I was offered to place in 9th grade classes, or 8th grade. I, being an intimidate kid, declined the offer simply because I was afraid the older kid would pick on me. When I went into school though, I didn’t know a lot of social stuff. I got called a faggot a lot, and called gay beyond belief. It was a daily routine that hurt. I didn’t know how to deal with it, and I insisted that I was not gay whatsoever, and became a very angry person. My parents pulled me out of school after 7th grade, and I spent a year homeschooling until highschool. During that time, I started to recover, but was still feeling suicidal, and didn’t want to talk to my parents about it.

In highschool, I went to the local school near my house. During the time there, I strived to fit in as much as possible. Being that I was a swimmer, and very good at it, I tried my best to become the best. Although that never happened, I was trying my best. I tried to be a jock, all buff and much of an asshole, but I still got laughed at. Essentially, I tried to be as “masculine” as possible. This worked, for the most part, and I got my first girlfriend during my second year of highschool. She was a tolerant girl, very sweet but commanding and eventually disliked me. The main reason she broke up with me, as she claimed, was because I was a “wuss” or acted like a sissy to much. Which I took for being to “nice of a guy” at the time. Now in retrospect, she was good for me. Before her, I despised anybody in the LGBTQ+ community. I thought they were “weird” and didn’t want to associate them with me. Looking back I believe this was due to being bullied in middle school, so I built this false reality around myself to fit in. 

School years aside, college approached. I was nervous for college, and didn’t know what I should do. Should I start dressing the way I want? Should I come out as trans? Should I just go stealth? Well I went stealth, and that’s what my parents knew. I told them I was “confused that summer” and they let me go off without the blink of an eye. During that semester of university, I had fun, and eventually opened up to people. First coming out as bisexual, then full blown out gay. People were accepting, and I made a few close friends. My girlfriends and I were always there for each other, and it was awesome that I had accepting people there. I hadn’t fully told anybody that I was trans, but when I got drunk a couple of nights, I was a giggling mess. 


So some events happened in the past year that have affected everything about my life:
-September 18th of 2015 my grandmother had a stroke; quite possibly the worst relative I had, became even worse after the stroke and she had to live with us until February of 2016
-February 16th 2016 a couch in my house caught on fire in the living room, ignited by grandmother’s electric heating blanket. We put out fire before department got there, and there was extensive smoke damage and so direct damage. 
-A week after house fire a motorcyclist rear-ends my mother’s van, which I was driving, because he couldn’t brake in time. Nobody injured, but I feel so bad for the guy. Was not my fault, as the guy in front of my had no turn signal and stopped suddenly.
-insurance company refused to pay for certain damage costs, and have caused a lot of stress with my mother. We have still not moved in. 
-In July I got a brand new car with the help of my parents, a 2016 Ford Focus. Three days ago I got in a fender bender (my fault) and scraped a lady’s car. 

	
	Alright that’s my life story in a quick summary that nobody wants to read lol. 
I’ve been to a gender therapist three times, and came out to parents again. Therapist charged me $65 each time, and wasn’t a great help. She was quite aggressive and scared me a bit. My parents reacted a lot calmer this time, but my mother didn’t want me “influencing” my brothers and said that our health insurance wouldn’t cover it (surprise it does). I told them this was something that has been bothering me for a long time, and they took this as me trying to be the centre of attention in my household. Past few months I’ve been struggling, and have even felt suicidal at a point. I’m lost and don’t know what to do. I am open to suggestions, and will answer any questions anybody has.

mor1em,asktransgender,I'm confused...,"So for a while now I thought I was a trans boy. I came out to my mom three weeks ago and have started using he/him pronouns. Before this I identified as agender, but I thought for sure I was trans. Now when I look in the mirror I don't see a boy, I just see a person. I don't want hormones or bottom surgery and I don't want to look very masculine. I want to be androgynous. Am I trans? I know you guys can't give me the answers but any advice would help."

I'm currently a straight male and the thought of a relationship w/ a guy repulsed me. However I'm afraid due to the fact that my sexual fantasies often consist of me as a girl w/ a guy. Although it's more where the guy is a prop and I focus on myself as the girl. Do you think my orientation will change? Maybe bi at the worst?
Saracma,asktransgender,"Been on hormones for like 9 years, haven't really seen any results.","So I'll preface that like, before I went on hormones I already had zero body hair and pretty smooth skin. So if those changes happened I definitely didn't notice ;x

That said early on when doing hormones chest was definitely very sensitive and nipples did get a little bigger buut then like 4 months after starting that chest sensitivity started to fade and pretty much nothings changed since then.

I think mentally I feel better on hormones but I would have maybe liked a *little* chest growth. So now I'm wondering if maybe I've done something wrong? Can I still see results even though I've been on hormones so long? Should I maybe try gaining weight? 

My weight has been pretty consistently the same for the past decade :v so idk if that would have any effect. That said during those first 4 or so months chest was sore and it definitely felt like something might be going on. Now I don't feel any soreness."

Terra2278,asktransgender,Laser and electrolysis for dark hair with some grey.,"Hi all. I am currently working my way through lasering up my face. Unfortunately about 5%of my hair has gone grey and requires electrolysis. Does anyone know how long after a laser session I should wait before an electrolysis session? 

Thanks!"
[deleted],asktransgender,How do I know what gender I am? What do I do with this information?,"Here's a little background. I have known something was ""weird"" about me for a long time. At age 16, I discovered trans people existed and figured that I was FtM because of extreme physical and social dysphoria. I'd been cutting my chest since puberty. I was also very depressed and often suicidal. At 18, I went on T for 5mos.

My depression did not fade on T. Emotionally, I was equally as disconnected as before, though I'd expected to feel happier or... something. I began to experience dysphoria towards the few things T gave me (back hair and thinning of head hair) while also having continued dysphoria towards the things T couldn't or didn't change (voice, hips, height, breasts). I stopped T feeling extremely awful and put myself back into the closet.

I've tried dissecting and isolating my feelings. It seems I want a flat chest, tall stature, narrow hips, and a lower voice. I do not, however, want body hair, male pattern baldness, penis/clitoral growth, facial hair, large muscles, or particularly wide shoulders. I long for a male or neutral name and a male social role (can't tell if dysphoria or just not wanting to be treated like utter shit), but don't actually want to be truly ""male"". But there is nothing else. 

Gender is your internal sense of male or female, right? Which body you should have/which hormone to run on? 

What happens if you run bad on *either* hormone? What happens to people who feel bad with either body? How do I exist in a world where what my brain expects me to be doesn't exist? How do I be someone who can't exist? How do I stop wanting to die?

BlueRose729,asktransgender,Difficulty gaining weight?,"For context, Im 6' 2"" and I currently float around 135-140 pounds. Ive been on Spiro and E for about three months now, and Ive been trying to adjust my eating habits to take more calories on, so I can gain some weight and the estrogen can do its thing, but I have had a lot of difficulty. Is there anything I can realistically do to help this? Or is it possible that genes and metabolism and things mean Im screwed and will be a twig forever?"
MorganX85,asktransgender,Why do I feel like songs are a message to me specifically?,"I just listened to a song that directly talks to me, this song I listened to is somewhere I belong by linkin park .

And ""I wanna find something I've wanted all along. I feel like this song is talking to me telling me I really am trans. Like I never thought my trans was real but I do wanna find the something that is causing me the pain. I wanna find that something to fill that emptiness, I get everything I could ever want but I still hurt and long for something. It could be a relationship, but I've had some but this pain always comes back when the relationship ends. Is this just me or is this song telling something personal to me?"
CircleNoise,asktransgender,Fun weird pre-transition stories,"Hey all, i've had two instances of odd kinda-cis-fails recently, one this morning. Felt super weird about both. Anyone else have any unusual things said before you were out? Any fails that don't make sense? I'd love to read them!

Background: i'm only recently hatched, not presenting any different than before i knew/accepted my trans-ness. I am tall and slim, short-ish dyed silver/white hair, wear black nail polish, skinny jeans, form-fitting tshirts. Kinda hipster but whatevs. I still carry myself like an awkward, shy male. I don't present my tru gender yet. 

Story 2: this morning i drove to the mini-mart near my apartment and my wife walked in to get our energy drinks (addicted!) while i waited in the car. There's been this older dude with a staring problem a few times lately, not creepy but not altogether there. Today he was parked with his window next to mine. He waved, looking a little inebriated at 8 in the morning, i waved back, and checked my email. I always kinda figured he was just ogling my wife, which was not awesome but harmless.

Wrong (or maybe he was doing that, too). As my wife was walking back to the car, i realized he was staring at me. I looked up and he said something i couldn't hear. I started to roll down the window, and he asked me, ""Are you a girl or a boy?"" with a big dumb smile on his face. 

Without pausing, i rolled the window back up and made a face, eyebrows furrowed and lips pursed to one side, a weird mixture of disgust and confusion. My wife got in the car and we drove off while i told her what had happened. It was like a scene out of a 90s flick with John Cusack and Janeane Garofolo.

I had a bit of scruff and felt gross that morning. The rest of my day was, oddly, very good (i'm non-binary).

Story 1: i was at Dragon Con. Cons, of any notable size for those that don't know, always attract the fire &amp; brimstone street preachers, with literal soap boxes and megaphones, hoping to shame (not save) all us damned souls. 

I was walking by as he said something horrid about the ""sins of idolotry and homosexuality"". Naturally, i flipped him off as i walked past. Despite a multitude of others around him in bright costumes and makeup, he noticed me in jeans and tshirt. He shouts (into a megaphone), ""That's fine, you can flip me off, but i know what's in your heart. Just remember: you're a man not a young lady!""

I almost fell over laughing. I had JUST come out to my best friend who was right there. I flipped him off again, with both hands raised all the way as i walked away laughing.

I then let it build up in my head all day and the biggest drunken nervous breakdown that night. ""How did he know???"" Asshole. 

What stories do you all have?"
forest__creature,asktransgender,If you could change your gender - not your sex - would you do it?,"So you have a button in front of you, and if you press it then your gender changes. Inside you feel like the opposite gender than you always have, or a binary gender if you're non binary. Do you press it?

I'm pre everything and I have a nice woman's body. Problem is - I'm a man. I think I'd press it, and live life as a woman. I'd have to redact my coming out to my family, which would suck, but other than that there wouldn't be too many consequences for me, and I could live life as a cis woman. 

But I just feel like it wouldn't be ""me"" anymore some how. 

If I had already started transition I don't think I would press it. Then again, I have a lot of genital dysphoria, and I find the options for trans men pretty lacking as far as bottom surgery. I'm not sure.

AndiGurl,asktransgender,Admitting to myself I'm trans. Looking for advice on some concerns and finding a therapist.,"
So I think I'm finally ready to admit I'm trans and stop being in denial. And this is me dipping my toe into the waters I guess, or my foot... whatever.
I found your sub recently and have been lurking a bunch trying to educate myself a bit and work up some courage. 

I feel I've no idea what I'm getting into as far as this goes, I'm looking for some validation and to make sure I'm not just forcing it. 
Any tips or things I need to watch out for looking for a therapist? (also if anyone knows good ones in central Ohio i might want to look into?).
I've been suppressing the hell out of myself for probably the last 15 or so years. And have been quite miserable. 
Tons of anxiety around this whole situation. As being the man (or trying to) I've developed a bad habit of bottling things up, so talking aint easy.

Primarily I'm very worried about this disrupting my entire life (it's not all bad no matter how shitty i feel). But I'm also tired of feeling so messed up.
Stuff that's been on my mind a lot as I've become more bold about this:

- Transition seems so great yet so terrifying. How the hell do you handle this with people that know you before and after. There seems like there are so many when I think about it? especially on the professional front.
I feel like it could significantly undermine me on the professional stage. (Not be taken seriously etc.)
- I don't know if my wife would stay or be able to handle it. I know she likes the masculine parts of me for sure.
On the good side she admitted to me she is closer to Bi on the sexual spectrum, maybe not a deal breaker then.
- My family... oh god. Mother and Sister I think would be super supportive. My Dad would lose his shit. At one point he thought I was gay(ironically, kinda is right), while he wasn't abusive about it, it damaged our relationship, which i worked to repair. I'd hate to loose my relationship with him. My remaining grandparent would probably be disappointed but I don't know that he'd care too much. (im his fav grandson, and I care a lot about his opinion). In his very old age (90+) he's gotten a pretty rowdy who gives a shit attitude though. More distant relatives would also have some serious issues with it. I'm pretty close with most of my aunt/uncles and it would certainly not be something they would do well with...I could be surprised though I guess. Either way cutting them out would be difficult if they were overly negative just due to proximity.
- Did you have any relief quickly when you started HRT? Or did it take some time? I assume this is a YMMV type thing based on what level of dysphoria you have?
- What happens if you can't get your hormones anymore for various reasons? I'm not so naive to think everything would go smoothly. Job loss etc, could be a big deal.
- Somewhat superficial I guess... but I'd really be disappointed if i ended up not somewhat conventionally attractive at least a lil bit. I think I can certainly pass given some time. Especially since I'm not overly masculine looking to begin with. (bit of a baby face etc.). My voice is probably my biggest issue here. It's actually kinda deep.
- I'm type 1 diabetic. Anyone have experience with this and HRT?

Sorry, started rambling. So much to look into...
Any advice is SUPER appreciated!"
Lunaa7,asktransgender,"Thank you. Seriously, thank you.","I just took my first HRT pill some minutes ago, and I'm in shock. Looking back 9 months ago when I found out what the word ""transgender"" meant, I was so confused, and so alone. Never something felt so right. For all my life I've struggled with this feeling, deep inside, but always tried to run away. To run away from myself. But that never worked. So I came here, hopeless, scared. And surprisingly, I got the most amazing support I could ever ask for - I found out I was not alone. I was not a freak. I found out a brotherhood of brothers and sisters (and anyone in-between) who are together for a single reason: to make each other feel better, to make each other be happy being themselves. To give support and to show kindness. And oh you did it. Thank you for answering my stupid questions, for any stupid things that i've said and you guys backed me up and teached me a lot. A LOT. 

In these last months I got out of my depression all by myself. I went to therapy. I lost weight. I came out to my friends. I've never been so happy in my entire life; everything makes sense, and even tho I'm not me on the outside, I can safely say I found myself on the inside. And my journey is just beginning. To think I've been *this* close to suicide and looking back now is just unbelievable. 

My birthday is this sunday, 11/09. But being exactly 9 months ago, I feel like I've been born again. And I couldn't ask for a better gift. My life.

I cried the whole day today, and I wasn't even on fucking hormones yet. That's all your fault. Thank you. I love you all &lt;3

And... **IT'S FINALLY. FUCKING. HAPPENING!!!!!!!!** I'M SO. FUCKING. HAPPY. LIKE, SERIOUSLY. YOU CAN NOT UNDERSTAND. I CAN'T CONTAIN MYSELF. OMG. HALP.

All three of you thought it would be great fun to laugh at me and talk about me where I could hear you. I know I'm overweight. I'm working on it, but I don't need your comment that if I'd put my burger down, I'd lose weight. I didn't need your comment ""*you think she knows what a razor is?* **I don't know but if she did, you'd think she'd use it**""

Yeah. Good chuckles all the way around. I tried my best to ignore you, but I left my headphones in the car.

viziroth,asktransgender,I just can't shave close enough. Any tips? Am I stuck with this until I get permanent removal?,"So, MtF, and I realize I'll always have to deal with the shadow and how to wear red/orange under the foundation to cover up the color. My problem however is the actual sensation. No matter how tight I pull my skin, no matter what razor I seem to use, no matter if it's in the shower or after I shower, with or without shaving gel/cream, with or against the grain, doesn't matter if I go over the area 3 times, there's just always stubble after I shave. I run my hand over my cheek and I jut feel the sand paper of my beard grinding into my skin. 

Am I just stuck with this until I get laser/electrolysis? Or am I missing something with my tools/technique? I just now got to a point where I've stopped getting nicked every time I shave, and it took me forever to get the the point where I felt comfortable enough to actually look in the mirror while shaving, but even when my shaving is the best I've ever done there's still razor shard stubble making me never want to touch my face.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the tips. I have discovered something that doesn't work perfectly, but it still helped me get a closer shave than I ever have. I applied a leave in conditioner to my beard a little bit prior to shaving and it really helped. I think the issue really is just that I have really thick, strong beard hair, and nothing is really going to solve that short or permanent removal or damaging the follicles. I swear it's even stronger than the hair on my head. "

I'm torn between penileinversion in the US and scrotal inversion in Thailand I have questions though that I can't find answers too.

I'm not huge down there , 2 inches soft and like 5.5 hard, is it soft length, or erect/stretched length that matters for SRS? Would my size work for either technique? I can find recommendations but nothing telling me if they mean soft or hard length when they talk about your size.

I'm also circumcised and very worried that this will lead to poorly defined labia majora or minora, will this be a big issue? Or will things still look mostly normal even when circumcised? Is ether technique better for dealing with that?

Just some background I would like at least 5+ inches of depth and am very concerned about everything being well defined down there.

Chief_Gadfium,asktransgender,Have there been any studies into differences between late-onset and early-onset MTF's? Why are late-onset MTF's usually gynephilic?,"I came across an awesome [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskscience/comments/54f4hf/comment/d81h3p4?st=ITJ9HWZC&amp;sh=1591009a) yesterday in shittyaskscience of all places!

It links a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987404/) which mentions that most late-onset MTF's are gynephilic.

Does anyone know why that is? Have there been any studies into differences between late-onset and early-onset MTF's?

The two explanations I can think of are:
a) It's easier to be in denial or dismiss it as a fetish when you are gynephilic.
b) Gynephilic MTF's have less feminised brains and the realisation can take longer to emerge? (note that is not to say they are less female, it's just a different pathology)

LouisePetal,asktransgender,Programmers how have you dealt with name changes and source control.,"I have quite a few well used public projects in git and npm fortunately npm does not tie username to projects but github and GitHub does and every commit in a git repo has an email address and name tied to it. Has anyone else encountered similar issues in the past? and what was your solution?

I know git repos can be changed and force pushed and your username can change but that does the .git file location so anything that uses that file breaks (npm, DeployHQ, etc).

I really dont want my dead name plastered all over every repo as anyone that drills into them will put it together or think the code is not mine.

The thing is, they rarely do. My dad has never said my name even one time since I came out, almost as if he's deliberately blowing it off and ignoring it, and my mom only sometimes says it and when she does it's always with this tone that comes off as sarcasm.

I feel like none of this means anything to them, like they're treating it like it's some big joke or something. I don't know what to do. Should I confront them about it, or just let them carry on as they have without making a big scene about it? I hate my deadname so much, and now I hate it even when they say it, but the vibe I'm getting from them about it does not seem to be a supportive or even remotely caring one. I'm thinking I should just give up and surrender to the verbal torture that is my deadname.

I'll be starting HRT soon and am waiting to hear back from a tattoo artist, with whom I spoke a while ago. There's a chance the appointment will be scheduled for some time within the next few months. Part of the reason I want to get the tattoo is to mark the start of my transition - a decision which required a good deal of mental courage to make, but one which I am glad and in some sense relieved I made - you know the feeling.

Just having concerns regarding the tattoo: I'll be getting it on my upper arm/near the shoulder - would you advise that I get it once fat/muscle redistribution has taken place i.e. will it change enough for a tattoo go under considerable distortion, or should I not worry too much about it and go for it? From what I gather, fat distribution can take up to 2 years to complete/stabilise. It'd be a shame for this tattoo in particular to look like a mess once that has happened."

The Next Best Thing

How do you tell someone you’re transgender? It’s such a scary word, such a disordered word. It never occurred to me I could be one of those. And that’s the double-edged nature of words. They can both express and obscure. 

How do you tell someone you’re transgender? It’s such a ridiculous thing to have to say. I am a different gender. It’s embarrassing. It makes people think about your body. It makes people feel uncomfortable. Or disgusted. It makes people pity you. No one wants to be a Martian. But that’s how it feels. And then you have to explain it. 

How do you tell someone you’re transgender? Do you start with a joke? An anecdote? Do you just come right out and say it? There’s no real rule. It’s too new. Our only language for it is not a language at all. It is unspoken imagery—shadowy, weird, deviant, sick. It hints at a misshapen world of strange bars and coded encounters, of loose definitions and tight-fitting clothes. What is the world coming to? we might ask. Things used to be so simple, we might lie. 

How do you tell someone you’re transgender? There’s just no way to say it that makes it any better. And that’s why it takes so long. It’s simple math: Does your need for love outweigh your need to be who you are? And for many of us the answer is clear. Until it isn’t. 

But let me skip the introductions. Let me anticipate a few questions. I am not going to have surgery. L----- knows and still loves me. We believe A---- is better off with a happy, transgender parent than a miserable cisgender one. I like girls not boys. My name is Rose. 

Key Terms
Transgender: when your gender identity, the one you feel inside, your boyness or girlness, doesn’t match what your body says you are. 
Cisgender: when it does.
Gender identity: how you feel inside.
Gender expression: whether you dress up and act that way. 
Sexual Orientation: something else altogether. 
A---: who I was when I didn’t know/have the guts/feel the overwhelming need to be Rose. 
Rose: who I am.

Now let me explain. But before I do, let me interrupt myself: This is hard for me. Very hard. And I don’t mean finally being myself. That’s hard too, but in another way. It’s hard telling you. It’s hard having to bottle up my emotions so I can make sense. It’s hard wondering if you will still love me afterward. It is hard asking. It is hard putting you through something you never expected to be put through, hard being that person. And really this is why it has taken me so long. It is hard. 

Now let me explain. I am a girl inside. 

Let me start again. I have always known I am a girl inside. But transgender hadn’t been invented yet. I wasn’t sure if I believed I had a soul, but I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt it was a girl. This was my secret. But in the contradictory, psychological morass of childhood, I didn’t draw lines. I survived. And to survive as a boy is to not act like a girl. 

I did act like a girl. But I was good at sports. And they stopped picking on me. 

The beautiful thing about having problems is how they can distract you from what’s causing them. They’ve kept me busy in the form of eating disorders, depression, OCD. They’ve kept my therapists busy. We’ve been busy. Fixing holes. Refurbishing. Deconstructing. And it’s worked. 

Almost. 

But to be transgender is to have temporary solutions for a permanent problem. You can fix the leaks, but the rain’s not stopping.

I have been a boy, a feminine one. And this has worked. 

Almost. 

But that’s the thing with life. You keep going. You try. Or you don’t. 

I have tried. I have failed. I have tried. And done better. And gotten worse. And all that trying didn’t lead to nowhere. It has led to the embarrassing predicament in which I find myself. Feeling an overwhelming compulsion to apologize to my family for who I am.

I am going to skip other things. I am going to skip years and lifetimes and places. But I am also going to hold a magnet to it all and pretend I am a public defender. I am going to prove I am transgender.

Closing Argument
Have you seen me lately? 

Of course, I wish it were so easy. I wish there were a badge or certificate proving my status, showing it was not a choice, that it was “natural,” that it really is who I am. We all do. Because it’s a very confusing (and painful) journey for most of us. But I won’t bore you with that. I’ll just get right to the juiciest chapter, the last one.

One thing kept bugging me: why is my anxiety going through the roof when my life is better than it’s ever been? It didn’t make sense, and theories abounded. 

I’d met my true love. I’d found fulfilling work. I’d found even better work. We’d gotten cats and dogs. We had a house that was bigger than a breadbox. We had a car. Cable. Credit cards (but that’s another sad story). We even had an iPhone 5s. 

And yet, my anxiety, my OCD, my stomach aches and heart arrhythmias, real or imagined, my unexplainable phobia that someone will suddenly touch my neck, got worse. Much worse. I felt like a train that was going the right way into a wall. 

I did what any self-respecting, vaguely middle-class Jew does: I found a therapist.

She helped me. But when gender came up, she didn’t. I had a nervous breakdown. We didn’t tell anyone. I couldn’t leave the house. I decided not to think about gender.

I shut the box. I went about my business. And I felt better. But like all such port-of-calls, it wasn’t a place I could stay. In the dead of winter, I became depressed. But not just depressed: severely, dangerously, debilitatingly depressed. It came out of nowhere. And wanted to take me with it.

I decided to kill myself. And not in that maybe, could be, I wonder if I could kind of way. I decided to kill myself, as in there was no doubt in my mind that I was going to kill myself and soon. I put together my plan. I prepared. I was waiting for the right day. I wanted to die with the sun hitting the snow.  

I still didn’t know why. None of it made sense. My life hadn’t made sense. And I was tired of the hole in my chest that wouldn’t go away. I was tired of feeling unreal, of the unbearable tightness in my throat, and the feeling that something was desperately wrong, that something was after me. I was tired of feeling like I wasn’t in my body, of feeling like a breeze chained to a boulder. I was tired. And I wanted to sleep.

There was really only one problem. L-----. In the textbook way of depression, I had convinced myself that no one else would miss me. But L----- and I have an unspoken pact. We are together. In the deepest sense. We are going to help each other walk if we have to walk backwards. 

And so I told her. And she tried. And I tried. But it was too far. L-----, in case you didn’t know, likes girls (like likes). I told myself I could give this to her by leaving. Suicide is ever the companion of melodramatic justifications. 

She pushed and pulled me into seeing a therapist once more before dying. I felt I owed it to her. I no longer trusted therapists. The last one made things worse. 

“I am going to kill myself,” I told my new therapist. “I don’t know why. But I am.”

I said a lot of things. Per usual. 

I’ve always prided myself on being honest about how screwed up I am. At least I can do that, the thinking goes, at least I can do one thing right. And I did. I told her the sad, scary, and sometimes lovely truth as far as I knew it. But I didn’t know it. 

“There is something about gender,” I told her that first session, “but I don’t want to talk about it. It makes me feel crazy.” 

My therapist is one of the greatest people you will ever meet. When I wonder about fate, I think about meeting people like her. 

I don’t want to belabor the point. In a hundred different ways, through just as many sessions it became clear that I was not crazy. 

Transgender is just a fancy word for something else. That something else is what happened. Or more precisely, my ability to realize and handle that something else is what happened. 

My soul is a woman. That has never been in doubt. That it took me so long to connect the dots is what’s so confounding. Even studying it, working with it, being surrounded by it, it still took my planned destruction to overcome the stigma, fear and self-loathing I felt about it. 

If it’s unsettling to hear, imagine what it’s been like to live.

The more I embraced it, the better I felt. It was uncomfortable and sad to be gawked at and judged, sure, but it was light years better than the pain I’d been living with my whole life without even realizing it. 

The chronic physical and psychological dysphoria I’d grown accustomed to, the disconnected certainty that others couldn’t see or know me no matter what I did, that waking life was a burden and sleep something to dread, only became apparent as they began to lift. And they only began to lift as I became a girl. 

To be transgender is not so much to add a thing as it is to remove a thing that doesn’t belong. It is utterly familiar, something you’ve known all along but just remembered. The oppressive certainty that you must hide yourself, that you must, in fact, remain unaware of yourself is the condition that transgender treats. It is a journey we share, transgender or not, of becoming our authentic selves, of learning to love more fully. 

And so I am a girl. I prefer Rose, but understand how confusing it is and will accept whatever is comfortable. 

I am still me, just more so. 
And this is important: my humor hasn’t changed, I repeat, humor still solid. 

I have tried to be as honest and caring as I have known how. I have not always succeeded at it. But I have tried and will continue to do so. 

This may cause embarrassment. You may wonder what you will tell people. It may cause you to feel uncomfortable around me. And I am so sorry. Just know that if there was another way, a healthier way, I would take it. 

I am taking hormones. I love them. It is like switching from unleaded to diesel (further proving my point in that I have no idea what unleaded or diesel even are). 

I recently cried for almost an entire therapy session. I hadn’t cried that hard in years, maybe ever. And the reason I cried was you. Not because of anything you’d said or done. You’ve been so loving and kind to me, so generous, playful and open. No, the reason I cried wasn’t because you’d done anything wrong. It was because you’d done so many things right and the thought of losing that—the family I’ve always wanted—seemed too unfair and sad to handle. I cried for almost an entire therapy session at the thought of you loving me less because of who I really am. 

I do not believe that will happen. I know you to be wise and kind. But knowing that only does so much to relieve the fear and uneasiness. Because coming out is really a question: Can you still love me as I am?
And that’s a question no one likes to ask. Or have to answer. 

How do you tell someone you’re transgender? There is no good way. It is not what you want to be doing, not what you thought you’d be doing on your forty-somethingth birthday. You think, maybe if I find the perfect words. But you can’t. And so you do the next best thing. You speak from the heart and hope to God it’s enough.

All my Love,
Rose

alwaysunknown,asktransgender,How have you built confidence in yourself?,"Something I read that really helped me with coming out and going full time was [Taming The Mammoth](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html).  I first came to terms with myself that I had to do this, and each person I came out to gave me confidence to take the next step, all the way up to full time.   Since then though I have spent so much effort on passing and blending in, that I kind of forgot to let out and build my inner self.   I've been feeling like I swapped one shell for another, and I think that is where a lot of my current insecurity comes from.

I decided to go back and read it again last night, and rather than helping me get over the hump of telling everyone I'm a woman, it's made me feel ok about opening up a bit and actually developing my personality which think I have left behind a bit with the focus on blending in.

What were things you found or did that have helped you be or find who you are?"
princess_ozma,asktransgender,How do you come out to people??,"I know all situations are different but I always hate using words like transgender, transsexual,  used to be boy, etc... 

Pre-op when telling love interest boys I would get straight to the point,  ""I have a penis"".  The other option was ""I'm trans""... which leaves a bit of ambiguity I feel and I end up having to talk about my penis anyway.  

Telling friends,  I just go with ""I'm trans"" which seems to be fine.

Now that I'm post op... I haven't figured out how to do it yet.  I've been a bit less forthcoming about being trans but I still do need to tell love interests.  I think I could say ""I used to have a penis"" but at this point I don't like associating myself with a penis.  Maybe I could say I used to have a thing?  I want to say something that a) says I'm trans b) I have a vagina and c) ok let's move on, I don't want to talk about it... can we make out now?

Kindlemoose,asktransgender,Here's the story I need to hear....,"I'm 30 years old. I always had feelings of wishing I was a girl from a young age. But I didn't hate being a boy. As my sexuality developed I realised something was off. In my dreams sexually I was a woman. I felt sadness and jealously looking at women that I couldn't look like them but I also felt like I was a straight male. i realised what came naturally to me sexually was to imagine I had a female body. When I did that I felt turned on by the idea of being with a man. I also felt an attraction to trans  more than cis females. I have lead very male life. Friends and family had no idea I had these feelings inside. I didn't know if it was a fetish thing related to my sexuality or if I was transgender. I knew I could never look female because the bones of my body are too big and I'm balding. But I felt so constantly hopeless and depressed and sad inside that I had all these overwhelming feelings.
So I tried low does hormones.

I instantly felt mentally better. The constant pressure of this feeling through my sexuality lessened to the point where it went from a constant thing to occasional every few weeks. I felt able to concentrate on life something I had never felt able to do. I don't look female. I've been on hormones for 4 years and I've managed to tailor things so that I haven't grown breasts. I haven't had to tell my friends and family anything. My inner identity is more just that I'm a human being I don't care about gender. I still get jealous and sad that I will physically never look female but it doesn't overwhelm me. I feel positive about who I am and that a happy future is possible where I didn't feel that was even remotely possible before.

clumsycucumber,asktransgender,My (transgender) girlfriend and I recently broke up. It has left me feeling very confused. Help?,"**This got quite long. There's a tl;dr at the bottom.**

So I don't know how common my story is, but it's not something I ever expected to happen to me and it has left me feeling very confused about myself and where to go from here. I'll start by saying that I have always identified as a straight male. Anyway, about three years ago I attended a work night out. One of our colleagues is gay and his personality is very dominant, so he told us we we'd be heading to a gay club after visiting a couple of bars. This was fine and we were all quite enthusiastic about attending. 

We made it to the club at around 11pm and after a little dancing with some colleagues I decided to head to the bar to get some water. This is where I first met Charlotte. We chatted back and forth quite a bit and she explained that she'd come along with some of her gay friends. Since we had hit it off so well and I found her very attractive, I subtly let her know that I was there with a gay friend too. We ended up dancing a little, and she gave me her number before she had to leave with her friends. I had zero expectations of meeting anyone that evening which is probably why I met someone so wonderful.

The following day I gave her a call (I'm not one for playing the waiting game) and told her I had a good night and enjoyed meeting her. I asked if she would like to grab a coffee and continue our conversation from the night before in a quieter setting, to which she readily agreed. This meeting went even better than our first and I could tell I had met someone pretty special. We continued to meet up several times a week for the next couple of months and, as they do, things became progressively more serious. We'd started holding hands and kissing/hugging (but nothing more) by the time we had the discussion about what we were both looking for and she enthusiastically told me she'd like to be my girlfriend. It felt like we were already in a relationship by this point anyway but, of course, I agreed just as enthusiastically.

Things progressed as they had done previously and we continued to spend a few days a week together. She was very upfront about wanting to take things slowly and I was in complete agreement - this also meant sex and she mentioned how appreciative she was that I hadn't pressured her in any way on that front. Truthfully, I don't even think I brought it up for the first two-ish months that we dated. I loved the level of intimacy we had and was very fulfilled with it.

The first night we shared something sexual was probably three months into our relationship, so around five months after meeting. I understand this may same excessive to some, but it was right for us. Anyway, we'd finished watching a movie and were enjoying a make out session, when Charlotte went one step further and gave me a blowjob. Apologies for any graphic terms, I'm just trying to present the facts as they happened. Everything was going very well and we were now kissing very passionately, but as I tried to unbutton her jeans she pulled away and explained in quite an annoyed tone that she already told me she wasn't ready for that. I apologised, but also told her that she couldn't really blame me for thinking she was ready after everything that happened. She agreed with me and apologised, but reaffirmed that she wasn't ready for sex.

Things returned to normal but I admit that after 6 or so months I felt that we should at least discuss sex and when it might become a part of our relationship. Blowjobs were plentiful by this point, but sex was always off the cards. I explained that I respected her right to decide when she is ready, but as her boyfriend I should at least have some insight into her thought-process. She agreed and told me we could discuss it soon. 

A little while later - I don't remember how long, a few days maybe - I was sitting at home and she messaged saying we had to talk and told me to get on Skype. This immediately made me worried because we never have text conversations with each other and ""we need to talk"" are the four scariest words anyone can hear in a relationship. When I got on I could see she was in a very serious mood and I admit I feared the worst. We talked a little and I remember how she started crying and apologising. I honestly thought that she was going to confess to cheating on me or something. 

As I'm sure you are all very aware she did have a confession to make. I honestly don't remember much of the conversation because I was honestly in a lot of shock, but she told me she was a transgender woman. I confess that I knew practically nothing about what being transgender actually meant at this point, so my reaction was one of confusion more than anything else. I do remember asking her if she was a man though, and she reacted with a very, *very* forceful no. I asked her to explain what the hell she meant (I hate myself for it, but I got angry) by transgender. She told me a lot of different things but I honestly only remember the revelation that she had a penis. 

I broke up with her then and there and ended the conversation before I really had a chance to compute all of the information I had been given. I was shocked and  incredibly upset and as the minutes and hours passed I didn't even know *why*. I had a lot of different thoughts that I won't get into but I do remember the realisation that she was still the same girl she had always been and I would be an idiot to just leave her. I turned my phone back on and gave her a call, and she said she'd allow me to come to her place - this was quite a long conversation, but that's the most important part.

I still remember, clear as day, what happened when I got to her place. As soon as she opened the door I just grabbed her and hugged her for what felt like an eternity. She kept apologising through tears and I just hugged her tighter. When we finally untangled ourselves from each other I apologised for my behaviour and told her I didn't want to lose her. We stayed up practically all night while she explained so much about herself and answered my clumsy and unintentionally offensive questions. Eventually we went to sleep and that was the first night we slept in the same bed together. We said I love you for the first time that night.

If anything her confession and honesty actually brought us closer together. I admit to struggling with the fact that she'd lied to me for so long, but it'd very selfish of me to not see her side and her reasoning. In retrospect there were a lot of signs that she was hiding something from me and I feel really stupid for not seeing them. No sex and not even sharing a bed for months is a little strange in an adult relationship, right? 

I'm sorry for the length of this post but it's important to me to disclose all of the relevant facts. Like I said, we became even closer   and of course we ended up having a sexual relationship. She was incredibly shy at first, to say nothing about me, but I remember the first night we had sex so clearly and it was such a special night for both of us. By this point I couldn't believe that I had ever allowed myself to get so worked up over our situation. I can confidently say that she was and is the most beautiful woman I've ever met.

Which brings me, finally, to the point of my story. As I mentioned in the title of my post Charlotte and I broke up about three months ago. It was a mutual decision and not really relevant to the story so I won't go into it, but it has left me more confused than I've ever felt in my life. I've had a couple of casual encounters with some girls since the break up and *I have been completely unattracted to them*. Specifically, and it upsets me to admit it, what's between their legs. For the past two and a half years the girl that I have sex with had a penis, that has become the norm for me, and now it's such a huge (and unpleasant) change to come to terms with. Charlotte was against undergoing SRS so I think part of me never really expected to be with a woman with a vagina ever again.

I'm not sure what to do. Dating another transgender woman with a penis is an obvious solution, but I feel uncomfortable about doing that. Obviously it's not wrong to be with someone you are sexually attracted to but, and Charlotte has dealt with these people before and hated how they made her feel, making a woman feel fetishised is just creepy and downright wrong. I really don't know what to do.

Is it wrong for me to actively try to date transgender women?

**TL;DR I met a beautiful woman and began dating her. I eventually found out she was transgender and we stayed together for two and a half-ish years. Now I find myself completely unattracted to cisgender women. Is it wrong to exclusively date transgender women? What should I do?**"

MechaMaya,asktransgender,Classic chicken or egg problem,"So I've run into a dilemma about coming out that I'm sure many others have faced before.

However I can't seem to get a passing voice with the limited amount of practice I have, because I don't have the ability to use my voice on a regular basis, without going out and presenting female.

How did you solve this? Did you just say 'fuck it' and start presenting female without having even close to a passing voice? Did you take voice therapy lessons until you were confident enough? (I don't know if I have any voice therapy places local unfortunately) If you did go to voice therapy in person, did you go in boymode or girlmode, even if you weren't passing yet?

I'm probably way overthinking this but it's really giving me a hard time in progressing anything at all..."

1. The thought of being a biological FATHER is a turnoff.  Adoption, on the other hand, would give me the exact same bond as an adoptive cis woman.

2. I'm not even interested in kids, and if I must, I would adopt because kids need a home.

3.  I'm bisexual, but mainly attracted to men.  If I must use a surrogate mother anyway, what's the point?  

4.  It's expensive.

5. Stem cell research looks pretty promising.  

6. I have pretty crappy genes.  Cancers on both sides of the family, anxiety, autism, heart disease, obesity, etc, are prevalent in my bloodline.  

7.  Having to alter my habits and raise my sperm count before transitioning seems like too much.   So many of my natural habits ""lower sperm count"", even the way I sit.  

8. How is it even collected?  Forced masturbation?  

9. What happens if I move out of the country?

My mom really wants me to do it, though.  

What should I do?"
Emmas25,asktransgender,My FFS Experience - 50 yr old (with before &amp; after timeline images),"Hoping this'll be useful for some girls:

[CLICK HERE FOR BEFORE &amp; AFTER TIMELINE IMAGE](http://imgur.com/8zRioVI)

Cutting straight to the chase, I believe the improvement in how facially feminine I now look, is little short of a miracle. That’s not to believe I’m the best or sweetest looking transgirl around – (I wish!) – but taking into account my starting point (facially) and my age of 50 years, I’m *incredibly* pleased and relieved with how I now look (given it feels so much more in line with my sense of self and identity). My resulting post-FFS op look is most definitely beyond my prior expectations as to what was surgically possible – and I thank Dr Bart van de Ven in this respect, for both ‘seeing’ what could be potentially brought out in my face, and then surgically achieving those aims. 

I feel I received caring and individualised attention at all stages of the FFS process – from initial email/website contact; then my initial consultation; most importantly of course, during the week of my operation and lastly, at my post-op consultation. I must admit that for various past reasons, in general, I can sometimes feel a bit reticent about becoming involved with the medical profession. However, every contact with Dr Bart imparted a sense of professionalism, confidence and calmness. Because of these experiences, I found that I was able to place my trust in Dr Bart (and his team) as well as discuss with him (with the help of various images I’d selected), aspects of the FFS outcome which were important to me (feminine looks wise).

I found Antwerp an extremely pleasant and safe city – and one that was straightforward and easy to travel to. The clinic is nice and I was really glad to have booked a room with a bath – as I take to water like a duck! Plus, given I did feel more than a bit rough, post-op, being able to take warm baths really helped lift how I was feeling. Rather naively (at least in my case), I'd anticipated being out-and-about enjoying Antwerp after just one or two days!

I found Nurse Hajiba to be an ‘angel’ and was so glad of her support and care on the first morning post-op. I also feel very grateful to Elli (the clinic’s Patient Coordinator) for all the care and attention she showed me during my weeks stay. It meant a huge amount, knowing Elli was around and close at hand.

Maybe, because I had such a substantial amount of work done in one go, I did find recovery in the weeks after the operation tougher going than most report experiencing. However, in retrospect, the weeks passed by quickly, and I could tell that I was most definitely making consistent progress each week—and besides, the difficulties seemed more than balanced out by the FFS results I could already see. In large part, I think the issue was that I got knocked off-balance by the op, and thus the momentum of my daily routine, (of attending to other people and things outside myself) was interrupted to a very significant extent. This need to care for myself and recoup my energy was quite a surprise and I needed significantly more time than I had anticipated to re-build my momentum.

In terms of the overall post-FFS op follow-up process - some minor revisions were agreed at my post-op consultation (such as the re-lifting of my top lip, as this had dropped more than anticipated in the time since my operation). I feel really appreciative about this being agreed as a revision, because naturally, it means a lot to me to look as feminine as possible – plus, I believe, it reflects a commitment to high outcome standards by the clinic.

So bearing all the above in mind, if you’re considering FFS, I do feel I can definitely recommend 2Pass.

I've seen doctors use ""transwomen"" before, I've seen advocates and other trans people do it. But y'know, I see TERFs do it because it promotes segregation, ala the whole MtT bullshit they throw around.

Yes, let's include these people, because they're not a hate group and totally ok.

&gt;Are feminists going to allow MtT to define feminism? I'm so fed up with them and their Third Wave feminist enablers,

Ah arbitrary rules, identity invalidation, a false sexual dichotomy; the works. 

&gt;Women's suffering must remain more important than transgender suffering if the latter is to expect any sort of acknowledgement or respect ? How can you choose which issue is more worthy, whose pain is more worthy of attention.

How about the fact trans women are women and therefore there's a complete and utter lack of fucking nuance in what you're saying?

At first I found it strange since we don't have a womb and ovaries so I was really wondering why post-op it would be important to have a smear 3-yearly.

The source states that if penile inversion is used it is important because of the outside of the penis now being the inside of the vagina and because the outside of the penis could carry HPV ( Human Pappiloma Virus ) that the inside of the vagina could as well post-op.

DollyLexi,asktransgender,Spouse is against HRT; what are my options?,"Background: I told my wife about my gender dysphoria last year, she told me she knew, we are okay. We have always had a perfect relationship and since then, it has still been perfect. We never fight, we know each other more than anyone...we're very lucky to have found one another. 

Anyway, the one thing though that has stuck with me since that day though is when she said ""no hormones"", basically against me ever doing HRT. She thinks it's too risky health-wise (she's the kind of person who worries about EVERYTHING regarding health) and thinks it will jeopardize our goal of basically living as long as possible. I guess she always just assumes the worse when it comes to anything medical. I've alluded to the idea a couple of times since then but she is firm on her stance, despite my efforts.

Nowadays (and before we had our conversation last year), I cross dress to help alleviate my dysphoria when it ""flares up"". The only problem is that it doesn't help like I want it to. At the end of the day, it all has to come off and I go back to being a man. Also when I'm dressing, I sometimes end up feeling worse because even though I can try my best to hide my masculine features, it's impossible. Makes it feel futile, you know? When I end up feeling this way, I fall back into the mindset of wishing I could do HRT. At the end of the day, it's not the clothes that I want to wear, it's the body I want to have (and the current body I don't want to have).

I often fall into a depression over all of this because I go back to the fact that my wife is very anti-hormones whereas my mind tells me ""maybe one day she will come around"". I live day to day with the hope of telling myself ""one day"". I don't know if this is healthy for me mentally but what else can I do? I think it's also worth pointing out that she is against therapists because of her past negative experiences with them so she's not real adamant about me seeing one either (thinks it would be a waste of time and money). I'm not trying to sound disparaging towards my wife or anything - she's been much more supportive than I could have expected. I can tell she is a bit uncomfortable with me even cross dressing, so I try to put myself in her shoes and understand that she doesn't want to lose me as her masculine husband...she's even said this before herself so how could I blame her?

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I want to throw it out there that NO I am not going to leave my wife over this. We've been together all of our adult lives and intend on never separating. We very much love each other and just want to keep living. The problem is my dysphoria. What should I do? Meditation? Indefinite suppression of my feelings? (yeah, I know it sounds obvious to not do this but I've been managing it so far for a majority of my life)

Thanks for reading regardless - I think I mostly typed this out to just get it off my mind."

Heautontimoroumenos,asktransgender,Surgery regrets / not opting for surgery (despite dysphoria)?,"Has anyone here gotten surgeries (trans-related ones, especially FtM surgeries) and then regretted it? If yes, why? Was there any sort of ""red flag"" that you feel should have clued you in that it'd be the case earlier on, or was it completely unexpected?

Alternatively, has anyone here been on HRT, but opted not to have any surgery *despite* dysphoria? (basically not that you never felt that you needed surgery and had no issue with your body). Have you found better ways to deal with it, or was it due to weighting pros and cons? 



**To give some background as to why I'm asking:**

I am in the process of seeking access to surgery myself, which will take a while, as my country by law requires to get permission from a judge before going to any doctor to ask for trans surgeries. In the meanwhile I'm trying to do more self-reflection to determine as accurately as I can what I really need to do and what I don't.

I *personally* (enphasis on *personally*, is not meant to be a judgement) view transition as a last resort and a less than optimal option, so my preference would be to have as little done as possible. Currently I am almost sure I need to have top surgery, fairly sure I need to get rid of my ovaries, hesitant about hysterectomy, strongly hesitant towards bottom surgery.  

I'm seeking differing perspectives to confront myself and consider things, so I am reading things from trans people who were happy with things after surgery, but I think it'd also be useful to hear from trans people who were not that happy with it or even completely regretted it (am also seeking things from a detransitioning perspective, as mentioned in another thread, but am finding it to not be particularly helpful as those people seem to have had completely different experiences)."
Saturdalia,asktransgender,"How to cope with being ""trapped in the closet""?","Hi, so I recently came to terms with my questioning/trans (mtf) identity only in the past couple of months. Which is like really awesome of course! But the problem I have, now that it seems like there's ""no going back,"" is that I'm living in a situation where there's basically no coming out, or much experimenting, or seeing a professional about it. It's a long story. But being open about any of this would basically get me thrown out of my living situation and my job with not much else I can count on.

And, for now things are fine, but now that I've started to accept my real self (internally at least) it's gotten so much harder without some form of release. And I'm just not ready to come out privately to a friend because... I'm just not ready yet. And I don't know how they would respond. 

Anyway, I was originally okay with being out to myself, because the situation I'm in is only going to last until the end of next summer, then I will be much more independent, and I thought I could handle myself till then. But the stress is already starting to trouble me a lot, and I don't know anymore if keeping it in till then will work, but I don't really have much of a choice.

So I was wondering what people who have gone / are going through something like this do to deal with it? I'm just a little down right now about the future. "

darkangel2831,asktransgender,First time here... What exactly am I?...,"Hello, as you may have seen from the title this is infact my first time on this subreddit. So, a little bit about myself before I go on with what the whole reason of this post. First of all, I am currently a senior in highschool (17) and a male. For most of my life I have felt a bit of discomfort with my gender, but just kinda pushed it away so to speak. Well, recently I met with someone who (is male, but feels that they are a female), which kinda got me thinking about all of those times I just ignored the discomfort. 
Like I said before, I have felt for a large portion of my life a bit of discomfort with my gender, but now that I know this person, I kinda feel like a switch (for a lack of a better way of putting it) was flipped, where its all I can think about... Am I a male? Am I a female? I feel like I should be a girl, but at the same time, its not a 100% thing, there is some discomfort with feeling that I am either a boy or a girl... Im afraid that I do know that I am/was meant to be a girl, but that these 17 years of pushing away those feelings have made me hesitant to see them as what I truly want... I dont want to tell my parents, or others I know irl, as I dont want them to look at me differently, I dont want to bring this up to anyone irl incase I decide that I am going to stay as I am, or go with what I feel might be who I actually am.
I saw this subreddit and came here so I could ask these questions... 
What am I? What are some steps I can go through to see if this is for me? Are there any specific signs that I should look for?

I forgot how I did it so I rubbed my boobs and nips a lot and pinched my nips (this went on for about 10 minutes) before I remembered to squeeze my boobs. When I did this, however, blood came out. Now, it may be because I'm probably slightly dehydrated (I only pee one or two times a day on spiro, so if that means I'm dehydrated then I am haha). However, I still wanna clear this up.

Katie_Deely,asktransgender,How to: waiting ???,"Hi there people :D

As always, some background first. I'm 17 years old, currently in my last year of school, mtf, and pre-everything. I'm a German citizen, but I live in Austria.

Austria happens to have a pretty horrible system for transitioning. With those 3 psychological/psychiatric statements it's already worse enough, but the insurances don't pay anything except for HRT and SRS. On top of all, if I want my name changed, I'd have to get the Austrian citizenship first, which costs a lot of money. If that wasn't enough already, I'm not 18, which means that I'm forced to go to a children's doctor and get even more diagnoses and even more gate-keeping. All in all that would most likely cost me up to 6000€ and take me 8 to 10 years... No thanks.

So I came to the conclusion that it would be a LOT easier, faster and cheaper to take advantage of my citizenship. In Germany more stuff is paid, there's fewer gate-keeping, I have to pay less, and Germany is a lot more liberal than Austria. In worst case I'd have to spend a few hundred € and I could do it in 3 to 5 years.

The problem: I have to finish school first. That'll happen in June 2017, so it's not really an eternity. It's still a challenge, though.

There's sadly no way I can go girl-mode, not even in private. There's also no opportunity for make-up. Not even hidden female clothes are a possibility on most days.

How should I use those months, and how should I deal with delaying being myself for another 9 months?

Thanks!"

konrankonran,asktransgender,"For people who divorced to transition, how did you rebuild your life to be happy?","After you divorced with your husband/wife (or separated from your children), now you're alone. You're well past the age of the younger years where everyone's looking for their other halves and very outgoing (knowing friends, developing hobbies, joining clubs), and that most people are now siloing in their family life.

I am trying very hard, but the outlook is not positive at all, and I don't know how long and when could things blow up. Or, then I would conclude the path to transition is a wrong decision. As some may know, transition does not solve problems alone, it introduces new problems of a new category. So...

Doisoundtransorcrazy,asktransgender,Do i sound like a transgender woman or just a gay cisgender man who thinks he's a transgender woman?," I am questioning whether or not I'm a transgender woman and HRT is getting closer. I've seen a therapist and I am getting so scared that if I start HRT I'll regret it and make a mistake because I'm not really a transgender woman. I'm just a crazy gay cisgender man who thinks he is a transgender woman. 

I've been coming on hear for YEARS creating throwaway account after throwaway account asking question after question and I can't seem to shift anything. Am I transgender? Am I not transgender? I don't know! 

I'm scared go and see my gender therapist and tell them these things because I don't want them to say things like, maybe you should not start HRT, maybe you should think about this more, and other thoughts like that. 

I keep getting the same thoughts, they are, what if I'm not a transgender woman, what if I'm just a gay cisgender man (I did come out as a gay cisgender man and I never questioned this), what if I just have multiple personality disorder (I took an online test for this before I wrote this post), what if I've just tricked myself into thinking this, etc.


Some of my family members were not supportive when I came out. These particular family members said to me I need to be put in a, straight jacket, I'm mentally ill, they said I'll regret this, they said I'll never be a 'real woman', they said they I decided to be transgender and things like that. These particular family members would tell me this EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY SAW ME!

I got bullied ALOT growing up, maybe that's brought this on? I was always very feminine growing up and things like that and that's why I got so bullied. I often think about things such as what I want my body to look like too. I think I might have OCD too as I seem to get intrusive thoughts about other people. For example and i am not proud of saying this I was watching a Laverne Cox interview and she said something nice about Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne said ""support my delusion"" and then this thought came into my mind which was 'we already do support your delusion because your transgender'. I feel terrible saying this and I hope I don't offend anyone.

I've often thought maybe it's OCD that is bringing on these 'transgender feelings' if that's what they really are.

I don't like acknowledging that name or saying it... AT ALL. So, I mentioned it to the admin at the desk so that hopefully this won't happen again.

jeffa_jaffa,asktransgender,Coming Out Advice,"I am a cis pansexual male, and my partner of nine years is trans. I have never had a problem with this; it was her laughter, her smile, her kind loving nature that I fell in love with, not any part of her anatomy. We've been comfortably getting along for years now, and her being trans has never caused any issues. She slowly started to come out as trans to a few of my close friends from Uni, as well as my parents, and everyone has been accepting. 

Recently, after the sudden death of a family member, she has had a new outlook on life. She has realised that life is too short to hide who she is. She has become proud to be trans, and is no longer trying to hide it, or pretend that it's not a big part of who she is. To this end, a few weeks ago she posted a massive “coming out” post  on Facebook, to universal acceptance. Her reasoning was that anyone who knew her already would know the kind, loving woman that I fell in love with, and anyone who could not accept it would likely be someone she would not want to associate with in the first place. I thought it was all going well, until she asked me if I could explain things to my sister.

My sister is nineteen, and is autistic. She has no idea that my partner is trans, and she has loved my partner from the day they first met. Due perhaps, to her new outlook on life, my partner feels that it is only right that my sister be told about her being trans. I offered to take my sister out for the day, and to explain some of the more complicated aspects of the birds and the bees with her. As an aside, I would in no way be surprised if my sister was anything other than cis and hetro, but I'm not sure that, due to her autism, she has the skills to work this out for herself, let alone explain her feelings to anyone else. I was hoping that knowing that someone she loves dearly is not only trans but also bi might help her to work out her own gender identity and sexuality. 

The only sticking point in all of this is my mother. She loves my partner, and almost fainted with joy when I told her we were engaged (although eight years later and we're still no closer to tying the knot). Obviously I don't know what's going on in my mum's head, but she's never shown any sign of having any issue with my partner. Despite this, she's just phoned me up, in tears, pleading with me not to tell my sister, for fear that, due to her autism and lack of social skills, she may blurt it out to the wrong person. From what I could gather, she is worried about what the neighbours might think.

I told her that I don't give a damn what the neighbours may think, it's none of their damn business. Similarly, if there are any members of my extended family who suddenly find that  they don't like my partner, then, as painful as it is to cut someone out, I would not hesitate to do so. My mum's other argument is that why, after all these years of people accepting my partner as a woman, would we want to risk upsetting anyone. She said that they were born in another time, when this sort of thing was just not talked about. I said that the world has changed, and if you try to hide what is right and good and just from people, just to save them from being uncomfortable, then you are going to end up with a world were nothing changes, and there is only hetro-normative cis relationships, for those who want them, and a lot of people who are being forced to hide who they are, and who they love, for the sake of not making people uncomfortable. 

If we want change, if we want to be on the right side of history then we need to do things that might make people uncomfortable.

So now I don't know what do to. Do I do right by my partner, and tell my sister, and risk upsetting my mother? Or do I not tell my sister, keeping my mother happy? Mother is right, in a way, nothing will change if I don't tell my sister, but at the same time, I want my sister to know that there are all sorts of people in the world, and that no one should have to hide who they are or who they love. 


Sorry it's turned into a bit of an essay, but I needed to get it out of my system, and I really don't know what to do. 

TLDR: My partner wants me to tell my sister that she is trans, my mother does not want me to say anything. What should I do? 

EDIT
Update,  my dad just came around to talk to me and my partner.  Between us we decided that if everyone else knows,  it's only fair that my sister knows as well.  We've decided to tell her,  but not tell mum that we've told her.  Eventually,  after a few months of nothing going wrong and the world not ending,  we'll tell mum that we told my sister.  Hopefully it will all work out in the end.  Thanks for all the kind words :) "

I have donned short cropped hair and men's/androgynous clothing except for special occasions when I feel like I am playing dress up with myself. The bad kind of paperdolls. I used to love dressing up in something tight and revealing to flirt with men. Though I think that was just something I did to get confidence. I would love to have a penis, but I like my chest, I think it's pretty. I never wear a cleavage or anything I just like the look of them and I like having them touched. The truth is I don't know anymore. What gender am I? Does it matter? Is there anything that can make me happier? I don't know anymore. You can only read so many psychology and medical papers about gender disphoria and transgender issues. But most of them are on treatment and surgery. I want to know what it feels like. How do you know it's time to change to another sex? I have like 3 female friends and 20 male friends and the friends I am close with are guise and they all tell me I am more like a man than a woman. The three women I hang out with are other women who don't have female friends. You know the kind of girl who hangs only with guise and play the ""cute girl gamer"" to flirt with them all and jealousy&amp;DOOM erupts once another female joins the fray? I am not one of them. I don't mind females, I keep female friends just the ""no-bullshit"" kind. The only kind of female I can't stand are women who don't value themselves and sell themselves to the lowest bidder. I am just so self-absorbed right now. Am I female? Or am I male? I enjoy both traditional female and male hobbies. But so does my father... What would my name be? How do I find the answer to the questions I ask? And more importantly what questions should I ask?
Ask me anything you like and I'll try to answer.

I truly am not making this up. It happens when I go sedentary as if my body says that it is time to make changes since I am not expending energy elsewhere.

Im not really sure, but I think thats the person who gets you on HRT.

How can I freak out the psychologist apart from saying that I felt like a girl at earlier age and was thinking abiut this for longer periods of time, and deppressed me, and bla bla bla?

Really want to start HRT as soon as possible, since I still look quite feminine and body hair is very low. My hair is also really big.

DarkLeach7,asktransgender,"For the women out there that take progesterone, could I get some advice on what changes I should expect physically and mentally?","When I went to my doctor last Monday he asked if I wanted to try starting progesterone and I said yes. There's not all that much information out there regarding progesterone other than ""it's not proven that it has much benefit to a HRT regimen for trans women"" and that what we do know about it is only due to trans women taking it and talking about what effects it has. I also read that progesterone has not been studied all that much in regards to how it affects trans women.

I did read up as much about it as I could when I learned about MTF HRT in general a while ago but most of what I know is just from the Wikipedia article on  MTF HRT. It says general things like breast development, weight distribution, changes in mood, etc. I really couldn't find much else and I figured it would just be better to ask trans women that do take it.

So to my question: What are some things I can expect to happen now that I am taking progesterone? Things to expect that I haven't really been able to find all that much out about because there isn't a lot of information on it. Unless I'm just not looking in the right places and it that case please let me know.

FadingObfuscation,asktransgender,"Getting Ready for a Showdown with the Army... and Holding it Together, Barely.","So, long story short, the new Department of Defense guidance for allowing transgender people to serve openly does a very poor job of accounting for the needs of transgender service members, and this plus dysphoria plus non-transition related woes had me crying on the floor in the kitchen last night.


Long story long... As you may or may not know, I am one of the above mentioned transgender service members. I've been out to my unit for a year and few months. It has been a complicated road so far, but up to this point I had managed to at least be treated as my correct gender (female) for daily life and work, living full time as myself, taking hormones, adjusting my appearance to be within female standards instead of male, you know, good stuff.


*However,* I've been informed that, per DoD guidance, I will be required to conform to male policy in all aspects until my gender marker is changed on a particular essential record. That record, in turn, will only be changed when a military medical professional has reviewed my situation and considers my transition ""complete"". I am sure at this point my challenge is becoming clear but allow me to illustrate.


I am legally female. I have been trying to get my record changed since I obtained legal status in my gender! (March).


* Hurdle number one: This is new and nobody knows how to or wants to handle this. Even routine things often get lost or shuffled aside. Gender marker?? It screams, ""I'll do it later"" to anyone without a vested interest, which is everyone but me.


* Hurdle number two: Discrimination. Take the above and throw in a dash of ""icky trans woman"". My reputation as a quality soldier means little when I am naught but paperwork. Impetus for ""oops, where did it go?"" increases.


* Hurdle number three: The new guidelines. That completely awful ""transition complete"" verbiage is annihilating me. My leaders are supportive in a ""we won't rock the boat for you but as long gray areas exist, operate within them"" kind of way. Thanks to the new vocabulary and the 01 October start date, I have a super small window to change my record before I'll likely need surgery to do so, surgery I am still years from having. I have been transitioning for a little over one year. There exists other wording which makes me feel like a commander has the authority to make exceptions, but my leadership appears so far unwilling, even while I have the backing of the other women in my unit.



Cue immense anxiety. The thought of being forced back into the charade of male while on duty AT ALL, but especially now that everyone knows I'm trans, I am *legally female*,  and I know what the relief of living freely feels like, is horrendous. Just my hair alone would be a significant blow and damaging to my safety here in this conservative state, plus conducting hygiene and being housed with the males, plus being evaluated on male standards of physical fitness, (I'll get by, but scores effect promotion and I have seen a very real decrease to my run times), plus losing my legitimacy in the eyes of new soldiers to the unit for who knows how long, (SGT Fading the *guy* who is trying to become a woman :( instead of like now where soldiers returning from deployment didn't recognize me!).


Basically, it's such a terrible prospect that I am prepared to face the uniform code of military justice before I subject myself to that. They may suggest placing me in an inactive status, but that is unacceptable to me, I am fully capable of serving. I have been just fine. By some miracle, when 01 October rolls around the Army's specific policy could be more trans friendly, but I doubt it.


So now I am seeking alternatives, I love being in the military, but I will not allow it to be at the expense of myself. How I can possibly uphold the Army values of integrity or personal courage if I don't take a stand when the system tries to wait me out or force me to be what I am not? This week, I am doing everything in my power to speak to at least one law firm. I am also reaching out to advocacy groups, and if getting the media involved can help, then I want that too.


But gods, is this hard on me. I have been struggling recently as I grapple with hormones being slow to act on my physical shape. My breasts exist enough to call them breasts and for me to stand out as apart from males, but not by much. My face shape is changing, but I am facing the realities of my bone structure there. My wide chest, my hips, my... lack of hips, and what's between them are very painful for me right now, topped only by discomfort with my voice which as an often talkative person by nature is brings-me-to-tears difficult. It is no help that I live in a place with little to no knowledgeable medical care at my disposal.


The non directly transition related situations I won't get into, but know that they are having a negative impact on my well being after moving on from them.


I feel terrible often, and the breakdown incident I mentioned above is not the first. I collapse, but I get up and keep going. I have to hold it together, first because I can't let this affect my ability to do my job or to serve, but even more because right now I feel like I am my only true advocate. My support can't or won't go with me at this stage, and I don't begrudge them for it, I love that they have given what they can, it's all I can ask. I know if it does come to a legal battle, I will have allies standing with me.


If you have made it through my clunky sentences and stress, thank you. I guess really what I am trying to say when you get down to it is... I am determined, but I hurt, and I am tired. Why can't I just be me?"
Lawful_Cupcake,asktransgender,Crazy stress rant from being trapped in a house with my parents,"Ok, I get that my parents want me to keep my room clean. I'm doing my best. I throw away stuff as I can. I'm trying to stay sane here, and it's no picnic for me either. There's a reaaaaaaaaly simple solution to this: let me use the guest room. I get that I'm here and they don't want me here either, but for real, why not give me a room upstairs where no one has to see my organized chaos, where no one has to barge in for any number of reasons, and completely invade my tiny modicum of privacy. When I found out that I was being forced back in with my parents, I immediately started smoking again. Them dogging me constantly for whatever reason, my mother talking about two kids in college bonking and how wrong that id, my dad getting pissed because he has a complex that everything needs to be in its space. Them not buying food AT ALL, even when I asked, hey, could you get some non meat based things so that I can eat in instead of having to go out to taco bell every god damned night, or literally subsist on bread and water. Anything that I want to do is half impossible because this Internet connection is from the stone ages. Mother lecturing me on how I need to not smoke because it's expensive, blah blah blah. DUDE, stop stressing me the fuck out constantly and live and let live. I'm not hurting anyone. Stop insinuating that anyone who has premarital sex is not a good person. Don't even get me started on how I was here for my birthday, and they didn't throw me a party, like they did for my brother this week. I'd appreciate NOT being treated like a bed bug: an irritating infestation that you don't want in the house. I'd appreciate conversation with somebody who doesn't look at me like I'm a creep or a pervert or a lazy bitch who just doesn't WANT to work. They wonder why I'm hostile to them when they refuse to give me any ounce of respect, and have absolutely zero intentions of trying to work on the shitty relationship we have, even after I've tried countless times to talk to them about things. I'd love my parents to treat me like I'm a person. I'd love my dad to treat me like my sister, like I'm his daughter. I'd love to have my mom look at me without sighing. I'd love to have an actual family that cares about me, my thoughts, my emotions, my aspirations. It sounds so stupid, but I hate that my mom just gives me money to do stuff, and doesn't try to talk to me. I'd love to feel like I'm their daughter who is strong and proud in her own right, instead of like I'm just their failed son, who's just a crossdressing weirdo. I'd love them to embrace me in all of my differences and be proud that I've made myself my own person instead of just following the path that was set out for me step by step. I want to have a FAMILY. Not a group of people who make small talk about nothing and never talk about anything REAL. I want a family who will have actual discussions about things, instead of mom and dad just constantly being like ""Well, you're just going to yell."" Yeah, I'm gonna yell. I'm frustrated as fuck because I have so much to give, and they refuse on delivery because the me that I have to give isn't what they want."

BeccaTheBaka,asktransgender,"Need help talking to another MtF on a server we both play on, their attitude is very self-entitled...","Brief title edit: Need help talking to a fellow MtF, won't stop disrupting server activity and blames it on us

I play on a Minecraft server that is open to the public (name shall not be disclosed). Anyways, there are two known MtF transitioners on the server, one of which is me. The other of which started out really cool and was a genuinely great person.

Before I continue to describe things, let me just say that they are a Demigirl, so I'm not sure if they are considered MtF or not or what pronouns to use, so sorry in advance and I'll just be sticking to the safe ""they / their / them"". I'll be using a different name, ""Jill"", for the sake of anonymity.

Anyways, back to the story.

Before Jill came out as being MtF, they were already assumed to be Female by the rest of the server (using a female name, typing in a generally ""girlish"" manner). Jill then came out about a year ago, stating that they were AMAB and were actually taking hormones for about a month or so prior to coming out. The rest of the server received the news quite well, and adjusted to proper pronoun usage.

We used to have good, long text conversations in PMs between eachother (I was yet to come out at this point myself), but that changed gradually over the course of a few months. We were no longer having long conversations that we both enjoyed, I usually ended up offending them without intent (and I'm VERY cautious when it comes to not offending the LGBT community). 

We shared a lot of interests, but as time went on they stopped talking about their interests / didn't contribute to conversations that much. Instead, whenever they were online, all they would talk about was transitioning, hormones, general trans stuff, and things pertaining to them. Everyone was ok with it at first, but eventually they got really fed up with things. It's also a PG-ish oriented server, and they wouldn't stop talking about sex, boobs, penises, vaginas, balls... anything remotely sexual.

Whenever people try to tell them that they are uncomfortable (or unwilling) talking about sex / lgbt issues, they would then respond that they don't give a rat's ass what you think and that you are oppressing them. 

Even though talking about sex (and being disrespectful to others, for that matter) are both against the rules of the server, they would rather ""spend the rest of their time on the server preaching their life story, only to be banned in the end, rather than be silenced and oppressed"". (Paraphrased).

The rest of staff (I have good communication with staff, being ex-staff myself) are really annoyed with them and have gotten very close to banning or muting them. The only thing holding Jill back from getting banned is that she was one of the lead builders on the server since it's starting date.

The bottom line is I need to act really fast to make sure no action is taken against them, and to ask them to stop leaving a negative impact on the server every time they join. I don't know what to say or how to phrase it to them, and I'd need help with that. What should I say to them?

On a side note, I feel as if I come out to the server (as I'm still not technically out to anyone on there besides a close few), people will begin to act harshly towards me through no fault of my own as if I would end up exactly like Jill did.

Edit: sorry if I was unclear, it's 5 AM and this has been keeping me up for a while :c"
steampoweredsquirrel,asktransgender,"I'm beginning to wonder if I'm demigender, help?","Hi all, I'm starting to question my gender identity. I was born female but never really identified with typical feminine things growing up, and felt strange and uncomfortable when my breasts in particular started developing. Just wondering, was this discomfort a natural part of puberty, or the first sign of dysphoria? Beginning to feel I may not be as female as I thought. Advice?? "
AshaWolf,asktransgender,Comfortable versus Happy...,"So then, I've been twirling around the inside of my head over this for a while now. I came out to myself not so long ago, about 6 months and the sneaky-concrete-dam-of-suppression sprung its leak and things have started happening. Feeling a bit more (finally) and making better connections with people I care about. Been spending faaaaar too much moolah on new clothes and hair (shaved head prior to realising...derp) and have had some really great nights/days out where before I was much more of home-bird, games, reading, netflix, and the like so I'm pretty happy with that etc.

Recently I started realising that I'm not totally comfortable with going completely femme (I woke up with false nails on after a sober night and thought ""nahh, that doesn't feel right today"" etc), which is fine. I always thought I'd be more of a tomboy anyway. However, my boy mode has decreased its incessant attempts to accentuate masculinity so I've become more comfortable with myself as a guy too.

Eventually, I got to the point where I thought I was more *comfortable* as a guy, but **happier** as a girl...

Probably more comfortable as a guy because frankly, I don't pass well, especially during the day (which is also why I go all out femme to mitigate this issue) so when I'm dressed as myself I'm constantly paranoid about being read etc.

So I'm not sure where to go from here. Reduce the femme and go tomboy but increase anxiety going out until HRT kicks in good 'n' proper or go with boy mode and hope dysphoria doesn't increase (very mild dysphoria when in boy mode tbh, although things have started getting worse. I can no longer feel comfortable laying in bed naked without covering *it* up, just can't stand seeing the thing which wasn't really a problem several months ago).

Was this even a question? I dunno, I just haven't been able to make any headway with this in counselling so I thought I'd at least get it off my chest. Ta for reading sugar-lumps!

**TL;DR** - More comfortable as a boy, happier as a girl. Prefer tomboy looks but don't pass unless full femme styled. Thoughts?"

For context, I am MTF, pre everything and anything, 19 and live in Australia.

1) What should I say if asked my reason for making an appointment (most likely by a desk assistent and not the actual doctor)? This will be the first time I take myself to a GP or anywhere like that so I don't really know the procedure.

2) What do I actually say to the doctor? I don't have any idea whether it is or isn't an accempting GP but I am pre-pared for if it isn't so that doesn't worry me. But like what do I actually say? I feel like if I don't know what to say I will end up being all like ""I need to do the trans thing"" and I really don't want to say that.

3) As I have a few other matters to bring up, should I bring those up first or afterwards? They are a mix bag of mental and physical things. Or maybe should I make a sepperate visit for those? The anxiety and the other mental health issues I am having all somewhat crossover so maybe they will come up anyways but I doubt the physical issues will as they are completely unrelated.

throwaway040896,asktransgender,So I told my mom and guess what? It was awful.,"Yesterday, for the second night in a row I couldn't sleep thinking about my current situation and I was starting to get really overwhelmed by anxiety. I just recently came out to myself as trans, and I'm starting to figure out how things should unfold in order to get closer to making this real and not just in my head. But yesterday emotions took the best of me and I made a mistake. So I told my mom about how I was confused about my gender identity and that I could benefit from seeing a gender therapist (I don't  know if there is such a thing in my country but whatever). Well, she completely freaked out and started downright shaming me, telling me how I would be a joke in the eyes of society should I transition and gosh, she would even freak out at the possibility I liked guys lol. She kept on rambling for a good chunk of time about how I would never get a job other than prostitution (lmao), I guess being on my last year of major does not count at all. She then proceeded to put on her own show and became hysterical, a thing she tends to do often so that she can draw all the focus to herself when something she considers unacceptable happens. Still, it felt very invalidating. I can't even show how much I hate her for this and have to now pretend I'm just paranoid in order to avoid another show of hers and making more people know about this while it's not under my control. I cried myself to sleep basically and now this morning I found out she phoned a psychiatrist in order to make an appointment to prescribe me antidepressants. Like, what? Anyway, this is all my fault, I should have known she is mental. Almost all my family is, they're terribly dysfunctional. I won't be able to do anything until I burn all bridges with them, which will take potentially years and make my transition less likely to succeed. I don't know what to do or how to feel anymore.

TLDR: Told my mom about gender identity doubts and dysphoria and shamed me because of her close-mindedness. My whole family is like this. I feel like I'll have no support ever. "

Any advice appreciated!"
Mushi_Iroh,asktransgender,They want me to go to therapy before starting HRT. Should I?,"In my country (Belgium) there are typically 2 approaches: the official way and the find-your-own-way way.

The official way is going to a so called ""gender team"" where there is a group of psychologists, psychiatrists, endocrinologists and surgeons working together. Their approach is to start with a psychodiagnostic period of 9 to 12 months with a psychologist before they'll allow you to start HRT. They'll typically want you to start your social transition beforehand and want to make sure you can handle it and that you have people to support you. In those 12 months there are also 2 visits to a psychiatrist. Legally you'll need his approval before you can go to an endocrinologist.

The second approach involves finding a psychiatrist who's willing to give you a referral (in my case after 3 sessions spread over a few weeks). Typically no ""team"" is involved and you'll have to find your own endocrinologist and your own SRS surgeon (if you want that).

So in my case my family and friends support me, I am 100% sure I want to do this and I have starting my transition (voice training, went out, talked to other trans women, makeup practice, new clothes, hair removal, and so on) but for the time being I keep living as male. Anyway, I find those 12 months of therapy rediculous so I skipped option 1 and found my own psychiatrist (tomorrow is session 2 out of 3). I also wanted to find a therapist who'll function as a personal coach to help me get from A to B (or M to F in my case) but almost all of them are pushing me towards waiting because ""maybe I'll do something rash"" and ""regret my decision"".

I'm lucky I don't **have** to wait if I don't want to but I realize there are risks and I want be informed as best I can so I'd like to hear from you:

* **1. Do you think therapy is necessary before starting HRT?** Why (not)?
* **2. When is a good time to start HRT?** In other words: what other things should you have done before considering hormones?
* **3. Is 9-12 months of therapy justified?** Why (not)?
* **4. Did you go to therapy before starting HRT?** For how long and why?

TL;DR: Months of therapy before HRT ... what's your opinion?"

I have no previous health concerns or issues and all my blood work so far checks out normal including potassium levels after one week of Spiro. 

I've been reading other posts and most people seem to start E faster or right away and Spiro dose is generally much higher, so I'm a bit concerned that I could be going a bit faster..."
Mellowbelle,asktransgender,"Theory: When people say they feel like they're in the wrong body, they don't mean it literally. Instead they mean that they wish their body was different.","I see a lot of people saying things like ""I never felt like I was in the wrong body. My body is mine. I wouldn't want someone else's body"". I think that people are missing the point of the ""wrong body"" narrative. I don't think that those who feel like they're in the wrong body are saying that they're literally in a body that is not their own. I think that they're saying that they don't want to have the body that they have because of the the sexual characteristics that accomapany that body.

i'm an early hrt transsexual who just started 1mg/day finasteride for a (not terribly) receded hairline.  Is the strategy to take it until hair resumes growth, and then spiro and then rest will prevent it from leaving again, or you keep taking forever, or what?"
throwaway2309570,asktransgender,Is it normal to have doubts?,"Sometimes I think, maybe I am just deceiving myself, maybe I think I am trans because I have the wrong idea about what it means?

Maybe I think that if I were a girl I would have friends because people would talk to me and I would talk to people (bc I would hate myself less)? Maybe I just want to be a girl because if I were a girl I wouldn't be ashamed of liking the things that I like?

Also sometimes I feel almost physically ill bc I'm not a girl and other times I don't really feel anything is that normal? When I read about how genetics/bone structure and starting before age 18 are the most important things I get sad bc then I am afraid I won't pass, is that bad of me?"
gaia1852,asktransgender,Coming out to parents this week,"So, I am going to be starting HRT in October some time circumstances willing, so I am faced with the last big hurdle in the way to my transition and happiness.

Telling my parents.

I've already told all my close friends, I've come out online pretty much 100%, I've been talking to a therapist, and I have my referral letter in my hand, so I am pretty commited already.

They are pretty liberal and cool, but this is going to still be a big step. I am lucky in that I am independent, I only really rely on my dad for health insurance, and that's only because he offered to cover me til I am 27. They will probably be accepting, or at least tolerant, but I am still really scared to tell them.

Anyone else here come out to their parents shortly after they moved out? Any tips on how I might start that conversation with them?"

Older_Wiser2,asktransgender,MtF: Lesson Learned: TELL YOUR PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR!!!!,"So last September I decided to go the DIY route - I had asked my primary care doctor a couple months earlier whether or not she prescribed estrogen for male patients and I got a ""no"" fairly quickly. But - I had a reason beyond wanting to begin a HRT regime so I did not tell her the *real* reason. After that and after joining this forum I went DIY. 

I have an endocrinologist appointment next Tuesday and there's no way now to hide it from her as they require my doctor being on board as I'm on a number of other medications and have a number of other medical issues. I had an appointment my primary care doc and so I sucked up all my courage and told her.... He response was unbelievable - she gave me the biggest hug - said she already suspected I was - and said if I'd told her the truth when I first asked she would have been happy to prescribe HRT for my transition.  WHO KNEW?????

**LESSON LEARNED**: Don't underestimate your doctors - be honest - be open - and you'll find they're very understanding and accommodating - particularly in today's more enlightened environment ....   ~Joelle"
throwaway18912892,asktransgender,Question about facial hair(Plus 2 little rants),"First the rant: I'm 15 and in the uk, It has been about a year and a half since I first came out and my mother took to me to the doctor(When I was 13). I'm annoyed because of how much I've just been ""passed along"", the waiting wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't pretty much gone through the whole of puberty since then - It's horrible seeing yourself change like that in the worst way every single day

Rant two: I was made to sit with the boys in my school picture today which I wouldn't mind, but I'm fully out to them, I asked the teacher if I could at least sit out but she said ""Just do it, it doesn't matter"" :/

Anyway - I'm curious about what will happen to my facial hair on puberty blockers(I doubt they would do much now anyway, but I need to or I can't get HRT) or HRT(When I can get it at 17).
 
I don't have typical facial hair because it hasn't grown out yet; I only have a tiny bit in a muchtache type shape, it takes a few months to grow out after shaving, and it's maximum length is about 3-4m

I don't know how HRT or puberty blockers would react to this?

PS. would puberty blockers even help at this point?"
Faldoras,asktransgender,I don't know how to tell my parents about my chosen name.,"yeah, so let's get right into it. I came out to them about 4 months ago or something, and they were cool about it. They weren't stoked or anything, but then again, neither am I. I told them (and my friends and my gf) to please refer to me as she/her and such, but I won't get angry if you make a mistake or two.  
So far, my gf has been consistent pretty much from the get-go, so that's cool, I have only seen my friends like 3 times the past 4 months, and they had to be reminded, but they picked up quickly after that.  
My parents though, they consistently misgender me, using the dutch (well, limburgish) equivalent of ""boy"" (""jong"")  pretty much all the time. I truly believe this is not intentional, sometimes they catch themselves after and they apologise profusely.   
In comes this one day where I have a bit of an emotional breakdown, as you do. I tell them that I'm just having a really rough time n shit, when my mom says ""well I won't call you 'she' because you aren't a 'she' yet. I will use just use your first name to avoid using pronouns."" My gf has said that this is better than nothing and to just get used to it for now.  

Since then I've settled on a new name, as you can see in my flair. So far I've only worked up the courage to tell my gf and again she picked it up instantly, referring to me only as Zoey in private conversations and in her diary (she really is the best.)  

I think you can see the predicament I'm in by now. How will I tell my parents about my new name if they won't even use the correct pronouns? They really are decent about me being trans in every way but this. What do I do?"

I look into the mirror and I just look like a korean boy aged 17-18 I don't look androgynous in anyway. The hairs on my arms and legs are driving me crazy, and having to constantly shave everyday (facial hair) exacerbates that.

Hanna529,asktransgender,I can't stop reading gc and it's making me suicidal,"I know that gc is a hate sub, but for some reason I can't stop reading it.  I've always been a good person to people in all aspects of my life, and the idea that someone hates me and finds me disgusting without even knowing who I am makes me curious about why they think these things, in a masochistic way.

But I just can't figure it out.  I've tried to understand where they're coming from, but in the end it seems to just stem from an irrational hatred of men while using the most extreme bizarre cases of shitty trans people to justify their hate.

That's not the only sub I can't help but read.  I also can't help myself but read through pages and pages of comments on trans stuff in AskReddit threads.  As I read more and more ""mentally ill"", ""delusional"" blah blah blah comments, despite how awful about myself it makes me feel, I just keep scrolling, just keep reading.

The daily intake of hate is fucking with me pretty badly.  When I talk to my friends, despite the fact that they are super supportive, I have a paranoia that they are only humoring me and secretly find me to be disgusting and a freak.  Reading this shit on a daily basis for such a long time has given me issues with self-esteem, anxiety, and paranoia.

Does anyone else do this to themselves?  If you did, do you still do it, or did you force yourself to stop?

EDIT: I just want to say to anyone who is concerned that I will be fine.  I'm just really down right now."

zxcv_throwaway,asktransgender,I'm scared that I'm transgender. Please help.,"Hi everyone. I'm 21 and male and in the last few years I realized I am gay. However in only the last year I've felt kind of disturbed. I have this unreal attraction to many straight guys and it's so bad that it's almost physically painful. Even if I had sex with an equally attractive gay guy I think there would still be something missing. I've never dressed like a girl or even thought that I'd want to, and I'm completely ok being called a man, getting erections, and doing ""manly things"". I'm a little effeminate but I still don't want to be called a ""woman"". The problem is that I have these painful fantasies where I imagine that I have a female body and I'm having sex with a male partner. Something about it drives me crazy and it causes me a lot of distress, almost as much as when I see really cute or hot straight guy. Being a gay male now, I enjoy having sex with other gay males (as a bottom), but I think it pales in comparison to my fantasies I described. 

I'm a total loss to figure this out and I'm absolutely not ok with talking to a therapist about it. I appreciate any help. "
Complacentrabbit,asktransgender,"Hey, me too!","I have been doing some searching for a while and I was glad to see this post. You all may never see this and that's okay, I have very similar feelings as the original poster does. I have been curious about crossdressing since I was about 14, did it quite a bit until I was almost busted by my sister. It was her clothes I was borrowing with out her knowledge at the time btw. At that point I felt embarrassed and scared that someone may find out so I hid my feeling for years. Problem is though, they resurfaced with a vengeance. I was more determined to crossdress, and I got aroused by it. So naturally I assumed that the two went hand in hand and I felt ashamed and stopped again. This was when I was about 20. Now at 33 years old, married with 3 children, and a wife who supports my quest for answers, I am still confused about where I stand too. I have often felt that it's a sexual fetish, but I don't mind dressing up and watching tv. I think I could be trans, but like you, I am quite scared of everything after accepting that that is what I am. If I am, well at least I know and I can make a decision. Except, then what if I get beat up because of it, will my family disown me, and what about my wife and kids? A million questions and almost zero answers. I went briefly to a therapist and stopped because I didn't have the money to go anymore. My other problem is that I feel I look too much like a guy in a dress. Like you, I want to be as close to a genetic girl (GG) as possible in appearance, and my voice. It's been almost a year that I saw a post on your thread, and I hope you don't think I have hijacked it. I wanted to share with you from someone else, that you aren't alone in your thoughts and feelings in this matter. I am about the same place as you were at the time of this posting, and am probably ruled by my fear to step out further and discover who I truly am. One day, the two of us will have our answers. Good luck to you in the future and I hope you find your happiness in whatever you discover."

pastelmemedream,asktransgender,"Hey, so I've been pondering... (ftm)","Ok, so for maybe about at least six months, I've been questioning about how I want to present myself. Thing is, I don't remember if I've ever been uncomfortable with myself before hand and I worry that 'oh god, i'm just lying to myself' or something like that. I've tried to transition to a few people, but I kept retreating back because I kept thinking ""what if i'm not? what if this is wrong? what if I change my mind?"", then I'd get a nagging ache, and I'd revert back to my birth gender. I worry that I'm not and that I'm just denying that I'm female cause I'm okay with my body and I like a lot of ""feminine"" things and have since I was little. But I also like seeming masculine at times and I tend to want to look like a passing guy when I cosplay as male characters. But then I worry that maybe this whole idea of me thinking ""maybe i'm a dude"" is just some weird hormone stuff going on. Anyone know what's going on?"
fullofsadandpanic,asktransgender,How do I confront my fear and panic and make a decision?,"This is hard to type, forcing myself to not just hide in bed honestly, but if I don't force this out, I don't think I'll ever get help.

I'm 32, born male, considered transitioning since I knew it was a thing (late teens'ish) but always dismissed it as too hard socially, impossible to fit in to my life, and as later years went on, far far far too late. Recent years I've gone into a spiraling depression and suffer from huge anxiety spikes. 

Then I saw some posts in /r/transtimelines, people my age and older, and it gave me hope. I was set on working toward it. I'd already lost 60 pounds last year 'just to see' if there was any chance of me passing once all the fat was gone, and now I've been working on getting rid of the last bits that remain. 

But today I read something that I -thought- I wanted. A stark, honest look at things https://sillyolme.wordpress.com/faq-on-the-science/

I have a psych degree, I've put so much of my life into facts and data and then I see in front of me there's two 'types' and I hit a lot of check boxes for the second type. The...adult one, attracted to women one. I'm not opening it again to read the name given. 

So now my brain is flooded with questioning myself, my own past. Did I never get along with the other boys just because I was awkward? Why when I was a teen and tried to do something somewhat feminine with my appearance and my dad freaked out did I just break down for days? Just...yes, I am attracted to women, the idea of being one is arousing, but as much as I put my faith into facts and statistics and psychology I just....can't see things as either A or B.

And then the other part that...was a big concern before reading that link above. I'm 6'2. Broad chested. Fluctuate between 170 and 180 pounds. I guess a lot of the weight must be muscle because people really raise their eyes when I tell them I'm trying to lose weight. I don't know. I have a young face, people think I'm in my early 20s. But I have no idea, very little hope that I could ever pass, let alone look...good as a woman. I also live in a somewhat hick region in Canada (not Alberta at least) where the city is built around industry, and that always brings with it a socially conservative 'vibe'. I can't afford to move elsewhere. Took me 2 years just to find a job that paid minimum wage. 

I just...I don't know what to do. My depression got buried by hope, but I can just see my hope being ripped away the more I try to move forward. "

I've taken to eating a lot of beets lately. I'm on cyproterone, not spironolactone, so I don't have to worry about potassium, and the slow burning carbs are good for some of the blood sugar side effects of cyproterone. 

My question is whether the boron in beets might mess with my hrt. I've read studies about how boron boosts sex hormones in both men and women, and decreases estradiol in men. I've also read that boron can interact with estrogen replacement therapy in post menopausal women to boost estrogen levels, sometimes to dangerous levels. 

I'm going to ask my doctor, but I imagine she'll probably have the same conclusion I do, ""I don't know."" I guess I was hoping someone here might have experience with boron and hrt.

SchrodingersGender,asktransgender,"1 Year Ago I had VFS at Yeson Voice Centre, here's a before/after and my thoughts and comments, feel free to ask anything about the experience","Hi! So a year ago my BF and I traveled to Korea, I stayed for about 12 days and had surgery in that time.
For obvious reasons I don't have many recordings of me before, but this is part of the sample I sent to yeson in the consultation.

http://vocaroo.com/i/s1bS8f7Gvus4

One year on, this is how I sound

http://vocaroo.com/i/s0GkGYituxqP

I never undertook any voice training before going to yeson. I tried a few techniques, but never really understood how to do it or saw any improvement, so I think I was treating Yeson as a magic bullet quick fix.

As recommended by Dr Kim, I sought out and got voice training once I was back in the UK, it was okay-ish but honestly I think having had the results from Yeson already by the time I started they weren't hugely serious about my concerns. Also, the techniques Dr Kim gave me were more focused on a singing voice, with emphasis on hitting notes, where as the training back in the uk was just focused on speaking more comfortably. There was nothing wrong with the voice training, and I recommend it, especially as I think it helped me with some hoarseness I had following the surgery, but I never felt like it was a huge help or anything.

The procedure itself was fine, the most unpleasant part was the botox shot in my vocal chords I got in the second treatment, I never felt any pain after the surgery. The biggest problem in Korea was drinking, the assistant (who's name I now forgot but she's lovely) recommended you drink pretty much non-stop, which I took to heart, but the problem was because my throat was swollen from the proceedure, it meant that when I drank water my throat didn't close properly, so I'd get water down my windpipe and start coughing which is the worst thing you can do. The solution to this is to drink out of a straw, so anyone considering VFS, take lots of straws.

It was surprisingly easy to avoid talking, the weirdest part was that you're obviously still thinking, and I communicated to my BF with hand signals and shit, so in my mind when I remembers our ""conversations"" my memory would think I had physically spoken to him. The month of no talking was shitty, and the worst part was the feeling of isolation, but it general it was okay. I think I might have accidentally spoken twice in this time, but the world didn't end.

Seoul is a great city and one of the worst parts of the trip was balancing my anxiety over ruining my voice by overdoing it, but then desperately wanting to get out and do stuff, especially eat, you're recommended to avoid anything which isnt bland as shit, but I cheated and had a lot of fried chicken. I'm definitely planning to go back to seoul one day, for anyone going, panmujeon joint security area (JSA) was 100% the best thing I did, and well worth the extra cost over just going to the dmz.

In the post checkup, my chords didnt look too good, as Dr Kim explained, my coughing had irritated them and caused them to become inflamed, in many respects I think I was lucky and it could have been worse. AGAIN always use a straw! I didnt know this until well through the first recovery week and it was the cause of a lot of anxiety for me to be constantly coughing.

Sorry this has been a bit rambling, the cost of the treatment was like $7-8000 as I recall, and flights were expensive but accommodation and food very cheap. If anyone has any questions or anyone else who had the surgery wants to chip in, please do!"
someone-someguy,asktransgender,Is it transphobic to not want to date a trans person?,"My friend says of course not. But he is straight and cis. He really only concerns himself with trans issues through me.

This is a subject that has come up once or twice. For me it's easy to say, ""Yeah it is. I'd call you racist if you wouldn't date a girl just because of her skin color."" Some would say it's a preference. And I really don't know. To me if you look at a beautful girl and say, ""But she's black I can't date her,"" it's racist. I think the same applies to saying a similar thing about a trans girl or a trans guy. Especially if their equipment is right.

So what does everyone else think? I'll admit I'm on the trans side of this so I'm a little biased here. "

ShellieHart,asktransgender,More Questions Concerning Aggressive Breast Growth,"I have somewhat touched on this subject on this forum before, but I guess I need better or more in-depth answers/opinions. I have been on HRT for over 5 months and have had very aggressive breast growth. At almost a frightening level. I know now I look very 'busty' when wearing certain old shirts (which I can no longer wear outside home). My new breasts poke out my shirts like the ends of two footballs and I can see this when I see myself in reflective storefronts, for instance. I estimate my breasts weigh about a half-pound each now and I can feel them bouncing and swaying all day. I am at the point where I need to consider stopping HRT in order to stop this profound breast growth. I have obviously hit the genetic jackpot for breast growth from HRT. I have grown from practically flat-chested to nearly full C-cups in 5 months. Certain bra sizing websites size me at 34DD/36D/38C. Strangely I have no stretch marks that I can see. My nipples are (still) constantly aflame with growth pains.

I need to know if stopping HRT cold turkey will bring this growth to a quick stop. I need for my breasts to stay as they are now. Just big enough to give me pleasure but not so big that they draw attention from others when I am away from home. I have heard that breasts can still continue to grow even after HRT is stopped. Or breasts can suddenly grow again in spurts months after HRT has been stopped. Does anyone have information or experience with this? What is so ironic about my situation is I have no intention of coming out as a woman. Ever. I simply live as a female when I am home (I live alone). I have business issues and family obligations that require me to stay in male mode for life, which strangely I am okay with because of my private life providing enough relief. But I am now afraid that my new busty (and still growing) appearance will bring this public persona to a halt against my wishes. I grew up with a very female body shape so now that I have breasts I am beginning to look like a curvy woman with a guy’s head on top:). I should have been born female because that is the shape my body grew from childhood. Any thoughts would be appreciated. I hope this question is appropriate here. If not I will delete.

PS: I have photographic proof of my large breasts but I am not sure of the rules here for posting topless pictures of breasts. ....I also have older pics of my breasts in bras.....I have outgrown most of them....

Thefanoodler,asktransgender,Friendly reminder about your body.,"You don't need to worry about what you can or can't do biologically.  So you're a woman that can't menstruate etc.  So you're a man who can't ejaculate etc.  It doesn't matter.  Because there are cis men and women who have the same issues.  I know it can seem like some kind of function you can use as a way to connect more with your gender, but a woman is more than her ability to bleed.  Just like a man is more than his ability to get hard.

That mindset of "" wah I can't do that I'm not the real deal "" is offensive to everyone to be honest.  Is a biological woman that can't have her period for one reason or another any less of a woman?  And for men?  It's dehumanizing really, being broken down into biological function.

She pointed me to some GPs and endos that her clients love and pretty much said whenever I'm rdy to go for it. I definitely want to start soon but I can't wait to go back and just chat. :D

Sorry I know it's not a question but I just had to share. And I figured some positive news is great as much as I spend here sharing life experiences and reading about others. "

catnails,asktransgender,"Not embarrassed to be trans, but embarrassed to talk about it..","So I'm openly trans (MtF) and I don't really care when people find out I'm trans.. The thing that gets me is when I have to talk and answer questions about transgender people and trans rights. I've always been anti-sjw and anti-pc, although I did believe that everyone should be equal and have the right to speak their minds whatever opinion they have (Which isn't the mindset of sjw and pc people in my opinion). 

So trans issues being all out in the public and having this ""sjw, pc, and triggered with 50 genders"" stigma associated with it is very embarrassing to me and is pushing people that think the way I do away from me which really sucks. Every time I try to explain my transition to someone I feel like they automatically view me as a triggered (god is this word overused) tumblr joke.

Does anyone else go through this or am I over-analyzing and being paranoid about this? Because I always feel the need to justify myself and I'm getting tired of it.

But it feels like I don't just dislike how masculine my body is, but that I just don't like my body in general, and feel horribly ugly all the time. And that in ways that aren't totally connected to gender, I feel unhappy with my body. And that, even if I didn't have gender dysphoria, I would still be very unhappy with and want to do all sorts of changes to my body.

I look in the mirror, and am not happy with what I see. I haven't dated somebody in several years, because flirting makes me feel like a creep and I feel too ugly to date.

Sometimes I've had self doubts about being trans, and just thought that I have a body disorder and am just unhappy with my body in general, not just how masculine it is.

CannibalIowa,asktransgender,"Writing a script based very loosely on my life pre-transition, and I'm starting to think the story is coming off a bit transphobic","The film is supposed to deal with two friends who each have depression and how they deal with it. While one of the two characters is based on me, there are some major changes. The first is that the main character is a pre-transition, still in the closet Trans man. I'm worried about portraying this character wrong, or in too negative light. At first I thought it would be easy and just make it as accurate as to real events as I can. This proved more difficult however and here are some things im concerned about.

1. The trans character spends almost the entire film in the closet. I thought of hiring an actor or actress who fit the bill the best, but I'm afraid if I hire a Cis woman for a part, it'll portray the God awful ""just a woman acting like a boy/man in a dress"" stereotype about trans people.

2. The character is in an abusive relationship and attempts suicide (unsuccessfully). Trans suicides/homicides are kind of cliche at this point and a negative one, but this one did actually happen. I was in the closet for so long because of my abusive ex, and I did attempt suicide right before breaking up with her and coming out. The movie is a bit non-linear and actually starts with the suicide scene, then goes back a few days. 

3. The character coming out as trans is a bit of a surprise. I did this because I told no one except my ex before I came out publicly and it was a surprise to everyone. I do include foreshadowing that came from my life as well. I was told to ""man up"" a lot, and it would make me incredibly upset, so I thought I'd inverse that as well, but I don't want to portray the character as stereotypically butch, mainly because I wasn't overly feminine pre-transition. 



This are my main concerns. The script originally had a trans woman, but it got a bit too real at points for me so I started over and made some big differences so I could actually sit down and write this out. 


EDIT: I saw what you guys have to say, im sorry I couldn't respond to all of them today. I think I'll go with a trans man who wouldn't mind presenting female throughout the film. I personally thought that would've been impossible (finding good actors is difficult, cis or trans, and I honestly thought asking a trans actor to present as their assigned birth gender would be as insulting to them as it would be to me) 
While casting will be more difficult, I think I'll have the time in pre-production to find a trans man and do this right. I'll be keeping the suicide elements, and revealing the character's closeted trans status much earlier in the film. 
Thank you all for your input, it's helped massively.  "

mynameisryanx,asktransgender,Suddenly I'm not interested anymore in the guy I'm dating?,"Hello, I am 21 yo and I'm a transgender female.

I came out to my family and all of my friends a couple of weeks ago and everyone took it very well. I did so because I felt it was the right time, considering that I was starting to date this guy that I met online and things seemed to be going in the right direction.

However, after one week of dating (that felt more like one month) things changed. I know one week is a super short amount of time, but we've seen each other nearly every day on that week, and done so many things it was like we've always known each other. Also, he helped me in coming out and is the first guy I'm dating as a woman, which made things incredibly new and special to me.

Anyway, after one week we've seen each other again and I felt he was hiding something. He barely kissed me, he barely talked and things didn't feel as natural as usual. After asking him several times what was wrong he told me that he's an escort and that at the moment he doesn't feel like quitting it. I said it was fine, but that I wouldn't keep dating someone that has sex with other people. Also, he kept saying ""no matter where this thing go, even if it's just gonna be a friendship, I'm happy I met you"" which kinda disappointed me because I thought we were seeing each other for ""dating purposes"" not randomly. I told him he didn't seem quite sure about what he wanted and we kinda agreed we will keep seeing each other for a couple of weeks and then decide where we want things to go.

However, somehow I feel like something has changed. Before I really liked talking to him, I couldn't wait to see him, calling him and sharing things with him. Now, I kinda feel like I don't wanna lose him but at the same time I'm not really that interested anymore. It's like something happened between us and I don't trust him as much as I did and I don't feel comfortable around him anymore. Why is it?

Could this be caused by the fact that I'm a bit stressed for my recent coming out? Should I keep trying? I don't know, I'm so confused!"

However some effects of the condition resulted in bone growth, male hair patterns, etc. I am also obese and trying to work on my physical and mental health. 

The thing is, up until around age 17-18 I loved makeup, dolls, dresses, etc. I thought out marriage, having children, building a life. Now anyone time someone refers to me or my gender in any I cringe. I feel like a caricature doing this because it's expected of me. I've been keeping a journal, trying to sort out my feelings but I don't know what I truly want. I think I would be happier as a boy, but this could also be poor self image, and misogyny. 

One thing that I wanted when I began puberty was to have surgery to remove my breasts and uterus. This was always in the back of my mind. I went to a clinic to start the Depo shot, and see if it will stop my cycle. I'm hoping that if my hormones aren't so out of wack, then I can gain some clarity and figure out what the hell is going on in my head.

I've tried to find studies about other people who were born with my condition. I've found studies of girls who expressed a male identity and transitioned. But most had the more severe form or expressed being comfortable as female. So what am I? An anomaly or crazy? A part of me doesn't want to be a woman I don't feel like one, and if I did stay as a woman it would probably be out resignation.

Except I was in a relationship, and lived with two of the most transphobic people I'd ever met. 

So I did what I thought I had to do. 
I dropped everyone in my life that I could. Dropped all my friends, broke up with the guy, only people I kept in contact was with my parents because I lived with them. 

But I never came out. 

Fast forward to 18, I stop repressing and start facing facts. I wanted to transition. I couldn't do it living with my parents, so I moved very far away. 
Still, I didn't have the courage to come out to them and I figured I'd be better off forgetting about the whole thing. 

Now, 23, I'm sure that I can't put it off any longer. I recently found out I have easy access to starting hormones. The only thing standing in my way is my family. 
I still live very far from them but I don't think I can start the transition without telling them first, I'd feel bad. 

I'm considering cutting everyone out of my life again, but then I'll have even less of a support system.

Unfortunately finding a new one has been really hard. I can't seem to find any obviously trans friendly endocrinologists at all. There is just so little information! I've found trans friendly clinics, but it really needs to be an endo because of some other issues I have that need monitoring.

Venus_s,asktransgender,Spiro to lose weight?,"I've been on HRT for 6 months and the whole time I've been trying to lose weight but it's been very slow. I noticed that when I started out on spiro only I lost weight pretty fast. 

Therefore I was considering pausing estrogen for 3 months in order to make some headway with my weight loss (If I can at least get to 180 lb I can stop hiding in my room.) 

Am I even right that spiro only speeds weight loss and if so is doing this a good idea?"

humpback_camel,asktransgender,DAE only want surgery when dysphoric?,"This might be really obvious to some people, but when I am not feeling dysphoric (like 80% of the time) I feel ambivalent about surgery. I was always going to have FFS but a recent post on this sub about risks and taking it one feature at a time kind of turned me off it. GCS was never really on the cards. If I end up with alright looking boobs I don't care how small they are.

But when I get dysphoric (like shaving yesterday) I just want everything done. Even bottom surgery. Even throat surgery.

I don't want major long term life and financial decisions to be motivated by something like dysphoria. But then I guess in starting HRT I already have. I don't know.

I'd love feedback both from people who decided to get surgery and those that decided not to - how did your decision relate to dysphoria? How did you sort out what was a good long term call regardless of dysphoria? How did you balance putting a deposit on a house with looking good? :("
Shakfar,asktransgender,Out to Parents now. Need advice?,"Hello r/asktransgender. Long story short is I ended up in the hospital after I threw a drunken fit and punched a wall. My parents who knew about my depression took it as a cry for help and finally came to visit me for the first time since I moved away from home 4 years ago. My dad basically forced me to come out, but has reacted far better to me being trans than I ever expected out of him. My mom says she will ""go along with it"" but made sure that i knew that she was skeptical and just thinks that the media has placed this idea in my head. She also mentioned that she read online that trans people are different than normal kids when they are young (man she must have not paid any attention at all because i was far from normal as a kid... i basically didn't give a shit about what was feminine and masculine) and that she never saw the ""signs."" basically she implied that i'm not trans enough which is super problematic. Now my dad is being a lot better and is supposedly advocating for me to my mom, and he says he understands and respects me and realizes that being trans is just who i am and that it's not a choice. He keeps telling me to just do what makes me happy. But the thing about him, is that even though he is advocating for me and being supportive, he hasn't changed the pronouns that he uses, and my mom flat out told me that she isn't going to make any promises about pronouns and that i cant get mad at her for it. 

I need advice about how to address this issue? I use they/them pronouns and prefer gender neutral language and it's actually pretty damn important to me to be gendered correctly."
Chief_Gadfium,asktransgender,Sexual effects of low dose HRT?,"Hi all

I will be starting low dose (probably 50 mg of spiro and 2mg of estradiol) in a few weeks. Very excited!

Can I also expect any change in how arousal is experienced or any change in orgasms at this dose?

Thanks!"
axlslashduff,asktransgender,Difference between being transgender and a crossdresser,"This is the question I've been asking myself for awhile. Since I was 12 I've crossdressed and I always thought it was a sexual thing. Mainly because I experienced virtually no dysphoria as a child and I happily lived as a boy. I still don't really experience any at all. But lately, when dressed up, the feminine feelings intensify to a point where it feels euphoric, even if it's just wearing leggings. Then it confuses me and I get scared I'm actually trans. However, usually what happens is that I'll relieve myself while dressed and immediately take them off. I get very scared going out in public as a girl, and around my guy friends I feel uncomfortable.

If I really was a woman on the inside I figured I would've known a lot sooner. On a daily basis, I like my identity as a male and it doesn't feel out of place. It's just my sexuality feels all screwy. I only truly get turned on when I think of myself as female, or dressed up. There are times where I wish I had the opportunity to experience life as a girl. As a guy, I feel asexual. As a girl, I feel like a lesbian.

I don't know why I feel the way I do. I just wish I had an answer. What are key differences between someone who simply enjoys crossdressing, and someone who may be in denial that they are a woman?

Sorry for the long post. Thank you if you've read all of it thus far haha.

Hi_im_Lexi,asktransgender,Getting my primary SRS letter - Advice needed!,"Hey everyone! Here's a short description of my situation:

I started HRT in January of 2016.

I went full time in March of 2016.

My SRS is booked with Suporn for early June, 2017. He requires 1 letter and will help in getting me a second one once I get to Thailand. The letter is due by the last week of April, 2017, and therefore I will have roughly 7 weeks between when I'll be eligible to get my first letter and when I absolutely need it by.

So now I have a few questions:

When should I start looking for a therapist who can write this for me?

How many sessions (roughly) will it take? (I'm trying to spend under $200-250 on this letter, and sessions are usually $50 each with my insurance)

Would anybody happen to know of a good therapist in central florida?

Is there anything I should know before starting this process of finding a qualified therapist?

Thanks! :)"
hiyapplz,asktransgender,Damned High School,"Oooookkk soo, as per the internet everyone in my school is on the assume gender joke, the 63 tumblr gender joke and all that kind of stuff. So err I was talking to some people on my bus and we had an argument over it to say the least (I mean like I managed to convince them that gender is in brain abliet they think it's a mental disease) they don't think non binaries actually exist. I am15 so being the idiot I am and should've just shut up, started defending non binaries. They start calling me a liberal as a joke, and even gets to the point where one the girls (friend) actually asks me if I'm trans (which I jokingly said yes, HAH THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW...i hope). Anyways to the point, how should I deal with these type of jokes and what are good points defending the questions ""if they aren't a gender then what are they""...non binary? Along with that ""Why don't they just choose a gender~proceeds to make joke about identifying as a cat."" So yeah, still going steady on transition thinking of stalling on try to start hrt till summer (switching to a magnet school that is openly pro lgbt, and is a music school I PLAY THE BASS HAH BEFORE I EVEN KNEW I WAS TRNAS) ."
Saturdalia,asktransgender,"Sorry for the cliché, but can I ask something in a safe space here?","So, I want to bring up something with only the best intentions of wanting to understand things, but I don't want to be perceived wrongly. As someone who's been questioning my gender identity (my whole life really but especially the past two months), I've been lurking here and trying to get a sense of the trans experience(s) and figure out if it applies to me. And the community has been great.

I just want to ask something about the community that connects to my own process of discovering myself. So, in my case, even though I've yet to see a professional about it, I'm pretty confident admitting to myself that I have gender dysphoria, and have for most of my life. I was born and raised male, but have been very uncomfortable with myself and my gender identity as I've grown up, and I have a distinct desire to live as a female that I can't really explain away or rationalize. A lot of times it's made my life really difficult. I want to live as a woman, and I don't doubt that.

But here's where I might diverge from others, and where I'm worried about offending or questioning other trans people. Even though I'm sure I experience gender dysphoria, I'm not yet sure that I'm transgender, or that the best solution for me is to come out/transition (even though most days it feels like that's what I want). And the reason I wonder about it is because on this sub and others, when someone asks the question ""Am I trans?"" and describes their feelings/experiences, the answers are often all some variation of ""Definitely, and you need to work on transitioning as soon as you can."" Although I'm not trying to generalize or over-simplify, and I don't doubt people's convictions or intentions, because everyone is super supportive. But sometimes I worry if an opinion that doesn't go along with ""gender dysphoria = transgender = transition""  doesn't get heard as much. I don't necessarily hold an opinion like that, of course.

And again, don't get me wrong, as someone who is probably trans and looks forward to being able to be the real me (whoever that is) someday, I'm not here to say that anyone who feels they are trans is just ""confused"" or mentally ill or anything like that. That's not what I believe, obviously. I've seen friends much happier post-transition, which is freaking awesome. And I just want to be happy too.

 I guess my question just boils down to: does having gender dysphoria automatically mean that you are some form of transgender, or has anyone ever encountered situations where there's another explanation not related to gender?"

melynda12,asktransgender,Tips on comming out to Family,"Hey! I made a post a few days ago, this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/534s30/not_sure_what_to_do/

TLDR: My mom found out i had girl things and asked if i was trans, gay, wanting to be a different gender etc..

I was shocked that she had discovered it and before thinking just lied and answered something to make her drop the topic ASAP. But in reality i'm Trans and want to live as a woman fulltime in the future, just not NOW. Even though i'm not ready to start my transition yet it doesn't harm to let her know how i feel, she sounded very supportive from the little we spoke when she found about it.

So, i've been thinking alot and maybe i'm ready to let my Mom and Sister know (I'm living with them, brother moved out and i don't have any contact with my father). 

But frankly, i'm really unsure how to come out, how do i bring it up? What kind of questions could she possibly have? Should i read up alot before comming out so that i'm ready to answer questions? Anyone who came out feel free to give some tips that could possibly help, also do i HAVE to do it in person? Would sending an e-mail be disrespectful? Idk, so many thoughts..

noncomformancey,asktransgender,Coming out at work?,"Hi! So, I'm a 20y/o FTM guy who recently got his first job. I live in Mississippi and work at Kroger.

I didn't tell anyone I was trans because I was worried that it would affect my chances of getting the job. Plus, I didn't even have a binder yet. My entire appearance read female and I hadn't made any physical changes to present more masculine, so I decided that it was safest to keep it to myself. It's not like I didn't *want* to be out. I was just scared of what might happen.

A representative from the union came by and talked to us during training and said that gender identities were protected, but I don't know how much I can rely on that.

Now that I'm getting my binder soon and am looking into starting HRT, I'm not sure what to do. I love my co-workers and they seem to like me, too. I'm just not sure how much they'll like me after they learn that I'm trans. I don't want to jeopardize my job, but I also don't want to jeopardize my happiness.

I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't know what to do and would appreciate any advice?

EDIT (9/8/2016) : I took a chance and came out at work. It was great. Everyone was immediately supportive and started using my correct pronouns. I couldn't've asked for a better result.

One area in which I've been having trouble is with shaving my facial hair.  Unlike anywhere else (legs, arms, pits) where the hair grows back gradually, I usually end up with visible stubble by the end of the day, and it's awful.  I really think it's messing up my ability to pass, and feel comfortable in my skin.  With that all being said, I've got a few questions for you all, regarding facial hair.  

1) What are some tips I can use to get a closer shave?  I feel like I get a close shave when I do so before bed, but by that time the next day, I've already got visible stubble.  I absolutely hate this, on top of shaving every day, to middling results.  Any tips for me?

2) Are there any basic tips, perhaps with makeup, to cover up beard shadow/stubble that I can't control?   I have so little experience with makeup, and so I'd hope there'd be an easy solution to this.

3) How much does electrolysis/laser cost you all, and how successful does it work?  How many sessions did you need?  How much do you need to shave afterwards?  

If anyone could answer any of these questions, that'd be great.  Thanks! :) "

ShellieHart,asktransgender,Feeling overly-feminine and dominated around manly men?,"As I have written on this forum before, I grew up very slender and feminine in shape and personality. Growing up I tried to be manly and tough like all the guys. I have admitted many times that I failed to be just 'one of the guys.' I was just simply too small and sissy-like. I am straight and was married and divorced as a young adult. I have finally accepted my femininity and now embrace my new secret life of living as a female at home where no one knows about my life outside home. Now on HRT for nearly 6 months I have grown very significant breasts and nice female hips and my waist has narrowed. All this has increased my hour-glass shape to the point that I look very womanly (at least many times when dressed certain ways) from the neck down. My breasts protrude my shirts that I really cannot hide anymore. But I must present as a guy at the shop.

Today, a couple (man and woman) came in to shop in my high-end gift shop. The husband was the stereotypical man's man. Stockily built, head shaved, large belly, darkly tanned, strong. And talked with a loud, commanding voice. Here I was; girly-shaped, busty/breasty, light peaches and cream skin, pretty blond hair and blue eyes. The old feelings from childhood of being overwhelmed and dominated by a masculine man made me feel apparently what a woman feels (perhaps) when conversing with a man. I could sense that he knew he was not interacting with an 'equal man.' He handled me like he might a girl. You know, like he would talk to a female sales clerk even though I am obviously a 5'-10” guy. Maybe a slim, feminine, somewhat sissy-kind of a guy, but a guy.

I do not ever plan to present as a girl/woman. I am closeted(?) and will remain presenting as a guy for the rest of my life. Because of business and family I have no choice. But my inherited figure and new C-cups are outing me apparently against my will.

How have you, pre-transition, handled this strange territory where you must interact with people as a guy but you can sense that  others are somehow questioning what/who you are. Is it stressful? Do you train yourself to ignore and carry on? Are you afraid it might hurt your business? I know HRT is changing my appearance a lot, but I must stay publicly male for the foreseeable future until I can get this increasing breast problem figured out.

11_49,asktransgender,My friend did a complete 180,"A few months ago, one of my friends (who doesn't know I'm trans) said some not really transphobic things but definately ignorant things. 

We were talking about insurance and how women pay less than men. I told him a story about a trans woman who's insurance went down after she changed her gender marker. He said something along the line of ""It's not what's in your pants that makes you male or female, it's your brain. She still has a male brain so she should be considered as male.""

I was taken aback by his remarks (I didn't know his stance on trans people before). I think a good way to describe how I felt would be 'unnerved'.

Anyway, a month ago, one of our friends came out as ftm. I talked to him about it and he was super confused and didn't really understand how that could happen. (He actually asked me ""How does that work?). In the end, I basically told him ""She was a girl, now he's a guy. Use his new name and male pronouns"". He was still pretty confused but he agreed to support him. 

Yesterday, we hung out and we somehow ended up talking about Caitlyn Jenner. He flat out said, ""I don't get why some people have such a hard time with the whole concept of people changing sexes. Like, other species do it on a regular basis.""

Honestly, he did a complete 180 and I'm real proud of him. I guess it goes to show a lot of people just don't know about trans people and because of that, end up saying some pretty nasty stuff. "

-clare,asktransgender,Anybody else 'anti-gatekept'?,"As in, you were encouraged to transition ASAP? I find it weird reading stories of gatekeeping because it's the opposite of what I experienced. I came out to my therapist last July. Within a month I was on AA's. My doctor then referred me to a psychiatrist to sign me off on hormones, all of it taking a few weeks. I was then referred to an endo who took me as a patient right away. I'd never crossdressed or *anything* until right before seeing the therapist. 

I always thought it was a phase I could beat. I did experience dysphoria for years which ultimately halted any progress in my life, zero sexual life, and just pent up everything lol. I was not a guy, it was clear. 

I knew what I was feeling, and expressed it, but there was no ""are you sures??"" It was like they knew I needed this to function and god damn did it ever help. I'm just kind of surprised, a lot of other people seem to get vetted for seemingly no reason, like one doubt and they're set back for months, I had tons of doubts yet not a single iota of resistance occurred. Does it depend on individual case by case basis or is it simply having an 'in', or what? I can't see why most trans people wouldn't get the same care that I got. "
transthrowawayhi,asktransgender,"My endo is prescribing 6 mg estradiol, 1 mg Finasteride and 350 mg Spiro - should I be concerned?","I've been on MtF HRT for close to 3 years now, and before HRT my body was at about 910 ng/dL T (regular levels for men is about 679).

I switched endos a bit ago to this trans accepting one and about 6 months ago we checked my levels when I had been at 200mg spiro, 3mg estradiol and 1mg finasteride for about a year. I was at 400 ng/dL T and about 50 E, so we increased it to 300mg spiro and 5mg estradiol (still 1mg finasteride).

Three months later (this was last week) I had a checkup and they re measured my blood levels, now I'm at 200 ng/dL T which is better, but still about 50 E.

So they're recommending I go up to 6mg estradiol (3 in morning, 3 at night) and 350mg spiro (200 in morning and 150 at night). Some people are saying this is high though? And I haven't heard of anyone else I know being on this high of a dosage. So should I be concerned?"
HijraShejra,asktransgender,How do you deal with discrimination being everywhere?,"I can't log on to social media, watch TV, or even talk to my friends or family without hearing some kind of hateful rhetoric.

Lunaa7,asktransgender,I'm losing my fucking mind with my parents.,"Oh, god. It's funny how things can change so quickly. Some days ago I came here thanking you all for being so great to me, and here I am, back again, now with bad news :/

My parents are transphobic as hell. My birthday was this sunday and I was pretty unhappy (still in-closet for family, everyone calling me *deadname*, ""20 years, you're already becoming a man!"", that type of thing). They noticed I was sad and they were apparently pretty annoyed by it. So, I keep some of my stuff in my back pack (A dress, some makeup, my documents for my HRT treatment), and I noticed my backpack was kinda in a different position as I left before, so maybe my dad saw all the things. Shit.

So today he came to talk to me, as it follows:

&gt;[dad] I went to an endocrinologist today.

&gt;[me] Oh yeah, what for? Are you okay?

&gt;[dad] I didn't went for me, I went for you. I've wanted to ask him what would be the effects of feminine hormones on men.

So then, he proceeds to *absolutely bash the fuck out* of me, saying that he really hopes I'm not even thinking about ""ruining myself"". He said things like ""It's poison. It's better you take poison and die quickly. You'll fuck up your health to the point of no return. That's why you never see old transvestites alive. And I'm not even talking about the social aspects, because being a transvestite is totally unnaceptable, and if you don't get shot by someone for being gay, you'll live all your life alone. No friends, no family, no jobs, no nothing. You have no idea of the damage you're causing to yourself and to the others"".

Apparently, I'm the cause of ""endless pain and suffering"" to my family. lol. Just because I wasn't ""gay as a kid"", my feelings are unnaceptable. I'm imature and unexperient and my feelings don't matter. What the fuck. And although I get that being trans is difficult and that HRT will fuck your male parts (which is exactly what you want as being MtF - fuck you penis I hope you die), this is so fucking wrong. Everything is so wrong.

I have nowhere to go. I'm 20, I have no job and no parents and/or friends to spend some time with (I do, actually, but I feel like a burden to people). So I'm here, hiding my HRT from my transphobic parents, and I have no fucking idea what to do. Should I stop the treatment? Should I came back to ""being male"", althought I came out to a lot of people and am happy as a woman, just to eventually kill myself?

It's very simple, and even repetitive, but I felt that's okay since it is for smaller children. I wanted to write something to let small kids know it's okay to want to be a boy or a girl even if they aren't and also that they can love anyone they want. I don't know if I got it across well. Can I please get some opinions from you kind folks? Ther draft follows down below:

You can be who you want to be,

That's something that's true,

You can be who you choose to be,

So please don't feel blue.



You can be a pilot

Flying your own plane.

You can be an engineer

Driving your own train.



You can be a doctor

Helping people everyday.

You can be a race car driver

Zooming down the speedway.



You can be an actor 

Starring in all the big movies.

You can be a soldier

Answering the call of duty.



You can be a boy

And you can play with any type of toy.

You can be a girl

But that doesn't mean you have to wear a pearl.



You can love anyone

No matter what.

You can love anyone

So don't be afraid to get caught.



People may try to make you sad

For being who you are.

But please don't get mad

Anger will never take you far.



Instead just say these kind words:

""I am who I choose to be and that doesn't hurt you,

Maybe you should try being who you want to be too.""

cole-acanth,asktransgender,Not sure if it's dysphoria (kinda nsfw),"I have never been able to handle even the idea of someone touching anywhere near my vagina or breasts (closest I can get is touching my clit), like to the point that I almost had a panic attack getting an external ultrasound.

Jilodragon,asktransgender,Seeking a little help from 'experienced' MtF ladies for my SO (NSFW I guess?),"Hey there Reddit!

My very first post here, wheee! First of all, I'm the SO of my lovely MtF girl and I'm posting this because I know she won't ask you on her own. Also, sorry in case my word choices may seem a little strange at times, as English isn't my first language. :)

So, she's been on HRT for roughly three years now and had reassignment surgery (no idea how you actually call it) about two years ago. To put a long story short: She's mostly happy with how everything turned out (physically and from the point of how things feel), but actually having sex this way is still uncomfortable for her. Simply put, it's due to her feeling too 'small' down there to enjoy it, which is in turn reflecting on her everyday mood.

Basically I would like to find some people for her to talk to. Ladies who also have or had this sort of problem and got some experience in terms of 'how to enjoy making love if your body is still a bit from perfect'. So, please just drop us a note if this is something you had or have to deal with as welll. I know she'd love to have somebody to talk to and share a bit of experience.

Also in case you have a more general tip or any questions, please tell us! We're looking forward to get a little help from the world out there. =D"

Despite all the gunfire and the explosions and the shouting and screaming and the planes overhead, everything goes silent and time seems to slow down and he just looks around in disbelief... today was the day where I had that moment.

I don't know what happened. Normal day, little overtired maybe, little bit anxious because I had a job interview (got the job!) but other than that, no worries. Had my interview, signed the contract then grabbed a coffee and went to see some friends at the place I used to work up the road. Then I got on the bus... and it's raining. Naturally, I put in my headphones and lean my head against the window and begin to ponder on the great mysteries of life while watching two raindrops race each other to the bottom. All is well.

""oh, **FUCK**, I think I might be trans!""

HOLD.
THE.
FUCKING.
PHONE.

Stop. Rewind:

I'm in kindergarten. My favourite colour is purple. Kindergarten kids do half days but my mom is a TA for 4th grade and she has to monitor their lunch before we go home. I have lunch with the 4th graders. Every day. And every day the table of girls and the table of boys all start trying to get me to sit with them. The girls think I'm cute (let's face it, I was fucking adorable), the guys think I'm cool (and let's face that too, I was rad af. Fuck with me). Every day I choose the girls. Maybe because I'm a playboy? Lil heartbreaker in training? Maybe it's because I feel more comfortable with the girls...

I'm 8. I'm at my mom's friend's house being babysat. She had two girls. The girls are out with their dad... I go play in their room. Beeline to the dresser. Find the underwear drawer. They have those undies with the days of the week written on them. I hide in the closet and put on a pair. Why am I doing this. I like them. They're soft. I hear a noise... fun's over. 

I'm 9. Me and my friend sneak into the girls bathroom after school. Just to see what it's like. No urinals. Dude, weird. It's clean in here. No wads of toilet paper stuck to the ceiling. Very serene... like a spa. Hmm. We decide to sneak into the girls locker room too. It's painted yellow. Smells good.

I'm 10. It's summertime and we're at my uncle's cottage with my parents' best friends and their kids just like every year. Me and my older brother, their two daughters. About the same age. We've come back in from a swim, I'm already changed... I go to the girls' room to see what's taking them so bloody long. Walk right in. Both fully naked. They try to cover up with their hands. I see everything. Everything. I shut the door. No boner. ""Interesting...""

I'm 12. Me and my best bud are out riding bikes. We start riding down a massive hill towards the river... we couldn't see this little ledge, cliff type thing because of the tall grass. My bike takes a nosedive, I'm flying through the air and -- I shit you not -- I land face first into a giant pile of old porno mags. Fucking porno mags! Dude! What? FUCKING *porno mags!!* We sit there and flip through them, I can't remember exactly how I felt but we each end up taking one home. Parents found it, got pissed. I think I remember being more interested than turned on... then again, I was an inquisitive little bastard. Question everything.

I'm 14. I'm snooping around because I'm an ignorant little fuck with no respect for my parents or their privacy. I find my mom's vibrators. Woah. I find her lingerie. Woah. I find a blindfold and a whip. Whoa. I put on the lingerie. Why? I masturbate over the vibrators. Why? I would go on to do this several times. Not only lingerie... eventually dresses. High heels. Mom jeans. Whatever. One time I tried to put the smallest vibrator in my virgin butthole. It's in. Like 1cm. Holy mother of fuck it hurts. Fuck that.

I'm 16. My brother comes out as gay. Yeah, big fuckin' surprise bud everybody knew since you were like 1 second old. 

I'm 17. I had a girlfriend for like a month in 9th grade. Made out a bunch, touched her boob. I'm so sexually frustrated I fuck a novelty blow up doll. It was a sheep.

I'm 18. I get a girlfriend. We're together for 2.5 years. We moved in together after 2. Not long after that I started wearing her clothes and her lipstick while she's out. We have sex. I go through the motions. I wonder what it's like to be her. Eventually I'd rather stay up after she goes to sleep and jerk off. We break up.

I'm 21. I join a fraternity. Fuck a bunch of girls, no homo.

I'm 23. I get another serious girlfriend. Often think about what it's like to be her while sexing. Literally every chance I get I'm putting on her clothes. Wtf. Girls night, she is with friends somewhere. I am at her house though. I should totally put on her makeup. Foundation, concealer, blush, contour, eyeliner, mascara, lip gloss, even nail polish, everything. I do a terrible job. I leave it on though. Masturbate wearing one of her dresses. Oh and btw I bought a dildo like 3 months before we started dating and I've been routinely bumming myself with it. We break up after about a year.

It is current year. I’m 24. I've been jerking off like 2 to 3 times a day for as long as I can remember. I'm insatiable. About a year or so ago I discover sissy hypno. I am mesmerized. Get pretty into tg porn. Still lots of regular porn but... I'm imaging myself as the woman a lot of the time. The guy is suddenly important. Like if he's fat or ugly or make's weird sounds or has a hairy asshole I'm not having it.

Resume.

In this moment, I am Tom Hanks. *Out of fucking nowhere* all of these memories flash before my mind's eye in a single nanosecond. What. The. Fuck. I begin to think about how I was a late bloomer. Late puberty. Very short until 16. Still only 5'8"". Scrawny, unlike the other men in my family... small case of gyno. My hormones fucked? Still can’t grow a full beard. Never a tough guy. Big mouth though. Little man syndrome. What was I trying to prove? Was never good at and was never really interested in sports. Hold on hold on hold on. I still loved getting dirty and catching frogs and building tree forts and shit. Cops and robbers and wrestling and building sweet jumps (fuck yeah, sweet jumps). Always felt more comfortable around girls though... but still somehow kind of awkward? Maybe that means I’m straight after all. Stole countless pairs of underwear from girls too. I guess that’s something a horny straight teenager would do. Oh but I would wear them. Wtf. At least one pair from each girl’s house I’d ever been in. Even my cousin’s. I bum myself with realistic dildo. I have cum lube. It’s lube that is the consistency and colour of cum. It’s anal numbing too. I like to wear makeup and lingerie and bum myself and jerk off. The moment before I cum though I instantly regret everything. Wtf am I doing? Who am I? This is disgusting. I literally don’t even like this at all. I gotta get this stuff off me. Feels weird man. This happens every time. Why do I keep doing this?

I spend the rest of the bus ride just staring into space. Thousand yard stare. I get home and put on a pink lacy thong and jerk off to tg porn. Instantly regret.

So what do you think? Transgender or just your standard, run of the mill crossdressing fetish with maybe a little vagina envy mixed in there? Please respond.

DanielleBasel,asktransgender,FFS with Dr. Bart van de Ven at 2pass feminisation centre - Part 1,"Now it's nearly three years ago I decided that I wanted to undergo an FFS. After that decision I dived deeper and deeper into everything related to FFS. And as more as I studied that matter, as more complex it got. But I wanted to understand what can be achieved and what would make sense in different situations. 

After that long time of study I had an idea what I wanted to have done in my face. During the same time of study I followed endless blogs with reviews about different surgeons and their techniques. I tried to collect all informations about each surgeon and surgeon team, which seemed to be worth to have a look at. And so I made a small database with pros and cons of each surgeon and their technique used for every separate part of the face. At the end I started with contacting each surgeon and/or team to see them personally in a personal consultation. So I had appointments all around the globe... some by personally traveling to them and others trough ismple skype chats. Thailand, Korea, Belgium, Spain, Argentina and last but not least the United States.

I compared what each surgeon suggested to have done with what I thought should be done, prices and reputation. 

Horror stories I found for every single of ""my"" surgeon, so I tried to look and weight them very carefully as well.

So I learned as well, that the personal esthetic point of view is something very subjective and important as well. So I tried to get also feedback from others about my research to see what they think and feel about something specific.

After all I decided to undergo my FFS in Antwerp at the 2pass clinic with Dr. Bart van de Ven and his Team...

temporaryalexx,asktransgender,Is this gatekeeping?,"from [albertatrans.org](http://www.albertatrans.org/transition.html):
""Current medical practices follow the Harry Benjamin Standards of Care. The practice is that a person undergoes roughly a year living and working full-time as one's identified gender. Alberta Health requires that the RLE be fulfilled before SRS surgery is funded, and typically RLE is started before prescribing hormones or lesser surgeries. There are cases, including patients who are older or with certain medical conditions, in which this period might be shortened. The transition process is different for youth. But the intent of the RLE is to make sure that the person transitioning will be able to function, live and work as their identified gender and that they are fully committed to doing so.""

This really frustrates me. Whatever happened to just disappearing for a year and coming back as the opposite gender? This process seems to be designed to embarrass and humiliate people so they give up. I guess that works for them since Canada 'funds' transition (i.e. makes people wait years for subpar work). People unwilling to jump through their hoops means saving money for the government. This seems ridiculous amount of control on gender change cosmetic surgeries. I feel so frustrated I don't even want to try to get through their system.

This also makes read a post I put on here about a year ago on my own Gender Identity.
https://redd.it/2zzd44

I was honestly prepared to answer the question but I paused and asked myself, why do we transition?

My response would have been that some of us can't live the Feminine Male lifestyle and prefer to transition but wouldn't that imply that being transgender is kinda a choice(I know that sounds stupid but he confused me with the question)?

-Viktory-,asktransgender,Came out to my mother the other day,"It went okay. The first day was hard because she was very judgemental of me and my status as transgender. She clearly didn't want to believe it and was convinced that I had no clue what was best for me or that I was drawing conclusions too quickly.

Since then, however, we have talked about it more and while she still clearly has some transphobic thoughts and incorrect, preconceived notions, she is becoming more open to the idea of it, and she wants to help me figure out what is best for me. She does think that this issue is me ""misdiagnosing"" myself, she thinks that something else is wrong that I haven't discovered yet. She is open to the idea of me visiting a gender therapist, however. She thinks that if I am right, and I am transgender, then I should at least have the opinion of some medical professional behind me.

I wasn't even planning on telling her that day, we had argued a bit and she was asking me questions. She sort of coaxed it out of me, and even though it was hard, I'm sort of glad she did. It was very hard for me, though. 

I think this will turn out as a positive in the end. "

When I went for the consultation with the surgeon I was told that it wasn't too bad and that he could clear it right up no problem, and a few hours after surgery I was told by him that my throat was completely flat now and it was dealt with. This obviously isn't true. So I have a few questions:

1) Has this happened for anyone else? What did you do about it?

2) I've lost about half a stone since the surgery (unrelated to the surgery) - is it possible that this is why it's become visible? Like if I gain a bit of weight is it possible it'll become less visible?

3) Is this something you would be wanting to have a word with the surgeon about? I don't know whether to contact him and see what he says about it, like I kind of feel that he hasn't actually done the job properly despite assuring me that he could and that he had

TerryWayne,asktransgender,Can OCD cause me to believe I'm transgender?,Growing up i had no gender dysporia. I was perfectly happy with who I was and never thought about what it would be like to be the opposite sex.  I had crushes on girls and guys were just seen as friends.  Then one day in  jr high I had a sexual thought with a guy pop up which pushed me into an anxiety driven rampage.  from that day on I constantly was checking if I was gay and if I was attracted to my classmates.  this went on for many years and it destroyed any kind of social activity I did for fear of having gay thoughts.  I got deeply into pornography to satisfy my urges as I felt that I shouldn't try with women because I could possibly be gay.  Now some 10 years later I've started having thoughts that I might be trans and it feels so much like before.  I've even started to dress to see if I would like it and I'll try to act feminine to see if it's natural for me.  I'm depressed because I feel like I'll never be able to be myself.  Sometimes I just think about killing myself to end all this pain.  I can't afford a therapist so that's out of the question.  I'm quickly losing hope.

I look a bit weird, like Theon Greyjoy from GOT or something. That is pretty accurate. 175cm/5.7ft tall. Have his build to. Except slight gyno which I had since puberty.

When out being my buttoned up fake ""self"" I guess I presented with a soft male vibe (By ""vibe I mean sum of body language, posture, walk, voice etc etc). This came of as ""charming"" to others, both men and women. I was complimented on how nice and pleasant I seemed.

But after accepting my trans state fully I think I may be slipping. I stopped figthing it and my suppression is basicly running on vapors. And the strangest little things started happening. There were quite a few strange comments from men I am pretty shure are straight (Nobody really is, but you know what I mean.).

Said by different men:

""You have such a (Slight pause. Seems to be looking for the right word).. mild and non threatening way of interacting with people. You are very nice.""

""You are very charming."", repeated to me with an almost puzzled look when passing same person two minutes later.

And so on...

Women also seem to stop in their tracks and process for a split second when encountering/interacting with me. But men seem to pick this ""vibe"" up so much easier. I don't think I seem very feminine in the way I go about daily life now. And I dress in the same boring baggy (SupressionWear™) manclothes I always have. But Im starting to worry if people can tell that something is up... Im not ready to come out to everyone (Need to know basis only.) and Im not even on HRT yet.

achanceatlove,asktransgender,Starting dose of estrogen?,"Hi

I recently got HRT prescribed; 50mg of spiro twice a day, and 4mg of estrace/estradiol twice a day, for a total of 100mg spiro and 8mg estrace/estradiol. 

The spiro dose seems fine to me because I already had T levels that were a decent amount lower than the lowest end of male ranges. The estrogen dose seems really high though, especially since I'm just starting HRT. I've read that 8mg is basically the max recommended dose, and starting off at that seems weird to me.

If it has anything to do with it, currently my BMI is 36.5 (5""8 and 240lb). My friends have said that it might be because of my weight, but I've found very little information regarding the relationship between BMI/weight and HRT doses.

I'd really appreciate any insight on this subject, thanks!"
Fayedrus,asktransgender,Transgender suicide rates,"A national survey found that 1.6% of Americans have attempted suicide at some point in their lives. Another study showed that 41% of transgender people have attempted suicide. Transgender people make up at least 0.3% of the population; however this figure is higher among younger people with more exposure to LGBT friendly media, and less loss by attrition to suicide and violence. I'd estimate that about 0.5% of the population is ""born trans"". 

For the sake of simplicity, we can assume that the rate of successful/completed suicides is the same for both the trans and general populations.

We can therefore estimate that **between 7.7% and 12.8% of all suicide attempts are committed by transgender people** (using the .3% and .5% population estimates, respectively)

So if proper psychiatric care, HRT, and other trans medical care is effective at reducing transgender suicide rates (and research suggests it is), then making such care freely available nationwide could potentially reduce the national suicide rate by **5-10%**

No question, but I thought this statistic could spark some discussion"

I mean, I was going to have to go through an odd, visible, transitory stage anyway, right? And honestly, a college campus is pry *slightly* safer to try that than anywhere in the ""real"" world...

Ember718,asktransgender,A Vent (Sorry for the Wall of Text),"You know, sometimes I wish I could cry. I don't mean shed tears, I can do that. I mean to really cry. To let my emotions out takes conscious effort, I have to exert my entire will to force down the walls I have built. And even then, curled up in my room, watching with almost morbid, detached curiosity as I trace the jeweled diamonds of sorrow trickle down my wrists, they still feel fake. Those were tears I made because I didn't have any way to show myself what I was feeling.They were mine in all the ways that don't count. And I hated them for that.

Who am I to bemoan my life? Who am I to fucking lament?! My pampered ass has never known true struggle, my hands have never worn callouses and my lips have never gone chalked with thirst. I can write of all these experiences like they were my own, yet the truth of the matter is I have grown up to a place where the world bends to my whims.

And still I want to cry. Why? What in hell gives me that right? Children are starving the world over, and all I can think about is myself. Does that make me a bad person? I want to believe it doesn't, though this is a lie. Really I am a narcissist, I am the villian, I am the demon, the devil, the fallen but laughing one. I am disgusted with myself, like I am tearing in vain at my skin, trying to claw out some parasite that has infested the me that I wish I was. That me… she is different. She is bright, and happy. She loves others. She doesn't scream or claw at the air. She isn't afraid of touching people's skin, she doesn't suck down medication to keep her head on straight. She is popular, but not in the mean way. She is just the kind of person who can make someone feel better.

Me? I am her shadow. Less even then that, I am a reflection of her shadow. She would hate me I think. I couldn't blame her for that. No, I don't think I can blame anyone for hating me. In fact, I think it is the people who don't hate me that I am so bewildered by. They call me a friend, however that is just a word for how I torture them so. I am cruel. I am unrelenting. I am the pain that spreads like an infection. I wish I could die. I wish I could cry, really cry, as I view the skin that never truly felt like my own. I wish I had the strength, the courage to split the corded rivers of my life and perhaps free that good me of reality’s cold grip. I wish. I wish. I wish.

But if there is one thing you should take away from this self serving piece of shit melodrama post, it is that I am a coward. I am a bloody coward who can't even face death with a brave face. Thats right, I cant even kill myself properly. One look off the edge was all it took for me to pull away and vomit. That is all. Not one finger laid on the precipice.

My parents tell me I am a boy. I cannot be a boy. I am sorry, I have tried. I have tried so hard, God. Every day I read of another pastor condemning me. I watch as the world spirals into chaos. I do nothing, not because I can't, but because I am afraid as to how that will affect me. Am I no longer christian? Is it true what my father keeps yelling at me? I am afraid. I will be honest. I can not agree with the vile, hateful things that so many members of faith espouse… but what if they are right? I am afraid of hell. I am afraid of what awaits me on the other side. And at the same time, I still think of myself as christian. I always come back to when Jesus died full of agony on the cross but with love in his heart. I still remember hearing about the splitting of the bread. I remember reading of how the world changed, not through war, but through genuine, honest, kindness. 

Ironically, in a post that began with me wondering why I cannot cry, I am now crying. I just can't take it anymore. I have said I don't care what others think. I more blatant mistruth has never been uttered. I care what people think. And I can't stop myself. I care what TERFs think. I care what my pastor thinks. I care what my parent’s think. I JUST CAN'T BEAR IT. I WANT TO SCREAM, I WANT TO BEG THEM ALL TO STOP.

Though they won't. They never will. They will go to their graves like they are. Perhaps that is supposed to give me some kind of satisfaction, the good old, “huzzah,” “you won,” “we got those bastards good,” et cetra. After all, in a way, it does. I will not deny that the thought gives a sadistic joy. But another part wishes for something else. I wish, I don't know, I wish for something other than what is. I can't give you “my dream,” for all I have are nightmares. All I can say is that I am afraid. 

Actually no, that's a horrible ending. Let's go with this: I am Jennifer Daisy Gill, and I am downright terrified."

graphsofpassion,asktransgender,trying to help,"hi everyone. this is my first post here and it's going to be a long one. I'm posting on behalf of my good friend, who is a poor 24 year old transwoman living in the south. for the sake of anonymity I won't disclose her location or real name. let's call her Amy. 

Amy's mom is a pastor, her dad is a bigot and her family has always been poor. emotional and financial support are not given to her by her family. Amy is somewhat of a facebook celebrity and has managed to raise enough money for ffs ($10k with insurance) with dr. spiegel. however, she has been waiting for spiegel's office to send the letter of agreement to her insurance company for almost two months now. she has done the Skype meeting with spiegel himself and had gone to his office back in March. 

I am encouraging Amy to move to my city (Baltimore)  because it is fairly affordable and there is a very strong and supportive queer community and transwomen are very visible and relatively respected here, and it's not filled with false allies. Amy is miserable waiting to hear back from spiegel's office and I have been calling at least 2 times a week for the last two weeks to get more information and a date estimate on when to expect spiegel's office to sign the letter of agreement and pass it along to Amy's insurance company, premera. Greg, who is the person I speak with, always tells me he doesn't know. 

Amy is 24 years old and 6-ft tall and kinda bricky -- she weighs around 220 lbs. she fears that it's too late for her to transition and to ever pass even though she began hrt a year ago. she receives messages from younger, cis-passing transwomen telling her to detransition because she will always be clocked as a man. she has almost no support in her hometown, but needs at least a grand to relocate and is afraid of dipping into her ffs fund and is tired of asking for money from people. she is also so down about everything that she doesn't see the point in moving and ""surrounding myself with people who will lie to me and tell me I'm pretty because I will still know what I am."" I try telling her that she's in a negative feedback loop because the people around her aren't supportive and that contributes to her dysphoria and negative self-image. idk I'm more than happy to help her financially and with the relocation process but i can't force her to move here.

on top of all this I have been reading a lot of horror stories about spiegel here and that makes me really apprehensive. I haven't told her what I have read because I don't want to make her feel worse or even suicidal. I need to talk with more transwomen who have lived experience here, and I think Amy needs to as well. is there any advice or resources or even just kind words that anyone can share with me? I love my friend a lot and I just want to help as much as I can because I know she is really struggling. she doesn't even have a room or anything that she lives in right now, she just has a couch at a friends house that she's been crashing on for months so she has no privacy ): idk. thanks for reading y'all."
HijraShejra,asktransgender,I'm going to medically transition but still present as male,"I'm going to keep taking HRT, get all the surgeries, etc... I'm even going to wear whatever clothes I want and talk with a feminine voice.

But I won't change my name or legal gender. I won't use the women's room or invade any other women-only spaces. I'll correct people when they gender me female... because I'm not one.

I'm not happy this way, but I can't change reality. It's a compromise. I can do whatever I want to my body and express myself however I want -- and I will. But that doesn't make me a woman. Too bad, so sad. 

I'll probably still kill myself anyways. But maybe I'll be able to live longer than a couple days like I was planning to in my last post.

Being transgender is totally valid. Everyone else on here can identify as whatever, but I'm definitely not a woman. That's just it. You can't always get what you want, so too bad, HijraShejra. Get over it. Grow up and face the world like an adult. "
Solem3,asktransgender,"Has anyone else, MtF or FtM, switched to patches from another E/T delivery system and LOVED them?","I just wanted to make this thread because patches get a bad rep on here, what with being kinda hard to keep on for a week/suoer expensive.

My concerns are that before I transitioned I had such a fire for transforming and appearing the way that I always wanted to.  While I still feel that way, it doesn't consume my mental energy anymore.  I sort of went full time and just continued life like normal except as a woman.  I'm not sure that it's necessarily a bad thing because I love everything that has changed about my life since transitioning but I see all these posts on here about constantly working on things and being excited for milestones (I'm so happy for you boys and girls btw!!!).  

I suppose maybe I'm just looking for some ideas for goals or milestones to focus on to keep the excitement up.  Maybe I'm crazy lol idk I'm just rambling at this point... My boobies are still so small so maybe I can focus on watching them lol.

heyheresmythrowaway,asktransgender,How do you respond to transphobic conversation in person? (TERF scenario in post),"Hey Reddit, been a while since I posted but I wanted to get your take on something. In short, I'm FTM and at a house party last night had my first run-in with a TERF. I'm not sure how well I handled it or where to go from here, so any thoughts appreciated. TW: transphobia, naturally.

So it was fairly late in the evening and everyone had drunk a reasonable amount. My girlfriend L, a gay cis guy G, and a cis rad fem dyke (by her own labelling) D were sitting on the sofa chatting, and since L had just mentioned me and that I was trans I was invited to join the conversation.

D greeted me with ""hey girl"" and explained she greeted everyone like this. I shrugged and wrote it off, and conversation picked up. I mentioned that post transition I miss the intrinsic ""sisterhood"" women have, and my acquired privilege feels a bit strange to me sometimes. I said it'd be great if society could stop the whole ""dicks are the best"" line, and all three agreed with me - until D said that dick (and dick-havers?) is awful...at which point I joked that the nice gay guy in our midst with one probably didn't think so.

Anyway, things developed from there, and it transpired that she doesn't agree with the trans restroom issue in terms of people being allowed to use their preferred restroom. She volunteered this information, and G asked her expressly to confirm in case we'd misunderstood. D said that it's not safe for (FAAB) women and there have been tons of cases of people (implicitly trans women) going in there getting changed and flashing their dicks in front of kids. All three of us pushed back on this, saying those reports are of men dressed as women rather than trans-identified individuals, I sure as hell wouldn't get my ""wrong genitals"" out in front of anyone, and would she be fine with me using the female restroom? She didn't answer that last point but said she'd send us some research if we wanted, so we said fine.

At this point the conversation was becoming pretty awkward, and for some reason she continued along a line that culminated in her asking G whether as a gay guy he'd date ""a guy with a pussy"". Leaving aside the fact that she completely singled him out and put him on the spot, he said he would. At this point one of the cis gay hosts walking past overheard and told her to get her stuff and leave because it made him feel uncomfortable and it was inappropriate.

As she was getting her stuff he escorted her to the door, and they talked for a few minutes. We tried to ignore them but then they went into the yard and talked for a long while more, ie in private. When the host came back he said he'd possibly misunderstood her position (we said he hadn't) but he'd wanted to shut it down, and we thanked him.

As we were leaving, she asked me for a word, and basically said she didn't mean to offend me, she was sorry, and she wanted to talk about it more some other time but I should be honest if she had. I said we should draw a line and that I didn't think we were going to agree about trans women, and I made my excuses and left. She did ""offend"" me, but I didn't think further discussion was going to be productive - she's from Brazil, so I'm not sure how far her cultural background influences her thoughts.

What I'm wondering is what to do if I run into her again. I can avoid that follow up discussion pretty easily, but I don't really want to cause ""problems"" for either host. I was also slightly stunned (and pretty intoxicated) so I feel like I didn't defend trans women perhaps as well as I should have, but I'm also not sure what I could have done differently. Any advice?

Thanks all."
Astus53,asktransgender,Questiom about HRT and changes to upper body,"I know HRT will change body fat distribution for a little while so breasts can and will develop, along with relocating some to the hips, thighs, butt region.

I don't know If I can do this here but I wanted to make a statement.

I am transgender.

I am not going to resist anymore. Today I came to the realization that I accepted myself. I am scared, I am still figuring out how far this is going to go, but this is the day where I flip my life upside down hoping that I am finally going to live for myself, not trying to fulfill a role that makes me uncomfortable. As a person told me here, this is a leap of faith, And I'm jumping today.

I have been raised and conditioned to be a male, without any chance of having someone to let me think that there was another option. I can see now how this is wrong, and how it would have been different if someone taught me what dysphoria is. I lost more than 10 years to start embracing my own gender, and instead I have been learning how to act and behave in a way that doesn't fit me. My mind resisted so much with me being unable to understand why. Now I have permanent scars of this. But I am not going to let this kill me.

God damn if someone told me how much the image that the media gave me of the transgender community was wrong and transphobic.

Today I live."

MightJustDisappear,asktransgender,How to cope with the fact that transition will make you ugly,"Trigger warning, I guess

I'm getting seriously suicidal over this. It gets worse by the day. I can't even look at other people on the street or pictures online because it reminds me of how fucked up I am.

I can look somewhat ok as a girl, but I know if I ever take Testosterone I would look like some kind of monster, and I'd never pass. My proportions are honestly fucked up. I've never seen a transitioned transmasculine person with more of a baby-face, tiny skull, button nose, big forehead than me.
I know men are less pressured to be pretty than women, but damn I wouldn't even look like a man !

I feel like I'm not valid as a trans person if I value my beauty over transitioning, but my self-esteem is SO bad I can't handle feeling ugly. I'd rather not transition than look like some kind of fucked up thing, but then again the prospect of living life while being seen as a girl makes me want to throw up and and disappear, too. 

I know I sound overly dramatic but I don't know how to get over this... I guess I really need to vent. I have to study for exams right now and I can't even focus on that because of all this...

As a kid like I said, I wasn't overly feminine or masculine, but I was socially awkward which made me a target. In highschool I got beat up and so started working out a ton and got super buff so I could whoop the next person who tried to hurt me's ass if need be. 

I came out as a gay male at the end of junior year or highschool and that's when I really started accepting the feminine part of myself, I loved having long hair and looking feminine. At the end of highschool I discovered I really like painting my nails and wearing makeup. 

I guess what confuses me is I didn't know as a child, and I never exactly hated what I saw in the mirror until male puberty really started taking off. 

Something that confuses me is, while most of my facial hair is gone from laser, I still get some blonde scruff and I love the way it feels against my skin, but hate the way it looks. I think this is part of the reason I grew a goatee before coming out as trans cause I love the way facial hair feels against my skin. But I'm thinking that's probably just cause I really like men lmfao. 

As a woman I pass 99.9% of the time, I am extremely pretty, and have feminized my voice and everything. Overall I am much happier now than I have ever been, and like what I see in the mirror.

I do sometimes miss how I used to talk, and how that used to feel (not emotionally or mentally, but physically, the boominess in my chest). I often fuck around with friends and out of the blue will go back to my old voice for a word just to freak them out and find it hilarious. 

In addition when I was aging as a man it really freaked me out, but aging as a woman doesn't freak me out at all. I can't imagine being a dad, and can only imagine being a mom.

But I have all this masculine stuff that comes so naturally to me and it makes me question, did I do the right thing, shouldn't a bunch of feminine stuff come naturally to me instead of masculine?

Like I enjoy heavy lifting, it makes me feel useful and good, I enjoy sweating, I hate muscles on myself though. I also am kind of Indifferent about breasts. I like the way they feel and look on me. But I don't think I ever hating having pecks, and I wouldn't mind having pecks either? I never liked breasts on other women, and I guess one of the reasons I like them on myself is cause with cleavage it helps me pass and passing makes me feel better.

I also never really hated my genitals as a kid which also makes me question if transitioning was right, I sure as hell hate my genitals now as I hate tucking, it hurts and my tuck always pops, (I've been tucking for a good 8 or so months) and my genitals no longer work like they used to. I miss being able to orgasm like I used to and I know it's kind of weird but miss the fluid that would come out, like now it's all clear and stuff. I don't like the way my genitals look and it causes me a ton of dysphoria, but I can't help but ask myself, is the reason I don't like all this stuff cause it keeps me from passing or is it because I am genuinely unhappy with them? Does the answer make a difference? I have no clue.

I'm just super conflicted. I haven't questioned my transition like this ever, and have tons of good friends, and a great support system. My parents are supportive. But I miss my male friends, and now all these guys just wanna fuck me and nobody wants to hang out like I used to be able to. 

I also like female privilege much more than male privilege. But I hate the societal constructs that females have to live by, I hate having to wear makeup to be respected, and honestly I'm not a huge fan of having to speak in a female sounding voice all the time, but speaking in my old voice gives me great dysphoria. 

I'm also a singer and I love singing, I am a high tenor but have an amazing lower register that it just feels so good to sing in. I do wish I could belt like Carey underwood though.... I've never liked how my lower register sounded, I've always wished I had a higher voice, and now that I do have a higher voice I'm much happier, but I miss my lower register...

Also one last thing. I'm 21 almost 22, I started transitioning when I was 20.

I'm just so confused.... Help?

Squigums,asktransgender,Looking to begin a martial art. More specifically what do I need?,"So as the title says I'm looking to begin a martial art (more specifically Brazilian Jiu Jitsu due to it's defensive potential). 

But I'm uncertain what I need to be honest. I'm fairly certain as a matter of anatomy I'll need a cup but I'm rather worried that given the -visible- body changes I've had that it might elicit unwanted attention? Is that something I just have to accept or does anyone here already do such sports/activities and have a way/method to successfully hide the hint of masculine bulge?

So in Summary my assumption of what I'll need is as follows. Am I maybe missing anything?

-A bjj Gi(This is a set of Pants/jacket)
-a rash guard/under layer
-A cup and supporter
-Knee pads(for floor drills)

 Thanks in advance for any suggestions and tips."
ThrowawaytransLol,asktransgender,Help with my coming out letter.,"Hello people! I am just done a very rough draft for my coming out letter to my dad and I'm afraid I'm being really passive aggressive and rude in it but I really don't know how else to express my feelings. I'm going to leave the rough draft here and just hope people can help.... Sorry if it's terrible.



Greetings this is a letter



I just wanted to write this to talk about stuff… Now before you read I just want to say don't discuss this with anybody else please this is designed for your eyes only. And if you want to talk about the contents of this letter please do it over Skype message at least for a bit, I'm very stressed about doing this face to face as you can tell by this being written.



This is being written at 12:40 PM September 2nd 2016, a time where I should probably be doing schoolwork instead of bed writing this alas. As I'm sure you know most of my life I have suffered from depression, anxiety, among other things…. For a while I came up with excuses about why I felt this way some true, others not but I couldn't come up with a reasonable explanation why do I made excuses. But after 5 years of depression I have finally figured out why. I'm transgender. You already knew this, unless you forgot the time I brought it up and then proceeded to not talk about it…. Point is I don't see myself as a guy but as a girl. I know that sounds weird it took me a while for it too not be weird myself. 5 years of repressing these thoughts apparently leads to depression, who knew. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I will try to answer as many as I can but if you have more specific questions SKYPE MESSAGES YAY. I'm sorry if this is poorly written I'm very stressed and can't do much while stressed



 First possible concern! This is just a phase he will grow out of it. I didn't know phases lasted 5 years caused me to almost never sleep thinking about it and fall into a deep depression. Sorry if that's a bad passive aggressive answer it's just I thought the same thing about it just being a phase and it destroyed me from the inside out repressing it so yeah. Second concern! He just had some friend who made him feel this way. Uhm, no. I've felt like this for 5-6ish years even before we moved to Michigan and I didn't even know what being gay was then soooo….. Third possible concern! He thinks this is just a fun game like “ oh I'm a girl now this is cool “ no I don't think this is fun I think this is life destroying and wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy.


    So I that i have tried to address concerns on a very rude and passive aggressive way because I'm a terrible person I think it's time to just end this letter, not end this conversation, but just this letter. Please send me skype messages about this questions queries just please don't be mean. I almost never open up emotionally and I don't want to get waves of hate thrown at me. If you think this is dumb and you don't agree just say “ I don't think this is a good thing for you “ and leave it at that. I just want you to know I'm not asking for your permission. I'm just asking for your support of you decide this is something you don't want to support I will wait till I am 18 and do it myself



Just too let you know it's not finished I haven't said everything I want to say I just really hated the way it was going and wanted help. Thanks.

babydall1267,asktransgender,How do I deal with this guilt?,"Okay so I've been questioning my gender identity as of late and I think I might be ftm maybe or at the very lest non binary.    

This realization has brought up feelings of guilt.        

You see my family has always been split by gender. My dad and brother where put on one side and my mom and I were on the other side. A team.         

I feel like by wanting to change my gender and pronouns that I'm abandoning my mom.     

Plus I'd love to change my name but feel bad cause my mom gave me my birth name and even though it does not fit right it was a gift.         

I don't know how to handle guilt at all but I have to find a way to deal with it. The constant guilt is making me feel sick.       


If you folks have any advice I'd much appreciate it.      "

goombiya,asktransgender,Airbnb Discrimination Policy Update,"Received this email today:

Dear Airbnb community,
At the heart of our mission is the idea that people are fundamentally good and every community is a place where you can belong. We don’t say this because it sounds nice. It’s the goal that everyone at Airbnb works towards every day – because we’ve all seen how when we live together, we better understand each other.
Discrimination is the opposite of belonging, and its existence on our platform jeopardizes this core mission. Bias and discrimination have no place on Airbnb, and we have zero tolerance for them. Unfortunately, we have been slow to address these problems, and for this I am sorry. I take responsibility for any pain or frustration this has caused members of our community. We will not only make this right; we will work to set an example that other companies can follow.
In June, we asked Laura Murphy, the former head of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington D.C. Legislative Office, to review every aspect of the Airbnb platform, and to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to fight bias and discrimination. Thanks to Laura’s leadership, today we’re releasing a report that outlines the results of that process. You can read the full report here, but I’d like to highlight four changes that will impact the way our platform works:
Airbnb Community Commitment
Beginning November 1, everyone who uses Airbnb must agree to a stronger, more detailed nondiscrimination policy. We aren’t just asking you to check a box associated with a long legal document. We’re asking everyone to agree to something we’re calling the Airbnb Community Commitment, which says:
We believe that no matter who you are, where you are from, or where you travel, you should be able to belong in the Airbnb community. By joining this community, you commit to treat all fellow members of this community, regardless of race, religion, national origin, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or age, with respect, and without judgment or bias.
Open Doors
We’ll be implementing a new policy called Open Doors. Starting October 1st, if a Guest anywhere in the world feels like they have been discriminated against in violation of our policy – in trying to book a listing, having a booking canceled, or in any other interaction with a host – we will find that Guest a similar place to stay if one is available on Airbnb, or if not, we will find them an alternative accommodation elsewhere. This program will also apply retroactively to any Guest who reported discrimination prior to today. All of these Guests will be offered booking assistance for their next trip.
Instant Book
We’ll increase the availability of Instant Book, which allows our hosts to offer their homes to be booked immediately without their prior approval of a specific guest. Instant Book makes booking easier for everyone, and our goal is to have 1 million listings bookable via Instant Book by January 1st, 2017.
Anti-bias training
We are working with experts on bias, including Dr. Robert Livingston of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and Dr. Peter Glick of Lawrence University, to make anti-bias training available to our community, and will be publicly acknowledging those who complete it.
These steps are just the beginning, not the end, of our efforts to combat bias and discrimination.
While we as a company have been slow on this issue, I am now asking you the community to help us lead the way forward. Every time you make someone else feel like they belong, that person feels accepted and safe to be themselves. While this may sound like a small act of kindness, we are a community of millions of people strong. Imagine what we can do together.

Feels wonderful to be back on blockers.

I want to thank everyone who helped me persevere to pressure her to put me back on T-blockers. I educated her a bit."
Tycorion,asktransgender,At this point I don't even want to know if I'm trans. I just want a sign pointing me in one way or the other,"About a week ago while I was scrolling through this sub I came across an excellent post which recommended to those of us that are still questioning that instead of questioning whether or not we are transgender, we should ask whether or not we want to take any steps towards actually dealing with our feelings. I thought this was excellent advice, and it gave me a lot think about this last week. 

Do I care whether or not I'm definitely trans it definitely not? Not really. But like the title suggests, I barely even have a sign as to which way I want to begin dealing with my *possible* transness. It could be that I'm looking at things all wrong, and I probably am, but the way I flip flop with my gender identity is crushing my desire to solve some of my questioning issues. There are some days I feel I may just be a bi guy, or a feminine guy, or a kinky guy, or androgynous, or genderqueer, or just flat out a girl. 

The problem I find in this is my indecision (not that I think i have to make a choice) feels like it is stopping me from taking any steps towards solving my problems. For example if I feel one day that I am a feminine boy, I may want to start going about things according to that identity, but if the next day I feel I am a girl (and am confused as to why I ever thought of myself as simply feminine) I may want to solve my problems in a way that is not at all how I'd solve them were I feeling anything *but* trans.

Sorry for the wall of text, and I'm not really sure what I'm hoping to get out of this post, but sometimes it just feels good to get it out there :)"
Hummdinger27,asktransgender,Questions about Dr. Brassard,"I'm considering at some point getting a vaginoplasty. I live in Mississauga, Ontario, and my doctor who does all my hrt stuff is very confident that I should go to Dr. Brassard in Montreal, for proximity and quality. I've talked to some people who have had it done by him, and they all say it was great, but I've seen a few stray youtube comments saying to avoid him because he refuses to admit to/correct/refund for mistakes. Youtube comments aren't exactly my #1 trusted resource for medical advice, but I'm a bit confused. 

Then I stumbled across this video, which doesn't seem to make any sense. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnm3-NylrMA
It seems to be a standard kinda commercial-thing of ""why we're great and you should come give us your money"" that I'd expect any place to make. But then the title and description are saying that he's bad? But then it has a ton of dislikes? But then the comments... what?

I'm inclined the think that the negativity towards him isn't true, since I only see it from such weird and questionable sources, and so many more people have positive things to say for him. But I am very confused, and wondering if anybody can clear this up for me. Is the negativity just people being silly on the internet? Should I actually avoid him? Sorry if I'm just being stupid here, I'm just confused"
Transthrowaway7776,asktransgender,Did your sexual orientation change on E or T? Let's share experiences!,"Here's mine:

I was always bisexual, but before medically transitioning to male, I only wanted to date women for a variety of reasons. One, I was not attracted to masculine heterosexual men. Two, even if I found, say, a bisexual effeminate man I found attractive, I could not bear to be in a ""heterosexual girl"" role. It deeply and viscerally made me dysphoric and squicked out. Thirdly, I am genitally dysphoric and am a dominant top. I do not want to be penetrated ever, I want to do the penetrating. Even if I wasn't squicked by the idea of being some guy's ""girlfriend"", there would still be a very small population of guys who would be into this. Since even the idea of being socially viewed as a girl on a date with ""her"" (sic) boyfriend sent my dysphoria to the roof, I didn't have to face this challenge.

T has not changed my bisexual orientation, nor has it changed my stone top-ness or attraction to queer feminine men (trans or cis) and femme to tomboy femme women (trans or cis). Yet now I can happily date men as well as women, since there are more men who are my type, fit my parameters, etc that are attracted to me as a man than there were when I had to present female. I also enjoy being a guy's boyfriend, whereas I loathed the idea of being a guy's girlfriend.

In general, T didn't change my orientation, my liked/disliked sexual activities or my ""type"", but it (and surgeries) changed how I could express all of these preferences.

Trans folks on hormones: what about you?"
raphmer,asktransgender,Body fat redistribution,"So I was wondering if it's better to lose weight for body fat redistribution while HRT or if it's better to keep some.
I have a normal built with some fat, but I was wondering if the ""curves"" will appear due to the fat that's already in the body, or if they will be made of new fat while the fat you already have will stay at its place."
masti12,asktransgender,"I am so angry and tired of being chased by ""bottom boy"" MTF chasers...(NSFWish)","I'm sorry for this, and I really hate to be negative on here but I just really need to get this off my chest. Throwaway for obvious reasons.
On one hand I feel like saying ""viva la revolution!"" with the sexual revolution I see going on, but on the other hand I feel like it's been a double edged sword for those of us in the trans community.
I seem to be coming into contact with a certain sort of chaser. Most girls I talk to get the ""I want to suck your dick! No homo!"" chasers, but I seem to be getting what I feel is an even grosser iteration. The ""I want you to fuck me in the ass...no homo!"" ones. This isn't once. Or twice. This is getting to be a 'ticking them off on my fingers and running out of them' situation.
A lot of times I seem to get the really irritating ""Well I'm totally straight, but I've always been into anal..."" (Good for you, that's fine) ""And my girlfriend pegged me which I loved..."" (Okay, lovely, you have a nice girlfriend) ""And now I just really want to feel a big, hard, throbbing dick in my ass, but I'm not attracted to men!!! Woe is me! No homo."" (Alright, we're done.)
I'm not saying all men who get pegged have these thoughts and desires, but I'm not going to lie when I say the sheer amount of these solicitations have made me start side-eying the pegging community a little. I'm not generalizing, if a guy can get pegged and say he wants real cock and is bicurious, all for it, but I really want to cry when men look at MtF girls as their ""no homo"" option for it, or have this weird straight-guy insecurity when they say ""I'm straight, totally, I just love dick...."" Argghhhhhhhhh!!
It's really obvious what a lack of understanding they have about what hormone therapy does to the penis in a lot of trans women, and no understanding of the crippling dysphoria so many of us have. You're basically asking me to penetrate you like a man would. You don't see me as a true woman, you see me as ""woman enough"" to satiate your own insecurities about bending over for someone.
I'm not your goddamn experiment.
(I'm sorry. This has just been building up for awhile and I'm frustrated, angry and near tears over this. I think I'd be less upset if I even got your usual ""suck your dick"" chasers because it feels less outright masculine than basically saying ""Fuck me like I'm the most bottomy bottom ever....grrrl."" Ugh. I'm angry that I've let this emotionally affect how I look at men who are straight and into anal play too, because logically I know what's going on there but I can't help but feel if I were to get a boyfriend who was into it I'd be so turned off and upset/disgusted because I feel like they would want something that I'm not capable/willing to give them. I'm so angry at what kind of person this whole situation is turning me into. I'm not an angry, bitter person like this normally, I swear.)"
Cornfondler,asktransgender,This is a really long one but I appreciate any input (MtF),"I came out as trans 20 months ago to my parents and at first they were supportive but very hesitant. Before that I had moved to university and became incredibly depressed to the point I didn't get out of bed for 3 months, I eventually went to see a counsellor and get help from close friends who were all really supportive and helpful. It became clear to me and my counsellor that I wasn't fit to study, I needed time to work things out in my head, transition, and start to feel at peace with myself.

I went home during Christmas break and told my parents, I couldn't stop crying no matter how hard I tried, my mother didn't seem to fully understand how it worked and I knew I'd have to try to be careful and ease her into the process even if it meant transitioning for a longer period of time.

The next day she took me to the doctors saying that they would help me and there would be some sort of pill that would help, I told her that's not true and they would just send me out the door having wasted their time. I went through with it and it all happened as expected, he said he can only refer me to a GI clinic if I'm in good health mentally and that prescribing any drugs would be unrealistic at this point especially since he's not my GP. We left and she seemed unimpressed with nothing much to say.

Naturally I was failing in my classes and I told them how I planned to leave but they wouldn't have any of it, they told me I have to go, that it wasn't a choice and if I did leave I'd never get a chance to go back since leavers don't get support a second time (which I later found out through Student Services was a lie).

After a lot of arguing I agreed to stay, I insisted it'd be too much but they wouldn't have any of it. Over the Christmas break I spent my time catching up on coursework and getting ready for assessments, somehow I managed to do it just in time and went back to school. A few months later the same thing occurs and I'm a complete mess but now I feel the pressure from home to do well and it reaches the point that I start feeling suicidal and like a failure.

I decide to go home and talk to them again, I didn't mention anything about school just that I was okay and seeing my counsellor regularly. Every time I spoke to them about my transition, progress, etc, they went quiet and wanted no part of it. I tried to be reassuring, I told them I'd slow down (at this point the only that I changed around them was wearing women's trousers) and give them a chance to catch up, but again they wanted none of it and just shut down and ignored me whenever I brought it up.

I go home on the coach literally in tears over how despondent they'd become towards me as a person. The same cycle repeats and I try getting learning support, more counselling, support groups, anything that'll help but nothing does because all I wanted was for my family to start to accept me and have genuine open dialogue about it.

Suicide becomes a daily thought and I start to alienate my friends by making up excuses for why I can't meet them or go out until those relationships almost entirely break down. I felt so defeated and unhealthy, I was ashamed of myself and who I am and I was pretty much ready to just give up and die, so I went to the doctors, booked an appointment with the honest reason for why I'm there and explained everything to her.

Less than 20 minutes later I'd been diagnosed with clinical depression and given a monthly prescription of anti-depressants. They worked extremely well and evened me out over the next week, I cleaned up my flat, organised all my current and outstanding work, grabbed my shopping and got back in contact with some friends.

This didn't last long though, eventually the pills stopped working and I ended up the same. I told the head lecturer of my subject what was going on and we agreed I'd take the rest of the year off and start fresh the following year from the beginning. I go back home, we move house and I don't even mention anything about what I've been up to out of fear my parents will get upset.

Along comes my birthday and all is fairly normal for a few days, then I tried going outside with a handbag. My mother absolutely flipped her shit, she started calling me selfish, thoughtless, I'd never be a girl or even look like one and that I never stopped to think about any of them. I'd been out about it for 8 months at this point, I wore women's trousers and had just attempted to go outside with a handbag. I knew immediately that this wasn't a situation that would end my way and that I should just leave. I packed my stuff and left the next day for my accommodation at uni.

I get prescribed something else by my doctor, have an emergency meeting with my counsellor, and break down accidentally in front of a housemate. The drugs made me feel worse, my counsellor told me at the end of the session she was moving to another job and my housemate told me not cry (she knew what was going on).

I felt pathetic, worthless, less than human and my lifestyle from then on showed it. I locked myself in my room, never answered my phone and only left to get food or to shower. I became a nervous wreck trying my best not to bump into my housemates on the way out, hoping no one from my university would call wondering what was going on. I just sat in my room on my laptop crying in the dark and wishing I'd just die already.

A year goes by, I'm a mess, my friends hate me, thoughts of shame and suicide plague my mind every day and I look disgusting.

I go home because I have no where else to go, my parents think I've been to uni like normal, ignoring that I'm trans, pretending nothing happened and I go to my room and go back to what I'd been doing.

Now I'm supposed to be moving back to uni and I literally don't know what to do, I know I've done this to myself and I know I'm to blame for my lack of ability to deal with this shit and not here for a roast or for some tough love, I've had enough of that already and it hasn't helped. What do I do? Just give me advice what the fuck am I supposed to do now? I feel trapped and unable to do anything, if I tell them I'm leaving uni I'm worried they'll throw me out with no money. Just anything useful is appreciated"
WitchDearbhail,asktransgender,Advice on shopping for breast padding?,Hi.  As the title says I'm looking for advice on breast padding.  I want to start having more of a chest and I want to get some padding.  Any brands or stores (online or physical) you would recommend getting it from?  I'm fine with starting cheap with decent quality as I won't be wearing it all the time at first.
overgirl,asktransgender,I feel screwed out of my 21 birthday and don't know how to present,"In short I'm going to see my dads family in California for my 21st birthday. We are going on a cruise were there will be plenty of fun stuff to do. The problem is his whole side of the family is transphobic as fuck. They all know I'm trans at this point and no matter how I present they are going to insult me.

If go full time which I'm not ready for all they are going to say is how sick or disgusting I am. How mannish I look or how much of a man I look like. There is so much hurtful things they can say and I already am terrified to go full time as is.

If I present androgynous they will only point out how butch i am and how I'm not a real trans women. How this is all a phase and how fake I am.

If I present as a man they are going to say I'm just faking everything. They will also being up how handsome of a man I am and How I must get all of the girls. 

The best case scenario is that they shut up and don't talk about it but I don't want to be stuck on a cruise were everyone secretly dislikes me on my 21st birthday and my 1st transiversery. Any suggestions? "
wthalpme,asktransgender,My T levels shot up?,"So I just got my blood results back... and jesus christ my t levels shot up. I got an appointment with my endo in weeks but im just stunned by this. Ive been on hrt for like 9 months. ok so every time id get my blood tested, every 2-3 months, my tlevels went down and down, all the way to 69 ng/dL then all of a sudden its at 250 ng/dL. My dose is 50 spiro and 6mg estro, so I'm just wondering, what the hell can cause t levels to randomly spike like that? "

TransgirlInLove,asktransgender,"I reached one year on hormones! So, what's different?","Everything.

This time last year, I was depressed - majorly. At 18 years old, I was lonely, I was going through a really odd phase in my appearance, and I was scared. Scared of taking hormones, scared of the road ahead. It was a frightening thing to get past. I didn't want to be allergic to the hormones, and I had never swallowed a pill before. I had bangs constantly as a way of covering as much of my face as possible, my dysphoria had gotten so bad that I couldn't leave the house without feeling suicidal. I didn't pass, I got sir'd all the time, I couldn't wear makeup or girl clothes due to my family, and I was constantly averting my eyes from mirrors. My movements were rigid and were forced to be masculine. I didn't think I would ever pass.

At 7 months on hormones, I not only passed - I was able to go stealth. I began presenting full time, I had girl clothes, I could wear makeup, I could walk more fluidly and in a natural feminine fashion. I trained my voice and it is now entirely feminine. I love to go outside, it makes me happy. People include me in events more, they strike up conversations more. I smile all the time, walk with my head up and in complete confidence. I have a bright and non-awkward style, chic clothing and use the women's bathroom. I don't get sir'd anymore, I haven't since before the day I began presenting. Nobody even knows I'm trans, and the few I trust enough I tell don't even believe me. I use the women's bathroom, even in deep south states, without issue (the second day I ever went out, a waitress led me to the women's room automatically!). Other women are even comfortable letting their kids run around me in the bathroom (which is kind of annoying, but they're kids :P). I have family, I lost no friends, and I've gained many friends through this. I had the best summer of my life, spending a good amount of nights with friends at house parties and overall having the life I've always dreamed of. I'm even getting my name legally changed and permanently sealed on Halloween!

This time last year, I would never have dreamed of what has occurred now. It would be impossible, insane; I could never look as good as I do now, or pass, or be stealth. But I'm a 19 year old girl who's saving for SRS and moving in with the love of her life next summer. I get to finally live life as a girl while I'm still a teenager. I'm even conventionally attractive too, so there's that!

PLEASE never give up. This time last year I was contemplating ripping my face apart with a knife because I had to wear a suit. I haven't thought about suicide since I started hormones.

Happy one year, and I can't wait to see the next!"
missbybye,asktransgender,My therapist told me I expect too much from hormones. Are my assumptions really that far fetched?,"I (mtf) told her I feel like HRT will be the best antidepressant for my dysphoria. I'm not feeling like I'm really depressed per se, since I don't see the world particularly bad or good, but rather feel like I'm not part of it because of the conflict between my brain and my body. That's how dysphoria manifests in me and I am under a strong assumption that HRT will help me get connected to my body and hence enable me to experience this world more ""first hand"". I also told her I feel like I can't cry when my brain clearly sends an impulse to express pain/joy because I feel like testosterone is ""not allowing me that"". I strongly believe that when I start HRT I will be able to feel/express broader range of emotions. Are my assumptions really that far fetched?"
Canadiannabis,asktransgender,Should I stop HRT and go bank more sperm?,"Title basically covers it. I've been on HRT for nearly six months now and last night I kind of freaked out about maybe not having enough sperm banked. Before I started HRT I banked 11 samples and I am still not sure if I want kids.


I've looked into it online and it seems that each sample can only be used for one try at pregnancy (correct me if I'm wrong), meaning if I have really bad luck or end up wanting a second biological child the amount I have may not be enough.


So with all this in mind I'm somewhat seriously considering going off HRT for the three or so months required to see if I'm still fertile and then banking more samples. Obviously I don't really want to stop HRT but I also don't want to make a mistake here that I might regret when I'm older.



So, am I being crazy paranoid/jumping to conclusions?"

helpmekillcatdog,asktransgender,SRS Questions,"My genital dysphoria is crippling. This needs to happen by next year. So, I have some unresolved questions I would really appreciate being answered.

1. What is the difference between the standard inversion technique and what someone like Bowers or Chett does?

2. What surgeons take insurance besides Bowers? I mean any insurance or credit program at all, in any country.

3. What surgeons do a labiaplasty with the vaginoplasty?

4. Has anyone here financed SRS with loan(s)? Details?

5. Anyone else find McGinn's website transphobic or like it belongs in the 80s? 

6. When emailing a surgeon, what kind of questions should I ask them?

7. Are there any websites that show comparisons of the various popular surgeons' works?

8. I heard Thai surgeons such as Chett take credit cards, is that true?

Bonus: When you mail to another state for your birth certificate to be amended, can you fold the form to fit in a standard envelope? And can I send copies of name/sex change as opposed to the original document?"

bmore977,asktransgender,How does one lose a majority of their mass?,"I'm pre hrt and am highly considering coming out and starting hormones eventually before I turn 20 at least. One problem is in order to try to distract myself from my dysphoria all these years, I gained a lot of muscle on my upper body.

subtleflora,asktransgender,Office Bathroom Design Question,"Hello :)

My office HR team is considering converting our typical men's and women's restrooms into gender neutral areas. I have influence over the outcome so I'm curious to hear your opinions!

The restrooms are currently pretty normal. The women's has a small lounge at the front and 5 stalls across from a row of sinks. The men's has 3 urinals and 3 stalls across from a row of sinks. I think converting would only involve labeling them as gender neutral and informing the staff.

Our staff is relatively young and liberal but sometimes behave like they're still in the frat house. There are between 80 and 200 in the office at a time depending on travel. We're in Washington DC.

We currently have no openly transgender staff (I'm closeted &amp; pre-*).

What do you think? Is this a good idea? Can we do better?

Thank you!!"
ijihara,asktransgender,How long does it take for skin to clear up?,"Hello all. First time poster. I've been on HRT for about 3 months now. I started E on 2mg from May to August and have been on 4mg E since September. 200mg spiro and 5mg spiro. Everything divided in two, taken twice daily.

I've had a lot of great results with my skin (way way way less oily. I went from looking like I'm homeless in the morning to actually being able to skip a shower every once in a while (if I really wanted to. ... I kinda don't)). 

But I'm still having some problems. Namely, seldom but *extremely* annoying sebaceous cysts that are completely full of oil in place of acne I would get every week or so. I still have very light bumps and sun damage that looks gross on upper arms and shoulders and I kind of doubt that will go away from E or vitamins. I've been just scrubbing that down with a callous remover and its helped some but not a lot with the tone and bumps.

I'm doing a bunch of stuff for my skin nutritionally - Lemons, oranges, limes, meyer lemons, natural vitamin E pills... as far as drugs go I even tried some mk-677 for a little while since it increases growth hormone. (bad idea. It didn't really have side effects but I was so hungry I couldn't handle it and gained a little weight for a little while.)



TLDR; What else can I do? Is my E too low, am I too impatient given everything wrong with my skin, particularly the sun poison on upper arms/shoulders? "
TrickyCharlotte,asktransgender,Need Advice on employment.,"Hey, everyone, I am in a bit of a pickle at the moment and not sure what to do so I thought I'd ask my family here for some advice.

A little background, I am 23 and have been on HRT for under 5 months. I feel like I've only had a really small amount of changes at the moment but my face has really rounded I'm probably 3/4 of an A cup and I've had a little bit of hip growth.

Now, what I need advice on is that I have recently enacted a plan and I am moving this weekend to a big city (I live in  Australia) because I want to get better paying work so that in a year I can afford FFS, GRS, and VFS. 

Now as a guy, I was really successful here as I have a truck licence, forklift ticket and I was basically a qualified machine operator for high-end factory machinery. 

Now at the moment other than growing my hair out and when I need to feel a bit better, getting my nails done, I am presenting male as I am still struggling to accept myself and I am deftly afraid of looking like a man in a dress.

My issue is that I have applied for a position at a company and on my resume, it has my now legal name (Charlotte) and what I am going by (Charlie). Now I applied for an office job but seeing my experience they have offered me a position doing what I have experience in.

Now I am worried because the type of industry often involves lifting and I don't want to encourage my top to have more muscles at this stage.

Also, I am concerned as the industry here is very anti-female and very male cultured. I worry that if I get really lucky as HRT progresses I will become a target for abuse.

The other side of the coin here is though that the money there is really the best I could earn right now. If I worked full time in about 12 months I could afford any surgery I wanted.

So my question to everyone is:

1. Do you think I should disclose in my interview that I am trans? 

2. What does everyone think I should do with the job offer?

She has to ""put on"" her male persona that she has always lived with. So, she doesn't go out much. She is beautiful. I can tell her all day every day, but until she believes it, my words won't mean much. My question is, what can I do to help her feel pretty? Anything helps. Thanks folks &lt;3"

When we went on our first date it was late night and we walked around the city.  We rode bublr bikes across the lakefront and sat out by the lake at about midnight.  It was very fun.  We talked for a bit and she said this date could have gone two ways, very bad or very good and she said it went good.  She said it is very hard for her to find someone who treats her as a human and not a sex object or asking her whats in her pants.  Personally i didnt even mention anything about her parts i just treated her like any other girl and she really appreciated it.  She even talked about how she one day hopes to get married with somebody.  I really like her so any tips or suggestions for me to stay successful would be nice!"

HRT was a success. i dont know what i expected though. this is so far above my expectations it's kind of disheartening how low my standards were for myself at the time lol. 

i knew what i was getting into i just didnt think it would go down like this. its like my brain hasnt caught up and actualized my self image yet. it's hard to imagine but last july i came out. i had never told anyone anything about what i felt. i had never crossdressed or shown any gender non comforming behaviour in public if i could help it. and now im the other sex seemingly overnight. it was so gradual and then flipped like a switch suddenly. its cool. new. right. but damn is it just totally the opposite of my past experiences. dudes flirting with me? women saying im ""beautiful"" ahaha wtf happened. i've gotten more compliments in the past few weeks than i did my entire life. it seems hilariously surreal to me. all the good things coming together at once, being able to finally express my true personality it's completely insane how right the choice to transition was for me. HRT was the treatment. and this is just the start.. damn.

right .. my question.. did you feel you just kind of woke up the correct sex one day and go.. wtf, so soon? and so well? you's now, mate, ya best admit

JackAlexender,asktransgender,"So, many basic questions.","I've been typing posts and deleting them right before submitting for like 3 hours now. (Look at the time when it says this one was posted) I'm going to try to condense the things on my mind into smaller things. 


Spent time with a MtF trans in real life, great friend. Talked alot and their words started to get me thinking ""Oh yeah, trans is a thing.."". Fast forward two weeks and here I am now. 


I've never felt comfortable in my own body. It's not always tied to gender but there are times where I will look at something, a dress or a nightgown or panties and say to my self. ""If only i were a woman"" Only time anything like that comes out of my mouth as a guy now is. ""If only it were longer..."" 


((Super personal ahead but being blunt cause best way to be)) There are times where i get ""Excited"" where I feel as though there should be another bit of kit, A phantom cave if you will. Not sure if deviant thing or identity issues. 


and now the big thing that really landed me in this waterfall of ""what do? Please help i'm drowning in my own mind"" A friend pointed out to me. ""Jack why do you always play Females in games?"" Because in games where I have the choice I always pick, cute small frame asian looking guy, or Female. One, to look at butts. One.. Because it makes me feel comfortable, something to bear in mind on this note is Video Games were my escape as a child, my one thing that would let me out of the real world. 



ANYHOW! If anyone here on this subreddit thinks that this sounds like anything they have gone though in there... Reality... awakening? Whatever you wish to call it, if it does. Let me know, and i will make an appointment with my therapist and swallow my many MANY nerves to do so. 

Anyhow, good day. pip pip cheerio. "

I just got off the phone with a local endocrinologist after scheduling an appointment. Yes, I am estatic, but I'm also terrified. What should i expect from this appointment? I will have my letter for HRT by then and have already told them why I'm coming, what I hope for, etc. But I can't help but worry. I am 21 and MtF, pretty much pre-everything. But I have an extremely feminine build, complete with small male genitalia, thick hips and thighs, lower amounts of body hair (compared to the rest of my family) and some breast tissue. With these factors, and the fact that I've never had much of an libido, and never really achieved orgasm, I was wondering if you think its possible I may suffer from XX-male syndrome? That's one of my biggest considerations as I'd really like to be tested for it, but if there is no chance I have it, I don't really want to spend all that money.

Sikoza,asktransgender,Another Estrogen without blockers/AA thread,"Hello, I am a 32 year old transgender female that lives in UK and I started the HRT 3 months and a half ago.
As some people might know in UK they don't give out blockers unless your body doesn't respond well to the estrogen therapy as in, estrogen alone should lower the T production.
Before I started the hormones my T levels were 12.6 - doctor said they were in the normal male range, after 2.5 months on HRT my T levels were 2.1 (female range).
Now, what worries me is that, this doctor is just a GP (Dr. Richard Curtis private doctor) and I don't know how much he knows about the hormones... my breasts didn't grow a bit, the nipples have been sore after 2 weeks on hormones but nothing happened; I will add that I have had and still have very small areolas and nipples prior to HRT, which scares me that I might not develop breasts at all.
Do any of you have transitioned on estrogen alone? because the doctor refuses to give me anything else and so do the other private doctors, claiming I do not need it.
I am on estradot patches 100micrograms 1 every 3 days.

Sorry for the weird post, I'd appreciate some help. Thank you."

I'm *deeply* ashamed, and I cringe to think of what my family and friends think of me. 

So does the shame go away? Will I eventually feel better? I hear from my trans friendsbso much how HRT and/or transition has made them feel so much better while I'm progressively getting worse.  

Sometimes I regret coming out. Sometimes I regret HRT. I want to be 11 again so I can stop myself from ever coming close to going down this road."

Hanicrumbs,asktransgender,"Something strange happened with my genitals, need some help/advice girls. NSFW.","So something strange has happened. Since I started HRT 7 months ago my libido has tanked, and the most I got out of my penis is a sorry half mast that was very soft. Several weeks ago I tried achieving a orgasm with no luck. twice. Today I felt like a bit little bit like masturbating, which was in itself a bit odd since I hadn't felt like masturbating since I started HRT and T Blockers. So tonight I started to read some erotic literature and started to masturbate. A while later I noticed that I was hard. Like hard hard, pretty much almost as hard as when I was pre-HRT (maybe a tiny bit less so). Which was strange, considering only a few weeks back I could barely get semi soft/half mast. So I kept on going and I started to feel a build up at the tip. I kept on going until I orgasm and clear liquid came out. In my penis region it felt like a typical guy orgasm, maybe not as strong though. The rest of my body was completely unaffected (which isn't completely normal (like I would shudder a bit or something but nothing serious or strong)). And immediately after I felt like I could just go on, as if I wasn't exhausted.

So I'm really, really confused here and actually a bid scared. A few weeks a go I was at half mast no orgasm and all of a sudden this. I don't know what my levels are, I was just told over the phone that they were ok. And discussing my blood results (also only several weeks old now) would have been one of the subjects at my next apportionment at my Endo in October. 

I mean I haven't even tried many times to masturbate, only two other times (this was the third time).

I have been taking my Meds as per instructions, with the right dosage, and never missed a day (FYI I'm on estrogen patches and Androcur tablets half per day).

I would call my Doctor, but she doesn't work on the weekends, plus its half past 8 on a Saturday night.

Could this mean that my testosterone is very high, maybe because of being completely hard? Is this something to be worried about? Did anyone ells have a similar experience? Should I hold off on masturbating until either A) I get my Doctor on the phone and or B) my next appointment?

Thank you for your help."
AmIReallyTG,asktransgender,Does this sound like I'm transgender or something else altogether?,"I'm going to be starting hormones very soon and I'm absolutely terrified.

What if I don't like these changes and then I decide to not transition and by the time I decide that it's too late because the changes are already permanent? 


I have created NO END of throwaway accounts on hear over the last couple of years to ask question after question! I think the only way I'd ever be satisfied that I was genuinely transgender is if I could get some kind of test or brain scan that would tell me with ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY! 



I've been to a therapist and I've got a referral letter for HRT. It's becoming very real now that I am actually TRANSITIONING. I thought living as a woman for the past couple of years would be an eye opener but this medical side of it is terrifying. I sometimes doubt (although this has minimised ALOT), I think if I could I would have been assigned female at birth I probably would have been. I struggle with alot of feelings such as not feeling that I think like transgender women, thinking that I am a fraud, etc. 


No matter what people say on hear to me I will be doubting and creating another throwaway account asking another question again eventually!  I even get stupid thoughts like 'if I was a transgender woman I wouldn't sit, talk, etc, like this'. I seem to obsess over the way I want to look in the future, I seem to alienate people around me by talking about my transition, transgender issues, etc, virtually every day.

It's not even full dose HRT. I'm so tired of feeling stuck and like I'm not enough. And, to be fair, I always feel that way about everything. It's not like I had terrible dysphoria, I just feel like there's a chance at something better. I'm just so tired of everything."

GabiCap,asktransgender,"Realization on dysphoria and question on internalizing ""I'm a trans girl"" vs fooling yourself","**Dysphoria Realization**

As I've mentioned before, I have more gender euphoria than dysphoria. When I dress as a girl, it feels right. But in boy-mode I don't hate my body. And that makes me think, sure I want to be a girl, but maybe it's just taking my crosdressing too far.

But today I realized something, let's say I stop dressing as a girl at home, a little part of me will feel terrible passing a women's section in a clothing store. And I'll still hate my body. In fact, I do hate my body.

I hate being overweight. So let's say I lose weight and am a healthy weight.. It still won't feel like the right shape. Part of me thinks I'll still hate it because it's not the right shape or right fat distribution... so maybe I do have dysphoria??

**Internalizing ""I'm a trans girl""**
The things is, I'd love to be a girl, but I don't ""feel like a girl"" while at work and stuff (though hanging out with my girl friends, I feel like one of the girls). And maybe it's because I've had machismo raised into me (been thinking a lot about my parent's roles in my thinking lately) but I can't look in the mirror and think ""I'm a transgirl"" or ""I'm a girl.""

The only time I can say that is when I'm Gabi, and some dysphoria (if you want to call it that) kicks in because I don't look right. But day to day at work I can't say ""I feel like a girl."" But the more I'm Gabi now the more it feels it a bit.

**Final Question**
So here's a question, was it a hard realization for anyone else? Was it hard to say ""I'm not a guy, I'm a girl""?

These feelings are all new to me. They come and go in waves, maybe once a year for a few months, but every wave it feels stronger.

Just don't want to think I'm fooling myself into being trans.

**Addition: Not just an escape?** Another worry I have is that I've been depressed over some family issues lately and being Gabi and crossdressing has helped. Only thing is this time, I'm going deeper and exploring more than just dressing up, so I'm worried it might just be an ""escape"" too."
ChickenCake248,asktransgender,Finding a surgeon for genital surgery ... how do?,"I have been trying to research surgeons for MtF vaginoplasty, but all of the results that I find basically tell me that almost everyone is satisfied.

alwayswandering_,asktransgender,What does gender mean to you?,"Personally I've always struggled to understand the concept. I'm a ( cis ) girl, and I've always felt like a girl because of my body, not really because of my personality or anything, those things have always felt independent of my sex to me. I know gender and sex aren't the same, but I struggle understanding the concept of gender. Is it your mind? Is it just really personal? I'll admit, I've always understood trans women who want to have bodies like women more, than who feel like women, because I don't really know what it means.  "
TallAubrey,asktransgender,Trans dentistry? Before or after FFS,"Hi,

I have a little question on the semantically correct order of things, I'm 3 months into HRT, 3 months into laser, I've just started voice therapy (UK).

So in my mind I was thinking no surgery for at least 2 years to let HRT do it's thing, but my teeth need fixing, they are crooked and not pretty right now, but they can be. So should I wait until after FFS to do them, or can I get them done before and just say make them more feminine?

Thank you, Aubrey x"
ethereal_bitch,asktransgender,Restart social media post-coming out?,"Sooo I have well over 1000+ friends on Facebook.
And almost 1000 followers on Instagram.

I have not come out yet publicly although my close friends know and my other friends/acquaintances are starting to question me.
Here's the thing, I always presented myself as a straight cis-male and I'm transitioning mtf.

I know not everybody will be accepting of my transition, and I'm totally cool with that. Ideally those people will just delete themselves off of my social media accounts. I just want to give people a chance to give a trans person a chance. (My origins haven't always been transfriendly).

Would it be better to just restart my social media accounts after coming out and adding the people are truly cool with me/want to be friends with me?

Sarah6591,asktransgender,What specific blood work do I need to do?,I just saw a Dr who will prescribe HRT and the only thing I need to do is have my pcp order me labs.

I can't afford 30$ to have her just literally tell me what I need ordered. So if anyone could tell me what I need to tell my PCP to order I would be very thankful.

Me

http://i.imgur.com/9xnsrKe.jpg

There's a song that goes:

&gt; I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend.

&gt; You could, cut ties with all the lies, that you've been living in.

This song is one of the things that first drew me to [ex].  We both loved the band.  I could play just 8 notes from the hook, but it was enough to fool [ex] into thinking I was musically gifted.

It's also a thing I think most of us can relate to.  Living a lie at some point in our lives.

So, have I been living a lie?  Not exactly.  For years I've been... ok.  Not bad.  Pretty good.  Bringing [kids] into the world with [ex] was amazing, and they are guaranteed to light up my life every moment I see them.  Even outside that, I didn't have any excuses to be down.

There's been quite a bit of controversy lately about the label ""transgender"".  Pride, beliefs, policies, science.

All those labels, controversies and supposed conclusions have basically zero to do with my experience.  And that experience is all I can tell you about.

For years I've experienced the world as ""Nick"".  By that I mean, I don't know what labels are me, I just know that I am me.  How I see things.

For a long time I assumed that Nick fit into certain boxes -- boy. [Religion]. Programmer. Man.

I don't think that tells the whole story for anyone.  However, for me I really started to notice some problems.  For what I thought represented ""[religion]"", there were in fact my own core beliefs, yet [religion] wasn't a great match for it.  I didn't want to be ""just"" a programmer or a ""just"" a designer.  I had a hard time convincing people I knew anything about both.  I never felt like I became a ""man"" the way people saw it, or even saw me.

I tried to twist back into the boxes.  I'd downplay my design talent and passion so that an interviewer would believe I was a real programmer.  I kept trying to fit in at church.  I tried all the masculine fashions I could think of to see which one felt like ""me"".

The problem was, I had no idea how to be things that made me a good ""man"".  I'd look in the mirror and think ""I _guess_ other people might think this works?""  Nearly everything I did was to fit someone else's model.  And I felt a bit bummed every time I'd notice how *far* my passions, interests, traits, and behaviors were from the ideals and norms.

That's fine, still, that's what everybody experiences, right?

I began to notice that I was very often jealous of women.  I knew exactly what kind of woman I would be.  That's just what attraction is, right?

After all: science.  XY Chromosomes.  Bodies.  Marriage.  Fatherhood.  Friends.  Son, brother.

Here's where it will get difficult for me to explain.

The thing about experience is, you can never truly understand it unless you have it.  That's why expertise takes time.  There is no ""The Matrix"" download.  That's why we aren't born knowing ourselves or the world.  That's why people matter to us.  Why we talk and listen.  There is no formula for transferring a learned experience from one person to another.  There has to be an effort by the giver to turn it into language, illustration, feeling, and the receiver to think, hear, question, experiment, and process from different perspectives.

I've been to hundreds of hours of therapy and spent thousands of hours thinking, studying.  Planning.  Unplanning.  During that time, I realized that none of those things would teach me exactly where to go.

For almost a year I've been working to figure out what *LIVED* experiences actually do fit me the best.  Those that *are* the ""Nick"" box and not just those I was handed when I was born.  One that is perfectly ""me-shaped"".  This was the line my therapist used just before I told her about my questions:

I had just described to her a scene that sounded completely perfect to me, and she said ""So, it is completely 'you'-shaped?""  I thought about the significance of that concept.

Suddenly it was clear.  A box could be ME-shaped?  Really?

At that moment I felt brave enough to start a journey that has brought more clarity and confusion, highs and lows, a hundred other extremes and changes that are impossible to overstate.

During that year this has involved me changing the way the world sees me, instead of just fitting into the world.

As I expressed myself more authentically, It was like one lightbulb after another turned on.  My world has a brand new sense of visibility.  So many new feelings, I didn't know I should or could feel.

I had no idea how rewarding the process would be.  Despite my absolute terror in doing so, embracing what I want the world to see and just saying ""Ok, world.  This is me.  Anyone there?"" -- I finally was able to feel seen.  I wasn't just a fly on the wall any more.  I was a participant.

I recognized at the beginning of this year, that this would involve changes that would throw on its head how I was seen by everyone in my life.  Through an enormous amount of compassion, [ex] showed me she could hear me and I opened up to her.  I hurt her.  She hurt me.  It became turbulence and chaos for both of us that we had no idea if or how we would get through.  We are still trying to come through this, and we're now apart, but stronger as individuals, and as friends.  I believe we are better parents, and though we are not the same family unit we thought we'd go to our graves as before, we are approaching this new phase with courage and integrity.

To be clear: I look different.  I dress like a woman.  I'd rather be seen as a woman.  Yep.  (Am I really?  Don't get me started on labels again...)  This is because part of recognizing what I really was inside me was about showing it to the world.  Growth requires light.

I love my name.  It means ""victorious people"".  It's part of who I am.  Which is why I've gone with Nicole.  It was always a beautiful name to me.  And it turns out that, inside, I feel this is much more closely shaped to me than a ""Nick/him""-shaped box was.

Femininity is a beautiful, wondrous world to me.  So much I don't know, and so much I have always known.  I have no idea why we have gender on top of our sexes.  I don't know how it works.  All I know is that when I get to show the world the femininity inside of me, I feel confident, courageous, beautiful, peaceful, happy, excited, generous, loving, kind, passionate, alive.

[ex] wrote this beautiful, heartbreakingly perfect poem about this experience for her. [removed]

The poem is about him.  The him I'm not.

As she says ""I know you must have always been around from the start, at least in whatever way you could be.""

Sometimes, I was there.  In moments, sometimes captured in an authentic smile on film, with my kids.  In a moment of sheer hilarity.  Those times [ex] and I shared that no other two people will ever understand.

But out in the world, I mostly wasn't there.  I was too scared.  I didn't know myself.

I don't hate ""him"".  There are lots of ""him"" things that are truly me.  The way I showed myself as him to the world was the best I could do at the time.

But now I can smile.  Really smile.  Really laugh.  Cry, dance, and love.  Freely.

There is an amazing song by a band I truly love, Hive Riot.  It's called Undercover:

&gt; There's a prisoner of war.

&gt; Knocking at your door.

&gt; Open up and you will see

&gt; The face is yours.

&gt; Step out from behind the shadows.

&gt; Shake your shame and all your sorrow.

&gt; Take your place and dance out in the sun.

&gt; No one should live undercover. No one is above the other. Freedom is a gift for everyone.

I love the beauty of that video I posted a few days ago, and the accompanying quote:

&gt; ""We are living in a culture entirely hypnotized by the illusion of time, in which the so-called present moment is felt as nothing but an infintesimal hairline between an all-powerfully causative past and an absorbingly important future. We have no present. Our consciousness is almost completely preoccupied with memory and expectation. We do not realize that there never was, is, nor will be any other experience than present experience. We are therefore out of touch with reality. We confuse the world as talked about, described, and measured with the world which actually is.""

This is my ""present"".  I am all at once my past, present and future self.  I am not locked into what I have been, and I have no guarantees about what I will be, but they are all me -- here I am, world!"

How do you think my mental state could change? Thinking about transition makes me happy and for the first time in a long time I feel alive. Sure I'm sad and stressed out but I'm also super excited. Will this feeling of happiness become stronger with HRT?

PeppermintAngel,asktransgender,How has finasteride impact your sex drive?,"Long story short I had my first HRT appointment yesterday  (yay! Time to change my flair) and learned a lot of interesting things, which surprised me, having been dreaming and researching this all my life. 

I've been prescribed with finasteride, which assists spiro as an anti-androgen. I had never heard of this drug before! And I don't see a lot of posts about it on the sub reddit. 

I've read that finas can drastically effect the the sex drive and may even persist after treatment has ceased. This is something I may not be too entirely cool with. I know spiro and estrogen can do the same thing to one's sex drive, but with those I had hope that it would come back ""with a vengeance"" like some people have said. But the verbiage used to describe this on some of these pharmacy papers I received suggested that it has a more serious effect on it.

My main question is has anyone here on finasteride saw an eventual return of a sex drive?"

someone-someguy,asktransgender,Update from after seeing my counselor,"[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/51y92b/i_dont_know_what_to_tell_my_counselor_today_im/) to my original question.

First I would just like to thank everyone for their advice and support. 

So before seeing my counselor I printed out my question and handed it to him. He read it and we began our talk. He is just a typical therapist so he couldn't offer much advice but he did say some things that are very true.

It was nice to hear someone be supportive. All of you are supportive and my best friend is supportive, but actually hearing someone I've come to know as a figure of advice say it really helped to settle down my nerves. 

We both agreed the only way I'll ever be able to shake all the questioning is to transition. If I don't feel it's right I can stop. I think this is the truth. 

We also both agreed that I will probably have to move in order to start. The reason being my family and also just the nature of the area I live in. So now I'm starting to look at cities that are trans friendly. 

This will be something that'll be a while to accomplish. Maybe a year or more. Maybe two, because I sort of want to finish my degree. But being 20 now and realizing I may be 22 before I get a shot at true happiness is a little unbearable. On top of that I'm just going to get farther away from being a woman everyday, and I'm afraid the longer I wait the less of a chance I have at passing.

But for the time being I'm going to call a gender therapist in a city that's about an hour away and see if I can schedule an appointment. What can I expect with seeing a gender therapist? 

So that's that. I really wish I could start today, but I'm still much too afraid of all the close minded people. I just can't bring myself to do it, but knowing that I will at least try gives me a glimmer of hope. 

If anyone thinks I should approach this differently then please say so. 

Thanks again

*hugs*

Lilacbean,asktransgender,Update: Dealing with Social Security?,"This was the original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/511wlg/dealing_with_the_social_security_office_longish/

Someone asked for an update, so I figured I would do so.

Wife got her new drivers license in the mail on Wednesday. I did as someone said and printed out the rules for changing gender on the Social Security website, and we took her birth certificate, legal change of name papers, new drivers license, social security card and the note from her doctor. We waited for over an hour because it was the office downtown and it was *packed*.

Our number finally came up and we were sent to a window with a young, hipster looking guy. We breathed a small sigh of relief because we wouldn't have to deal with someone who was older and typically harder to deal with. We sat down with him and told him what she needed to do. He took her papers and then looked up the rules for the process. He had to get up to go in back to look up some stuff, and dread set in. He came back and said the letter was ""absolutely perfect"" and that it had everything that it needed, but there was ""one problem"" and he asked us about the ND. 

We explained that she was a Naturopathic Doctor, and from what we could tell, she had most of the same credentials as an MD, but her specialty is in solving things with vitamins and whatnot. This was a hang up. He was so nice, and so wanting to help us, but his hands were sort of tied, so we asked to speak to a supervisor. My wife's mood severely tanked and she was resigning to the fact that they just werent going to help her. The Supervisor came over and sat down and went over things with us. We told her the same things we told him. She decided to actually do some digging - she did her homework. He tried to call the Doctor, but their office closed early, so he couldn't reach her. After a while of actually researching on the internet, the supervisor accepted the paperwork.

I started crying. My wife got misty eyed. The guy helping us was telling us that he was so happy that they could help us and that he absolutely didn't want to turn us away.

He pulled up her file in the computer, entered some information, then *handed my wife his mouse* under the little window, and turned his monitor toward her, and *let her change her OWN gender marker*. How amazing is THAT? He filled in the rest of the information - our address and whatnot, then handed her the mouse again, turned the monitor back around and let her hit ""Submit"" on the application. She thought that was pretty awesome.

Overall, there were some hiccups, but because they actually took the time to do some research, things got done. There's another F! Two down, one to go!

Thanks a bunch for all of the advice you kind folks offered. It was much appreciated!"

Did anyone else experience something similar? Thinking about this bugs me because it makes me doubt whether I'm genuinely trans or not. Even then (like pretty much my whole life) I knew there was something ""off"" about me and I've always had this nagging sensation of incompleteness, so there's that and I guess that qualifies as dysphoria, but still. I've noticed that dysphoria comes in waves for me and those waves get more intense the older I get, but I still can't help but feel fake.

""I just want to leave all of this trans stuff in the past and never think about it."" ""I hate when people let being trans define their personality."" The harsh truth is that you can't just force yourself not to think about something... every day turned into a nonstop insecurityfest of worrying about being found out. And then I would feel like shit for thinking about my transness so much! Most of all, I felt like I could never be a real girl unless I hated myself for being trans because I couldn't help but view transgender and real female as mutually exclusive.

Hating yourself is cute for a little while and it might make cis people view you as a little more authentic if they do find out, but it's preventing me from moving on with my life. Self hatred is not authenticity; what is the goal of that path? Deluding myself until I believe I'm cis? lol it's time to grow out of the emo phase (no offense to emos I know yall like to hang out here ;p

People who've been stealth for a long time do you agree I'm on the right path? I'm not gonna start outing myself but if people someday find out then I will be all the happier for it. It's time to stop being ashamed that people on 4chan said my voice wasn't passable when I was 6 or 8 or 11 months into transition- I have improved a lot since then and I hope I continue to improve! And if it comes out a little low sometimes I hope I will learn forgive myself or not care or maybe even be proud of it.

ALso, I'm done putting myself in all these precarious situations with boys and not disclosing because I'm not gonna keep getting away with it and it's not even that validating tbhhh.

kbye19,asktransgender,Just came out on facebook.,"Shaking with anxiety. Anyways how is my post?

""Hello everyone. I have been putting this off for a long time, trying to wait for the perfect moment. Today I realized there will never be a perfect moment to tell all of you this.

 I am trans. Which simply means that I am a woman. I was not going to do this until I was ready to live as myself full time but honestly there's no reason to hide who I am whether or not I start dressing differently yet.

 I will make a new facebook soon and hope we can all still be friends. I know a lot of you will disagree with what I am doing and I respect that. That said, I know who I am and the past year since the start of my journey I have been more happy and stable than ever. So I'm sticking to it.

Thank you for reading this.

MidniteHauntingMoon,asktransgender,In need of advice!,"Hey everyone. 
For the past few years I've identified as genderfluid/noncomforming. Which was always fine, but recently I've been having more ""masculine"" days and more ""no gender"" days, and much much less ""feminine"" days. 
More and more I feel like transitioning on lower doses of t and getting top surgery would make me so much more at peace with myself. 
My problem is this. 
I have quite a few trans friends in my life as well as family, additionally my fiancee is trans. 
I grew up fine with my female-ness. It was only after I opened my eyes and grew into more knowledge that I wondered about my gender identity and if I was truly happy. 
I don't know if I'm taking on a trans identity from all my loved ones around me or if it's truly me. 
I've been talking about top surgery forever. Before I knew my fiancee even. I've been genderfluid just as long. 
I'm just worried if I do transition that people are going to judge me and say I'm just doing it because most of my friends happen to be trans. 
I truly feel that if I had the free option to transition without stigma and judgement I would do it and never look back. 
Am I nuts?"

After all this time, I finally booked my first doctors appointment today and I was EXTREMELY nervous. It can take a while to get on hormones here (Sydney Australia), so the earlier I begin the process the better... but I'm still really scared of how real this all is. I've done my research and chose a trans-friendly doctor who has prescribed hormones before, so if I'm lucky, they might prescribe me hormones while I wait to see a psychologist and endocrinologist to be properly evaluated/prescribed long-term hormones. The doctors appointment is this friday. &gt;.&lt;

Does anyone have any advice on what to do in this first appointment? I've never told anyone in my life about my gender issues, so I'll probably be shaking from being so nervous. I'll be in boy mode (I want to stay in boy mode until the hormones take effect before coming out). What usually happens?

NicoleTheVixen,asktransgender,Any tips for dealing with coming out in the work place?,"So like today I had a SUPER awkward situation where a coworker started asking me questions in the bathroom of a very demeaning nature.

""they let you in here just because you changed your name?"" and as I am walking out a comment about how she wants to use the men's room.

I responded to every single question with, ""Go ask [Hr Reps Name.]"" or ""Why don't you go to HR and ask them"" as my HR rep outright told me I owe no one any explanations. I did email HR so that they would know to expect someone in the morning.

I for the most part don't have issues if I'm out and about around town. No one really thinks twice or bats an eye. New coworkers even before I switched to femme clothes and make up were gendering me female more than 50% of the time it seems like.

Still I am a little shocked with how upset the whole ordeal made me. I stuck to the plan I made with HR which is if anyone has a problem or question, I tell them to ask HR. I'm just not really sure what to do now other than ride it out. Any tips? "

intpsam,asktransgender,Can someone tell us that we're stupid for wanting to try having biological children before my wife (MtF) starts HRT?,"We're not really the most financially stable right now, but I doubt we will ever be truly financially stable TBH. Anyway, she's hoping to start HRT within the next several months and is worried that we'll lose the chance to have biological children because of it. I'm worried too because I want at least one biological child and I know she does too. 

We've been married since 2014 (together since 2012). She's 22 and I'm 21. She's working, but I'm not doing much other than online surveys due to severe anxiety. She wants me to be a stay at home mom anyway because childcare services are expensive af in the US (if we both had jobs, it's likely that nearly all of one income would go into daycare).

So, yeah, we have no idea what to do. Either tell me that we're stupid and shouldn't try for a child or reassure me that we're not being totally selfish by considering it. What would you do in our situation? thanks :')

One solution I hear often is to go through a sperm cryostorage clinic, but that isn't really an option due to the cost, distance of the nearest clinic, and relatively low likelihood that it would actually be successful.

I want to put my best face forward, like anyone, but there are mornings that I'm either running late, tired, just not feeling it, or all of the above, and I'd much rather just get cleaned up, dressed &amp; out the door.

Xenia_Haffordqa,asktransgender,My husband is unaccepting of my daughter [17F]; born [17M] and wants her to go back to being male. Need help coping. (Warning: transphobia in quotes in text; my husband has issues with my daughter's transgender / gender identity),"*Names changed for privacy*

I have a 17-year-old daughter, Phoebe (born Chris). She came out to us in early August as female, no grand announcement or anything like that, and began living as female the week after. He explained he'd known he was female since he was 8 years old and that he was a ""female in a guy's body, a girly speed freak.""

We live in Batley, West Yorkshire.

I am happy my daughter is at peace; when she came out as transgender she told us:

&gt; I'm still the same person you love. New name, old interests; I still like my cars, Formula One, holidays, ten-pin bowling, fashion, as before.

Phoebe wants to wear a bikini, but feels embarrassed about it in public (and wants to hide her male genitalia) and worries about people being transphobic. Incidentally... Phoebe does not want her male genitalia removed.

Phoebe likes bikinis, and said to us she wants a Wickedweasel for her 18th (it's an Australian bikini brand).

Also, Phoebe wants to start taking her driving test but isn't sure how to explain things like being born as male etc. and applying for licences etc. / photo ID?

Phoebe told us she is too scared to go into JD Sports and try on the crop tops and sports bras she likes because she said she doesn't look very feminine yet (she said:

&gt; I look like a butch lesbian when I want to be feminine-looking. I hate that. I want to change it but think I can't.
)

Phoebe's role models for her physical look are Gigi Hadid, Ferne McCann, AJ Michalka and Nell Hudson (are these good role models to emulate?)

My husband is **not accepting of this at all**. He told me:

&gt; ""I'm not having fucking ladyboys in my house, there is no Phoebe, it's Chris fucking us around, don't give me that nonsense, I don't fucking want a ladyboy fag son, I want Chris back. I want him to grow out of this stupidity. He's not transgender, he's fucking us around. I just want my son back.""

My husband refuses to believe our daughter is transgender and it's caused conflict between them (verbal, rather than physical).

He constantly harasses her and insists she should go back to being male, she tries to ignore it and feels frightened of him. They used to get on so well together , were very close and I now feel sad and very worried about my daughter.

Is my husband transphobic or not?

My daughter Phoebe said to me this:

&gt; I'm trans, but into women, same as I was when I was Chris. But I doubt there'll be many feminine women who'll want a transwoman like me, especially one with male nether regions (whcih I'm not getting rid of).

My husband keeps insisting my daughter should present as male 100% of the time, claiming ""People in Batley don't like trannies or transgender people, they hate ladyboys"".

Yet grandma is very accepting of her new granddaughter, so is grandad, and there's no issues there.

This is causing conflict in our family and I don't know how to resolve it.

I sometimes think ""He'll never accept it, even though I read online people say 'He'll soon come round.""

This transphobia is a little out-of-character for my husband, he doesn't normally get this verbally agressive, he's very laid back normally. He's a good man (normally) and I really love him, we've been together since we were 19, married aged 21.

Anyone here been in a similar situation to mine? I need advice from everyone here. Is this an unusual situation or unique one I'm in?

TLDR; Husband not accepting of my daughter (MAAB/male-assigned at birth) and refuses to accept she is transgender and demands she live as a man again."

I woke up this morning and just wasn't feeling it at all. By ""it"" I mean the desire to be female, to have breasts and whatever else. I thought about it and the whole idea just felt revolting. Being male hadn't suddenly become any more appealing, but I've never felt a great deal of animus towards my maleness,p, just a preference for being female instead. The feeling didn't last, by the time I'd finished shaving my legs, torso and face and had a shower I was back on board with ""yep I'm trans"" but I keep getting occasional times when I feel that way, usually when I wake up.

catfusion,asktransgender,(Trans) youth and identity; double standards...?,"How is it that we place an expectation on people at age 13 or 14 to have a very clear idea of what *profession* they want to enter as adults, and start asking the question 'what do you want to be when you grow up?' as soon as they're old enough to understand it, if not sooner, but when it comes to something as basic as one's gender, the attitude is that 'kids that young can't really know what they are.'?

Semi-rhetorical question, but as I'm pondering it myself, I'm putting it up in the hopes that it'll be useful to someone, food for thought, or maybe not so rhetorical after all.

(And yes, there's also the matter that kids whose choices of adult professions are considered 'wrong' are generally discouraged from pursuing them, but no one -doubts- the sincerity of their desire; I've never heard anyone say, ""Oh, you're just *confused* about wanting to be a &lt;whatever&gt;, puberty's a confusing time, I'm sure you'll grow out of it.""

RembrandtsHat,asktransgender,HRT and Diabetes,"For the record, before I go any further I'll just state I'm waiting for my GP to call me back.

So, this is probably the exact opposite of what you think.  I did a lot of research on diabetes before beginning HRT, and the risks involved.  I learned estrogen might even help ease my blood sugar.

Well, yesterday I was dizzy after riding my recumbent bike and I checked my levels.  74 mg/dl.  Yikes.  Almost in the ""low"" category.  Today, I checked it before getting on the bike.  78 mg/dl.  No way I'm exercising.  I ate a piece of bread to get it back up.  Gonna check it again after I finish typing this.

To be honest, I've dropped 35 to 40 pounds this summer.  It's slowed the last month to almost nothing, but in the last few days I've tightened up my eating and decided to move the biking from 2 or 3 times a week back up to 5 or 6.  I was JUST getting started yesterday, though.

I've been on 1000 mg of metformin since August 1st and on HRT since August 9th.

I'm really hoping I just need a cut in the metformin, but can estrogen impact my blood sugar that much?"

PeppermintAngel,asktransgender,What do you obsess over when you're not obsessing over transitioning?,"Transitioning is a very hard thing to do. There are so many steps to take, a super long process, lots of money to be saved, and appeasing to beauty culture can be really stressful (for those who chose too). The list goes on.

But I often hear it's beneficial to still have other things in your life, other pursuits that have goals just so that you can prevent yourself from going insane over trying to be stealth.

Having experienced some of the earliest onsets of HRT (mainly body odor and slower growing leg hairs, but I'm still waiting on those tingly boobs) I've discovered I'm better off by trying to think about being on HRT as little as possible. I'd destroy myself trying to inspect my body over every little change I THINK I see. So when I'm not obsessing over the goal of being a girl full time, I'm working on small projects and such that helps my tiny little twitch channel, and trying to do things to help it grow. Maybe someday I'll make it good like some people, but maybe not, either way it's my other obsession to help keep my mind off how slow it is to reach my other goal.

How about everyone else?"

catfusion,asktransgender,HGH Precursors and Breast Development?,"""The process [of breast development] is mediated by an assortment of hormones (and growth factors), the most important of which include estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and *growth hormone*."" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_development), emphasis mine. There's more in depth sources but Wiki's accessible both in delivery and content, so...) 

HGH or Human Growth Hormone isn't something that's readily available by prescription, in large part due to it being seen as a performance enhancing drug. (And it seems supplements containing HGH precursors are generally marketed as such, i.e., bodybuilding/strength training supplements, although they're also marketed for 'health/anti-aging benefits' and as cognitive enhancers.)

It's commonly held that trans women don't, on the whole, get as much breast development as their cis counterparts, and it's theorized that one of the reasons for this is because HGH levels drop off significantly as we get older (makes sense, huh, that as you stop growing you have less of the stuff that makes you grow? lol) so although there's estrogen and maybe progesterone (and even prolactin because everyone produces this to some degree, and by pretty much the same mechanism) in the mix, the HGH levels are lower during 'second puberty'. (This does beg the question of whether that conceit, that trans women have less development compared to cis women, is accurate.)

In theory, these supplements should increase HGH levels, and if they're herbal supplement hokum, they're probably not really -hurting- anything except your bank balance.

But, since these are marketed to the 'get stronger' (which is often really just the 'get bigger') crowd, I'm wondering if supplements also encourage muscle hypertrophy. That's certainly not something I, or many trans women, or even women full stop, are really desirous of having.

So my question is: **Has anyone tried any of these HGH precursor supplements, specifically GABA and/or Alpha-GPC, in correspondence with HRT?** If so, what was your experience of that?"

I'm also, regrettably, a smoker who has tried (and failed) on multiple occasions to quit. After reading about the effects of spearmint as a weak anti-androgen, say, in the form of tea or in the form of capsules, it was something I wanted to look into as maybe a baby step towards getting things like beard growth under control. After some furious Googling to no avail, I simply want to know: does the anti-androgen effect of spearmint interact with smoking/nicotine intake, and if so, in what ways? For example, if I took 400mg-800mg of spearmint daily, or drank 2 cups of spearmint tea daily, should I cease smoking entirely in conjunction with that? I naturally want to make progress, however small, but I also want to do it in a reasonably safe way. Again, hopefully this isn't too stupid of a question; I'd just rather know than not know."

So in my transition journey one of my goals is to lose as much muscle as possible.

My reasons are my own, and I don't mean to imply that having muscles makes you less of a woman or anything of course.
Anyway, it's been 7 months, according to this chart thing http://i.imgur.com/OBjQy5Z.jpg that muscle loss should have well enough started already, but it's been a while and so far... nothing, almost no muscle loss, especially not in the upper body.

At this point I can't go 2 days without thinking what life would be like as a woman. Am I trans or is this just a temporary fantasy?

throwaaawaaayaa,asktransgender,"I decided I was trans, and now I'm doubting it, but I can't even remember life from before I decided I was trans well enough to feel like I'm truly questioning","Several years ago, I decided I was trans. Since then I've been slowly progressing towards transitioning. Playing around with names and pronouns and haircuts and binders, coming out to peers and professors and friends and family, trying (and failing) to get in contact with therapists. And now that I think I'm really closing in on being able to start HRT... I'm severely doubting myself.

Because I've always been attracted primarily to men. I aesthetically appreciate women, I would definitely engage in a romantic relationship with a woman, but the idea of a sexual relationship with a woman does nothing for me. But I find men aesthetically, romantically, and sexually attractive, so I just consider myself attracted to men. But some nights I end up in tears because I want to be a lesbian and want to be in a lesbian relationship. I try to convince myself that if I were in a relationship with a woman who wanted to get physical, that's something I could/would do. It's not a ""I'm just a lesbian in denial"" feeling, it's a ""I *should* be lesbian, I *want* to be a lesbian"" feeling. 

And I feel emotionally so much more connected to women, and there's probably a fair amount of my anxiety influencing that (including anxiety about not being a ""real guy"" so I could never really be ""one of the guys""), but it's still a feeling that if I lose my sisterhood with other women I'd never be able to make it up with brotherhood with other men because I just don't connect with men.

And some nights I end up in tears because I want to be very femme, and wear folkish dresses and grow my hair long and wear it in braids and have a sweet feminine name and a sweet feminine demeanor and I want to marry a big strong man and *have children* and *breastfeed them* and I get so caught up in this deep desire for a very traditional lifestyle and *motherhood*, overall for *motherhood.* Not fatherhood where I carry the child. I don't want to be a pregnant father. I want to be a *mother.* And I want to at least be able to attempt breastfeeding and the idea of getting a masectomy and not being able to do that *kills* me. I have strong memories of being like 13 and reading a book about pregnancy and raising an infant and thinking that I had inverted nipples (I don't, they're just small) and I would never be able to breastfeed my children and just sobbing on the couch.

But I just don't feel like I *can*, I feel like I could never *be* that because I'm *trans* and so I have to *transition* and be a man.

But today I was on the bus, and a guy on the bus kept staring at me, literally like he'd look around and then he'd look directly at me and then he'd look around but like, I'd look back at him and he wouldn't look away, he was just looking away whenever he felt like, but he wasn't staring into space it was very deliberate, and it was so weird, and I couldn't help but get a flutter in my stomach wondering if I looked androgynous and he couldn't tell what gender I was, cause no matter how hard I try I usually still get gendered female so the possibility that maybe he was questioning it and maybe he would decide I was a guy was just so exciting, I wanted it so badly.

And it still feels right to hear my friends call me he/him, although I guess hearing she/her doesn't feel bad just wrong, but maybe cause I've grown so used to he/him, and sometimes my hand will casually brush my lap and I'll feel my packer and get this deep, gut-wrenching sorrow knowing that there's nothing really there, that it's fake, that I don't really have a penis, and probably never will because the FtM bottom surgery options are both just so non-satisfying to me.

And I remember the feeling of holding such a strong conviction that I was trans, I remember coming to that conclusion and the wave of relief and *joy* it brought me, and I remember holding onto it so fiercely for so long, but now I just feel lost and unsure and I can't even remember what brought me to such a strong conviction in the first place.

Because when I first started questioning, I wanted so desperately to be told I was trans, because I learned about it and I felt very compelled by it, like ""wow that's me, that makes so many things make sense."" I thought I was trans, but I felt like I needed validation, like it wasn't a conclusion I was allowed to come to myself. But I was also so scared of being told ""no you're not trans"", so I would go on trans message boards and tell my life story but I definitely bended things to fit The Narrative(tm) better because I really just wanted people to say ""yes you're trans"", I didn't want to leave any room for doubt. And eventually I realized I didn't need their validation and it was something I needed to figure out for myself and I decided for myself that yes, I am trans. I needed someone to say those words, so I decided it should be me and I said it myself and that was that. But at this point, years after all that, the lies I told trying to get validated have become so emblazoned into my brain that I don't feel like I really remember what my life was like *before* I decided I was trans. I'm pretty sure I remember what stuff I tweaked, but I don't remember what it was really like pre-tweaking, how much I exaggerated.

I feel like the biggest thing that I didn't have to tweak at all was a *constant* need to exist in male roles. Playing pretend games with friends (both when we'd make up our own characters/scenarios and when we'd act out characters/events that already existed, because the guy characters *were me*), creating online avatars or video game characters, performing in theatre, being on the guys' team in sports or when classroom activities were divided by gender, even sometimes through occupying stereotypically masculine positions like my choice of instrument in band so that I would be included when my band director referred to my section collectively as ""gentlemen"", etc. It wasn't a desire, I might not even call it a *need*, it's just the way things were. I *had* to be a guy, one of the guys, for *everything*, and anything else just wasn't an option. And that still rings very true for me.

And for all these years ""I am trans"" has become so solidified in me that even trying to think about the stuff I didn't mess with my memory of feels very... dissociative? I literally cannot genuinely remember my life as my life from before I decided I was trans. I can only view it through a trans lens or through a ""that's not me that's some other person"" lens. 

At this point I don't entirely remember really what led me to feel so strongly connected to the idea of being trans, or my conviction that I am. I really only remember the feelings of certainty, not so much the rationale behind them.

And I'd like to talk to a gender therapist about all this of course, but there's also this terrible fear for me or being denied or even just delayed hormones because I'm doubting. Like I doubt so hard sometimes but I still feel like I need to transition and don't ever want anyone irl to know I'm doubting but then they'll doubt me. If I went to a therapist now I would not tell them about my doubts. I would not be comfortable doing that. I would tell them the same lies I made up to convince internet strangers I was undoubtedly trans, so that they would give me hormones quickly, so that the choice to transition, to actually fill that prescription, take those hormones, *keep* taking those hormones, would be *mine.* Maybe if I had my hands on an irrevocable prescription for T I would be comfortable talking about my doubts, but the idea of being *denied* hormones is just so viscerally terrifying that I would certainly go out of my way to lie, even bend my story *more*, to avoid it.

And I don't even know why. Because I want to be a guy and grow a beard and have a deeper voice and experience brotherhood with other guys, but I also want to be a woman and present very femme and be a breastfeeding mother with lots of children and experience sisterhood with other women.

I feel like I could lay out a very good argument for me being cis and also a very good argument for me being trans, and I feel like at this point the main reason I'm going to trans route is because I committed myself to it years ago, and because the cis route just doesn't feel possible.

Understandably many communities are increasingly accepting of those who are transgender, thus we see it represented more in society but how common is it?

I think because my friend came out to me it has me wondering if this is just a very common matter with humans. I live in Los Angeles and frankly I see transgender people all the time. I don't necessarily think it's an accurate representation of the whole... but maybe it is?"
JacksonEM,asktransgender,Ever regret transitioning?,"I've been transitioning for almost two years on hormones. FtM, lately I've been stressing a lot. A lot of it may have to do with the acceptance of taking on a new social identity. Some of the stressors I have may not be associated with transitioning. I don't reallly know what's wrong with me but I'm starting to regret my transition to being a ""man."" Has anyone here ever experienced a period of depression and regret, perhaps grieve over their decision to transition? I hope that what I'm experiencing is only temporary and common amongst people who've transitioned. I'm starting to bald and I'm definitely not (yet) as attractive as a man as I was a woman. I miss the attention and sex I experienced as a woman with other women. I miss being strong and sensual at the same time. I liked to a point what hormones did to my body, I never liked having curves, never liked having breasts. I hope this is a phase and maybe just me being depressed. "

One suggestion is talking about this with the whole group but don't know how that would work with teens who joke about everything.

Dr_Hal_Emmerich,asktransgender,Straight male who wants to date trans women,"I'm a 27 year old straight male who would like to have sex/date a transgender woman, but not really sure how to go about this. I've always been attracted to women for as long as I can remember and have no interest in men. I'm quite open and adventurous to anything really and I even tried to watch gay porn to see if it interested me, which it didnt. But for some reason I'm really turned on by a woman with a penis. For many years now I've watched trans porn (along with normal porn) and had numerous relationships with women, however I would love to have sex with a trans woman and touch and feel a womens penis at least once. While I have never told anyone about this I am quite happy to admit this to myself and feel no shame. 
My first question is how do I go about doing that? Are there any genuinely good dating sites out there? Should I frequent certain bars? Find an escort even? 

My concern is that a real life experience may be disappointing. I realise that many trans porn photos are often heavily airbrushed and edited. I won't lie in admitting I only find the super feminine looking girls (i.e. With breasts, bum and hips) attractive, which I realise is pretty shallow. 

P.s while I am primarily only looking for causal sex I have no intention of using or hurting anyone emotionally"

I can tell it's not really affecting her, she just keeps saying that she's glad she knows their true feelings and she's glad she knows how disgusting they are but honestly I'm really hurt and just hate the fact that people are transphobic. I don't want to bring up the fact that her family hate me because I know there's nothing she can do but I also feel like this is hurting me and I shouldn't have to deal with it alone. I also don't know if I should leave her and keep her relationship with her family okay. I don't know what to do."
Blairnatalie,asktransgender,anyone else notice an increased sense of smell?,"Good morning! 

Has any other transfem people noticed an increased sense/sensitivity of smell? I'm currently 4.5 months in, my mood is getting back to normal, and I now sit in the prefered ranges. Along with the onset of changes from a higher dose a month ago, I've noticed my sense of smell is way more sensitive towards certain things. One of them being men, which is fine if they smell nice. However men that aren't super hygienic, and that smell like BO literally make me want to vomit somewhere lol. Before it wasn't like this, and now I totally understand my girlfriends fear of bad smelling people ��

Yay Estrogen!"
TheLandofYellow,asktransgender,I don't know what to do. I feel so lost and distraught and vulnerable,"Okay so this is going to be a rambling post because it's so goddamn late but I can't sleep and I feel like shit and I think I'm going to cry.. I don't even know where to begin but I guess i'll just get right into it. 

I've been questioning my gender really seriously for around 4+ years. But before that time i've always just felt..off. I remember when I was younger I would always google ""cost of SRS"" and ""I want to be a girl"" and other things just to see if i was alone in feeling this way. The cost I always got was somewhere around ~50,000 and I don't know how accurate that is but I would think to myself that I'd save the money and do it. This was when I was between the age of 8-12ish And eventually it blossomed into different ways of exploring transgenderism such as reddit and youtube. I've met some great people and it's nice to know i'm not alone! But it doesn't help the fact that I don't wanna go on like this anymore. I actually came out to my parents at 18 and my Mom was generally pretty supportive. She supported  me getting therapy and she didn't seem like she'd love me any less. My dad though, he kept saying ""This is probably just a phase. You're too young. How do you know?"" And I told him that it couldn't be a phase! I've felt this way for YEARS. It doesn't seem to ever go away. I want to be a girl so fucking bad. Long story short that therapist was not one who specialized in gender issues. She focused more on my marijuana smoking more than my gender issues. When I  first came to her she had no idea what gender therapists even do let alone how to deal with my issues. So I guess that was just the wrong therapist

That was two-ish years ago. I'm 20 now and the feelings are still there. Stronger than ever! (TOLD YOU DAD!) I haven't really even mentioned it to my parents since then though. I'm scared to bring it up again honestly. :/ Also some part of me is well.. I'm afraid that somehow i've got myself believing I'm something i'm not for whatever reason. We all have those doubts, yeah? :( What do I do about them? 

Something that always makes me feel good is when I play an RPG or other game. Any game that lets you customize a character; I always pick the female option, and I always have. It makes me feel good when the characters call me ""ma'am"" and It just feels better to me to play as a girl. My brother always asks ""Why do you ALWAYS pick girls?"" I always dodge the question. I don't want him to know, not at all. Not yet! 

I don't really know what dysphoric symptoms i show but my nipples are kind of hairy and looking at myself in the mirror with a shirt off makes me really upset. I hate my penis, that I do know. Not enough to cut it off, never had the urge! But I hate knowing that it's there dangling between my legs. I hate it constantly reminding me of my ""male-ness"" and it taunts me almost.. I've dressed in my sister's clothes before as well and i really liked it. I shaved my legs once with her razors in the bath and loved feeling my smooth legs, i think my body hair is a big dysphoria thing for me. Is that common? 

I feel like there's so much more that i'm leaving out. But it was nice to get this off my chest. It's been eating at me for a while and I wanted to say something.

Thanks for reading, If you have any advice or positivity please send it my way as I could really use a lot of both. 

I also should probably make a throwaway account for this post but I have zero fucks to give right now.

OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,"I'm considering going to my school counselor. Has anyone else ever talked to a high school counselor regarding their issues? If so, how was it?","All this time I thought I had no one to talk to. But then after speaking with a friend, I realized that DUH my school had a guidance counselor! 

I've never actually spoken with her outside of stuff involving classes and tests, but she seems really nice. And I ABSOLUTELY need someone to talk to. I realize that Counselors aren't Therapists, but considering I have no access to a real therapist, this is the next best thing.

I have to see her regarding Scholarships soon, and I was thinking of dropping a bug in her ear and seeing if I can speak to her once in awhile in my downtime at school. 

The only thing is that my school is in a conservative area and the counselor isnt extremely young, so I can't guess her stance on LGBT things and I'd be amazed if there were ever another Trans Kid who attended my school.

But I really need someone to talk to because im liable to have an emotional outburst at school any time.

So, I know this sub mostly consists of 20/30 year olds, but has anyone here ever spoke with a counselor regarding their gender issues? If so how was it?

And, should I go for it?"
Cuteness_Everdeen,asktransgender,"Cis wife of MtF, six months hrt and she wants to find a way for PiV. NSFW","So my wife and I have been together six years now. There have been no issues with us with her transition, I adore her more than life itself (literally yay clinical depression). Sex has been awesome, I even got a two sided toy and have topped her often.

Lately though she says she misses topping me. I think it's less she regrets transitioning and more she really knows it turns me on and misses how it feels.

Anyway, she was curious about extenders (but at this point she's pretty soft even fully aroused so idk?) and I was curious if anyone had tips on, perhaps a strap on that she could use without discomfort considering her anatomy? Or a way she and I could give her that feeling again.

She's diabetic and I'd rather avoid viagra or something similar (if that even works?)."
[deleted],asktransgender,I have a work friend who's told several people around the office that I'm trans... today I came out to my boss to talk about it.,"I am a year and change post-op, full-time for two years, and started a new job in February '16 at a very LGBT friendly place in a very LGBT friendly city where no one knew me before transition. 

Not long after I started one of my co-workers (we'll call her S) clocked me; we talked about it, and I asked her to keep it between us, but I know for a fact that she's told at least 6 people around the office who, as far as I can tell, have kept their mouths shut about it, but it's only a matter of time before she tells the wrong person, and the rumors start flying.  

The last straw for me was this past Friday.  My friend (S) and I, another established co-worker (let's call him T), and a new-hire (let's call him A) were out to lunch, and out of nowhere S and T started talking about TransStuff™, and a particular popular comedian who's known for being a chaser.  The comments included the *T-word™* among others, and also the sharing of a web article about the the comedian.   Meanwhile I'm just getting increasingly depressed and withdrawn, and A is visibly shocked/uncomfortable with the conversation; he just couldn't believe what he was hearing from these two. I left early Friday because I was just too upset to focus at work the rest of the day.  

Today I went to my boss, and came out to him; gave him a little background about how things went down at my previous job - *spoiler, I was fired* - and said that while I don't want anyone to get in trouble I **do** want S to stop telling people before the rumor mill starts churning (though it may already be too late), and I don't want to have to endure another conversation like that with my co-workers at lunch. 

It looks like the best way forward here is to just talk to S one-on-one and ask her to stop, but on the other hand when she and I first talked about it I had asked her to keep it to herself, and we see how well that worked out.  So I asked my boss to be there when I talk to her so that she understands that she can't just ignore me and do what she wants anyway like she did the first time - she needs to understand that what she's doing is a problem, and that it's a serious one, and that the company isn't going to tolerate it. 

I may lose a friend out of the whole deal, but a friendship without trust isn't a friendship; it should never have gotten to this point in the first place, I never should have been put into the position of having to come out to my boss to deal with it in the first place.  I'm really hopeful that this doesn't blow back in my face, but it's a risk I have to take.

LorenaDal2016,asktransgender,Thought on the best way to do the HRT?,"I was curious how other people have done it. I am currently on 2 mg of estrogen and 200 mg o spironolactone (to be increased to 300 soon). My testosterone has dropped considerably and by now should be close to target (was 73 at 150 mg of spironolactone and my free testosterone had been educed by 90%) . So now I am on a higher dose and the dose will increase within the next 2-4 weeks to 300 mg. 

I have seen that some girls take 4-6 mg of estrogen but are on relatively low doses of spironolactone and other do the opposite.

Any idea what is better? I thought that suppressing testosterone as much as possible would make sense as it would allow estrogen to work better. I also thought that it would allow lower doses of estrogen to translate into higher levels. I am only on 2 mg of E orally and certainly would like to be on a higher dose, and have read comments of girls with much higher levels, specially after shots

What is your experience on this. And which one do you thinks is the best approach: bring down testosterone as much first or try to push estrogen up even without adequate testosterone suppression?"
ta3183237,asktransgender,How do I stop believing that everyone is pretending?,"I'm sure this question is asked a lot on here, but I'm still not sure how to deal with it.
As far as I can tell, practically, I pass 100% of the time. I get compliments on my voice, hair, appearance from people who, as far as I know, don't know I'm trans.
I also know that it's ridiculously unlikely that people will just pretend for the sake of my feelings, but there are plenty of my friends who used to pretend when I was still transitioning and figuring things out. They would compliment me even though I knew I didn't deserve it because they're good friends who care about my well-being. I'm not sure that anyone I know would be completely honest about this if it meant hurting my feelings. 
At the end of the day, I'd like to pretend that it doesn't bother me, that I am who I am and I'm wonderful that way or whatever, but in all honesty, it's not something I'm comfortable with. 
Does anyone have any flaws to point out in my thinking? Or any reassurances, suggestions, or thoughts?

transthrowawayyylmao,asktransgender,"I'm so confused. It's all just so subjective, so up in the air, and how can I trust my own feelings, and I how can I remember my own feelings, and how can I trust my own memories?","I can't say I thought of myself as a boy as a kid, or I guess really ever, in a definitive sense. Not ""I am a guy"", but at times ""I should be a guy.""

I wouldn't really say I was ""one of the guys"" either; most of my friends have been girls (though I'm chalking that up at least partially to anxiety), and I have always always always preferred pretend games, whether playing them physically or with toys. But I also always always always had to play a guy. In Titanic I was Jack. In Spirit I was Spirit. In Maximum Ride I was Fang. When we played house I was the dad. In every game where we created our own personas, I always created a guy. In class, when we read scripts or dialogue-heavy books aloud, I would fight for a male part. It was the role I felt I should play.

And I had this idea in my head for a long time that I would grow up to be Steve Irwin. Not a conservationist or a zookeeper like Steve Irwin, but a large Australian man like Steve Irwin. I mean, I knew it wasn't true, but I still felt it.

And I've always had a very strong sense of aesthetic, a desire to fulfill a specific look. And as a young teen I was way into emo and scene. And I connected with it *because* of the guys, because I saw scene kings like Alex Evans and thought ""that should be me."" But of course, I was a girl, so I couldn't be Alex Evans,  so I settled for Jac Vanek instead. And I embraced it very wholly. I lamented when my body wasn't right, wasn't feminine and pixie enough to fit the look, but also that my eyeliner would never be guyliner, that I had to go for the long hairstyles instead of the short ones.

And over time, though I still love that scene, a vintage style started to appeal to me. I think on that front the feminine side definitely appealed to me more, because for men it was just so much less distinct. So I embraced the dresses and skirts and hose and heels, the full face of makeup with the red lipstick and the impeccably curled hair, I even corseted for a while trying to get the right shape, and I liked it, I loved it, because it was so aesthetic. I looked like something. But I'd still see pictures of guys from the fourties and wonder why I couldn't pull that off, why *that* couldn't be my aesthetic.

But for some reason curling my hair every day fried it a lot worse that straightening and dying it, and my hair just started to give up. So I thought, alright, some people pull of the vintage look with pixies, I'll just cut it all off. And the second I looked in the mirror and saw myself with short hair, it was like something clicked. And I went back to my t-shirts and jeans and sneakers and hoodies, but it wasn't enough. And around the same time some of my friends were taking AP Psych, and they learned about being transgender, and they told me all about it, and I thought ""Jesus that's sounds like me."" So I bought a binder, and I bought a packer, and they both just made me feel so much better, and I don't feel like I need to fit an aesthetic anymore because my aesthetic now is *me.* Dirty jeans with a bulge in the front and a-little-too-small t shirts hugging a binded chest, ratty vans and short swooshy hair, it's just me. But even just looking it isn't enough, because I want everyone to call me he/him and some masculine name like Milo or Seth, and every step I take forward the better I feel.

But then I also feel ingenuine. Because I still do like dresses and makeup; they were a hobby for a long time and I still think they're fun. And I still talk like a girl, very feminine word choices and stress and tone patterns and all, and no part of me wants that to change. 

And I don't hate my body. I guess in clothes and all I prefer having a flat chest, but when it's just my body I don't mind my breasts, and think I might even miss them. They're a part of me. 

And I think I'd feel a lot better if I had a dick. I have nothing against what I've got going on down there right now, but I think I'd prefer the other option. The only thing about my body I've felt that I might describe as dysphoria is those little moments when I drop my hand on my lap, or it rubs against my leg, or any other sort of contact with my packer that reminds me it's not real, that I don't really have anything there.

But I guess I don't feel this as wholeheartedly as I like to. Because I didn't really think of myself as anything but a girl for 17 years, and I'm bi (well, I'm physically into guys but romantically into girls, so bi in practice) but I've always preferred being in lesbian relationships, and not even just in the sense of being in a relationship with another girl but also in celebrating being two girls together. And I don't feel like one of the guys; I have guys friends, but I've never particularly connected to guys. I feel connected to women, I feel a sense of comfort and belong with women, I feel a sense of sisterhood, and I know if I transition I'll lose having that, because obviously women won't view me as their sister because I'll be a guy.

I know I'm not just a confused butch lesbian because I definitely am physically attracted to men, and I know that when I think of myself in isolation I am much happier thinking of myself as a guy, but when I think about the larger context I worry that if I actually transition I'll be unhappy and lonely because I've never really been able to connect with men and I'll lose my ability to connect with women.

And there are definitely times (usually nights) where I think I want to go back to just wearing dresses and makeup and being a girly girl and forget this whole trans thing, but I'm out to so many people at this point (including family) that I would be absolutely *mortified* to detransition, and I can't let my dad think he was right when he said it was a phase, and there are definitely other times that I can't even believe I'd ever doubt myself like of course I'm trans I should be a guy, etc., and that's not even getting into when I find myself super attracted to a girl and suddenly want to go back to she/her and all just so we can be lesbians together , and I'm just all over the place and NOTHING IS DEFINITIVE.

I'm so confused, and I have been for a couple years at this point, and I've still never been able to find a therapist to has h it out with. "
MADmaroi,asktransgender,Does being the sex you want to be in a dream mean anything? (Story in description &amp; share your dreams too),"I had just had srs and it was great (in the dream ofc), I didn't try  my new gear out as much as the last dream but this one i could see it and it looked quite good, ;) but a better thing is that there was no recovery time, as we somehow appered on holiday right after it was done. Most of my close family and some people from my class were there and it was strange because everyone just accepted it, except for one person from my class that I know would say something and he did, 'your a freak' or something or other like that. But it was jokingly &amp; didnt even worry me so we kinda laughed it off as it wasn't a serious threat. Kinda strange right. I was running aground mad asking people where I had got it done &amp; if it was in Thailand, because that's where I wanted to go and not some local surgeon from my country that would f it up or give sub par results, like I would have flipped out. I finaly got an answer and it was.:)

I've heard that if someone tells you they're trans, and you have had no idea, that it's offensive to say that you had no idea and wouldn't have known.

I accept that, and am not here to argue against that! I just don't understand why it's offensive. Would saying ""oh, you totally pass"" be offensive too? In my mind, they mean the same thing, and I wouldn't want to say that if it's just as offensive as ""I wouldn't have known"".

I tried going to the informed consent clinic (Sidney Borum for those of you that know it), but I've chickened out at their doorstep like... four times now.  All I can remember is that time in freshmen year I tried coming out to my mom and her blowing the f#$% up.

I know she'd eventually get over it, albeit incredibly, incredibly slowly, but I'm living with her still, and I just... I don't know what the next step to take is.

If any of y'all have any advice, I'd appreciate it."

Everythingsucksugh,asktransgender,Everything feels horrible,"
Everything feels horrible right now. I dont know what to do, everything is difficult. This gender dysphoria is really to much and is crippling practically everything . I'm sulking in my bedroom all day, I have a bunch of things due but it doesnt matter anymore to me.  My grades are plummeting, i'm nearly crying everyday and i wish I could just dissapear to not deal with this anymore. I dont feel happy with associating as a woman but i feel the same way with associating as a man or nb. Nothing feels right. I try to block out the thought of gender entirely sometimes, but it's nearly everywhere. It feels isolating seeing everyone  okay with their identities and not feeling haunted by this feeling. I feel like whichever path I choose this horrible feeling will never go away and it doesnt help that  my parents are already transphobic as is. Will there ever be a resolution to this gut wrenching feeling I feel or will I just sulk forever at this point. I'm sorry for bringing my little rant here in such a positive area, It just kept piling up and i just needed to let it out."

Malarkay79,asktransgender,Accidental insensitivity,"So I'm ftm, closeted, pre-everything, which makes me feel worse about this incident.

I'm working full time at a fast food place at the moment, a super early shift so I can have the afternoons free to hunt for a better job.  The only problem is that I'm a night person, and try as I might I have still not adjusted to the new schedule after two months.  So I'm running on about four hours of sleep a night, which leads to me being pretty tired and, well, not very mentally sharp towards the end of my shift.  

So I'm working drive-thru and I take an order, and the customer sounds like a guy.  Where I work, we have a double drive-thru line, which can make things confusing as customers can get out of order as they pull up.  So there's only two customers in line at the time: my customer, and another in the other lane whose order was taken by a coworker.  

I finish taking my customer's order first, and they pull up to the window. Without really looking at them at first, I begin to repeat their order to confirm, and look at them halfway through to gauge if I'm correct or not, and it's a woman.  So I trail off, confused, because I'm not sure how the other customer managed to cut in front of mine.  Baffled, I click my screen back to look at all the orders, while for some inexplicable reason loudly proclaiming, 'Who *are* you?'  

That's when my customer spoke up and said that that was indeed their order I was repeating back, in the voice I recognized, and I take a closer look and realized yeah, they're trans.  So I kind of laughed at myself and took their money and felt like a giant idiot for completely botching the entire interaction.  I have been dwelling on it since yesterday.

So hey drive-thru customer, if you're out there, I am so sorry if I made you uncomfortable in any way.  I am a sleep deprived, socially awkward idiot.

i-cant-think-of-name,asktransgender,Haven't really seen changes in the last 7 months on hormones,"I've been on spiro and E patches for the past 13 months, but I only saw changes in the first 6 months, when my endo ramped me up to E=220pg/mL.


He thought that was too high so he halved my dosage. My boob soreness went away over the course of 2 days. My E level fell immediately, so a month later I was put back onto the previous dosage. However, my E levels never went back to previous levels - now they remain at 120pg/mL. Boobs haven't been sore since then.


Is 120pg/mL too low? Were there any consequences for being at this low level for 7months? I'm kinda panicking that I lost 7 months of potential growth -_- but I'm also not sure if it's normal to not see any changes between month 6 through month 13.

__its_only_me__,asktransgender,Dealing with Terfs?,"The two friends that I came out to first, who have been so supportive, who are both very educated about gender things and social justice issues and whatnot, came out of the woodwork as basically terfs. It started with them asking tentative questions. About my thoughts on how it made sense for me to be a girl. About how I feel about the way I identify. Not sure how relevant it is, but both consider themselves to be agender, without gender, etc. They don't have a particular label they like.

Was conversing with one of them and kept pushing them to flesh out their questions even more. This escalated to them revealing that they thought that what I was doing was extremely sexist, because I was reinforcing sexist stereotypes about women and that I should not go so overboard with my gender performance. (Which I'm not. I want to wear a dress, because I've never done so before and I've always wanted to. I want to grow my hair out because I like the idea of having long hair. So I happen to like colors that are traditionally more feminine.)

They don't, however, limit their critique of gender to just trans people. They proceeded to bash on some of my other friends for *wearing clothes that they feel comfortable wearing*. God.

Their main question for me was how they could respect my identity without having to be sexist. Because apparently respecting my identity in all of the ways I'd like them to means they'd have to superimpose sexist stereotypes on me. Which isn't true, but that's how they see it.

A little later, my other friend reiterated friend number one's ideology.

Anyhow, I don't know how to address this. Any help is greatly appreciated."

So I get home each day, and I run the scenarios through my head. Explaining myself to my therapist, starting hormones, coming out to my family, trying to pass as female. I need to stop worrying about all of these things but my anxiety just cripples me.

I could really use a smile right now, a nice story of someone else's transition that made their life better. Something to put a smile on my face and a tear to my eye. It can be the littlest thing, it doesn't matter. Just something to remind me that it's not all doom and gloom.

The problem being I am really worried about it. She is pansexual so shes fine with me having a penis but I am pure lesbian. I am really afraid of having sex with someone with a penis. I personally don't want to do anal, receiving or giving, it just seems unclean, and I'm not to interested in doing oral because, well I don't like penis.
And to make it worse she is way more experienced than I am, having had around 8 girl/boyfriends before me, and I am still a virgin. I was thinking I could just wait till her or I have SRS surgery because I feel like Ill be ok with penetration if I have a vagina, but I also wan't to feel sex with a penis before I loose it.

debraMckenz,asktransgender,7 years since transition: Not as stealth as I want to be,"This is kind of a diary entry I wrote the other day:

Realization today.

FFS. Voice. These things are on my mind lately because frankly it's come to my attention that I don't quite pass like I want to....like I thought I had....over the years. The word and concept of 'passing' is annoying but it's still a fact that I want to be seen (and heard) as a woman....not a man, not trans.

Living in the seattle area, working for open companies, dealing with mostly friendly people, I've had really good circumstances that have led to me believing ignorantly that I 'pass'.

I mean sure, the average person on the street probably doesn't give me a second look. Anyone on the phone, at a coffee shop, or at the grocery store wouldn't question my voice either.

But start hanging around me and you might start to see and hear things. In pictures I'm pretty photogenic and good about angles but if you catch me at a bad angle or in a profile shot, you'll notice the masculinity in my face....or 'strong features' as one designer told me as he rejected my casting for his modeling show. Ironically , walking back to my car after that casting, in downtown Belltown in the dark (with a skimpy dress and heels), a guy in a big truck started yelling at me 'You're a BOY! what are you doing? You're a BOY!' as I hurriedly walked to my car. I'm not sure if I was more scared or humiliated by that experience.

Introductions and casual chitchat, my voice sounds normally feminine but catch me upset, talking technical, or even just lazy and comfortable and you'll hear it drop in both resonance, pitch, and inflection. If I'm excited or happy , things are fine but again if I'm sad or empathetic the same voice changes occur. You might also hear a difference if we're at a club or if I'm intoxicated.....and my coughing and sneezing and throat clearing are particularly masculine sounding.

Cosplaying and modeling through the years, I've had a handful of people question whether I was 'a man' or 'trans' or 'in drag'. Some have said it was the broad shoulders and big biceps, others the voice, still others the 'wig and lashes' which....well that's just cosplay.

The last two jobs, I've felt pretty safe. At one, I never told anyone about my past and it was my first job where they never knew me before transition. So it was surprising to me, 1.5 years into the job, when a friend at work told me someone had been spreading rumors about me that I was a 'transvestite'. He had the term wrong but his inclination about my past was on the right track and I was surprised that I wasn't quite passing like I thought I was. I brought it up with HR and it became entangled in me leaving that company.

For a while there, at the gym, I felt pretty good. I met up with my personal trainer for coffee to hear her life story and I ended up coming out to her. She seemed to have guessed already and she mentioned that some other staff member at the gym had asked about me being trans or a crossdresser or something weird. I was very sad to hear that.

At one point at the gym, I felt confident in my stomach enough to not wear tank tops and show my midriff. This pretty much stopped when one day I walked by a personal trainer and he kinda flinched as he saw me. To this day, i don't know if he flinched because of my midriff or because of my 'transness'. Either way I stopped showing my midriff at the gym.

I started at a new company and again I told no-one. I made friends with people outside of my team and we hung out outside of work. There were times I suspected some of them knew....little signs they gave off. Not questioning when the subject of not being able to have kids came up.

My friends Gail and Kyle were probably some of the only people I ever felt like maybe didn't know...and Gail confirmed it when I told her.....she took everything I had said at face value and I love her for it. But telling her about my past did cause a lot of things to fit together better about my past for her. And unfortunately since telling her, I've felt like I share more trans stuff with her than anybody (except maybe my hubs) and I kinda hate myself for it. Why can't I just let that go and move on? 

The other thing about telling someone close to me is it opens up MY thoughts and worries about what they must be thinking now that they know. Even if they're accepting. I mean is it weird that I'm in the locker room with them? Same restroom as them? Changing in front of me? The problem with telling people nowadays (even if / esp if they are supportive) is MY OWN INSECURITIES about them knowing. =/

Kyle on the other hand had always asked weird questions about my name being the one I was born with. That was such an early time in our friendship and at that job such that I lied and said 'of course!' and changed the subject. He seemed to take things at face value as well even though he'd poke at my story here and there in his curiosity. When I came out on Facebook to close friends, he did ping me and ask some questions (even tho I had asked people not to).

Anyway, what is my point? I guess I'm starting to feel like the past 5 years since I had vaginoplasty and went 'stealth' , stopped talking about transition and moved on......I have not been as 'stealth' as I had thought or hoped. And that's increasingly depressing. I'm trying very hard not to let it throw me off my game but it is quite difficult.

**TL;DR: I'm hoping that FFS will help smooth out some 'strong features' on my face but I increasingly need to improve on my voice. I'm stealth to most around me but once you get to know me better, you end up seeing (and hearing) signs of being trans. The 6 months of training I had at the start of transition is just not enough to be the person I want to be......and present how I want to be seen and heard.**"
throwaway124578919,asktransgender,Pre-op girlfriend is far better endowed than me and it kinda bothers me.,"So 23 Male here. Since a long time I've been dating this superb girl. She's funny, intelligent, attractive and so on. I'm truly having a blast with her.

Now I knew beforehand she was pre-op, something that didn't bother me much, until we had our first time. I'm a bit disgusted by myself to allow myself to be so affected by this. 

Thing is I've always been a little insecure about my penis size, but never to the point like I feel now. She has a bigger penis, which wouldn't be such a problem if the difference between us was small. But it isn't; she a lot bigger than me, which sort of makes me feel emasculated...

I know it's all on me! I shouldn't be so affected by it but it simply does. I was wondering if people have similar experiences or have thoughts and ideas that can help me build confidence.

EDIT: I asked them what pronouns they prefer at the end of the course, and SHE/HER pronouns are the preferred choice despite identifying as a trans male. "
Drumada,asktransgender,I overcame my final hurdles and I feel so much better :),"So about a month ago I finally came out to my rather large extended family. It went a lot better than I expected and everyone was surprisingly supportive. Still, a lot of old acquaintances or extended friends did not know. This weekend we went camping at a local campground and although I didn't plan on dressing en femme, I totally packed a bunch of my clothes anyway. Long story short, I ended up dressing en femme the entire weekend and it went great! My dad didn't say anything to me and neither did any of our other campers. I was feeling so good in fact, that I decided to celebrate this labor day weekend by coming out on facebook.

It was a tedious process, since I ended up using a mouse and keyboard attached to my phone while requesting the chrome desktop site, but I managed to type up a lengthy coming out post as well as posting a bunch of pictures of me over the years. It went really well, and so far i've gotten nothing but good responses from people! Maybe some people have problems with it, but no-one has made it a point to tell me about it. I dont often use facebook but all weekend ive been checking it non-stop with constant glee waiting to see what else people have to say.

I even feel better about myself after doing so. It used to be that when I was dressing as a girl, I still always felt a little awkward because I dreaded running into someone and having to have that awkward discussion. Now that i'm past that, I can't believe how much better I feel. Sometimes I even felt like the elephant in the room, even around those who supported me. For reasons beyond my explination, sometimes I still felt like I was wearing a costume. For whatever reason, that feeling is completely gone.

After all this, I decided it was time to get over that hurdle at my new job as well. I had already basically told just about everyone but I was still presenting male. Today I sit here in my cube (waiting to get moved to my actual cube out on the call center floor) in full girl mode and nothing bad has happened. No weird looks, no odd questions, hell I even used the womens restroom twice already with no issues. I hear plenty of stories about things not going well for people, and I understand my narrative doesnt match everyones, but right now I feel better than I have in years. So I want to let everyone who has reservations about presenting as themselves to know one thing: I cant promise everyone in your life will react as well as this, but the feeling of just being yourself without reservations is a feeling I can only describe as *true comfort*. I feel at peace with myself in a way that I haven't felt in years and I am only excited about what the future can bring!

I hope everyone here had as great of a labor day weekend as I did, whether you overcame any life hurdles or not :)
"
AWitchDidIt,asktransgender,Just noped out two times from a blood draw due to major fear of needles.,"I had to get a blood draw done for amongst other things start of HRT. 

And while I am pretty okay with it as a general idea, I end up with a full blown panic attack when someone is waving an actual needle arrangement around for blood drawing. So that was two cancelled orders already and a lot of me stressing out and taking a few days to get back to normal.

I am going to atleast try it one more time the normal route, but then drag along a friend of mine to see if that helps me deal and probably going to ask for a butterfly needle. But is there any other thing I can do to make it easier to manage ? I've read some stuff about EMLA creme, but idk if that helps me if the sight of the needle freaks me out and you still feel pressure (also it's prescription here, so I'll have to jump through a ton of hoops to get it), so I'd like to hear some personal stories on it. 

Reason I am asking is that if this doesn't work, the next level of escalation that my doctor suggested was going nitrous oxide to take the edge of my conciousness basically, but they are really hesitant to do that as it means booking an operating theater and such just for a blood draw.....

(heeeeeelp)

edit: While none of this really is a direct help, I am pretty sure I am going to call my GP about it as soon as I can, because appaerently my levels of panic are not the usual kind of fear and I am likely going to need some therapy as else I am just fucked.

edit2: GP recommended me taking propranolol (a beta-blocker) to stop the physical response and the feedback loop from that and I might ask for EMLA-cream at the hospital as soon as they get back to me about having merged the labs. So let's see how that works.

edit3: Back for more, after having been out of the running due to allergic reaction, now trying to get blood drawn just for that at my GPs office (much quieter). Tried hydroxyzine and propranolol, the combination seems to be doing quite a bit, the lidocaine cream I just bought should help with the last bit, so retry tomorrow or Wednesday

The hydroxyzine is a very effective, short acting, non-addictive mental acting (unlike the propranolol) anxiolytic, that also happend to be an anti-histamine effective to killing my allergy. "
Pasha3,asktransgender,"How do I get unstuck? - I know, not a very specific questions, but still...","I have until recently identified as a gay bottom male. But truth be told, I do not feel to be of male gender. I do not feel 100% female either. I, for one, do not desire to have female sex organs. But I surely do not identify as male. 

I am attracted to males whose gender is not hesitant and who do not expect to be penetrated. I find this quite hard in the gay community as it seems that truly top gay guys are so few, and even if they are there, they are not attracted to me. It seems that if they were allowed to tell me honestly why they are not attracted to me, they would say something like, 'If I wanted to date a girl, I would. The whole point of being gay is being attracted to a man.' I on my end do not feel a man, do not project a man, and hence i feel to be invisible to this type of gay guys.

Yes, I have felt that some gay guys are attracted to me, yet I cannot reciprocate because I feel that the ones that are attracted to me have uncertain gender roles and are at least versatile in bed, if not bottoms. I do not shun effeminate or bottom gay men and have kept my mind very open. I have tried dating all kinds of gay guys. Yet when I am with someone who expects me to penetrate them, or whose behavior is gender-variant, I start feeling a tremendous amount of anxiety, as if I'm at the wrong place, with the wrong person, as if I'm pretending and not true to myself, and there's also the feeling of un-safety: I just do not feel emotionally safe unless I am convinced that my partner's gender is unequivocally and continuously male and he does not require me to penetrate him for him to be satisfied. Penetration here of course means sex, but I also attribute a wider meaning to it, since I also remember my anxiety when my partner expected me to set the tone and take the lead in the relationship, i.e. penetrate them in the wider meaning of this word.

(By the way, if you’re intent on asking the question of ‘But what is male? And what is female?’ – I would rather not have that kind of a discussion. I know what’s masculine and what’s feminine in my heart, and I know that I’m wired neurologically in this kind of way that these aspects become very important in matters of my being attracted to someone.)
 
I've kept my mind so open that I feel that I could even  be attracted to a female-to-male transsexual as long as the female characteristics in the appearance and personality are sufficiently absent. I would even be ok if this trans man didn't have a biological dick and had to use something like a strap-on -- as long as i knew that I do not have the responsibility to give them penetrative pleasure, the doing of which is so foreign to my nature. 

With all of that said, I'm also attracted to straight guys, and I find that with them I feel often more at ease than with gay guys, since they come across to me as more gender-certain, much less gender-variant than gay men – which stops the turmoil that I experience when I’m involved with genderqueer gay men) and there's no expectation that I should be penetrating them (even if they do carry that desire, it is not expressed upfront, if ever.)

However, if you take away the straight man's ocassional desire to ""play"", I feel as invisible to straight men, and I believe that is for the reason that straight men desire to be with women, and I'm not one.

With all of that said, I feel awfully stuck. I'm 34 and all things love, relationships and sex seem to be just going by me. I am wondering if someone could help me start digging in the right direction. I would love to get unstuck from this. Thank you all in advance."
SarcasticNut,asktransgender,Learning about different gender's socialization and norms that men or women accept and what's ok and what isn't.,"Hi everyone, I'm currently transitioning right now (MtF) and I've been thinking a lot about how each gender has defined expectations and norms that they perform with other members of their same gender group. I have some friends to ask some questions of, but I figure crowdsourcing some info might be helpful for not just me but other people too. I just need a few questions answered about what's ok and accepted and what isn't when you're a women talking to other women or men, or vice versa?  Some examples include:

When do you ask other women to go to the bathroom with you? Is this at a specific tier of friendship? Should I just go with them when they go but don't ask?

As much as underwear is advertised, do you go shopping with people often to get new underwear? 

As always feel free to ask any other questions you might have!

feeling_supersonic,asktransgender,Is my disinterest in having sex trans-related?,"I am a 22-year old bisexual trans man (starting T next month).


For some time, I've been questioning wether I fall somewhere in the gray-ace area or whether my lack of interest in sex has to do with me being trans. 


I am attracted to people of various genders, but I just can't picture having sex with any of them. I do have sexual fantasies, but they don't usually involve myself. I don't even have sex dreams. Very rarely, I have dreams of myself making out with someone, wanting to get naked, but we always get interrupted. 


I was only once intimate with a guy when I was 19, but it triggered a rush of dysphoria that got me a lot closer to realising I am trans. It was all fun and lovely and he was perfect, but suddenly I had this feeling that he did not see me. He did not see me, because he could only see this girl-shell I was stuck in.
Ever since then I have not been keen on repeating that. I think it could change when I get on hormones and have top surgery, but that will take a long time.


We were discussing asexuality in my trans youth group some time back, and there were several people feeling similarly to me. 


So have you had similar feelings? Did they change with medical transition?"

The experience marked this huge milestone being that this was my first time even leaving the house dressed like this. Like a lot of other trans individuals I find myself almost haunted by doubts everyday even as I start to see small feminine changes in my appearance. Also like many other transgender individuals I used this as an experience to see if I truly believe this journey is for me. I will say this is an amazing experience and just kind of reaffirms that “yes this is for me” me feeling. Pride in general is amazing and if your town or city has one I would seriously recommend going in full girl mode as a practice run almost. Its amazing and fun and hey there is a ton of fenders with trans pride stuff. Thank you /r/asktransgender for all the advice posts and just everything I have been here lurking since I started to remotely had feelings about myself. So thanks for everything.

SelfLoathing91,asktransgender,Is keeping my last name a bad idea?,"The way I've been dealt cards I really don't have anything out there with my legal name and sex out there. My dysphoria is more extreme in nature that as long as I don't feel even 70% complete, I can't even bring myself to doing simple work. So I've been unemployed and doing small gigs that no one's going to even know really. I  also dropped out of high school because the fear of seeing my legal name on a diploma was something I couldn't live with(That and mom got sick and needed a caretaker.)

Literally only things I have with my legal name is my state ID, insurance, social security and clinical visits.

The reason I ask this is because, I don't feel resentment toward my last name.. I used to be because my family was transphobic but they got over it and accepted me as their living daughter rather then having a dead son. My last name is also fairly common too.

I mean I already pass to my knowledge, no one suspects me as visibly trans or even trans except myself(Thanks delusions &amp; dysphoria.) My parents are even willing to cooperate with a lie because of the origin of how I was named, I was named after someone who died around the time I was born that meant a lot to them. So if anyone asks when the newspaper article is covered we've already got that one covered...

So in my case, is changing my last name really necessary? As far as I know, there's no way for anyone to really hunt down my info and out me.. I never used social media until I went full time so I don't really have anything under that name.

TL;DR - Given a situation where one couldn't work because of extreme dysphoria and ended up dropping out of high school and other things as well.. Is there really a danger to someone like this not changing their last name?"

MechaMaya,asktransgender,Do you ever get dreams that help you accept who you are?,"Now before I start, let me make it clear that I usually don't put much stock in dreams, if any. I don't believe they're prophetic or have some sort of otherworldly knowledge that I don't have.

That being said, last night I had a series of particularly vivid dreams, which is unusual for me because I rarely ever dream, let alone multiple times in one night. But in these dreams, I feel like my mind was trying to help ease the anxiety my conscious mind feels. My dream presented me with scenarios of coming out to my friends and family and being accepted by them unconditionally...

This goes against everything I've been stressing about lately, which is that they won't accept me, and I will have a nightmare of a time trying to transition. But in the dream not only were my loved ones OK with it, but they immediately began adjusting their perception of me to reflect who I'd revealed myself to be.

Now I know this is an idealized situation in a dream land, but experiencing it really gave me hope for the future. I hadn't previously been able to imagine an outcome where this ended positively for me. But thanks to my subconscious mind, it helped me understand that there is a potential happy ending in here somewhere... I shouldn't lose sight of that.

I just wanted to share this epiphany, thanks for listening :) And if you have had similar dreams, I'd love to hear I'm not the only one who's been helped like this!"

CarrotPipe,asktransgender,How to better internalize/accept someone's true gender?,"I understand factually that gender identity is something that cannot be changed, and is determined biologically. However, I have a hard time thinking of transgender persons as their true gender. For some reason, my mind tends to think of them as, for example, ""female but identifies as male."" I consciously try to use the right pronouns, but unconsciously, I'm incorrect.

This, of course, will inevitably lead to me referring to someone with the wrong pronouns or some other similar mistake, making me look quite foolish. More importantly, I feel as if my support for transgender persons only extends to my vocabulary; I am not truly respecting their gender, only pretending to.

A few examples of recent mistakes:

* I have a friend who has transitioned male to female, and while I have been accepting of her throughout the transition, I feel that I do not view her as female in my head. Because I value her friendship, I want to truly accept this person for who she is. However, I sometimes make mistakes and use her old name or the wrong pronoun. It made me realize that I didn't internally accept her as female.

* Another time, someone was trying to remember the name of one of my coworkers. The description she gave was ""a guy with long blonde hair"". I said the name of a coworker who had transitioned male to female (and also had long blonde hair), and of course someone had to correct my mistake. I am thankful my coworker was not around for this.

How can I learn to internalize someone's true gender when my brain is so stubborn? Does anyone have any advice?

Ever since I was toddler, I always hated being associated with girls. I always wanted to be called a ""kid"" rather than a ""girl"". Eventually I stopped doing that, but I was still very Tom-boyish. Eventually, when I started using the Internet, I always said I was a guy online. I couldn't stand saying I was a girl. I only did it *once*, which was followed up with ""I was just joking."".

Until recently, I always assumed I was into men. I always had this love of the male body, and I always preferred being with guys rather than girls. But recently, some things made me realize that's not the case. I might be into women, and this attraction I feel for men might just be some sort of jealousy for their body.

justmeandibecausewhy,asktransgender,let me rant,"So I go to this Youth Club, consisting of 8 of my friends. They've been my friends for 7 years. One of them, happens to be transphobic and homophobic and generally disapproving of the lgbt+ community, let's call him Jake. I just didn't realised how disapproving he was until tonight. I also discovered that his way of ""debating"" is shoving his opinion down your throat, insulting you, and denying hard facts.

I get there, and all is well. After about 20 minutes, someone brings up trans people. Then Jake comes in and says that transgender and genderfluid people (yes, I know that genderfluid people are transgender, but he seemed to mention them separately) are sad little shits who just want attention. I start shouting at him, I asked him if he thought people with male genetalia had a male gender. He said yes, that anyone with a penis had a male gender. I showed him a dictionary, and looked up the word ""gender""

Surprise surprise

It said it was psychological

But guess what? He denied it! He said it was wrong? Then he repeats that he thinks trans people are sad little shits who want attention and that if you're sad because you're the ""wrong gender"" you're a fucking idiot. At this point, me and two of my friends who are arguing with me, are absolutely outraged. One of them is genderfluid, and I'm transgender (MtF). My friend says that gender dysphoria is a serious thing which makes people commit suicide. Then Jake comes along saying that people who are depressed or who have depression should stop complaining and stop being little shits because there were people who had it way worse, such as children in Africa. My other friend, not the genderfluid one, has depression. He then follows this by making fun of people with mental illnesses and disorders, and then switching the subject back to trans people. This argument keeps going on, us providing Jake with facts, and him shoving his opinion down our throat, insulting us, denying facts, and being a general asshole.

At the end of this argument, me and my two friends are in tears. And the guy doesn't even fucking apologise! And I'm just sat there wondering HOW THE FUCK DOES SOMEONEING STUPID AND IGNORANT AND DISRESPECTFUL TO A WHOLE FUCKING GROUP OF PEOPLE?! HE HAS NO IDEA HOW FUCKING PRIVILEGED HE IS! HE JUST PISSES ME OFF SO FUCKING MUCH.

Strong bond and intimacy evaporated over night. She said she feels emotionally dead inside (not to be confused with sad or depressed, just neutral). She asked if maybe we could keep the relationship more 'casual' for now, which I agreed to. I can wait and be patient for her. But I do feel like this is slowly creating a divide between us, and I worry in the end it may pull her away from me.

She feels more like a friend and less like my girlfriend right now, and that's really concerning me.

lyaa55,asktransgender,Feeling rushed or I should take the final steps of self-acceptance and be more open about all this,"So I started HRT like 3 weeks ago.  I told like 3 close friends, two of whom live in different cities, that I started, and I told a fourth that I was considering it but haven't updated her yet about starting.  I haven't told my family, housemates, or any work/school contacts.

I'm in what I anticipate to be fairly accepting circumstances.  I'm in a graduate school with many gender-neutral bathrooms, there's one publicly GNC phD student in our department, at least one of my housemates posts pro-trans political articles on FB.

I've found it fairly relaxing and kind of empowering in certain ways to be pretty DL about hrt.  I just do my thing, I was already noticeably gender-bending.  And i'll just surprise everyone if/when I decide to change my name and pronoun.

But I'm finding this kind of socially limited.  Two of my friends/housemates are cis/straight, and I'm like, ""oh I don't really wanna go to this bar to pick up straight girls, sorry.""  And I wanna start dating but have difficulty initiating conversations with anyone except other trans/GNC people, and there aren't too many on okcupid.

I still second guess myself re: transitioning, like ""do I really wanna do this.""  And socially coming out seems like the biggest, most irrevocable step.  I guess short of SRS.

I'm delaying things like laser and acquiring a wardrobe and don't want to find myself like, developing breasts while still presenting totally as a guy (albeit a queer one with patent gender trouble).  I don't know.  I guess I need to better form realistic expectations for transitioning and figure out how I'll handle it.

I also need to actually fully commit if I am in fact doing this, which I guess is the real problem.  As I said, I anticipate support from the people around me and a relatively smooth social transition.  But I don't want to ""come out"" as doing something that I won't actually go through with.

I know doubt is normal, but what if I am using this knowledge of the normalcy of doubt to avoid acknowledging that my doubts are legitimate!  My social/dating life feels like it's been falling apart lately, and i'm not sure if I brainstormed ""something's wrong with me"" to explain this away, or if I've been staying in so much b/c of my gender issues.  My last sexual relationship was explicitly ""autogynephiliac"" --- (""can I go in you"" she'd ask)--- so it's not like it's just a ""dark time desire.""  And like 100 other examples of why the latter explanation, that I really am trans, is the only plausible one.  But argh.

I have no real desire to go ""full time"" until my body changes enormously.  I'd like to avoid the visibly in-between as much as possible.  I'm not interested in a super classically femme presentation.  List of familiar early trans insecurities.

I'm not sure if I want to socially transition so things like laser-faded hair on my face will have an explanation or I want to transition in stealth and taaaaaaake my time.  I worry boobs will rush me.  I don't want them to catch me unawares!!!  I worry i'll transition, appear unseemly, and it'll make my (mild) dysphoria much worse.  I worry b/c i'm in grad school and i'll be flagrantly trans during my final semester and upon completion, and discrimination will prevent me from getting a job or even from continuing the HS teaching I've been doing while I study.

Thanks for listening!    "

nate4ward,asktransgender,So I came out to my parents...,"So last night I finally told my very open minded mom, and she said ""I have to tell your father."" Didn't mind since it saved me from the face to face with my highly conservative father. Woke up this morning and he wanted to talk. Turns out he was super calm about it, most likely from shock and just had a bunch of questions. This then turned into a 2 on 1 conversation with them both. My dad mostly focused on what my job prospects were (I'm still waiting on my job to tell me when I'm going to start working there, also 22, graduated from college this year), while my moms biggest issue was who I'm interested in, and says, ""you know the only people that are going to be with you are other trans people"". She tried to rectify this with ""its because you're so tall"" (I'm 6'3 3/4) and she is 5'11 almost 6'0 and easily a 9/10 but says, ""I had trouble finding someone""/ ""people always made fun of me about my height"" despite never being single since probably about 9 yrs old (met my dad at 14). This was after I showed her pictures last night asking for critiques and her saying, ""well they do have ffs"" I just ignored that putting it up to shock. This fiasco then turned into maybe you should go to Transgender groups meet some people ""do that for a couple of years because if you start anything and you don't like it you can never return"". ""Are you sure you're not just gay?"". ""There is a very high suicide rate for people because so many regret it"". I tried to dispel many of their incorrect stats but was met with a lot of opposition because they know a lot about the subject and to say otherwise is insulting to their intelligence. I honestly feel they are very supportive but misinformed and just want to know what I can do to fix it, since they seem unwilling to further educate themselves and honestly I don't want to lose them or distance myself from them? Aside from that my mom brought up a lot of my insecurities which I honestly need honest opinions on. I know my face isn't overly masculine aside from the obvious 5 o' clock shadow (at least I thought it wasn't). But is my only shot of passing FFS? 

I know my problems sound like nothing compared to some of the people here but it does cause me a lot of distress thinking about it.

My (inevitably stupid) question is this: How severely would HRT affect my workout capabilities? I take being fit fairly seriously, for various reasons that I won't exactly go into here (if you want to ask, feel free, but I don't find them important to the question) I'm not about to abandon the idea of HRT for myself (I'm GQ) but rather I want to know what to expect my capabilities to be while on HRT so I can adjust accordingly. I know that testosterone at least somewhat increases your baseline, but if anyone has any resources or such on this topic I would greatly appreciate them.

silam39,asktransgender,"Pre-bottom surgery trans women, did you experience weird moistness in your penis while on HRT?","So I've been on HRT for... I don't know, maybe 14, 15 months?  

Around three months ago, my penis finally began to shrink. I'm uncircumcised, so I pretty much ended up with a small penis and a ton of foreskin hanging off the front. Now, about a month ago I discovered I couldn't ejaculate after masturbating anymore, which was interesting. Kinda cool, honestly.  

However, around that time (and possibly/probably as a coincidence,) I started noticing something weird about my penis; sometimes I would take it out to go to the bathroom and it was all... sort of slimy or moist in the foreskin area. Or I'd be in bed and would get up, and suddenly realise my legs felt a little wet. On rushing to the bathroom, I'd find my penis had been leaking... something. Not cum, not pee. Just... something.

Is this normal? It's just a little weird to have the tip of my penis getting wet randomly, no matter how well I clean it when I can. Is this possibly going to make infection more likely? Is it hygienic, or irrelevant? Is this related to HRT? Has anyone else experienced it?"
Throwawaysbae,asktransgender,Joining the Military?,"I was surrounded by the military (US) growing up and in high school wantes to join, but couldn't because I was actively medicated fir mental health issues.

I know its likely not a very trans-friendly atmosphere and I admittedly don't agree with much of this country's military influence.  But I'm horribly poor, have no real family, would like to go to college some day, and also desparately want to finance surgeries so I can move on from this transition stuff.  I also haven't been medicated in 6 years and am very physically capable.  So I'm seriously considering joining the Military once trans service members are cleared next year.

My body is filling out as pear shaped and it's too hard to suppress being myself at work anymore. I've spoken with HR and they are very supportive. However my office culture requires pantyhose/tights instead of just bare legs and preferably skirts instead of slacks. That's perfectly fine with me and I enjoy the way they look and feel on my legs and waist.

However as much as I will enjoy them, I haven't had much experience with them. I keep tearing them when putting them on, sometimes they are too tight on the waist, it always seems like they're rolling up or slipping off which I would hate to have happen at work. I'm overweight if that matters. I don't tuck because it's uncomfortable for me, I just wear normal plain panty briefs.

EverlastingM,asktransgender,How do I help with someone else's stubborn parents?,"I have a coworker. We're friends. He's 16, while I'm 28 and married. So we're in significantly different stages of life. He is a trans guy, I'm a trans woman.

I'm full time and on HRT, but he has actually been out longer than I have. Pretty much everyone around him knows him for who he is and uses the right pronouns, aside from a few high school jerks that try to stir trouble. His parents have been very supportive of his identity, and now he's asking to visit a doctor for T. His mother has repeatedly refused, said he's too young to make this decision, it would cost too much, she needs to hear from a professional, no-one can take off work to go to a doctor's appointment. Since I bring up cost I should mention that he has volunteered to self-fund his transition. They went to family counseling last week.

I met them for the first time today to talk about my experience being trans. I talked very casually and tried not to play up the doom-and-gloom side of being trans, but rather how normal everyone ends up after transition. I offered a lot of information, gave them free reign to ask questions. We talked about the price of hormones, and talked a little about my life at his age and I expressed that I thought he was capable of making such a decision. We also mentioned that experiences with hrt are generally better the earlier they begin. Tonight he texted to tell me that his mother is still concerned that he's too young to make the call, and that it will be too expensive. It sounds to me like she's just stonewalling him.

Tomorrow I will see them again at their first PFLAG meeting. I know that there will be a large number of trans males his age at this meeting, and their parents. What do I say reddit? How do I be a bro? How do I help my friend without inciting a fight between him and his mother?


TLDR: I know a minor, his parents are ""supportive"" but not allowing hrt. He wants hrt bad. I've tried a lot already, I need ideas to be helpful.

KelseyMorrisTG,asktransgender,Considering Detransition,"So I'm 4 months on HRT and have been full time for about a month and a half.  Really all of my experiences since going full time are pretty unreplaceable.  I had no idea that life could be like this, considering I grew up as a boy and had next to no emotions and/or relationships with people until I transitioned.  So why detransition if I'm so happy?

I'm beginning to realize that I miss many thigs about my prior life that I never knew I would have come to miss.  Some of these are the way I looked in certain clothes or the way my voice sounded before I tried to feminize it.  Maybe I'm caught between both genders because I do find myself jealous of they way that both genders look on different occasions and often wish I was whichever it was that I was seeing.  The difference being that it's easy for me to be an attractive male, I don't have to do anything.  With being g a female obviously there's much more work that goes into it and I don't know that I even look better now than I did before I was on HRT (Yes my levels are fine). 

I suppose I'm mostly just looking for some input or insight on whether any of you had ever had doubts or considered that your prior life was actually fine even though you had already gone all the way.  Certainly I could be very happy as a woman and the same could be said as a boy, but so think I'm always going to wish I had the opposite that I am.

TL; DR - I'm considering detransitioning due to not being sure if it's actually for me or not.

Thanks boys and girls(: Muah!"

OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,"How do I go about handling upsetting/""triggering"" comments as Someone who is questioning/""In the closet""?","Okay, so I'm currently taking a class in school that I just started. And, I'm very much used to be being the ""butt of the joke"" among people my age. I'm not a very offendable person.

But in this class I just started(that I am not even considering dropping), amongst the usual light-hearted jokes I usually am subject to came a new trend. The joke is that ""I'm gay and in the closet"". 

Okay, no big deal, I'm not gay and lightly being teased is perfectly fine. But one of the people who makes these jokes is a girl and she takes it slightly further.

She basically jokes about me actually being a girl. That I'm on my period or that she could lend me a dress. Or whatever. Typical stupid stuff.

And usually I wouldnt give two shits, but as I'm struggling with finding myself right now, I can't help but feel hurt. Not because she is purposefully being mean or anything, mind you. But more because every day is a mental battle with whether or not I'm trans and hearing things like that remind me of that. The mental anguish I feel.

I mean, in the short term, I'll get over it. It's not purposefully offensive and I'm not out as questioning/trans so she and my friends have no idea it bothers me, but in the long term I'm worried. I'm worried that a few months of those funny little jokes about me being a girl will cause me to not be able to keep my emotions in check, possibly outing me.


I don't know what to do, but I'm not going to take that to a staff member/guidance counselor. I can handle jokes, but those perticular ones do bother me.

I guess I could try to just say to this girl and my friends that I don't appreciate those kinds of jokes, but I dont want to give the impression that I find them offensive because I could be transgender. 

I realize this is super long and the subject matter is probably very minor, but whatever.

Thanks in advance. Please answer as honestly as possible! :)"
chooseausername9294,asktransgender,Help me understand myself,"Hi all.

I'm 19 years old, and am currently working 25-50+ hours a week over two jobs. The reason I'm telling you this information (which might seem completely irrelevant) is because I tend to work as much as I can ""to fill the gaps"" in my daily schedule (which is practically non-existent). 

Before I started working after high school, I was unemployed for 3-4 months and it was miserable. I felt I didn't know how to function as an individual. I didn't know what ""normal"" people did in their spare time. 

At that stage, the thought of transgenderism hadn't crossed my mind. I had always just assumed I was boring/different. But there was this lingering feeling in the back of my mind that something wasn't right about me. Nobody I knew felt the same as I did. Those who were (and may still be) unemployed found hobbies and hanging out with their friends to be of helpful pastime, but I felt those wouldn't have ended my loneliness and feeling of alienated. I suppose I knew there was always an issue when I convinced myself I probably wouldn't live past 21. 

In saying that, I don't believe I am depressed, nor do I believe I am conventionally suicidal. For me, it's a matter of not being able to comprehend why I'm so much different from most people. And that creates insufferable loneliness. 

However, after toying with the fact I may be transgender over the last 6-12 months, a sudden cloud of ""normalness(?)"" hit me. It's mainly been the last 2-3 weeks when I've forced myself to genuinely question these feelings opposed to suppress them that things in my life have begun to make sense. 

I will admit I do not follow some list of some objective-narrative-transgender-story-bullshit like many people have (although I understand many also don't) but have concluded that there's no fucking way anyone completely comfortable with their gender (and sexuality) would be able to fathom what I am feeling. 

In order to feel somewhat more certain about my discoveries and realisations, I want to write a list of everything (starting from about 5 years old) that may or may not be as a result of my gender.

- I once complained to my brother that I hated being a guy because ""we couldn't have babies."" I suspect this in itself was a little phase because I didn't think much of it, but maybe it holds value.

- For a very long time, I thought the scar under my penis (I believe it's called the raphe line) was as a result of some birth surgery to make me a male. 

- I'm not overtly masculine. I hate contact sports. My interests include more unisex activities (photography, travel, computers, listen to music, ect). 

- I infinitely get along with females more than males. I cannot stand the superior complex most males seem to have. I know it's a gender stereotype, but most of the guys I work with or serve (I work in the service industry) tend to come across as though they think they're better than you. It's not a huge issue, but women tend to not care, and I find are more fun and friendly to be around in general.

- I could never understand human biology. I simply didn't relate to it because my desires were far different to other males. Apparently I'm supposed to be attracted to women with wide hips? No thanks. 

- In saying that, I'm only attracted to men. This created so much confusion until I was around 18. I came out as my parents at 12 telling them I was gay. They told me it was a phase so naturally I repressed it, thinking I'd get over it eventually. Because, you know, the definition of a phase through puberty should be universally accepted as normal and something everyone else goes through, right? So all guys wanted to have sex with men at around during puberty, right? (/sarcasm)

- on the topic of being gay and coming out, I came out again at 18 during my unemployed period of feeling just like shit. But there wasn't some feeling of relief I had hoped for. I still felt.. wrong. 

- The only porn I watch is straight porn, but I dream about being the female. I want to feel protected. I want to be dominated; penetrated and cared for (I tend to think my sex fantasies are completely normal if I were a biological female, and not dangerous in any way).

- I hate my voice. I despise my physique. I feel like I don't know what to do with my hair/clothes etc. I've been told by girls I have a good fashion sense and have been complimented on my hair, but I don't really do much.

- For the most part, I tend to not mind looking in the mirror. It's pictures I cannot stand. And you know what's worse? Seeing or hearing myself on video. I cry a little on the inside.

- I have panic attacks when giving presentations. It's not some normal, healthy feeling. I legitimately want to die. It's one of the reasons I'm not at university right now - I know I'll have to face this issue, but now is not the time.

- I cannot for the life of me maintain friendships. I get along with almost everyone. I'm the person people at work go to when they want help with their problems (not entirely, but people tend to be open around me). But outside of work I talk to nobody. If it wasn't for living at home, I'd probably rely on work for any source of communication. It wasn't until recently I realised this probably isn't a healthy lifestyle.

- I would genuinely like to know if I have female internals. When I masturbate I rub where a theoretical vagina would be, and my feelings just seem too physical and real to be ""in my mind.""

- recently I shaved pretty much everywhere, and just felt... Eh. It definitely wasn't a bad experience, but no real life changer.

- I think I am slightly more feminine than I once thought. In primary school, I went to the toilets and a kid told me to go to the females toilets because I was a girl. Of course, I assumed this was an insult and just ignored it, but maybe he had a point? In addition, a friend recently told me I would make a good looking girl out of nowhere - and I have told nobody about any of this.

- both men and women smile at me at work. Their attitudes tend to be more caring and less aggressive around me. I thought it was normal until I realised how they were around other typical guys. Furthermore, colleagues (men and women) both almost go out of their way to touch me when they walk past me. I've never thought much of it (I don't mind it at all) but mostly thought it was because they maybe suspected I was lonely. 

- my biggest fear is women being attracted to me. I'm out to nobody at work. I've always had a fear of women hitting on me because I can't give them what they want, and I know all too well what that feels like.

- I tend to be attracted to older men. They seem more mature for the most part, and I suppose I see them to be more suitable life long partners if I were to have the right parts. As long as they're not creepy though.

- I have no dysphoria when it comes to my name and pronouns. I really don't give a fuck (maybe that would change if I identified as a female, however).

- I've never desired to wear female clothing. But then again I don't put much effort in my masculine clothing either.

- I feel like I almost didn't go through puberty at all. I noticed physical changes, but my sexual desires didn't change at all. They moulded slightly, but remained consistent.

- a guy from school asked me if I wear a bra, because apparently I naturally have big ""moobs?"" (I'm not overweight at all)

---

I understand this isn't a place for counselling, but I want to do the best to figure myself out before seeking professional help. I want to reiterate I'm not conventionally suicidal. I have family and friends, but see no point in progressing in life if I can't be happy. I fear that once I move to the city for university, I won't cope emotionally. 

I'm saving right now to backpack Europe next year as a guy. I hope it will give me a new perspective on myself, and even some confidence for when I come back and eventually (inevitably) come out. I know that if I can backpack Europe alone for a few months, then I should be able to accomplish this, right? 
 
Thanks!

Ragnellrok,asktransgender,Question concerning shoes and boots,"So here's the thing.

Here's my problem though... I'm a size 16 in women's.... so, with that being said, does anyone know of a size where I can either find boots of this archetype that go up to that size (please don't just send me a google search result if you don't know for sure that they have the sizing I'm wanting, I've tried many different searches, hence reddit), or I want a male size 14 version of that boot (literally same boot but sized for men). If you know of a custom shoe crafting site, that'd be freaking awesome too!

 Anyway, hope to hear from people soon on this."
TRMouse,asktransgender,Confused and need advice... Not sure if I'm actually dysphoric or not...?,"I'm not the best at talking about my feelings. I can say what I want in my head, but when it comes to speaking and writing, it just doesn't come out right. I'll try my best to explain things clearly, but it's likely to be jumbled and rushed.

I came out as trans (ftm) 'bout six months ago and I've just been... really confused since then. I've been thinking about whether I'm really transgender or not a lot lately, if I'm just pretending or I'm completely crazy; because, y'know, I don't really have all these problems other people do with their bodies and such. I don't really mind my genitals (though I could not imagine having vaginal intercourse), but I've never really liked my breasts. Back as a girl, they weren't ""good"" enough - being small and not perky or round - and I had push-up bras to give me a better/more feminine chest; I wanted a boob job at one point. It wasn't until after I came out that I became self-conscious about them showing, now I'd much rather not have a noticeable chest. When I was presenting as a girl, all I wanted to do was be more feminine - I wanted to fit in better with the other girls, so I wore makeup, feminine clothing, etc, to make myself ""better""/more feminine in public. I didn't have a problem with my body looking girly until I came out and actively starting trying to hide these features, and now it's the opposite way around; I feel self conscious for looking too girly instead of not girly enough.

When I was little I used to pee standing up. I remember I used to show off this ability to my (female) childhood friend, I thought it was so neato and exercised this ability whenever possible. I got caught once by my uncle when I left the door open and I felt really embarrassed for doing something ""wrong"" and after that I don't remember standing up to pee again except for in the shower (where I do remember once pretending to be a boy whilst doing it). 

I've always sorta wanted to be a boy since I've been little. When I was starting puberty, I remember I used to pray at night and beg god to be a boy when I woke up. I remember I used to wish that a lot, I used to pray that I'd die in my sleep, too. I would often have dreams where I was a guy and get upset when I realized it was just a dream. I still have dreams about being this guy. I don't remember ever being incredibly upset that I don't have a penis, but I sure would like one of those a lot better than what I've got now. 

I've always hated myself. I've never looked like I look in my head and it's always upset me. I'm not comfortable in my own skin and I don't want to go back to living as a female because I was much happier right after I came out. I'm not really sure if I don't really like being female or if I don't want to go back because of how severely depressed I was before transitioning to appear male (can't afford hormones atm) and I don't want to feel like that again (though if I'm being honest, I'm still depressed as fuck). I don't like to be considered female and I much prefer to pass as male, but it wasn't like that before - I never minded being called a girl before, and I'm just... Confused.

I'm confused and scared and horribly worried that I won't be able to be the man I want to be in the future. I'm worried I won't ever look like I look in my head, that I won't ever be able to afford surgeries or hormones. That I'll always be a worthless little girl who's not really transgender at all but so mentally ill she thinks she is. Because I don't want to go back living as a girl, but I still like girly things. I may have changed what pronouns people call me by, but I'm still me - I haven't changed much at all. I don't know if I'm a guy or just some weird little tomboy playing pretend, but I'd really like it if it turned out to be the guy.

I've always imagined myself as a male, I've always primarily played male characters, and I've always pretended to be a dude online (catfished a couple of chicks before). I've always wanted to be a male since I've been little, but I've never really had bad body dyphoria. I'm not even sure I have dysphoria, and that makes me really question calling myself trans and wanting surgeries. "
EloiseSkye,asktransgender,Can I get some advice on what to do next?,"Apologies in advance for formatting errors/spelling mistakes I'm on mobile c:

So I'm (mtf) about 5 months hrt and everyday I feel like I just want to be out and live as a girl but I haven't got a job yet so I'm unable to afford laser hair removal as of now. My facial hair is very dark and grows very quick and always leaves a shadow. I'm also really hairy on the rest of my body.

My other problem is my voice, it's very clearly a guy voice and I don't feel comfortable practicing because I share a room with my brother and barely get time to myself. Practicing also gives me intense dysphoria and makes me feel fake. Again once I get a job I'll be able to save for voice feminisation surgery (as well as my parents might help me).

Passing to me is fairly important because I have anxiety and depression and I really can't deal with the idea that people are going to laugh/make fun/potentially even harm me in public. That and I really don't want to feel 'fake' like I know that I'm a girl but it still feels like I'm pretending, any advice for me? Should I just take the plunge which could end really badly, I could feel very depressed and dysphoric or wait more months, potentially even until next year which is doable but again I could feel very depressed and dysphoric? Thanks so much in advance :)

Side note: I don't have that many 'girl' clothes because again no space from my brother and even though the family I live with knows I'm trans and are supportive I still feel very uncomfortable around them talking about trans stuff/wearing 'girl' clothes around them.

inkwat,asktransgender,Requirement to have hysterectomy after 5 years on T?,"I've just had a phone call with my doctor, and whilst it was recommended to me by my Gender Identity Clinic that I do have a hysterectomy within 5 years, I have always been clear that I would rather not have this and have requested yearly monitoring instead (which I get via ultrasound).

However, my new doctor isn't happy with this and says that it's medically necessary. But to be honest, I don't think she knows much about being trans patients and may not have had one before, because she doesn't seem to know very much about what the procedures are and didn't believe me when I said that I needed a yearly ultrasound (despite this being general practice for a person on testosterone with a uterus/ovaries).

Do I need to have the hysterectomy? Will yearly monitoring suffice?"
charlet1995,asktransgender,Coming to terms with being trans and other questions?,"Hi I've been a long time lurker and I've finally decided to make an account. Most of this is just me splurting my feelings into my phone so sorry about all the text and whinging.

So I've had feelings of dysphoria since I babysat my little sister and played with girls toys with her I was about 10. I didn't know what those feelings were back then but now that I know what these feelings are a lot of things make sense (shaving my legs, wanting long hair, crying when sent to a Christian school and having short hair be mandatory) 

I've repressed these feelings since I realised what I feeling by growing facial hair, binge eating, sleeping and being anti-trans (to myself and close friends). Is that a normal thing to do?

I nearly came out to my mum a year ago but she thought I meant I was bi, I said ""I'm questioning my gender identity"" and I think she took that as I was questioning my sexual preferences. I haven't talked about it since to anyone.

I've been looking for a job the last few months I have to find 20 jobs a month and I receive benefits. I've applied to over 60 jobs and not 1 reply. Just automated denials and nothing else. I'm kind of happy I haven't been offered a job yet because I know I wouldn't be able to work to their standards or just completely fail whatever task is given to me. Orders/directions go right through one ear and out the other.

My Dad is extremely religious and homophobic and transphobic. I don't know if I could come out and risk losing him. He already said if either me or my bro were gay he would disown us. He lives on the other side of the country. How am I suppose to feel about that? He's my dad and I love him with my entire being.  

I've grown my hair to shoulder length and every time I straighten it/do it I always smile. I wore one of my mums dresses and it felt so good I was smiling like a kid. Then why do I still doubt my feelings? I've been putting off going to the doctors for years because I'm too scared of what people will say about me and I feel like it's just awkward to be trans in Australia and that it isn't really accepted as much like in parts of America and Europe. 

Why can I only repress these feelings for short amounts through masturbation and alcohol? I'm such a quiet person and I have no real personality because always repressing feelings so I feel so out of character by wanting to come out like it would cause some real world error. I'm scared it isn't real. I'm scared if I tell someone they'll just laugh at me. 

I'm so envious of how courageous the rest of you guys are. The one time I went out of the house in months someone laughed at me for having girly hair and a guyish face. 

And I feel like deleting all of this because I'm just whining but I know you guys have gone through some of same things I have and had the same feelings and will welcome me...

Thanks for reading so far :/

xJ_Dx,asktransgender,Has anyone else reached a conclusion similar to mine?,"I believe I lie on the middle of the gender spectrum, but because of my socialisation as a male due to my male body, the balance between my masculinity and feminity has become disrupted. In other words, I have not been able to express my feminine side nearly as much as I've been able to express my masculine side, which results in dysphoria.

I'm not sure how much truth there is to this statement. Maybe it's me denying my transeness in favor of a more all-encompassing identity. But nonetheless I'm blaming society and gender roles in the end."

I was thinking about when I was 4/5, and I drank a sip of my dad's red wine, without my parents knowing. I'd always previously attributed this memory to the time when my mum had pulled me out of a party at a friend's house.

But then I had a sudden flash - my lips red, a child's makeup palette, my mum dragging me down the stairs and back home. 

The funny thing is, I drank the wine at my own home, so there's no way the events were correlated. 

How can I trust this memory? Is it just me projecting onto my past? Why has it hit me so strongly? How on earth can you tell if a memory is real, with no-one you can ask to verify? I'd always thought I had no forgotten/repressed memories... But wow.

Maybe I went too fast with them, I don't know, I'm generally very patient, and very ginger with cis people when I tell them. I'm only out to a small number of people though. Still, I'm not used to being outright disbelieved. I get that this is all very sudden for them, but it's not for me. I'm at that point where I don't want to wait another second, and I honestly don't see the benefit in doing so. If my ma had her way I'd wait a year, then 5, then 20. Thank God I'm a fucking adult.

I didn't even get around to telling them my name or explaining dysphoria and how I was feeling to them. They were basically reeling the entire time, and I was trying to let them talk it out to process it. :/ I had to deal with them misgendering me the entire time (not maliciously) and I'm a tough girl, I can take it, but damn it all if it doesn't just suck. It's about what I expected though. Sadly.

For background, they are still very uneducated. They knew just enough to be a danger to themselves and others./s

I'm only going to focus on a dream I had last night because it's the only one that was explicitly related to my transition. I dreamt that I was out buying makeup for the first time. I was with a friend and I was talking to her about what I wanted to buy just to get started. We looked around and talked about different products, but I only grabbed what I was looking for. I was a little nervous when I went up to the counter to pay for it, but I also felt a very calm excitement.

I was planning on waiting until I was more passable to start wearing makeup so it wouldn't be so obvious that I'm trans, but people are definitely going to figure it out eventually. Do you think I should go for it? I was only planning on getting foundation to cover up the shadow from my facial hair and maybe some mascara. I attend a college that advertises itself as being LGBT friendly, but I'm still not very good at my girl voice because my allergies have been holding me back and I can't imagine anybody would notice my breasts yet. I'm also still working on posture, but I think posture is pretty easy. Should I start wearing makeup?"

Tgheidi,asktransgender,Life is so short. I'm starting to wonder what is the point of transitioning?,"People often argue ""life is so short, do whatever makes you happy."" But you can get to a completely opposite conclusion with the same argument. Human's life expectancy is so short compared to the age of the universe, our lives are only a split second if the universe is a 24 hour clock. Since you have so little time, whether you are male or female doesnt really matter that much. For example its like taking a cab and the driver keeps talking to you, you don't want to talk but since it'd be too much trouble to get out of the car and take another cab, you decide you'd just put up with it because you would reach the destination very soon. 

I'm not saying I don't want to transition but I'm just wondering whats the point of it all and is it really worth it."

Jachra,asktransgender,What does dysphoria feel like?,"This question requires a little clarification.

I've been on hormones for almost a year now and it's going great. My one great personal regret is that I never went through with it much earlier in my life. Among the reasons why I never did is because I had convinced myself that maybe something was wrong with my feelings.

As I'm sure I've mentioned before, people's accounts of dysphoria and the symptoms they feel as a result don't really match mine. What led me to be who I am was a combination of factors including envy for other girls (their hair, clothes, mannerisms, voices, everything), distaste for masculinity, and haunting dreams, but I've never felt crippling pain or phantom sensations.

The closest I ever came was when I was in my teens and started having my first erections. I didn't know what to do with them, they were painful and strange and I didn't like them. Eventually I learned to ""deal"" with them, but that sense never went away.

Is it normal for dysphoria to not strike some people as hard?

How do you feel dysphoria?"
Estronaut-23,asktransgender,What do you think about my coming out letter?,"**Here it is:**

Hello `&lt;family-member&gt;`,

There's never a right time to say something like this, and waiting longer won't make it better.

I've had these strange, feelings all my life. I hated it when my legs started growing hair. I hated it when my voice started getting deeper. I wear jackets and coats, no matter how miserable the heat makes me, because I hate looking at my body without all of the extra padding to hide it. Recently, I've come to realize what has caused these feelings, and in the months since then I've been thinking about it constantly; I'm sure of it. I am transgender.

Tons of thoughts are probably going through your head now. You're probably wondering ""What does this mean?"" ""Why do you feel this way?"" ""What do I do now?"". It means that the gender of my brain doesn't match my body's gender. There are theories as to why this happens, mostly pointing to abnormal fetal development. No really knows exactly why yet.

You can help though. You can try to be accepting, and not think too hard about it. I've had months to think about it and accept it, you've had like 2 minutes. There is also transition, via hormone therapy and other means, that we should talk about. Transition is the only way forward. It won't be easy, but I'm confident I can do it with your help.

And please don't tell anyone else, not family, not friends, or colleagues, or random people on the streets. I'm not ready for anyone outside this house to know yet. Asking me questions is fine, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have, and there's some stuff I want to get off my chest too.

This helpful resource, put together by people much smarter than me, will probably answer some of your questions. It's a lot of information, the most relevant information in there is regarding transsexual people.

sophiegirl0129,asktransgender,SRS question,"So I'm on HRT, and I've been trying to decide on having srs or not. It's covered by my insurance, but I'm more concerned about a few things. For starters I feel lost as to how to get approved. I know I need to be on HRT for 2 years at least, had hair removal down there, and have two letters from therapists. But I've only been on HRT for 8 months. When should I start finding that second therapist? Since I need to have hair removal could I try to have my insurance cover it? 

My biggest concern with SRS is whether or not my neo vagina will be sexually functional. I'm worried that I won't enjoy using it. I'm a lesbian if that matters, does  anyone have any experience . Do you like the results?

I'm also worried about timing with my career. I'm 23, about to graduate, and I'll be working for a major company. I'm afraid to take time off during my two year training period. Especially since I'll be traveling from East coast US to Japan quite frequently. Any advice on that front? "
melynda12,asktransgender,Not sure what to do..,"First of all, Hello!

So my mom was cleaning my room a while ago and for some reason went into my drawer (Not sure if snooping or just wanted to be nice and clear it up alittle). And she found ALOT of girl clothes since i've been stashing up for years. Ranges from Clothes to Make up to shoes and everything, half my drawer is basically female sutff. 

Anyways, a few days after this she came up to me and asked what i was doing and why i had all these things, am i crossdressing? Are you transgendered? Do you wish to be a girl? Is it just some sexual thing?

It caught me by such a surprise i just froze, before even thinking i answered simply ''I don't really know, it's just a stress reliver maybe a fetish im not sure'' And she went something like ''Are you sure thats it? I've been seeing your female stash building up for years and you can talk to me about anything you know, i support you whatever it is, if you wanna change sex or dress as a girl whatever it is i love and support you and if you need more clothes just let me know and i can help you''

I was still in such a shock and kept denying saying nono it's fine, i'm just experimenting i have everything i need.

The thing is, i'm pretty sure i'm transgender (Questioning still). Which is normal i guess, i try to visualize how the future would look like, and i like it. I would prefer being a girl all the time over a male, i hate being hairy, having muscles or whatever and i rarely go out with friends as i feel i dont fit in. As of late i'm literally dressed as a girl whenever i get the time, even if it's just for 30 minutes when my mom or sister is away.

So, it seems my mother is very supportive, my sister actually has a trans friend and she always supported the lgbt community and goes to pride festival in Sweden where i live etc. Looks like my family really supports this but still i can't see myself coming out anytime soon.

I just don't feel ready to have the talk, to transition in my current situation being unemployed and being overweight (currently working on that, already lost a fair amount). 

And if i ever feel ready in the future, did i blow my chance? Maybe my mom gets upset i didn't come out sooner when she's been so supportive? Also i'm 21 if i keep waiting will it just make things worse? And i feel so ungreatful for not coming out reading stories of unsupportive family members..

Maybe i just overthink everything, i always do... gosh

kmg75,asktransgender,Somewhat philosophical question . . . to be visible or not,"Hi all,

Please excuse any typographical, grammatical, or logical errors in the following as I may be somewhat inebriated after drinking a bottle of wine . . . and I don't even know what type of wine as the label is in Arabic (kind of ironic I know but shrug . . I can work out that it says 13% alcohol *grin*)

As such - my question is this - I have been somewhat visible as a trans/intersex role model at least in my own small sphere - do I have a responsibility to continue to be visible as someone who has transitioned?

To put this in perspective, I believe that there is at least odds on chance (and no - I do not gamble but I listen to what the commentators say during NRL games :-) ) that my bf may ask me to marry him in the next year or so, and if so it is basically an opportunity to change my last name and disappear from public view completely. Should I take it? 

I really enjoy helping others, and I certainly do not envisage stopping the one on one assistance where I can, but quite simply I simply want to be seen - day in / day out - as the woman I am now and not judged on my past. I do feel sometimes though that this is a selfish thought . . . *sigh*.

AirRaidJade,asktransgender,Need feedback QUICK! Possible opportunity - is it time to come out?,"This morning as I was taking a shower before work, I shaved my arms. I was in a hurry and accidentally scraped some skin off my elbow with the razor. I put a bandaid on it and went to work. When I got back home this evening, I joined my family at the table for supper. My mom spotted the bandaid and asked what happened. I told her I scraped it on something. My dad went ""Razor?"" I laughed and said yeah.

Then he said something I didn't expect. He said, ""You know, some of the girls you work with have more hair on their arms than you do. Androgyny as a quality does not necessarily mean hairless arms.""

""Androgyny"" is what caught me off-guard. I'm nonbinary, and I identify as androgynous and strive for an androgynous appearance. What he said hit *extremely* close to home for me, and the way he said it was so nonchalant, like it was nothing. I asked if he'd been spying on me. He said ""No, I live with you, I see you every day, I see what you do and I see what you look like, so unless my eyes are deceiving me...""

I left it at that because I wasn't sure what to do. I've been planning on coming out to my parents anyway. I had this plan in mind for how I'd do it, too. I want to do it soon, perhaps in the next 1 - 3 months. But that little exchange this evening is making me rethink that. Since my dad has an idea about what's going on, and apparently my appearance is obvious enough as a clue, I'm thinking... maybe I should come out today? While this is all still fresh in his mind? I see an opportunity here, and I'm wondering if I should take it. Thoughts?

I'm to the point of almost going crazy and wanting to transition for sexual reasons alone. I don't have an issue w/ my body and my current life situation as I'm not depressed and pretty happy. Where I am confused and frustrated is my sexuality/sex life. I have really no desire to have sex as a guy as it feels wrong and doesn't do anything for me. Since puberty I've always fantasized sexually in a female body and can't w/ imagining as a guy. 

I feel at this point I am almost willing to accept I'll never have a sex life and as a result never have a relationship due to this and this makes me very depressed and frustrated. I don't really think I want to be a girl in everyday life though so I have no idea what to do!"

I told myself that I'd come out at 18 but I didn't because it gets more difficult as you grow older and I was sick of pretending to be someone I wasn't. So I tried to be myself, and that backfired cause then no one let me be myself.

My mom bribed me with plastic surgery, my best friend keeps using my problems (of my gender dysphoria and unsupportive parents) to make his problems seem less bad so he gets pity points, there's twats in my school that call me both my masculine and feminine name in some weird mix as if I'm an alien.

Today I went to school, it was my first day. Still had to wear a fucking skirt because my parents are still in that dickhead phase. An asshole in my class called me both Noah and Naomi at the same time and I found myself in uncontrollable rage but didn't do anything about it.

Another boy in one of my classes thought it was acceptable to yell ""ARE YOU CALLED NOAH NOW????"" When the class was quiet. Who the fuck does he think he is? I know it's a legitimate question but you don't fucking yell at the top of your lungs when asking someone that. 

The teacher I was planning to tell about my problems doesn't teach any of my classes anymore so I don't want to go to her because it feels awkward. The other transguy in my year has supportive parents and has his shit together. He's already planning to wear the boy's uniform next year and I can't even get my parents to mention the fact that I'm trans.

People won't take me seriously if I'm not wearing the boys' uniform next year and they'll assume that I'm just saying I'm transgender for attention even though they don't know the damn story that I want to, but I'm not allowed to. 

I'm planning to tell my mom that she either has a suicidal, depressed daughter or a happy son. I'm being serious cause I'm on the brink of snapping. This is stupid too because I had a really morbid thought of killing myself to make my mom feel guilty but I'd never actually do that cause I'm a pussy.

My CAMHS appointment is on the 6th and I'm not even sure they can help. I can feel the storm of mental instability coming and I'm just sitting here doing nothing.

Thank you. Thank you all. I truly believe I'm finally ready to move on and accept myself. I had been spending the past few months in pain trying to deny myself and what I have wanted to be all along.  I hate living as I currently am, and stuck being male makes me sad right now. But I'm also excited because no matter what I'm looking to the future. The future where I can finally be who I want to be.  I've realized that no matter how good my life could be, if I'm not living it as Myself then it's pointless. 

I no longer have to worry because deep in my heart I know who I am, and I'm going to make sure I live my life as who I am.


But onto the advice, I intend to come out to my parents and start HRT in a few months (and maybe even graduate as A woman). But, until then I gotta be doing something I gotta be making progress, I'm gonna start shaving my legs and working on my voice, but I also have a weight issue. I'm in the 250-300 pound range and I need to fix that ASAP. I want to start taking care of myself. But I don't have access to a gym (not that pumping iron would benefit me anyway).

What can I do, aside from literally starving myself, to get fit in a few months(or at least less fat) that's free and can be done any time of the year?"
ReimiS,asktransgender,"""Holy crap your hair, you look like a girl!""

I was in boy mode, which is basically a ball cap, ponytail and baggy tshirt (but Girl Jeans because they are so comfy :3) Immediately after the greeting she blurts out the above, which puts both me and my Mom into a bit of laughter since we were talking just 5 minutes prior about how I looked in my recent photo I took for my timeline. I wrote the hair off as an eventual donation for a wig, seemed to work. 

This person does know my Mom, and will probably ask her about me. (they see each other frequently) My Mom is kinda worried that she is just gonna ask flat out if I am trans and is trying to figure out how to respond. Any tips to help her? She doesn't want to out me if I'm not ready for it, but is worried about being put on the spot.

ethanchow00,asktransgender,[MtF 15]How to come out to parents?,"Sorry for the long post but here it goes: So all my life I've known that I was somehow different from the cis boys around me, and I remember liking a lot of girl things and even right out saying that I wanted to be a girl when I was very young. At about 9 or 10 though, I completely shut those feelings in the closet and tried to forget them as best as I could because I got bullied at school for it. It wasn’t until early this year that I found out what transgenderism is and how there were other people like me. I was at first in complete denial, but have slowly began to understand that I am likely trans as I did more research. The tipping point was when I read someone (I don’t remember who) on r/asktransgender say that cis people don’t have any doubts about being trans. Also read that if you hope the COGIATI and other tests say that you are trans, then you are likely trans. I got a 205 - probable transsexual on it answering completely honestly if that happens to be relevant. I also took a bunch of other “gender identity quiz” type things and they all said androgynous or female. 

It was within the past month that I realized that I am likely MtF trans and not just gay or non-binary or something else. I’m really scared to come out to my parents, I have a feeling that they won’t accept me, but after talking with some people I realized that it’s not as bad as I think it is. If I look it objectively, they have no real reason to not accept me. I may just be a coward and full of it. Every time I try to bring it up, I have self-doubts again and back out of it. Like when I’m reading books and stuff online on being trans, I am really sure that I’m trans, but when I actually have to say it out loud to my parents I get really scared and just back out and cry. Any ideas how to come out? 

TL;DR I wanted to be a girl from very young but only recently came to terms about being transgender. I keep backing out of coming out to my parents.

xolovenate,asktransgender,Worried about being alone.,"(Mtf, pre everything) So when I told my boyfriend of 2.5ish years that I was planning to transition, he told me that he couldn't be with me any longer because he strictly likes men. It's understandable but gosh, it really hurts. He told me to tell him when I decide whether I will be transitioning or not, because he ""knows this relationship wont work out, so we should just end it."" But at this point, I'm pretty much dead set on transitioning. It's something I've wanted for years, before I even knew him. I guess I'm just prolonging the inevitable? I mean we hang out so often. And we text all day if we aren't together. Imagining life without that is painful... Before him, I was so lonely for years. I never had a real boyfriend, never had any dates. I thought it was something wrong with me, and now that I'm about to lose him, I'm terrified of being lonely again. And genuinely worried that I won't find anyone who makes me feel loved and happy like he does. He said he would support me and be there for me as a friend, so that's good I guess, better than nothing...but I don't know. Maybe its just silly but I'm worried no one will love me again. I can't imagine how it will be trying to find a significant other as a trans woman. It was hard enough for me as a man. "
pherhaps,asktransgender,Does this mean I am not trans?,"Hey guys,
So, at the moment I identify as MtF. One thing that worries me is this. While, yes, right now I would like to be a girl, it is wierd. I wouldn't mind my gender at an early age, but I would only mind my gender at an older age, (like right now, I am 14), since that is when puberty starts and secondary sex characteristics appear. Does this mean I am not trans, because I wouldn't mind at an early age (and possibly not at very old ages)?"

This means that for months now I've had more than three times the estrogen in my system than would ever be experienced during the peak of a normal menstrual cycle. Three times more than the statistically distributed upper bound of the peak, that is.

My doctor has *suggested* that this might be responsible for my depression. For all my sobbing outbursts of late. Gee doc, ya think? This is *dangerous*.

A few months ago, he actually *decreased* my dosage from weekly 30 mg IM injections to 20. Why he had me on 30, I'll never know, but that coincided with the one time I had to call a suicide hotline. Things did improve after that, but he never followed up with labs to see if the levels got down to where they should be. I kind of had to take the initiative on that one myself.

Gotta say I'm kinda pissed about the incompetence on display here. This has been incredibly painful at times. 

I don't really have a question, just wanted to say you have to get informed and advocate for yourselves because your doctor's MD is no guarantee.

Smapps_,asktransgender,"Trans Parent, Tough Questions. How do I answer these?","So my wife and I were out with our amazing three year old daughter. I'm out full time and pass so I don't run into issues these days but we had a situation hit us both in the face out of nowhere.

We were chatting nicely to a woman and she asked us about how we had our daughter. She was totally polite, but we both realized we had NO idea how to respond to this without outing me or telling a big long lie.

Later at home we also realized another thing. My daughter is three, and she's honestly only ever known her mommy. But how do we explain this to her? My wife hates the idea of telling some elaborate lie to her, only to tell her later in life what really happened when she needs to know for her medical records. I don't want her to have to go through a bunch of things trying to figure this out because she hasn't known anything else.

blynng,asktransgender,Is it transphobic to dislike post-op genitals?,"The answer I think (like every other question like this) is: not inherently but it can be depending on the underlying reason.

If someone dislikes reconstructed genitals in general, thus applying their attitude to cis and trans people alike, it's not transphobic.

If someone dislikes the reconstructed genitals of trans people but does not apply this attitude to cis people, that's transphobic.

If a straight person dislikes the reconstructed genitals of trans people because it uses tissues from a sex organ they are not attracted to, I would say that's actually homophobic not transphobic. (Of course this could be combined with the previous paragraph for a double discrimination whammy.)"

tanzanite_robber,asktransgender,Is this appropriation of trans* voices?,"Hi there! This is my first post on this forum so please let me know if I'm breaking any rules (and apologies if I do). I am a member of the LGBTQ+ community myself; I identify as an AFAB queer person of colour who is mostly attracted to those of her same sex. I am also comfortable with both she/her and they/them pronouns and think the term ""agender"" best suits my gender identity, but I hesitate in using the ""trans*"" label for myself.

I am currently taking a screenwriting course and have an idea for a short film that involves trans* kids as main characters. Basically, it's about an AFAB trans* boy who is forced to be the flower girl of a wedding and tries to sabotage his frilly white dress in rehearsal to no effect. Then, he finds out that the ringbearer is an AMAB trans* girl. They become friends and switch outfits just before the actual wedding, performing each other's wedding roles, much to the surprise of the adult audience.

My question is: would my telling this story as a non-trans* person be problematic? If relevant, pronouns would not be used in the actual film, only on the screenplay. This is a 5-7 page short and is by no means meant to express big philosophical idea about gender and identity. The plot is simple, and as a not-quite-gender-conforming-individual myself, I can 100% relate to the discomfort in wearing gendered clothing. Also, if I were to produce this film eventually (which is not impossible, but unlikely, since screenwriting is more of a hobby right now), I would ABSOLUTELY ask the help of trans* directors, creators, and actors. (In fact, I know quite a few!).

Thoughts? Thanks in advance!"
f30bim,asktransgender,Am I being clocked or getting checked out?,"I feel like I have this feeling every day. A lot of you can probably relate! I'm almost 8 months on hormones and I'm naturally very small boned so I do come off as a skinny girl. I pass 100% of the time, assuming that people aren't just using correct pronouns just to be nice and supportive. However, I feel like it's easy to tell I'm trans to an observant onlooker considering how small my hips are for a 19 year old.

Anyway, I'm honestly so confused on whether people are clocking me or checking me out. On one hand, the majority of people that stare at me are guys. I have strangers trying to have a short little chat with me every now and then. On the other hand, some guys give me a mocking smirk like they can tell I'm trans and they're entertained. These men tend to be older and I'm guessing that older men are more aware of trans people, especially in the large, liberal city I live in.

I ignore this and keep scanning. Then he says a bit gruffly ""You didn't hear what I said?"" I look up and say ""I did."" ""You just don't care do you"" he says back... At this point I'm pretty upset, uncomfortable and panicking internally, but I play it off. After a long pause, I scrunch up my face into a wince and say ...""Not really."" ""Are ya gonna tie it into a ponytail?"" He then said. ""No...just growing it out."" I replied. That was the end of the conversation, and I finished bagging his stuff and tried to be as polite as possible, after our awkward exchange. My hair is nearing shoulder length and to be honest pretty shaggy and unkempt and I have to keep moving it out of my face every 15 seconds while I'm at work. Maybe he was just trying to give me crap because I still am very much gendered male 70% of the time I'm at work. I think he may be a policeman or an expoliceman because I feel like I've seen a badge in his wallet from previous occasions. Maybe he's just coming from that environment where guys should either have a 1 or a 2 haircut. I've always felt a little uncomfortable around him even before I started transition.

-------------------------------------------------------
There's something I want to clear up in regards to being trans. I was never male before being a woman. I've always been a woman.

Now you may be thinking ""BUT YOU HAD A PENIS!!!!"" and my response is ""yeah so what?"". Think about it, there are women who born without a uterus or ovaries and have a small pocket as a vagina. They are still considered women. I was a woman born without a uterus, ovaries or a vagina. So why aren't I a woman also? Why do we draw the line at a few folds of skin?
What about the women who are born intersex and have an enlarged clitoris and no vaginal canal, uterus or ovaries either? They would be still considered female. Why aren't I?


The point is the body is just that. A body. It doesn't determine the soul of a person, the identity of a person. If a person is born with the identity of a female that makes her female. They might have been raised male but they were always female on the inside.


I was RAISED a male but I was not born a male."

Before I could pass--that is, before I started using a feminine voice--I began going to a weekly social function in an attempt to both meet people and gain some confidence. I'm now integrating myself fairly well within this group, and people are generally very respectful and nice--even welcoming.

How do you deal with people who know you're trans? Not the people, really, but just the reality of people knowing that you're not a cis woman? It makes me paranoid that they'll view and treat me differently than they would a cis woman. I suppose I just want to be normal--to be seen and treated as normal--and I fear I've given up that ability. "

Yesterday, I finally managed talking to my girlfriend about my trans issues, after we ignored it for a couple of weeks.
She seems quite supportive, although she says she can't have a relationship with a woman. 
During our talk, she said that if I want HRT, I should go for it. She really meant it, but didn't say that I'm going to lose her afterwards, which is pretty obvious.

I told her I'd be to afraid to start, and afraid of losing her.
Even though I've always wanted to transition asap, I really have my doubts right now. I can't say if I'm too afraid to take this step (am I really trans? Why me? Will I pass?...) or if I'm afraid of losing her. I can't make up my mind.

Good grades and decent at sports. People would praise me but I insisted that I sucked. This could be seen as getting attention but I think it was because I didn't feel like I deserved the praise. Everyone started hitting puberty except me. Eventually I was put on T to induce puberty (wish this never happened now). Life became less and less fun as I pretended to understand the whole male thing and getting girls. I had twisted my mind into thinking that I was doing alright, but everything was awkward and I didn't really get close to anyone except for a select few. And even then I felt like I relied on social queues of who to be. I was depressed but didn't admit it to myself. I would always have hope that my good grades and university would open up opportunities for me finally. University came and the realization that university wouldn't solve my problems soon hit. I met the first androgynous person at uni and it awoken something in me. I started looking up gay and transgender stuff. I realized that one or both of these things is me.

I lived in my head, isolated myself and had a breakdown and had to withdraw from University. It's been a descent into hell since then, loss of friends, loss of mental health, loss of dignity. I feel like people don't tell me the truth because I couldn't take it. They leave hints on facebook and the like that are too coincidental to not be about me. This could be paranoia but the fact is I feel worthless, I'm trying to find a reason to like myself but it's hard. I'm not proud of my story and I don't expect sympathy, but if any of this resonates with anyone let me know. I'm starting to realize that transition is possible, and that maybe it's still possible to love myself and all of my past and flaws. I'm at the point where I'm like fuck it, I should try hrt. I know it's not a fix all but my life can't get much worse. PS I'm in counseling and addressing these issues."
fivetenash,asktransgender,How Can I Be the Best Supportive Friend I Can Be?,"A really good friend of mine came out officially recently. I want to there for them, and be as supportive as I can be. I'm sure it's a very scary experience for them, and I know my accidental mis-gender mishaps, are frustrating (although not frequent, I'm trying to speak slower to sort of catch myself before I say something).  I don't want to completely barrage my friend with questions. I know that being a WOC, and sometimes the only WOC in some spaces, asking a billion questions can be annoying in its own way. So I was wondering, what are some good resources I could check out or read to deepen my own understanding of transgender issues and experiences, while learning how to support and be there for my friend? 

Thank you!

Samara_blue,asktransgender,Anyone have experience with how HRT affects health insurance claims?,"So I have a insurance policy for critical illness which I signed before I realized I was trans. I'm worried though that starting HRT will mean I'll get denied if I ever try to make a claim.

Basically if I get any of the major or minor illnesses they list I get to make a claim for 50k. But I'm worried that being on HRT I'll be denied since it increases my risk of certain health effects like blood clots, etc. Does anyone have any experience with health insurance companies and making claims while on HRT? I imagine even if I can make a claim it's going to be a battle regardless. I signed the policy until I'm 65 but could cancel now even though I sunk some money into it already and I'd lose out on getting that back since my policy is a return on premium. I'd just rather cancel now instead of finding out years down the road that I can't make claims anymore. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, especially from someone who has experienced this before. "
Mummtwoxs,asktransgender,Advice?,"I have known for quite some time that my fiancé is attracted to trans women. I discovered this when he accidentally took a screenshot while watching porn back in 2014. I am VERY understanding and accepting. I understand trans women ARE women. So When I confronted him about it, I explained my openness. He still denied it for awhile. That is, until I discovered emails from him addressed to trans women he had found on Craigslist. When I confronted him, He had said it was simply an attraction and he only emails them because he gets off from the thrill. 
Fast forward to last year. In a fit of guilt, he admitted he had been talking to multiple trans women on Craigslist, kik, as well as other dating sites. He also admitted to meeting up with many of them and receiving oral sex from them, and even had intercourse with one person. 
I have children with my fiancé, and I have tried to be understanding. But there is CLEARLY a difference in having an attraction, and acting on it. 
He has begged me to stick around for the sake of our family. But I don't know where to go from here. "

throwawaytransgirl24,asktransgender,"Brow Ridge, Hair Transplant? Both?","Hi guys and girls!

I wanted to ask some of you about hairline transplants, HRT, and brow ridges. I've just started HRT, I'm 24 years old and I'm really excited. But I have no idea what to do with my hairline. I want to come out in about 6 months or so. My hairline isn't too bad but it's not round either. I want to rounden it so I'm not sure when I should do the transplant. So here are 3 questions I would love to hear your feedbacks on.

1. I've heard that when you get the transplant, the hair always falls out and regrows and it looks weird and red for like a few months. Is that true? If so, should I get the transplant now? so that it grows to normal length for 6 months with the rest of my hair? Because I don't want to have 10"" long hair and super short edges around my face when I come out. If that can be avoided I would like that. Or can you get the transplant using long hair and have the long hair just naturally stay there? So I can just get it when I come out.

2. Brow Ridge! I have a brow ridge but it's not that big at all. It's pretty normal, if not just a bit bigger than when I look at other girls with brow ridges like Kendall Jenner, or Meghan Fox even. I think the amount they could shave off, vs having a scar at the hairline is a tradeoff. What do you think? Is the brow ridge something that's essential to passing?

3. Last question, about HRT. I know it's all bone at the brow ridge but I've seen that a lot of girls on HRT have it become less pronounced. How is that? Have you noticed anything? Maybe I'll just wait and see? And what about the hairline, did HRT rounden it a lot if you started at around 24 years old? Did you notice anything?"
CaptainToodleButt,asktransgender,Has anyone else became extremely self conscious of their appearance?,"Ever since I realised I was trans (so around 10-11, I'm 13 now) I also realised I've became so self conscious on how I look in public. Like super self conscious. 

I would worry about my hair, like if I'm in need of a haircut, I'll be stressing over how flat my hair lies on the sides- cause they stick out when they get too long) and then I'll get self conscious about going to the barbers because my hair is really dry from bleaching and I don't want him to think my hair is really nasty.

I'd be really concerned on how flat my chest is and every time I walk past a shop, I look at my reflection and check how flat my chest is. Then when I'm looking in the mirror I'll be like ""holy crap my thighs are freaking massive!"" Just because they touch and they're not like a thin cisguy's legs (which are stick thin).

When I walk past a group of teenagers that are my age or older-sometimes even kids younger than me- I get anxious that I'll be clocked or that they might call me a ""chink"". My heart beats really hard, I walk twice as fast as I usually and I try to ""look brave.""

I worry that my nose is really oily and I question if people judge me because I have a few spots on my forehead or if I have blackheads on my nose. Every time I smile, I remind myself to stop because my teeth aren't white and they're stained because I drink a lot of tea.

I don't wear the boy's uniform in school and I'm forced to wear the girl's uniform and I absolutely hate going anywhere but school in the uniform. It's like the worse thing for me because there is no way I pass (I **have** to wear a skirt, no way around it) and sometimes people think I'm MtF so I get shit for that too.

Sinking even lower now, when I walk I get insecure about my thighs cause they jiggle a little (though a lot of it is muscle from field hockey and running) and my arms jiggle too and I absolutely hate it.

My posture is horrible when I don't wear my binder.

I am not comfortable at all in my body and I can't tell my parents cause they're so bent on the fact that they think I'm just confused and they keep comparing me to my dad's cousin who happened to be a tomboy but then got more feminine and I don't have the courage to tell them ""no, this is different"" because of anxiety.

A lot of people would be like ""holy shit dude, it isn't hard to tell them that"" but they don't know that it's ten times more difficult to even bring up the fact that I'm trans to my parents cause it's practically me asking for an argument."
Throwawaytrans14312,asktransgender,Sugar daddy paying for transition?,"I can't believe I'm posting this, but hey, life is full of firsts. So, as it happens, I have a pretty good figure and face naturally that would look absolutely outstanding with a few surgeries (boob job, minor FFS, and of course SRS). It'll take a while to save up for those, though. After reading stories about sugar daddies paying for girls' transitions, my brain kept getting drawn back to the idea. I'm still *far* from sure it's something I would want, but I had to post this just to satisfy my curiosity.

&amp;nbsp;

So, I'm wondering if anybody has had any good experiences with a sugar daddy (or mommy) paying for transition? What was the arrangement like? How happy were you with it, over all? If it's over, did you part amicably, and what's your relationship now?

On top of this I've talked to my friends about this, and have gotten overwhelming support from them, and have been encouraged to start my transition at school. However, this is in direct contrast to what my parents think I should do. 

They are under the impression that this ""is a phase"" or ""I'm just confused"" and want me to move slowly, and not to do anything I can't take back.

At the same time I really want to start HRT (both because my window for maximun effect is closing and the sooner I start the sooner everything will develop), but, of course, my parents are not on board with this. Furthermore, now that I've realized what my problem is, my dysphoria has been getting worse and worse. :/

I guess my question is like, how do I convince my parents that this (HRT and transioning in general) is something I am serious about, and something I honestly want to do? "

They sent me photos etc so I'm sure that this isn't some crazy thing to try and get us to break up or whatever alternative motive they might have.

I met him online when I was 16. We were friends for 3 years, falling in love along the way. We got married in 2014 so I could run away from home and move to his country.

He was the reason I got out of a suicidal phase and made my transition a lot better. (we had a long distance relationship for 2 years)
I found my first job, and bascically got my life together with his support. I feel I owe him my life, seriously.

And I love him, with all my heart. But he, since quitting his last job in 2013, doesn't want to work ever again. (if he doesn't absolutely have to) And he hasn't worked ever since.

He does everything for me at home, cooking, groceries, cleaning. That's great. And giving me emotional support when I have my bad mood swings.

But I am the breadwinner, and when I get the SRS I will not be able to work for maybe 6 months. And I am uncertain of our financial future.

I feel overwhelmed sometimes just thinking about our situation, and so I mostly just ignore those negative thoughts.

**Got any advice for me?**

Edit: Another thing that bothers me:
He's saying, as long as I'm not stable enough to support myself emotionally, he can't get a job.
I feel so bad for being the reason we don't have enough money to save.
And I'm afraid of being alone, when I think about leaving him...
When I talk about him getting a job, it always ends with him saying it isn't possible because of me, and his bad experiences with jobs. And I get frustrated and just leave him be.

**TL;DR: He says I'm the reason he can't get a job. This is frustrating. I'm afraid of being alone though.**"

I'm beginning to face this problem would anyone like me to document my progress and where?","Male, (don't want to put my exact age so (18-21). 

Ok, here's the deal.  I'll put some history out for better understanding, then ask. 

Here's the TLDR but still kind of long:
 Since I was twelve I've fantasized about being a girl, it's gotten worse. About 4 months ago, for a month every time I saw a girl, internally I would be thrown into turmoil (so much so it physically hurt) about wanting to be a girl. Went overseas and for a month I legitimately thought my body was turning into a girl, like thought I was my male genitalia were turning into a female's as well as my personalty and physical features (not a therapist but from DSM-5 it sounds like Psychosis). During and 3 months after that was insanely depressed. (A few years ago I had a suicide attempt so depression wasn't new it just escalated like to a bitch). Depression is still there for long periods of time and off for a few days or so. I came out to two people but and though they didn't condemn me they weren't necessarily accepting or helpful (which the helpful part I understand, they aren't expected to be helpful). So I'm pretty scarred by that since I lived with them for a year, and they just brushed what I told them off. 

Moving on, I recently found the phrase (gender dysphoria) this week, and this week has been a fucking ride as a lot of things in my life from childhood to know make sense. Such as using porn as an outlet, and nicotine to try and curb the edge.  I'm going to see a therapist hopefully soon, I'm at the phase where I'm trying to make sense of this, as well I am finally facing this damn thing instead of only trying to repress it. Now that all the background is out, I have two questions. 1. It seems like all of the treatments I see are for transitioning, or hormones. Is there a way to treat this making it go away? The community I'm in though I love them would not accept me for transitioning, as well I'm still not sure I'd be ok letting everyone see I'm a guy who wants to be a girl I just wan't to be comfortable with my body and personality now. 2. Now that I'm starting to face this would anyone like me to document what happens, and if so where should I? (I think it'd be cool for people who haven't come out or are still repressing see someone attempting to deal with it realtime.

IowaGirl92,asktransgender,Any other trans people suffer from eating disorders?,"I've been on-and-off anorexic for the past 10 years.

Probably the worst I ever was was senior year of high school where I weighed 125 lbs. I'm 6'2'', so that's about 20 lbs under the lower end of a healthy BMI.

Eventually my parents intervened and started forcing me to eat more, and I stabilized at about 155 lbs.

Since going back to college however I've stopped eating as much (parents are no longer around forcing me to) and I've been dropping like a rock. I was 139 this morning when I weighed myself. Down over 15 lbs in just a little over a month.

I'm non-transitioning and have no desire to, but being super thin makes me feel a bit less dysphoric I suppose.

NerdyTeacher,asktransgender,Was I sexually assaulted?,"TW: Possible Sexual Assault?

So I've been mulling this over, what happened to me Monday. I don't know what to make of it?

My roommate/BFF was in the hospital. I was in a pit of utter despair, not having slept in a day, so I went over to my good friend, the hookup app on my phone to go cruising.

There was a guy I had been talking to on Grindr, a gay dating app that I still use cause I figure I might have better luck with bi and bi-curious guys. I'm a trans woman. I got a hit. He was interested in a date. So 3:00 in the afternoon we meet up, we talk for a bit and I invite him in to my apartment to fuck him. I give him a brief tour and then talk to him about safe sex, using condoms. He's straight, so I tell him about Truvada. He's not that interested in talking and so we go to my bedroom.

We get into it, I point out that I have condoms and lube on the table but he doesn't stop. He gets really aggressive and forceful with me, pinning me to the bed. ""Ok"" I think.""This is different."" He starts humping me with his penis trying to penetrate and I say ""wait, you need to use a condom and lube."" He doesn't stop. 

I say, ""anal hurts if you don't use lube, let's take this a little slower."" He says it doesn't hurt him which is a no duh but ""It hurts me."" He relents long enough to put lube in me, hastily but he doesn't put a condom on.
""Condom! CONDOM! On the table! Right there!"" He keeps going without putting a condom on and I get to thinking, ""Well I guess I just need to bite this pillow and think of England since this is a thing that is now happening to me."" He asks me if he could choke me and I'm like ""fuck no!"" and I'm scared he's going to do it anyway. Within a couple minutes he cums in my asshole.

I leave the room to shit it all out. He claims he put a condom on and flushed it right afterwards but I didn't see him do it nor did I hear him open the wrapper, I also felt him cum inside me which makes me think he was remembering things wrong the way lots of people seem to remember things wrong when they want to hurt me.

He asks if he can play with my PS4 and I let him while I take care of things in the bathroom. Annoyed as hell that he didn't do what I fucking told him.

Honestly I was a fucking idiot and I was thinking with my libido. I was the one who got myself into the situation going cruising. I should have paid heed to the risks. I should have done more research instead of trying to break my depression with a quick lay.

I didn't use the R-word to describe what he did to me until Friday when I told someone else the story. I mean, I DID want to have sex with him but I wanted him to use protection and to go slower so that it wouldn't hurt and you know actually respect my boundaries. I described it as him exceeding his permissions and fucking me beyond his permission and then thought about it.

I don't feel traumatized or anything like someone is supposed to. I'm more annoyed and indignant that someone would do that. I mean, what an asshole.
I think I am going to be okay but that did teach me a lesson that I should be a lot more careful, especially with men."

XNargaHunter,asktransgender,Tips for dealing with potentially gatekeeper-y therapist,"So I went to a clinic last week that was supposedly informed consent. While there, the doctor said that he preferred his patients to be actively engaged with a therapist because he wasn't really there for that sort of support, being a medical doctor. He also stated that most of his patients had spent months or years in therapy before beginning HRT. He did seem to stress that therapy was not a requirement tho. Had blood test, thought I was good to go.

I said I'd be okay with seeing a therapist, tho I assumed this would be in addition to HRT. So he set me up with a referral.

Next day I get a call from the counselor about meeting, I explain that I need to know how much it will cost without insurance _(yaay BCBS excluding trans services!)_ so my wife and I could budget for it. I also say that I can't really meet until ~5:30 because we're in a release crunch at work. They say they'll check and get back to me.

This week I had to call the office because a) the counselor completely forgot about me and b) they gave me the wrong number for the financial person. They apologize and then we talk about possibly meeting tomorrow.

They then said this: ""I see the doctor put Gender Identity Disorder on your chart, that's different from being trans and transitioning, you know?"" In the first call they had also said, ""we just need to make sure you're transgender, and it's not something else"".

So apparently I'm not capable of determining who I am? Others have to make that decision for me? What in the fucking, godforsaken, coldest part of the ninth circle of hell in a tea party with Cthulhu!? Yes I'm non-frelling-binary, but I'll go nuts if I have to keep running on T _(see previous outburst)_. I've been dealing with this for a decade and a half, pretty sure I have a good idea what my deal is -.-

So, how do people deal with therapists who feel the need to judge if one is ""trans enough""? I know ""lying-through-your-teeth"" is semi popular, but if there are any other tactics, I'd love to here them. The doctor himself seems nice enough, so I'd like to avoid burning bridges in a storm of dragon fire..."

WitchDearbhail,asktransgender,How did you come out to your parents? (Also open to parents of trans),"My current plan for telling my parents is at some point when I'm at their house I'll tell them that I have something important that I need to tell them both, tell them what I can, and then give them my letter which says the same things along with some new information and resources.

However I watched a video recently where a parent was asked how they were told and if they wished they were told differently.  They said they were told over the phone and they liked that way.

So, open for everyone, even parents, how did you tell your parents (or how were you told) and what were the results?

Sammie1488,asktransgender,How to deal with unaccepting and religious parents?,"EDIT: wrote something up that made a little more sense on another forum so just going to post that instead


I'd figure this is a good place to vent, I'm usually just a lurker on this site but I'm going through some shit and I feel writing out/organizing my thoughts would help, so uh here it goes.


Ever since I hit puberty I've been depressed and uncomfortable with myself, when I was younger, I wasn't really sure why. Although when I was probably 14 or so I came across a wikipedia article or something on transgender people. After reading it I became overwhelmed with fear, because what I was reading described how I felt perfectly. My family is very religious, especially my mother. And at thay point my depression got so severe I was borderline suicidal, and naturally my parents were worried so they put me in a mental hospital. When I got out I was so terrified of going back I learned to hide any signs of depression and I started lifting weights in an attempt to suppress my feelings about myself. That ended up being a mistake, keeping all of this shit bottled up for years fucked me up to the point to where about 6 months ago everything that's been eating away at me for so long I flunked out of my first semester of college. After that I was a neet for several months until I finally got a job because my parents were bitching at me, which they have every right to do I should be contributing in some way. Anyway a few days ago I had a terrible breakdown, started crying and cutting my self for hours. When I calmed down my mom started talking to me and wanted to figure out why I was depressed for half my life. There was no way I could let her know that I want to be a girl, so I just told her that I didn't know, she didn't buy it. So at that point it was a guessing game for her, she started throwing out reasons I could be depressed, eventually she asked me if I wanted to be a girl. I froze for a second and managed to mutter out a yes. I don't remember her reaction honestly I think I was in shock my self that I actually let someone know. The next morning when I woke up I had a long talk with my mom and dad about this. My dad seems to think that this is something that can be fixed by going to a counselor or taking antidepressants. Honestly I think he's just having trouble processing this. My mom on the other hand is just batshit crazy, she thinks I'm possessed by a demon and that this is gods punishment for them because they didn't study the bible enough. So my situation right now is like this: My dad agreed to let me go to an informed consent clinic for hormones (he wants to come along and talk to the doctor) if I agreed to go to this christian counselor with him. He doesn't want me to transition though because I have 4 siblings and he feels that it would screw them up. I'm pretty much forced to do what he says because I don't have a car and I walk to work. My family is pretty well off so there's no way I could afford to live anywhere close to this part of town, and if I don't live in this area I can't get to work, and if I can't get to work I'm homeless.

I doubt anyone here has dealt with anything like this but if anyone has any advice I would appreciate it."
WillowJP,asktransgender,How did you feel or react when others started referring to you by your preferred gender name and pronouns in real life?,"I've yet to build up the courage to come to a trans meeting dressed up and I'm not on HRT yet.

Texas-Kangaroo-Rat,asktransgender,Do any of y'all feel as though your life stopped a while ago?,"Like for the longest time I've felt like I'm still fifteen or something. I used to think it was because I'm a loser (and I guess it could be) but now that I've realized I'm a woman my perspective about the weird ""what-if nostalgia"" has changed.

Like I really wonder if I were accepted as a girl back then I wouldn't have missed a month of school due to depression and then end up in the ""school prison"" thing and then eventually in the special ed thing.

More and more I've been noticing things like, I have dreams where I'm back in high school only it's not horrible. I've gotten a recent fascination with teenage drama and zaniness (and honestly might make a comic LOL)

That and I have absolutely no interest in ""age appropriate"" clothes. Like I want stuff I woulda worn as a teenager.

Like I think maybe 2% of my friends are my age otherwise everyone I have a common interest with online is closer to 20. =\ I dunno does anyone else feel like your mental age just sorta stopped and transitioning is kinda restartting it again?

HijraShejra,asktransgender,Maybe I've just spent my life trying to be the wrong kind of man,"I've been on HRT for almost a year. It will be my anniversary in just four days.

I like the changes it's made a lot. I've felt a lot closer to my own emotions, and a lot more comfortable in my own skin. I really, really don't want to stop taking it, and even if I detransition, I want to at least take antiandrogens still, if not estrogen, too. I still want to be seen and treated as a female in society, and have all the surgeries, and everything, but maybe there really is a way to learn to love my body the way it is... I mean I've lived for almost 21 years in a mostly male body, why can't I learn to live with it for the rest of my life?

But I think it was wrong of me to try to be a girl.

Before I came out to myself, I was surrounded by extreme toxic masculinity, and tried to live up to it. No wonder I hated being male, if that's what I associated with it. 

When I was little, all the men in my life were awful. They were abusive, neglectful... I've even been sexually assaulted and harassed by men. All the women in my life were amazing, caring people, though, and I think I made the false association that men are all bad and women are all good. Aside from that, I always felt like I identified with the personalities and interests of girls, but society imposed such harsh gender roles on me that I was punished for 'trying to act like them'. So I think I started seeing myself as a girl just because I like 'girly' things. 

Well, boys can like all that stuff, too. You don't have to be a boy or a girl to like certain things...

I can still embrace my more 'feminine' qualities as a male... There has to be a way I can learn to live with it. No more stressing that I'm not a real woman. It's better to just learn to accept what I have. I don't know how, but I'll find a way.

Thanks for all the support this sub has given me in the past months. I'd be dead without you all."
Katiewonderabout,asktransgender,Non Acceptance disguised as acceptance. Do you guys have any experience with this?,"Hey guys, on a throwaway here.

There is a leidon mutation in my family, but it hasn't been confirmed in me, although i had 2 clots, but thats a long time ago. About 9 years, and i am on blood thinners, besides the medical experts don't seem that as a problem. I can see her worries, but as I see it, its about she has to trust me in what i am doing. 

After a while she came out and said she don't actually trust me, and she would never use my female name or pronouns before she could come with me to the doc.

Am I totally wrong to assume this is a lack of acceptance?

ArmchairContrarian,asktransgender,"If your child came out as trans, would you grieve the ""death"" of the child you thought you had?","Being a parent myself, I'm always interested to read about how parents react to their child coming out as trans.

I can imagine a million thoughts I'd have if my child came out as trans, but grief over losing ""him"" just isn't one of them.

When I'm not having an OCD, I know I'm a woman, it's nothing new to me. And I hate my male body so much... (but that's not the point.) Have you ever heard about people that get really nervous and get intrusive thoughts that they might be transgender, and they compulsively search for an assurance that they are cis? Well, I have literally the opposite.  I often get really annoying thoughts and start thinking about posts of such people and imagining myself that I'm one of them: I feel scared that my transsexuality is just an OCD and I'm really a normal guy. It's really driving me crazy.... :( It started a month or two ago, I don't really remember.

confusedtransbean,asktransgender,Genderbends considered transphobic? Why/Why not?,"There's a post on tumblr going around currently that claims all genderbent art is inherently transphobic. It's gotten me into some trouble (with cis people calling me transphobic/fake) solely because I personally believed that they weren't done with trans people in mind at all and it was a lot more transphobic to assume that drawing  stereotypical genderbent art of characters and slapping the ""trans"" label on it was better.

Here's the post in question. (Which I hope is okay to add?) http://joltick.tumblr.com/post/135426333885/why-genderbends-are-transphobic-a-tldr-version


I also got into an argument about this on tumblr which didn't go quite well. So this is my first question here and probably far from my last (but the rest will be on my main!) 


**Edit**

I've had to drop the topic anyhow and block the other user in question because they were getting far too manipulative for me to be comfortable. They're vague-ing me currently in even more manipulative fashion but thanks to this thread I still feel fairly secure in that they aren't transphobic and I wasn't just trying to be a ""Cis-ally"" in the terms of one of the anons I received.

justathrowaway248928,asktransgender,Shamed and scared,"So I read this post https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/522jf3/am_i_trans/ yesterday and what the OP says is also what I feel like her I thought everyone had thoughts like that maybe they didn't obsess over it but. I have been obsessing about this for about a year but I am now becoming more and more sure that I have only two options that is killing myself or transitioning but killing myself is obviously not an option so I will have to transition. Some girls treated me like a girl online and it felt like I don't take drugs but that is probably how they make you feel I felt so happy about just that ""of course you're a girl"" and so grateful like a would float away. I plan to take care of my body more like nails and hair and skin but I don't know how to get hormones it is very strict in my country they like to make you wait a year if you are lucky and I am already 22 I don't want to wait. Does this sound good (that is I mean transgender) or bad (not transgender)?

One thing that still bugs me and makes me feel fake and disgusting is the thing most of you probably had or still have. I can understand that when I feel aroused that it gets hard and that it feels ""nice"" if you stimulate it by touching (I never intentionally get it like that it just happens I don't touch it to stimulate just to adjust it like having keys in your pocket is annoying but depending how they lie they can be more or less annoying). I can understand that but it also gets hard just for no reason this is even worse than just having it there I feel so fucked up how can I ever be a girl if I am like that. Does anyone else feel like this (I hope you understand me I don't like to talk about it I wish noone knew I had it so I am a bit vague)?"
RefreshToken,asktransgender,Getting HRT from a physician?,"I figured out I'm trans about two months ago. I told the psych I see for anxiety issues, she referred me to a gender therapist, who I've been talking to weekly since then. I'm now looking to get on HRT. Due to very long wait times at the HRT clinics and endocrinologists near me, I'm thinking of going through a physician. I'm due for a yearly checkup and was looking for a new physician anyway, and my research turned up one near me who, at least anecdotally, is very trans-friendly and is apparently willing to prescribe HRT instead of referring to an endocrinologist. I know this sounds silly, but what exactly do I do? When I call to make the appointment, do I just say I'm looking for a physical, and then mention it in the appointment? Or do I specifically tell the receptionist on the phone that I'm looking for HRT? I'm leaning toward the former because I'm horribly anxious that I'll get a transphobic receptionist or something.

Also how does the endocrinologist tie in to this (I know they do the blood work but really am not familiar with what goes on)? Does the therapist have to recommend one for you to see one?

MissDaisy9001,asktransgender,Dropping dosage prior to SRS?,"So on Bowers' website. It states that they recommend their patients dropping their dosage to as low as possible prior to SRS. They mention they've done this since 2003 without incident. They seem to think making patients completely discontinue HRT isn't good for their mental well being among other things. 

Now my question is, what is the lowest dosage? My doctor recommended that I stop Estrogen completely. I am really not looking forward to that. Would there be any risk if say I dropped my dosage to 1mg or .5mg a day? I can't drop any lower, my pills can be split in half, but there is no way to tell one quarter of one. Also, would it be recommended I stick with sublingual, or should I switch to oral to lower the dosage even further? 

I know my doctor recommended I go off completely, but he isn't as experienced as Bowers, and I assume she would know better.  Would it be advised that I still listen to him? I really don't want to.

Izzabe11e,asktransgender,DAE feel intense dysphoria while masturbating? I don't even do it anymore.,"I literally don't do it anymore, ever. I feel so wrong just getting into that mind set. When I was younger this wasn't as big an issue for some reason, but as I've discovered my own identity more and more, I've felt my libido die more and more.

I now have no sex drive really. I'm sure I could force myself into getting excited, but I have no real urge to even want to. 

Aside from that, I feel so much disgust with what I have between my legs that I just end up crying and having to stop. :/

My significant other came to the conclusion that she identified as non-binary and she thinks (and I agree) that her mom is also non-binary.

&amp;nbsp;

I am not asking necessarily why they do what they do, while that answer would be great, I am really asking because it makes me feel better when I know where my version of things lies. I am very passable, I have no problems with work, public, etc. My parents tend to fuck up my name like all the time and maybe even pronouns when they are like frustrated or stressed. I don't have this problem with like 90% of people and none of the people I've met post transition, which is a lot surprisingly. But all and all it's a little disheartening. I feel like it puts my development on hold because I have to think ""why doesn't this person accept me?"" and then finally come to grips with that my confidence, personality, and true self are what make me--me.

Please, can someone help me to refute this and show that we can be legitimate as men and women without being incoherent or hypocrite? I feel so bad right now, it is difficult for me to think about it without being overflown by my emotions.

**EDIT** (now that I'm less overwhelmed by my feelings): I think that the core question form of the link is ""When should he/she be considered as a man/woman and on what basis?"". For that matter the author reject the notion of gender identity to focus only on biological sex (and by ""biological sex, he means genetics). For him, saying that someone is man because ""he feels like such, it is his gender identity"" is the same as ""I am 7', because I feel like such and this is his my stature (sature being not the same as height, like gender is not the same as sex)"".

There are two possible solutions I think.
The first is to find another way like, someone is a man when arriving at some point in transition. Using this, it is easy to refute his analogies because there is nothing that similar (like, no ""animal transition"", ""maturity transition"" or ""stature transition""); but it would mean to give up the concept of gender identity and saying ""this person isn't a man yet because she hasn't transitioned"".
The other way is to show that the comparisons used are false analogies. I mean, showing that the concept of gender isn't similar to the concept of ""stature"", ""maturity"" or ""animality"". Like, saying why it is okay to consider as ""men"" or ""women"" people ""who feel/identify like such"" and not as "" 7' "" people ""who feel/identify like such""."
Throwaway984287,asktransgender,Not sure if I should carry on with transitioning (MTF).,"So yeah. Getting more and more tempted to detransition due to a host of factors, mostly boiling down to how after 12 months of hrt, I've had next to no changes. Barely any breast growth (Sensitivity and pain is entirely gone), facial changes have been nonexistent and fat redistribution seems to be a myth in my case.



I started hrt at 19 and my levels have either been within the correct range since 4 or so months in. The latest in April had them at 565 oestradiol and next to no testosterone due to being on Decapeptyl injections. However, since about 6 months in to now, there has been no progress whatsoever.



Next week I'm supposed to go to a surgery referral to get dates done, but struggling to see the point. The dysphoria is still as bad as ever and nothing seems to so much as touch it, so going through with a major operation feels like a waste of time and effort. I in no way believe that I was wrong in coming out, but dealing with the misery and humiliation day in and day out just does not seem worth it any more. Plenty of bad thoughts to be had along the way as well.

Tiffany97,asktransgender,What are some fun/worthwhile activities to do for Pre-HRT MTFs before starting transition? (Besides crossdressing alone),"Hey there,
So I'll finally have my car in college in the next couple weeks. That being said, I'll have so much more privacy, freedom, and the temptation to really take the next step forward in possibly transitioning.

It's scary as hell to think about everyday, but I wanna take it slow and use the rest of the year to really solidify my decision. Am I just a crossdresser or would I be more comfortable as a girl?

Some stuff I've considered to start with is renting a motel for a weekend as a girl full time for the weekend, doing whatever.

But besides that, what is there to do that will be the best way to get a feel for being a woman? Clubbing? LGBT clubs? 
I'm in Southern California, San Diego area. Perhaps any locals know some good activities or get togethers?

Tbh I'd be most comfortable doing something with a crowd, a group of other cross dressers or trans women like myself in public or private. If only it was that easy tho!

I talked to my mom about it and was told that if I had been born with female anatomy, I would've been named Gabrielle Noel, I really like this name, I like the simplicity of not needing to change my name much, but I'm not sure I like the idea of people being able to google the name (plus my very unique last name) and having a wealth of information that could end up being potentially harmful...

I like my name... I really do.

Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,Update: Saw Urologist to determine if I'd had any Intersex surgeries as a child,"[This is an update to my original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5119op/im_just_feeling_pissed_off_about_the_secret/)

**Short version:**

My Urologist examined me.  At first, he said huh, that mark does look rather indicative that something was done to me.  Then he examined me further and in closer detail, and said that no, actually, it's just that my Raphe line is somewhat dark and unusual looking, and diagonal in some places rather than straight, and so it makes me appear as though I've had reconstructive surgery for Hypospadias, even to people who've had reconstructive surgery for Hypospadias themselves, because the dark Raphe line that suddenly jeers diagonally looks like a surgical scar, but because the penis head is pristine, it's apparent upon closer examination that I was not given an intersex surgery in that area.

**Long version:**

I came in, and when I was talking to the nurse about what I was here to see the doctor for, I told her that I believe I have an intersex condition known as Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, and the doctor was going to examine my body for that.  My Urologist then came in, and I told him that I'm transgender, and he said he already knew from my chart.  I told him that I'm here because my Endocrinologist has believed since late 2015 that I have Partial AIS, and I recently was talking to someone who had undergone reconstructive surgery for Hypospadias who described that situation to me, and I found a mark that closely matched what they were describing.  I showed them, and they said that looks exactly like a scar from Hypospadias, and asked me if I was intersex.  So I took pictures of that area and sent them in to my Endocrinologist, who took a look at them, said that it would be best for someone who specializes in that area to look it over, and gave me a referral to a Urologist, and that's why I was there.

The doctor asked me if I would like a chaperone to be present.  A chaperone? I asked.  Yes, he replied, you are female, and I will be examining you down there.  Balderdash, I thought, the man did not spent a decade in medical school just so that he could get his jollies from ogling peoples' nethers.  I told him a chaperone would not be necessary.  So he examined me.  As I said in the short version: At first, he said huh, that mark does look rather indicative that something was done to me.  Then he examined me further and in closer detail, and said that no, actually, it's just that my Raphe line is somewhat dark and unusual looking, and diagonal in some places rather than straight, and so it makes me appear as though I've had reconstructive surgery for Hypospadias, even to people who've had reconstructive surgery for Hypospadias themselves, because the dark Raphe line that suddenly jeers diagonally looks like a surgical scar, but because the penis head is pristine, it's apparent upon closer examination that I was not given an intersex surgery in that area.

I talked to him more about Partial AIS.  I said I've never seen another person with Partial AIS.  Neither has he, he said, and no wonder, I thought, at 1 in 130,000, people with Partial AIS are extremely rare.  I told him about the symptoms that caused myself and my Endocrinologist to believe I have Partial AIS: voice that didn't masculinize at puberty (to which he replied that my voice sounded very feminine), being nearly sterile pre-HRT, with 3 Kruger Strict semen analyses saying that I had a very poor sperm morphology and a poor prognosis for succesfully impregnating someone (14+ being normal, I was at a 1), and lipomastia, with ""fatty manboob"" breasts that were about 36E pre-HRT with a BMI of 26 or 27, but no breast tissue in them, my body just really really wanted to store lots of fat in the breast area even when I was only mildly overweight.  I told him that my Karyotype test came back as 46,XY, which seems to rule out other intersex conditions and seems to leave either undermasculinization of the testes, which he could see from his examination of me wasn't the case, as my testes had dropped, or some elusive form of Androgen Insensitivity.  He said I might very well have Partial AIS and it could just not be evident from my genitals, and that the way they conclude that is by doing some advanced form of genetic testing, a very expensive test not even done at that medical center, which has its own lab testing area, but done at a specialized place.

He asked me about development of other secondary sex characteristics, such as underarm hair.  I was kind of confused at that, since I think that both males and females grow hair in their armpits.  I told him that I had actually gotten laser hair removal on my armpits, 3 sessions, and that after the 1st session the hair had just given up and surrendered, and the 2nd and 3rd sessions had salted the earth so that hopefully nothing would ever grow there again, and that I haven't shaved there in 10 weeks and don't have any hair there.  He thought getting laser hair removal was very nice, and mentioned that he wishes he could get it to remove his gray facial hairs, but that it wasn't really in the cards for him, because laser can't target gray hairs, and because of his black skin tone; laser would burn him very badly because it only works on people with lighter skin tones, as the laser burns dark pigments.  I mentioned that I wish laser would work on gray hairs, because I have what seems like a thousand of them on my neck, and I worry that it might take 100 hours of electrolysis to remove them all

While I was speaking to a Urologist, I asked him about other issues of concern to me, such as getting an Orchiectomy.  I wasn't planning on getting SRS, I said, but was strongly considering getting an Orchiectomy after a self-imposed 3-5 year waiting period after starting HRT, given the irreversible nature of it.  I asked him what would be the better method to preserve my ability to get SRS afterwards, an inguinal orchiectomy, or going in through the scrotum? He said that going in through the scrotum would be better to preserve my options for SRS (which surprised me; I though inguinal would be better), and that inguinal is actually the traditional method of Orchiectomy, not going in through the scrotum, something about inguinal allowing the surgeon to get to the ""Core"" of the testes and remove them.  I should have asked him about getting erections post-orchi; if I'm still able to get an erection with no trouble now, with T levels deeply in the female range (I'm at 26, female range is 8-60), will I continue to be able to get erections post-orchi, when I'm no longer on Spiro?

I asked him if the medication I'm on, Spiro and Estradiol, is basically the same thing that a patient with prostate cancer would be on.  No, he replied, for a patient with prostate cancer, they would just be on Lupron.  Just Lupron? I asked.  How would you prevent the onset of Osteoporosis if they have no Testosterone OR Estradiol, surely you need one or the other? He responded that in their case, he would give them extra Vitamins such as C and D and others, and tell them to do special exercises, to guard against Osteoporosis.

He was very generous with his time; I think I must have been in there for 40 minutes.  As is usually the case at that Medical Center, I was treated with dignity and not given any mistreatment on account of being transgender."
Live51,asktransgender,Using Bovine Ovary,"How many here have used or investigated into using Bovine Ovary as their feminization program.  From all the researching that I have done it reprograms the body over a period of time to aromatize testosterone into estrogen and causes the free floating testosterone to bind with other molecules in the blood so that they can not bond to your body cell structures which leaves them open for the estrogen to bond to them.  From what I read it reprograms how and what hormones your body produces. "

I almost died from a car accident about a year ago, I needed to do something about this problem. I needed to do something because my first thought was ""thank you God that this charade is over"". And here I am. I have been on hormones for 9 months, but as crazy as it sounds, I don't want to be female. I've resisted this my entire life and I am always able to make it go away. But it always comes back or its always just under the surface. 

Even on HRT, as much relief as it brings me, the feelings of actually living as a female get stronger than ever. I feel better having a feminine body with breasts, but I don't want to live as a woman. I have a wardrobe, I have panties, bras, jeans, skirts, makeup, you name it. I've started wearing it and I feel even better. An objective look on my life showed it basically consisted of attempting to force masculine behavior, and trying to convince myself it would go away eventually. It sounds so crazy, everyone who knows me says it's inevitable and I have to stop fighting it but its like......once I do, whether I am happy or not, its like I've given up and accepted it and my struggle was for nothing. I never wanted this. If its possible i would throw my wardrobe away, stop hormones, anything to get this feeling out.

sasuto23,asktransgender,Transgender Casting,"Hello, I'm an aspiring writer and general content creator and I have a question about casting. There's a character I wrote who's my favorite character I've ever written and I have a very deep and emotional attachment to them. In the story, she's a MtF teenager and by the start of the story she's about two weeks into transitioning. I have very high hopes for her and the story she's part of and a potential medium I've been considering for getting her and the story out there is a live action show. It's got a young, fun tone to fit on the CW, the necessity for a high budget to go on HBO, and innovative enough for Netflix. Lofty and unlikely aspirations, I know, but I can dream. 

My question is, are there any teenage or young adult transgender actresses, models, singers, etc that are kind of big? Or would I likely have to cast someone in their first production? I'd like to steer clear of casting someone cisgender to play her, but given she's extremely early in the transition, it might work.

2.) I'm worrying that while the feeling of being masculine and being a man is nice, I worry that I'll be ""too feminine"" to be a man sometimes and that causes some issues.
3.) I have never been to any sort of therapist. What should I expect?

Help me?"
[deleted],asktransgender,Laser prices,"What do you guys think about laser hair removal prices? There's two places near me and one is like $200 a session and the other is like $250 to maybe $150 it depends. Do you think $$ = good results? Like, the $250 place I know seems very professional and there's even a doctor that regulates shit there. It's also a skincare/plastic surgery (like breast enhancement) place. The woman I spoke to was friendly and knows I'm trans and she's been doing this for years. She said she had many trans patients. She also said depending on how things go and how I react the prices are flexible, or so she says lol. Bonus with this place is that it's kinda isolated so not too many people.

The other place is in a kinda crowded place but I didn't go see consultation there. Just read about it on the website.

Dunno just wanna see your opinions and what you did at your place/your prices you had to pay. "

As our relationship progressed, he realized that he was indeed transgender and came out to me. We both realized how strange it was that an MtF and a FtM just so happened to find and get in a relationship with each other, and we found it kinda funny and I wanted to know if anyone else has had similar experiences."

real-dreamer,asktransgender,Trans*Ponder a podcast for life in the trenches... What happened to these awesome ladies? I'm kind of concerned. I hope they're okay. They certainly made me feel less alone when I was younger.,"I was in the military, one of them was in the military... I trans and working in a church as a janitor. Now I'm trans and not really working much at all. 

The last episode was in 2014. 

The website is down.

I remember years ago a question I asked was answered in an episode. Someone from here managed to talk to both of them. Maybe even had an AMA. I don't quite recall.

I just hope they're all okay is all. I know life can get *really* hard for us trans women and I hope they're doing well.

Because of them I feel comfortable making youtube videos. Because of them I feel comfortable being me. 

Because of them I could vacuum the sanctuary of my church and not feel so alone.

Where ever they are. I hope they know I'm thankful.

I havnt seen any breast growth at all yet not even any tissue and I'm getting super worried. My levels are now at T-11 dmol and E-257 dmol

So I've decided to just do it all myself and get a check up done regularly on hormone levels, since there doesn't really seem to be any other option for me at this point, so I was wondering what I do to start out with. I've read on places that starting with estrogen and then taking the anti androgens later on will cause unnoticeable/dead effects on the body and could also lead to more cancerous risks. Is this true? Will taking them at the same time be the same as anyone else out there, or am I reading into this too much for dysphoric reasons?"
catfusion,asktransgender,"Dude, guys, why do people do this?","So it happens often enough that I'm curious, if irritated:

Someone (invariably a cis gendered someone) will say something hey, 'Hey, dude!' or, 'How are you guys?' to a woman or group of women, that they know is trans.

And then they'll follow it with, 'Oh, I hope you're not offended, I say that to everybody.'

And it makes me want to scream, and I honestly think the next time I hear it, I really just am going to reply, ""I was fine with it until you had to explain it. Do you say 'I say that to everybody' to *everybody* every time you say it too?""

But why do people do this? Not the 'dude-ing' or the 'guys-ing' - I get that (even if I think it's semiotically sexist) and people *do* do that. 

It's the qualifying it - why do that? 

I could write an essay, but I'll just say I think it's for the sake of the person saying it, not whoever they're saying it to.

SophieCalle,asktransgender,No longer needing antidepressants after HRT?,"Ok, so I've been on an antidepressant for a very, very long time. I tried going off of it but I crashed rather bad, a number of times, many years back.  So, I've always been on it ever since. I sort of accepted having to be on it the rest of my life.  It was better than when I wasn't, and nothing's perfect in life, you know?

So, after being on HRT for a while now, last week, I ran out of the antidepressant due to a misplacement of a bag and I just realized that quite a few days have passed without me even knowing.  I simply forgot to call in and get it renewed.  

Why?

I feel totally fine now, I guess?

Could it be that I don't need it anymore now that my brain chemistry is where it should be?

This is rather unexpected.

Has anyone else ever experienced or heard of this before?

raphmer,asktransgender,I don´t know how to continue...,"Yesterday evening, I had a talk with my long-term girlfriend. Lots of tears were involved. It seems she finally managed to understand that what I feel is far from just a fantasy.
She even told me I should go for HRT if I really want it, she´d be supportive, but that we can´t stay together.

Actually, that´s pretty good news, it even made me smile some when she told me, but I can´t imagine losing her. All these years I´ve tried to make her life as happy as can be. The worst about losing her isn´t the fact that I´ll be alone, but that I won´t be able to help her. I feel like I´ll leave her behind. All my life, I´ve tried to help other´s whilst forgetting about my own needs.
What adds to this is the fact that we´re living together in her apartment. So if we break up, I have to get back to my mother´s house, since I´m still a student. She doesn´t know anything about me being trans, and I planned telling her while having our apartment as some kind of back up if it doesn´t go well.

I am feeling so powerless right now, like losing the ground under my feet, I don´t want to start HRT because of her, although I know we probably won´t have a happy life together after all. She says she can´t simply forget my issues.

All I ever had, I´ll probably lose it due to these feeling I have. I have never been so close to HRT, yet never so far from being happy. If I chose to look after my own needs, then I´ll lose so many important things that matter so much to me, even my home.
I feel like my life suddenly lost its meaning and I´m not looking forward to anything. Even HRT, what I always wanted to start, doesn´t seem attractive anymore.

Although there is no question, I felt the need to share it with you. Maybe there´s someone who can cheer me up. 

Thanks for reading."
FortyThreeSunsets,asktransgender,The people I wish I could hear from,"Some background: I'm 20 years old, FTM, in college, presenting as female, and only out to about four friends. I've been reckoning with my gender since 2011, and I'm still today not completely sure whether I want to transition.

I'm very incrementalist when it comes to gender stuff, and I try to really listen to the perspectives of those who regret transition. The problem is, most of these people tend to be within the category of ""TERFs"", or are inclined to blame trans people for their making the decision to transition.

What I really to be able to hear are the voices of those who detransitioned or regret transitioning, but don't have a problem with trans people or cast blame on others. Also, trans people who don't believe that transition is the right thing for every person. I have trouble finding voiced from these perspectives in and out of trans communities, and they would be really helpful, since I am thinking that I'm going to most likely transition at some point but am open to other paths to handling my dysphoria. Any ideas about where to find these voices?"

doit92,asktransgender,Never crossdressed,"I am a 23yo guy who wants to start his transition MTF.
I'm pretty sure I would live my life much better as a girl (even though I don't think I feel 100% a boy or 100% a girl, but I'm certainly closer the the female and feminine world)
When I was a child I used to wear my mom clothes everyday after school. But since I grew up I stopped crossdressing.
I just tried some makeup and girls clothes a couple of times in my house (I live with my parents).

My question is: do you think I should start wearing more feminine clothes and find out how I feel with them before starting HRT? Sometimes I am really attracted by those beautiful skirts and jewelry, but sometimes I'm too lazy to try them, and I don't care too much.

shoelaze,asktransgender,Is it normal to think you wouldn't even consider transition if you had to go through RLE?,"So I'm extremely lucky to not have gatekeeping imposed on me and to be in a situation where I think I could start hormones as soon as I wanted with very little resistance (I am definitely not ready for that though...). However ever since I heard about ""Real Life Experience"" it's stuck out to me as particularly off-putting and frightening. This is absolutely not a slight against anyone who transitions pre or without hormones, by the way, actually somewhat the opposite. I worry that this is a sign that transition is actually not what I want. The idea seems frightening to me, and not because of the whole opening yourself up to transphobia thing either, at least not fully... Idk...

I think this may be because I have a lot of issues and fear around exposing how I feel internally, I think that's why I want to be *really really sure* before I do anything and worry that it's something that I was wrong about and have to go back on in the future..."
deannamaybe,asktransgender,*Update* Estrogen (Estradiol) Injections in Canada,"This past June I made this post: [Estrogen Injections in Canada](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4oqwfg/estrogen_injections_in_canada/?st=ITH5NRRV&amp;sh=b31d766c) and received many helpful replies. 

After passing along some of the information that was provided to my clinic and doing some more research of my own, my clinic decided to look into it further. We found a compounding pharmacy that specialises in HRT injections in our community that was unknown to both myself and the clinic.

After some back and forth between the pharmacy and the nurse practitioner at my clinic, my NP went to the endocrinologist that works with them. There were some concerns on dosages, which forced them to seek advice outside of the area (and took what seemed like forever because of vacations and such).

In the end, I was given the green light to proceed at my last appointment, and picked up my new prescription yesterday. I have to go back to the clinic on Tuesday to get some instruction on how to inject and stuff so I can't start yet, but I have some questions that the people at the clinic likely can't answer because, as I was told, I am their test subject, the only MTF patient at the clinic on injections, so they're not fully sure of the results and are relying heavily on input from the pharmacist and their associated colleagues outside of the clinic. They do have some FTM patients with testosterone injections, however, so IM injections are not new to the clinic at least.

So, the questions: my IM injections are BI-Weekly. Is this normal? I'm on patches now and my E levels stay fairly constant, I'm concerned that the sawtooth wave of E is going to make for an interesting roller coaster. Am I over thinking it?

Lastly, the pharmacist also suggested (and I requested though my clinic) a topical spironolactone cream to help reduce hair growth in troublesome areas. I have never heard of this before. Does anybody have any experience with it?

Ultimately, while it seemed to take forever, I am super glad that my clinic was open to trying new treatment options and thoroughly researched those options before prescribing them.

Thanks!

bmore977,asktransgender,Mixed feelings and dysphoria..,"My entire life I've dreamed of being a girl. Everytime I see one I get super jealous of everything about them. Usually I just blow it off and move on and that's what I've been used to doing. but lately I've had this nagging voice in the back of my head telling me that if I don't start to transition soon it will be too late seeing that I'm already 18 and a senior. Also, in order to hide the fact that I may be transgender from myself, I've tried working out and now I'm all bulked up with muscle.. yet I still get dysphoric and want to be a girl so that didn't work. I know muscle is reversible but I feel like being 18 is too late to transition anyway. Plus I can't seem to muster up any courage to tell anyone, although I have been debating it lately seeing how depressed its been making me. I just don't know if I can handle being a male any longer. I've researched the effects of hrt and they sound absolutely amazing and it makes me want to start ASAP but coming out seems to be the wall stopping me from going anywhere. 

How did y'all handle this? Is it too late for me to even start?"
Noli420,asktransgender,Back at square one (advice),"So I'm at a loss and don't really know what to do at this point (or don't want to admit what I need to do)...

Monday my wife met therapist. Wife decided she wants a husband, not wife. Okay. That means no SRS, although hadn't really considered it. No full-time presenting female. I assume that HRT falls right in there. She is okay with it during the day when she isn't home. So basically I feel like it's back to ""don't ask don't tell"" that we have been at and i wasn't happy with... I really don't want to lose her and my son, but I don't know if I can live with that, or worse regret it and resent her...

i dont feel physically attracted to boys and the way she looks dressed like one is really putting me off

any advice? i dont want to end this relationship

strangedreams1,asktransgender,Starting transition soon - huge anxiety about the whole thing,"After waiting way too long I've finally accepted that I'm a woman and transition is something I need to do. As amazing as it is, I've never been more scared in my life and the anxiety is really building up.

I've known pretty much my whole life that something was off about myself. Always wanted to be a girl while I was growing up but the idea just seemed insane to me. When I was younger I never thought trans people were something that actually existed. The only real exposure I had was through TV shows/movies, which growing up through the 90s and early 00s was not positive at all. Was really about 10 years ago when I started reading about people's experiences being transgender. It really put a more human connection to the idea and made me realize that if I wanted to live life as a woman it was possible. More importantly, I realized that I'm not the only person who feels this way.

Shortly after that I went to therapy to talk about it. Few months later I make an appointment at a clinic that specialized in trans health in my city with the goal of starting on HRT. Went to the first appointment there then never followed up because I was scared of the road ahead. I was 18 then, turning 28 in a few months now. Ever since then it's been like a black cloud hovering over my life. I've been trying to tell myself all those years that I don't need to do this to be happy. 50% of people are men and they're accepting of who they are, why can't I be? Having to reinforce that thought every single day gets tiring quick. Feels like every day I wake up to live a lie and have to put up a fake persona to get through the day. After nearly 10 years of doing that I just can't do it anymore.

I started going to therapy two months ago and recently started the process to get on HRT. If my bloodwork comes up positive I'll be able to start within the next few weeks. Have my first laser session this week to start getting rid of my beard. I've never been more elated or terrified in my whole life. 

As great as the progress is, there's just so many doubts I have about transition. If I could press some magic button where I would instantly turn into a woman and have all people's perceptions of me change instantly I would press it in a heartbeat. But there's just so much about my body I can't see every being feminine. Wide shoulders, manly face, deep M hairline, size 11 feet, huge hands. Just whenever I look in the mirror I don't see how I could ever pull it off. Browsing transpassing and transtimelines makes me a little jealous because everyone there looks so beautiful, I just don't think I could ever reach that point. All of that is without even thinking about the social aspect of transition at all.

With all these doubts flying around it's really making me question whether I'm trans at all. Part of me thinks I'm just doing this to scare myself out of starting. I can't imagine this is going to be an easy road to take even if it does lead to happiness at the end of it. Did anyone else have these kind of strong doubts right before starting? Does it get better?"
Jrhiannon,asktransgender,Five year old in foster care,"So my cousin's are in foster care and it's been about 5 months. I'm in the process of getting custody of a 5 year old boy and his 2 younger sisters. Unfortunately social services is fighting me on this so we have to go to trial and that takes some time. Well now the 5 year old is dressing like a girl wearing dresses, skirts, leggings, hair bows, makeup, girls underwear &amp; even dying his hair multiple colors. The family has been told by the foster parents and DSS that we now have to address him as a girl and his new name Hakela. If we fail to do that we are cut out of his life, no communication/visitation. I was told he had came up with this name on his own, but that's the same middle name of the foster sister. This is very hard for the family and it's hard to believe that this is what he wants. The whole family truly feels the foster family is manipulating him to do this. They have 2 biological teenage daughters who live in the home and are lesbian who dress almost like a guy. I decided to pull up the foster parents Facebook and what I saw was disturbing. There's nothing wrong with being gay/transgender whatever you wanna be, but they are associated with all types of transgender people, groups, associations and I just find it very funny that my cousin who was a boy living at my house and has been his whole life, is now a girl and is being sent to school wearing girl clothes and is being called his girl name. He has never shown any feminine signs. His parents have disappeared so I do understand the grief and depression he is under. But I don't think it's right to try to change who he is. We have discussed our concerns with DSS and they seem to not care. They also told us that he does not like his penis, we are talking about a five year old! If this is truly what he wants I will accept it and support him, but he has never told me that this is what he wants! "

transforlife84,asktransgender,"MtF. I transitioned, then detransitioned now considering retransitioning. What to do?","I need some advice. When I was 28 I transitioned mtf, truthfully it was the hardest time of my life, my wife left me my family looked at me like I was a stranger I had no friends so I decided to make new friends that were trans and they turned out to have drug problems, thing were shit. But within myself I was happy, I was on hormones for 12 months I liked my body I can't say I loved it because I still was a the stage where I couldn't tell if people saw me as a guy or a girl so I didn't even have the confidence to tell people my name or use a public bathroom or buy cloths and most of all I didn't have the confidence to look for a new relationship. So if you ask me was I happy, to be honest with you I would have to say no :( so I detransitioned and with my new found confidence of being a guy, I don't know what gave me the confidence, maybe it was the testosterone or maybe it was the fact that I thought that I obviously look like a guy so I knew I had no problems being one. Anyways I hook my self a girlfriend, talk about a twist of fait, her father transitioned to a woman which gave me the confidence to come out to her and tell her my transitioning past. We been together for two years now and up to recently everything has been fine, I simply be myself ""feminine guy"" well I feel that way on the inside but on the outside I've becoming more and more of a typical guy. Truthfully sometimes it scares the shit out of me, I'm handsome, successful and as time goes on I'm becoming more and more of a guy but it's not what I wanted to be.
 
So here's my what I would like your opinion about. It has recently crossed my mind that I would like to transition again but I don't want what happened last time to happen again. I hurt a beautiful woman and I'm worried I'm going to do it again, I'm was selfish last time and even though this time I was honest from the beginning, I don't want to take my girlfriend's boyfriend away from her. She loves me and I love her and from the inside I will be the same person but I know that from the outside every little part of me will change, from my looks to my personality.

I honestly make a better guy then I do woman. As s guy I'm emotionally strong, I'm confident and I don't care about my appearance and I don't second guess what other see me as. As a woman I'm happy but scared, strong but weak, loving but lonely. I make a great guy and a terrible woman but life as a woman just seems like the me I prefer to be. "

Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,Question about Orchiectomy / SRS: Does it truly result in better feminization?,"I've heard this a couple times, that trans women who've had orchiectomies or SRS see better results from hormones in terms of feminization of the rest of the body (not referring to the groin).  But I'm confused as to how that could be the case.  If you're taking HRT and as a result your T levels are in the female reference range, then how would having an Orchiectomy result in better...um...results?

I mean, I could see that being the case if pre-orchi/SRS you had high T levels and anti-androgens were proving only partially effective, but if the AAs are effective, then surely there shouldn't be a difference in results whether you've had an orchi or not?

Btw, my current plan is to get an Orchiectomy around 3 years of HRT.  3 years seems a good long time to think it over and be absolutely certain about it."

Sometimes at night I'll use my pillow and press it against my chest in an effort to solve this. I'll also notice that after watching porn where I imagine myself as the woman w/ boobs, this sensation will be more intense and take longer to subside. I don't really have other types of body dysphoria, if this I even anything. Anybody else experience this?"
b7d,asktransgender,Ways to act more feminine?,"I was at work the other day and a coworker jokingly remarked how I look like a girl when I let my hair down and said I must be transgender and currently undergoing transition. When I confirmed that she was correct however, she immediately backtracked and said that she didn't think I acted feminine in any way and this was a really surprising turn of events. 

I know that in public I have this autonomous response which turns on and portrays the ""guy"" I've been trained to be but my question(s) are: *How does one go against this mold and what are some ways to approach life in a more feminine manner?

AlliCat2021,asktransgender,Unusual laser hair removal results,"This isn't meant to brag or celebrate or anything, I'm just curious.

So I had my second laser hair session about a week ago, I saw an 80% reduction after the first one and am at a 95% reduction in beard hair after the second one. ( granted those are guesstimates not measured.) I've heard a lot about laser hair removeal not working well for people and was expecting like a 60% reduction in total, then follow with electrolysis.

Has anyone else had this kind of success with laser? Or am I just lucky?

The person treating me says this kind of reaction is unusual and wants before and afters advertise with, but in worried about how long the results will last since they've worked so quickly.

It's hard to tell from my pics due to make up but, I'm almost translucent white with jet black hair."
[deleted],asktransgender,Feeling pressured to be something that I'm not.,"The further along I get in my transition, the more I feel pressured to conform to some societal standards of femininity. I've come to the conclusion that I'm not extremely feminine. I've never worn makeup (although I'm not against doing so), don't think I'd ever feel comfortable wearing a dress or skirt. 

I was hoping the hormones would change me enough, that I could could go out in public in my jeans and women's t-shirt and gendered female all the time, but I don't think that's going to happen. I have reached a stage where I'm gendered female or not gendered most of the time, but I'm not sure if people are being nice or really seeing me that way.

I feel that I'm going to have to be somebody that I'm not so people can see a woman. It seems like I'll be trading one fake existence as a man for another fake existence and it kinda sucks. My social dysphoria is through the roof right now and I don't really know what to do about it. 

Does anyone else feel this way? How do you move past this point to feel comfortable as yourself and in public?"
amon_erin,asktransgender,Headaches and HRT?,"Okay, just over two weeks into HRT and I'm loving everything thus far. The one problem is headaches. I've kind of had a low grade one since I started, but today it's almost feeling like a migraine is coming on. I thought I was drinking enough water, but perhaps I'm not?  I'm told my doctor this on Tuesday and he had me do blood work to see how my levels are.

justmeandibecausewhy,asktransgender,Still confused.,"I made a post about a month ago, to talk about what I was feeling, to wonder if I really was trans. I didn't go much into detail, and I still have many doubts about stuff I never mentioned. Any help would be appreciated. I'm 13, if you're wondering.

When I was under 4 years old, my only friends were my sisters. I remember wearing dresses/skirts, and listened to ""girl's"" music. I'm not too sure if I was just heavily influenced by them, or I was a trans girl. 

When I joined school, I stopped doing that, possibly in an attempt to fit in with the other boys. I never really experienced any dysphoria. Well, I do experience some, but it's never that bad, and I usually get on without worrying. In school, most of my friends were either feminine guys or girls, mostly because I got on with them the best. I didn't like being around most boys as I didn't feel I fitted in. People describe me as quite boyish, not really feminine. 

Around when I was 8, I started having these thoughts. ""If only I could be a girl,"" and, ""I wish I could've been born a girl."" I thought this was normal for guys, and didn't really think anything more than that. Girls were just better, and nicer, and prettier, and I thought everyone wanted to be a girl.

Looking back on my life, I can't really think of anything which would've made me feminine, or female, I've mostly been quite boyish. Yet, I didn't fit in with most guys.

A couple months ago, I came across a transgender blog post, where someone explained their feelings and I realised they matched mine. I thought of the idea, denied it, but soon accepted it, as I realised that I wanted to accept it. I'm now out to my whole family, and my siblings have started using my correct pronouns, yet, I'm still unsure. I can never really think of myself as female, no matter how much I want to be. I want to look like a girl, be treated like a girl, but I don't really feel bad being male. I've realised I'm still extremely confused. What do you think? Am I trans? Or do I just want to be trans, or have some sort of fetish. I'm really not sure, and someone's confirmation could really help me."

* From what I heard it can take up to 6-8 months until hormones can be prescribed, is this true? And if it is, why? Why should anyone wait that long for proper treatment, it makes zero sense to me.

* How do I act? I've heard that being demanding and requiring treatment can put you on hold for even longer.

* If I have no choice but to wait, is it possible to still get AA's (Anti-Androgen) during the waiting period?

Elena1270,asktransgender,Interesting feelings using a public bathroom,"Not a question. I was out yesterday in male mode with the exception of wearing panties under my male clothes. Twice, I had to use a public restroom. As I was presenting male, I used the mens room however, I became quite self conscious when I realized that if anyone walked in the bathroom, they could probably see my pants and my lime green panties through the space between the bottom of the stall door and the floor. I became quite worried that someone would see those panties and assault me, especially since I was in Pennsylvania where people can be VERY conservative for being in the northeast. I do wish that they would make stalls and stall doors full length down to the floor so no one can look and see your clothes on the floor and creepsters couldn't try to get their jollies looking under the stalls. Thats why I HATE public restrooms and avoid them whenever possible. I prefer bathrooms with just one toilet that you can lock. I want my privacy!! I dont want anyone knowing whats underneath my pants!!"

alexandercon,asktransgender,What am I experiencing?,"About a week ago, a facebook friend was tagged in a post by someone who had just transitioned from male to female, and despite me never having had any feelings about being a women (I'm a 20 y/o gay male), for some reason it sparked something in me, that anytime I think about/do pretty much anything, I wonder what it would feel like to be a girl in the same situation.

This is causing me a huge amount of stress, and I've had trouble sleeping most nights because the thoughts just go round in my mind, and it's seriously affecting my well being. I've started to see a counsellor at my university.

What i'm very confused about is that I like the way I look, my biological features, and being a guy in general, and when I consider actually being a girl, I would hate having breasts, having the female anatomy, and I find the thought of being a woman wrong. I realise that being transgender dosen't just entail a binary transition, but I don't understand what has sparked this inside of me.
Up until a week ago, whilst I had thought about transgender people, it had never even crossed my mind that I might one day experience this, and question my own gender.

I'm very aware that realising one's gender identity is a long journey and that no one will be able to say 'this is what you are' etc., but has anyone experienced anything similar?"
kaylarue,asktransgender,"Co-worker outed me. We did damage control, but I'm not sure how to move on from the incident.","A co-worker of mine, who I've known for a couple of years and trusted (and tbh is stupidly cute), outed me to another co-worker a couple of months ago. My manager/best friend/ally pulled them both aside and made it very clear that she didn't know what exactly was said but that if rumors started to go around that there would be serious consequences. 

I would have expected the person who outed me to come to me and explain what happened, since they say they didn't mean to and it was an accident. But they didn't. My manager friend told me outside of work, and when I confronted them they lied about how much they told. 

My manager eventually was with the person who was told outside of work, got the full story, and convinced them it wasn't true. 

I'm having trouble moving on from what happened. This isn't the only time I've been outed either, though the other two were recent and more a result of my carelessness than inability to stfu.

But that's not the case. I find myself wanting to burst into tears just doing the same things I usually do. Just being me, interacting with the world as ME. And that feeling won't go away. There will ALWAYS be some point in the day that I find myself upset over this.

I can't take it. I'm not suicidal or anything. I have plenty to live for, I'm just sick of living miserable.

Basically I'm a 19 year old male to female whose been struggling with gender their entire life. I've finally come to terms with it. I'm not going to question any longer and force my self through life as male. 

I've made an appointment with my GP and found a doctor to go through therapy with and to eventually go on hormones.

Still haven't told anyone. But I have plans to start coming out to close friends and to start my transition.

Always wrote this off as a fetish but felt fucking miserable these past 2 days and decided this is why.

This is my coming out post. I am a girl. I've always been a girl. Sick of pretending. I've been such a disaster as male. Got plenty of guy friends and I've always been a masculine guy. But it doesn't make me happy. 

I'm a girl, I know this now and it makes me happy that I know this and can now start to transition. 

Love that i know who I am now.

Anyway, my names Elsie not Joe. I am female not male. I like girl things and prefer socialising with girls. I'm attracted to guys. Not girls. 

So excited that I've accepted my self, and can't wait to wear my makeup and do the cute girl things I've always wanted.

Shockingpink13,asktransgender,Sometimes I feel terrified for the future,"Sometimes, when I think about the future, I feel terrified.  This only really started once I began to truly identify as a girl, and I suppose (as my therapist assures me) the reason for that is because anyone in their right mind would be nervous.  It's just before the world seemed as if it was in such a straight line: grow up, get married, die.  Now that I started accepting myself (and I have been accepting myself for two months now) I have no idea what the future will bring, and what should excite me now terrifies me.  This isn't an intrusive thought, I am a girl in a boy's body, but I am constantly perturbed and distracted by unknowing how my future as a female will unfold.

Sorry for the rant, I just needed to exorcise my thoughts.

transtacos,asktransgender,HRT and fertility at 19,"I'm about to start HRT next week. I was thinking about storing my sperm, but my best option price wise is $100/month for 6 months, or $600 out of pocket up front. I don't really have the money right now, or in the near enough future. I'm not sure that I'll want children in the future either, but I wanted to do this just in case. I've been waiting for HRT for so long, and now that I'm so close, I'm not sure I could wait any longer and still be sane. I'd be taking just estrogen for three months, unless something changes. Any guesses as to how long I'd have before my fertility is affected? And if you have advice as to paying for storage, I'd greatly appreciate it."

I met this guy on a dating app that's new to my town, new to the country in fact.

This will be the first time I have ever been taken out on a romantic date and I'm not really sure how I'm supposed to conduct myself. 

I feel like asking him about ""whats life like in country x"" would be similarly frustrating to him as asking my transition would be to me.  I don't really know much about him other than we both dislike country music haha.

He knows I'm trans and hasn't been creepy about it, so that's a plus. I just don't know what I'm supposed to do and im kinda half excited/half incredibly anxious.

and that's not even asking about sex..do I do anything? what if he initiates? he said my body isn't a problem, so does that imply that we are? i'm not against it i just also don't want to come across too slutty and desperate.

Now, I know actual Estrogen, HRT for MtFs is a rather long process that requires counseling beforehand. But what about Anti-Androgens?

1. I have Medicaid(I'm poor) and my state covers Transgender related medical needs. In your opinion, could I, a 17 year old, get them and have it be free like any other medication?

2.Is any sort of lab work required before being Perscribed them? Transportation is a huge issue for me at the moment and this'll probably be the only chance I have to see a doctor for awhile.

3. If I properly portray how legitimate and extreme my issues are(which they are) could I be given them immediately WITHOUT having already seen a counselor?

Waking up with the constant struggle that you’re not yourself is a battle millions of people face everyday. Can you imagine? Every time your eyes pop open to be embraced with the newness of the day, there is some underlying pressure inside that you’re not in your body, making the embrace a rather daunting nightmare, than a happy sunshine filled day with candy fluffed clouds, of a carefree sentience. Looking in the mirror and seeing this is even worse. Feeling your own skin can make you feel as if you are touching someone else, and hearing your name or gender rolls that you don’t represent to yourself can cause a sense of confusion and anguish, making simple task like getting out of bed, brushing your teeth, getting ready, eating, going out, anything at all really a chore that leads you just wanting your bed over anything else. I’m sure you’re telling yourself. This is awful, why would anyone want to feel this way? Well, it’s not much of a choice, people don’t just wake up one day and decide they desire to destroy their lives, throwing everything they have built for themselves out the window like a crazy ex dumping your belongings after finding out their significant other has been unfaithful. Rather, being transgender is something that has always been there. Some don’t realize right away, some could go most their life without really knowing how to process the feelings creating deep voids. Most of this spans from lack of knowledge on the subject. Instead, just feeling out of place and having trouble pin pointing it down to an actual solution.
I myself know this all too well, due to the fact that I am transgender, and was able to cognitively examine the meaning of this with my own research. Never feeling normal, I had no choice for myself but to discover through countless years, months, and hours of research into the subject. The internet has made information readily available for people to research topics ranging from all spectrums of life, so naturally this is where I began my research into this particular topic. Besides the library or some other information hub that lives in the physical realm, the internet provides a much safer sense of openness. Never having to stand face to face, staring someone in the eyes and flat-out asking them questions, wondering what thoughts are being processed through their mind while waiting for a response relieves the pressure to ask those questions we might even be embarrassed to type out on search engines. 
The social pressures from the world we live in today has created impacts in the way we live. Most people don’t fulfill their actual aspirations. Feeling that if they can box themselves inside and appeal to the general masses, then they will have acceptance and the freedom to live in the world as a regular individual. Statistic studies show that only point six (0.6) of the United States population is transgender and from that staggeringly small number, seventy two precent are trans women that will become victims of homicide, and sixty seven precent of those are transgender people of color. These stats can cause some alarm, leaving one to wonder, is this really worth living the life you want? Keeping certain feelings locked inside is the option most will take at this point. Not only due to these tragic stats, but also due to deeper personal levels of individuality. Family, friends, careers, and regular acquaintance can add inflation on the already heightened surge of stress.
With image being such a crucial aspect this millennium, people will take great measures to cover up their true feelings. It takes tremendous courage to open up and come out as a trans person, or any other non-traditional ways. Stress is definite, and can cause people to choose to end their life, with forty one percent of the trans population stating that they have attempted suicide. Suicidal thoughts come from a range of problems. Some may find it to hard to accept themselves, some can’t deal with their family or friends not accepting them, some may have financial problems due to losing their job from a company that criticizes, while most will have financial problems regardless, due to the overwhelmingly large amount of money required to meet the expectations of ones inner self. If insurance won’t cover cost, this amount increases exponentially. To begin this journey one needs approval from a therapist, which depending on the region you're in, the therapists knowledge on the subject, and your ability to prove to them you're transgender can take years to achieve even this first step, forcing some to resort to self medication, leading to massive health problems, and inevitably may expedite the persons last breathing moments with long term use of this particular self prescribed method. After this milestone, one needs to seek a medical professional, and once again, depending on the region and the knowledge of the doctor depicts how fast tracked this step will be before receiving a prescription to start hormone replacement therapy, which itself is a monthly expense that can leave a sizable impression in ones capital. Even still, doctor visits every three months are required to continue, and other operations including tracheal shave, electrolysis, gender confirmation surgery, facial feminization surgery, breast augmentation, and legal name and gender markers are some things trans females may feel necessary, though not everyone finds all of this to be significant to become complete with there inner self.
Beyond ones personal struggles, the struggle of finding someone to share your life with can present challenges as well. Most cis women, even ones who are lesbians or bisexual, might not be attracted to a trans female, and for the trans girls that are into guys, coming out as trans could raise the issue of safety. As mentioned before, with seventy two percent of trans females being murdered due to others not understanding or accepting them, thinking they are a disgrace and less than human makes coming out a challenge. On top of this, the subject of always having to introduce oneself as transgender can become an annoyance, and the repetition of the same questions, which almost always come off as inappropriate and demeaning, sends oneself to be discouraged to speak up. Understandably, someone who knows nothing on this subject probably doesn't know the questions to ask or how to ask them."

Also seems odd that I never read cis women calling tights/ stockings 'hose.' Maybe my grandma used to. But I don't remember.

So, I am 14 years old. I have been identified medically with OCPD, and I believe I have OCD as well. I have one problem though... I currently believe that I am transgender (MtF), as acting feminine feels so much better, and I wish I could be a girl sometimes, and wear pretty girl clothes, but other times I don't really feel it, but I never feel masculine. I fear having thick legs, and I already do a bit and it is so annoying :(. My problem is, sometimes I fear it is my OCPD/OCD doing this to me, and it worries the hell out of me, as even if I wasn't trans, I want to be a girl thats happy being a girl so darn bad, as I am so jealous of their bodies. I have had obsessions on other things such as diabetes, cancer, aids, you name it, but they are mainly bad obsessions. I don't get scared of being trans, but rather not being so. I live in a very anti-lgbt countrt (Peru), so I don't want to come out unless I'm sure I am trans. I go to a psychologist, and although I do trust her, I don't know if I can trust her with this yet... My question is, do I sound trans, and, how do I recognize an obsessive thought, is there something that sets it appart? I really need help with this.

I know tips like making sure you don't shave right after waking up when your skin is still puffy and to go with the grain then against it, but I can never seem to get rid of all the stubble. It really bothers me. Last time I shaved I ended up cutting myself pretty badly trying to get a closer shave so I'm waiting until my skin finishes healing to shave again and it sucks!

EDIT: My current routine is to wet my face with a warm cloth, apply shaving cream/gel all over my face and neck, shave with the grain until all of the hair seems shorter, then shave against the grain until the skin feels smooth. 

I can never get it completely smooth though. The worst area is where my jawline meets my chin and I have a bit of a problem under my cheekbones."
rising-above-myself,asktransgender,How did you start?,"After months of insurance deadends I finally have some traction.   I was able to get a pcp, therapist and endo.  If everything goes well ill start HRT in January.

To get to my question my therapist asked me today if I'd ever dressed up in private or in person, if I'd like feminine pronouns and if I had a performed name.  I was caught off guard.  I haven't made any progressive overtures to femenizing myself;  most of the cis women i know are not hyper feminine, I look to them as type of mentor. I don't hate my name although I prefer Sarah for my female name, and I doesn't hurt me when they use masculine pronouns cause I still present as male.  I guess I just kinda felt guilty cause I'm not aggressively trying to present as female.

For those of you who might have eased into transition how did you start.  I hate buying clothes and make up by myself cause I feel that the women are looking at me like a shark in the waters.    I feel like I should jump right in sometimes but I'm cautious, especially with my insurance set backs.  Maybe I should slip into it like warm bath water.

Thanks."
NanyPony,asktransgender,I'm not sure how I would feel if I were to go through a transition?,"I'm currently in high school, graduating in two years, but I honestly hate my body. I don't feel right in it, and I hate a lot of things about it. I feel as if I'd be a hell of a lot more comfortable in a woman's body. through telling me friends of this, one has totally wrote off that idea for me, they didn't want me to go through hrt and srs at all; another has been kind of 'eh' on the subject, saying they can't see in the future, but they're sure they'd support me; another, my boyfriend in fact, has been so helpful to me, giving me advice on how to tuck and the such, but it almost makes me feel uncomfortable when he gives me tips. I feel uncomfortable when he tells me about one of his favorite youtubers (I don't know if anyone's heard of her, stef sanjati, she's a trans woman about a couple months through her transition). I don't know if its because I feel like they're better than me, like I can't be like her, but I don't know. I honestly have such a hard time as well with family, I have no idea how they'll react if I told them, if they'd get mad at me, etc etc. I've worn a dress to school once and came back home to them almost yelling at me for doing so, telling me I'm putting a disgraced name to trans people everywhere. I kind of feel like a fake trans thanks to them. because of them, I keep seeing myself in the future going through hrt and srs if I ever get the money, but them just looking at me wrong, acting completely different around me, and I'm not sure if I'd feel right like that. I still feel like I'd be a man in woman's clothing, just a fake, a fraud, something someone could easily disprove, and it hurts me, it hurts to think about that. again, I'm sure a ton of threads like this have been made like this, so I'm sorry for the addition, but I just needed to say this to someone. if you've taken the time to get this far, thank you so much. please keep the comments clean and friendly ��"

amon_erin,asktransgender,A few questions. (Looking for some support.),"I'm just over a week on HRT, and I'm kind of annoyed. Maybe I just haven't given it enough time, but I'm still fighting with myself about being who I want to be. Like, my desire to be a woman has been increasing dramatically since starting and sometimes I feel like I'm being torn apart because I'm not right now. I keep reading about how everyone says hormones made things so much better for them overnight. I have to believe that's placebo effect. Because I'll be honest in saying I had a some of that during my first few days and it feels like some of it has worn off. Is that possible?

So I'm at a party right now and I spent a good amount of time hanging with some of my cis female friends for like an hour. One of them knows I'm transitioning and the other doesn't. It felt good to feel like one of the girls, but it's still sucky knowing people still see me as male. It's not that I'm really experiencing social dysphoria, but I want that to go away. At times I feel like I'm never going to see myself as the woman I want to be. Even now I'm sitting out on the porch typing this and reading a book (I'm that girl). Feeling out of place, just like I always did before I started this.

I guess this is mostly me rambling. I always was pretty sure I was destined to be forever alone, but now it really feels like that. Does that ever go away?

Sorry for my babbling. I've had a rough couple of days dysphoria wise."

Quinncidences,asktransgender,Dealing with a lot of internal things?,"Before we start, i'm a 21 year old AFAB, and probably a trans guy?? And i apologize for my thoughts being all over the place, i've been thinking too much these last few weeks/months and i just need to get it out. Thank you for reading!


In the meantime i'll add this to the long list of things i want to discuss with my gender therapist when i get to see him in a year. Why wait a year? I have no money and he is literally only one of two people i can see in my province for free, thus the long ass waiting list. I've already been waiting for about 4 months, i'll just keep truckin' along until then.


So, today i learned (or, the subject finally sunk in) that internalized transphobia and homophobia is an actual thing that people deal with. (Pardon the phrasing, i dont know how else to write it without offending anyone) I dont know how it didnt sink in earlier but now i know now that i'm definitely affected by both. I figured out/came to terms with the fact that i am bisexual about two or three years ago. Before i had any knowledge and before i figured out my issues, internally i was a very angry person when faced with people who were different from the societal norm; Meaning gay, lesbian, trans, etc; and i think this was largely because back then, in the years before 2010, the whole lbgtqa+ thing didnt exist. it just straight up didnt exist. I tried my best to be as kind as i could to these people cause my mama aint raised no asshole, but i still always had extremely negative thoughts and of course i would talk about them behind their backs with close friends (who also didnt know better back then, they're very active in the LGBT community now). SO I'VE BEEN DOING MY BEST but those stupid ass intrusive thoughts have started making my life hard again, this time around its with transphobia, i have multiple trans friends, and i think i myself am trans but still when i see a non passing trans person (I KNOW ITS HORRIBLE) i just feel those ""gross"" feelings that i can only describe as transphobia. I'd love to know any tips you all might've learned to either repress those thoughts or work through them and just better ways to deal with them in general to get rid of some self hatred for feeling like i might be trans. It ain't healthy.


Next issue, is the whole ""oh do i just want to be trans because i want to escape society's gender roles?"" or ""am i just pretending to want to be a male so my friends will accept me for who i am instead of excluding me 'because im a girl'?"" It's making my life actual hell. I know there are a lot of upsides to being male that, as someone who was raised as a female, would definitely be jealous of. Things like wanting to be taken seriously no matter the topic, the instant comradery, being able to express feminine traits and be celebrated for doing so instead of these things always being expected of you, and even sometimes shamed for, (like guys at parties who wear bright pink leopard print tights as an extreme example), the wage gap, not being catcalled, being comfortable wearing anything ... theres a long list. Myself being a female, i honestly dont see an upside. Many women are beautiful, powerful godesses; meanwhile theres me. I just dont ""fit"" anywhere a female normally would. Never have, and i doubt i ever will... and is wanting to be male just a quick scheme to being accepted? I need to consider these things seriously before i start making changes. I dont think these are good enough reasons to want to transition, or im just using transitioning as an escape to society's norms. The only thing i want out of this female body is children.. not child birth itself, but i do want biological children, and again being poor af i cant even consider getting eggs frozen, and being a pregnant trans guy ... i dont know how i'd feel about that. 


Then there's the big issue of separating society's ideals from what i want and how i feel. As a classic example: I loved boy toys, dinosaurs and almost exclusively had male friends most of my life. Is this evidence as to me being trans, or is it just me not following society's norms and is completely unrelated to my gender? Again, a great topic to talk to the gender therapist about lol.


If anyone has any advice for me it would mean the world, i appreciate every reply. Thank you again for reading my brain vomit, i just had to try to get everything down, it's been bugging the shit outta me lol. Theres only so much advice non-trans friends can give, god love em for putting up with me.



TL;DR: Internalized transphobia, society's gender roles, and the impact of sexism is making my life and choice whether or not to transition very confusing. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with these? Thanks!"
Confusedkookaburra,asktransgender,"Girls on HRT, what was your starting dosage?","Hey all, I was just curious how everyone's starting doses and experiences on HRT were/are. For me personally, I started on 200mg spironolactone and 2mg estradiol. After the first month I bump to 4mg E, and after the second month I bump to 6mg E.

At the end of the third month I go back in for blood work to see how everything is.

As far as experiential stuff, because of being on low dose E with regular dose spiro, I've found that erections and libido are severely diminished, although feminizing effects haven't become visible yet (just moved up to 4mg E a few days ago though)

Thanks in advance for your replies!"
flacdada,asktransgender,Anyone else identify with characters that tightly matched your gender identity?,"Kind of an oddball but hear goes

From a young age I always identified with the strong female characters.  Today this came to mind because I always really liked Merida from brave as an example.  More examples include Veronica Mars, rainbow dash/twilight/applejack, hermione, the powderpuff girls early on, etc.  

A lot of these characters are strong female characters one way or another.  And it is this narrow slice of the wide variety characters that seems to catch my attention.  I never really understood why it was that avoided male characters somewhat. I mean I have liked Yoda and Spock as characters though even these guys are more androgynous seeming than anything else. Super masculine characters? I don't remember ever really being into one a lot.  I also don't see myself into the super feminine characters.  Anything skewed super hard by one direction in gender I never really identified with.

That kinda leads me to who I want to be.  Identification with certain characters as a decent indicator Ive been pondering. Keep in mind who someone is in terms of likes, interests, personalities, etc has nothing to do with the end gender. It can be a guide but certainly not the end result.

At the forefront of my mind is the fact that none of the characters I listed happen to be defined by the fact that they are female.  They are more representing that they can exist as their characters and also happen to be female.  More I am female and I am x but I am x and I am female.  It's interesting.

Now for me, this self internalization is important because what I realized is that one can be a girl and be an engineer and go for long runs and not give a shit about dating and enjoy lots of more nuetral interests in terms of gender and not want to wear makeup or wear dresses.

That internalization based on these characters (as silly as it sounds my little pony was huge) aided me in discovering I'm transgender.  Now there is nothing wrong or even telling about being a guy and identifying with female characters.  But for me I had this but significantly through introspection my life has been sprinkled with bits of gender discomfort but not outright gender incongruence.  

Both combine to partially allow me to realize that I'm just a girl.  I'm not male.  I can't possibly be male.  I dislike the small nuances, I dislike being considered male I like being considered a girl and I would like to walk around as a girl.

Thanks Merida!  I also like the ways in which I've figured out about what kind of a girl I am.  I'm a tomboy. You're aren't going to see me walking into a makeup store.  That's not me but I'm a girl.  Your not going to see be be super frilly.  That's not me but I'm a girl. I'm weird and full of gender incongruence but I'm a girl.  

Thank you for reading my rant.  Now how about you guys?"
Aegis381,asktransgender,Question regarding US Military service and Transgender people.,"I'm not sure if there's anyone with firsthand experience with this, but I know that the US Navy (can't say for sure about other branches) has begun accepting transgender recruits for their various careers.

Again, this policy is new and I don't know if there would be anyone who frequents this page with experience, but does anyone know how the Navy treats trans people?

ghost_blade_xx,asktransgender,"PSA: trans women on spiro and/or sublingual estrogen, take care of your teeth","I recently went to the dentist to find that I needed 2 root canals and 10 fillings.

In addition, the sublingual estrogen I was taking was seeping around my teeth, having an effect similar to holding sugar water in your mouth for 30-60 mins a day. All of these problems crept up on me in a 1-year period, even though I was taking great care of my teeth flossing and brushing with toothpaste every day. Now, I understand that my diet has included a lot of unhealthy foods and sweets, and different people might have different tooth health, but I just wanted to put this here to warn everyone out there because when I was put on HRT I had no idea spiro and estradiol could potentially cause severe dental issues. xo"

Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,I'm just feeling pissed off about the secret intersex surgery that was done to me as a baby and then hidden from me,"There are scars on the underside of my penis that indicate that I was born with ambiguous genitalia (hypospadias) and then given reconstructive surgery.  Secretly.  As in, I'm 33 and I'm just now finding out about it (I thought those marks were normal, didn't know that they seem to be surgery scars).  I don't know how secret.  It could have been that the doctors didn't even tell my parents, thinking if nobody knew, then this baby with ambiguous genitalia wouldn't grow up to question their gender identity.

Maybe my father knew.  He's wanted to have me injected with masculinizing hormones since age 9 against my will.  That would make more sense if I was born with ambiguous genitalia and he knew about it.

My Endo is of the opinion that I have Partial AIS.  The question, to my mind, has always been, if I have PAIS, why don't I have ambiguous genitalia? I guess the answer is that I did, I just didn't know where to look, how to identify a surgical scar on my penis.  I guess it's still possible that it's not a surgical scar, it's just a massive coincidence, and it's just a surgical scar-shaped birthmark.  Probably not, though.  I'm scheduled to see a Urologist on Tuesday, hopefully he can set the record straight.  I sent the pictures of the scar to my Endo, and she immediately scheduled me with a Urologist.

32 years.  I went 32 years feeling all that confusion, wondering if I was a pervert or a sissy (the only two options that I knew about, given the knowledge of the time in the 1990s, when I was a teenager), wondering why I felt like I wanted to be a girl.  All because there was some crazy plot to hide this intersex condition from me, and from other people born with ambiguous genitalia.  They should have told me, so that I would have had the chance to deal with my feelings in a somewhat more open environment, educated myself, rather than burying it deep down out of fear.  Bastards.

I just feel pissed off that they robbed me of my ability to deal with it in a more open way, sentenced me to secrecy and fear with their bullshit plot to keep it all secret.  I'm pretty mad today.  Yesterday I was kinda shocked, couldn't stop thinking about it.  Today I'm just pissed.

I wish Tuesday would hurry up and get here.  I want to see that Urologist, get it out in the open, what all was done.  Hopefully when he examines me he can set the record straight."

cfdwgc,asktransgender,Exercise makes me super restless at night now,"Hi /r/asktransgender! My quality of sleep is absolutely horrible on nights that I exercise and I was wondering if this was a normal occurrence for MTFs?

A year prior to starting HRT I had a good cardio routine; 5 minute warm up, 30 minute run keeping my heart rate around 165BPM, and a 5 minute cool down. This was done Monday-Friday and I was in great condition. The quality of my sleep would be AMAZING on the nights that I exercised and it really improved my ability to concentrate the next day.

These days it's the complete opposite.

Currently I'm 9 months into HRT and I am struggling to get back into a similar routine. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I go for a somewhat fast-paced 20-30 minute walk. My heart rate is usually between 110~140BPM and the exercise itself does not feel too strenuous at all. I could easily walk twice the distance.

Wednesday night I went to bed tired and fell asleep quickly only to wake up between 3 and 4 times throughout the night feeling super restless.

I just turned 28 back in June, looking up my symptoms it looks like I'm over exercising myself but my workouts aren't really that demanding at all. I usually do my walking right after work but I have plenty of time (4+ hours) to wind down afterwards before bed. This issue has been going on for a few months now (I took about a 1 year break from all cardio vascular training) and on the days that I do not exercise my quality of sleep is very good.

Medications I'm taking: Delestrogen 10mg/ml 0.6mls weekly, Spironolactone 100mg, Progresterone 100mg, Finasteride 5mg, and a Multivitamin daily.

I don't think the low blood-pressure from my Spironolactone is causing the issue as it's recovery that I'm having issue with. I'm also drinking 32oz of water and having a small piece of fruit before heading out. I drink plenty of water throughout the day and before bed. Dinner usually includes some form of protein.

My next appointment with my doctor is still a good 4 months into the future so I think I'm going to hold off on asking him until then as this doesn't seem to be an urgent issue.

Any suggestions on what might be going on?"

tris1599,asktransgender,"Going shopping with a friend, absolutely terrified. Any advice?","On Wednesday I'll be going to a thrift shop with a friend to buy clothes for the first time and I'm freaking out. I've never bought clothes in a store before, and I'm really concerned about being treated poorly by the staff (99% of thrift stores where I live are run by religious organisations, which also concerns me haha). 
So yeah, any advice for keeping myself calm/surviving the experience?"
nafssertam,asktransgender,Is sudden unexpected discovery in adulthood possible?,"I'm a 24 year old man and I've never really questioned the man part until very recently. I read some of the posts on this (amazing) subreddit and I felt I could relate to them like I've never related to anything before. 

The idea that I might be a woman makes me feel warm and complete but at the same time terrified and uncomfortable. I've never really felt dysphoria and I didn't feel like a girl growing up. However reading about peoples experiences of growing breasts and changing mental states makes me want those feelings. 

I sometimes see posts from transgirls that I don't relate to and this makes me feel like I'm probably not trans. This makes me feel relief but also a little sadness. I feel like my life would be incomplete if I don't experience being a girl, I just don't know if cis people ever feel this.

I feel like I would like to transition but I doubt I ever would. Does anyone feel the same? Has anyone ever had these feelings then realized that they are cis? 

Edit: I cam into this expecting everyone to tell me that being trans is something you know deep down from a young age. I assumed I wasn't really trans because I didn't experience this. You guys have got me on the brink of understanding that I'm a girl. Thanks for all your advice."
rek9,asktransgender,What is electrolysis/hair removal like? What would you think about someone who isn't trans receiving it?,"I guess I should give some personal background as to why I'm asking this. I'm a cis guy, but I really do dislike my facial and body hair. The real reason I'm considering this, though, is that I'm autistic, and because of this my motor skills are pretty poor. For me shaving is one of those tasks that is way more difficult than it is for neurotypical people; it can take me up to 30 minutes just to shave facial hair I've grown for a couple weeks, and I usually end up making a mess of shaving cream in the bathroom as well. Also I don't like the sensory feeling of shaving at all. Because of this I'd really like to just get it permanently removed, maybe sometime later in life once I'm more sure about all of this, so I never have to deal with the trouble it brings me. Though of course the other reason would be just be because I'd prefer looking that way all the time. "

LorelaiGilmore,asktransgender,Old friend trying to reconnect. Long story/wall of text. Any advice?,"Sorry for the wall of text. I really need to write this out to sort it all out and hopefully get some input, although I think I already know what it will be and what I should do. Also, sorry for no **tl;dr**. If you didn’t take the time to read it I don’t really want the advice.

So I received a friend request on Facebook this morning from an old friend. We go back to high school, and through college and into my mid-20’s he was my best friend. He’s the first person I ever came out to. At the time he seemed very supportive, and emotionally he was. Both he and his wife were very supportive of my transition and would go shopping with me, encourage me to dress as myself around them, both at their house and while out doing things, and so on. One night I came very close to killing myself. But I put the gun down and called him. He and his wife came over and talked and ended up leaving with the gun, which he held onto until I moved away. He also encouraged me to talk to his priest who connected me with my first psychologist and started the whole ball rolling. Three months later I started HRT.

This, BTW, was a long time ago. (For a lot of you I’m probably old enough to be your mother.) The Internet wasn’t a big thing back then, so we had to struggle through without access to online communities or resources. When I needed him, he was there for me. But although he rarely deadnamed me (even when it was just a terminally ill name) it did seem as though he was having trouble accepting me as female.

After a while I moved out of state and we gradually lost touch. A few years later I moved back and found out that while I had been completing my transition he’d been succumbing to alcoholism and slowly blowing up his life. It also became clear during this time that although he’d been supportive he’d never really accepted the reality of the situation and basically saw me as his old male friend in drag. Nothing I could say seemed to have any effect and we grew apart. 

One day I got a call from him asking me to take him to rehab. It seems his wife had left him and he’d just spent a few months in jail and begged me to take him to rehab in another city. So I did, and that was the last time I ever actually saw him (although I later heard he’d walked away from rehab with someone and ended up in the ER with alcohol poisoning that night).

Fast forward to a couple of years ago and I receive a call from him. He’d gotten my number from my mom. I’m now living out of state again and happily married. He tells me he’s in recovery and stopped drinking, but now has cancer and wanted to talk to an old friend. Then he started calling me 3-4 times a week. Sometimes he would be his old self and we would talk about old times and recent events, but it was still clear he viewed me as just [Deadname] in drag. This was made even more clear on his other calls. He would talk so deep and slow, his words so slurred that I could only make out about 1/3 of what he was saying, and most of that was, frankly, insulting. He claimed it was the cancer meds, not alcohol, and also claimed he didn’t remember doing it. Regardless, he evidently broke his phone and lost my number and my mother didn’t give him my number a second time (evidently he’d also been calling her and leaving long messages on her voice mail in his slow, slurred state). So again we lost touch, and honestly I was relieved. I had enough going on in my life without adding that in. But, I felt guilty for feeling that way.

Back when I was in college I had a psychology professor who taught about what he called ""The Bugs Bunny Shit Bomb."" Bugs rings the doorbell, hands Yosemite Sam a nicely wrapped present which then explodes, covering Sam in shit. And this, he said, is what people tend to do to us in a figurative way. They ring the doorbell, we let them in and accept the gift and it blows up, covering us in emotional shit. The only defense, he said, is to not answer the door so the bomb goes off in their face instead, which leaves them standing on the front porch covered in emotional shit and wondering what just happened.

Now the crux of the matter. My old friend sends me a friend request on Facebook today and I’m torn. It’s almost certainly a Bugs Bunny Shit Bomb. He’s never really accepted me for the woman I am and I have no reason to believe this has changed. And yet, he was such a good friend at a time when I needed that. I don’t know how I would have handled coming out and starting my transition without him. It's not an exaggeration to say that without him I might not even be here today. So, on the one hand I feel a sense of obligation and gratitude to him, but on the other hand I really don’t need a shit bomb exploding in my face.

Any relevant insight or input any of you have would be appreciated.

Sublime99,asktransgender,needing a court order to change name if already updated in passport?,"So as the title suggests, I want to start the ball rolling with updating my vital details (like name, gender etc.) back in Virginia where I was born (I live in the UK atm, making this process a lot harder). I saw the first step is to attain a court document and go through the rigmarole of getting stuff signed, then approved by a judge ad nauseam (blows my mind, why cant it be like the UK, super simple), but as I already have a name change document here in the UK and as such have a ""transitional"" 2 year US passport with all the correct info (gender and name all correct on it), do I still have to file a name change in a court of my last living location (which was over 16 years ago, when I was a toddler) in the state? or will my new passport be good enough. My biggest concern atm is updating SS (I don't have a US driving license so that doesnt matter), as I can't update my birth certificate due to the stupidity of VA lawmakers, meaning I have to have SRS to get a doctors note saying I have had surgery and then send an asinine ""petition"" (I do not get why they're called petitions, this court BS is so annoying), to then get close to changing the docs (again, I live an ocean away, going to court rooms are not viable anytime soon).

Anyway, rant over. But my question about needing a court order even if my passport is correctly named still remains. I know theres this proud federalism about state and federal government, so maybe this might mean something?"
MxMusician,asktransgender,Why do I feel this way? Or what should I do?,"I keep thinking I want to be male just for the sake of having a male voice and body and for people to see me that way but at the same time I don't want to stop being feminine and miss the chance of being a mother (I keep thinking maybe I don't want to be considered a 'father' because I idolise my mother far more than my father and because I feel closer to Mum). If I did transition ftm I think I'd miss being female but I might be happy...? I'm also worried about my singing voice. I don't really like my normal talking voice (although I do somethings think I sound androgynous which feels brilliant until I hear myself on a recording device).

I don't really like it when people call me a girl or use she/her pronouns for me but there's something really off-putting about being called a boy (namely looking at myself and ending up thinking about how they're lying to me or how I'm not really a boy). 
I don't think being transgender is wrong but I'm definitely at war with myself over the subject and that also makes me feel like a bad person. I've actually been feeling really bad and lonely lately and I want friends but often times I feel like I don't deserve friends. A friend of mine is actually out as a transguy but I don't like talking to him about it because I feel like I'd say something really wrong or I'd end up talking about my own feelings which I really don't want because then I'd feel pressured to do something about my feelings. This makes me really anxious around him (especially considering I think about him way too much and like him a lot even before he came out). He likes girls a lot more than guys though - what if he doesn't like me? Maybe I just want to be like him? Although I do remember even before he came out I compared myself to men a lot - especially my body and how much I'm like other boys. I can't relate to girls very much but I don't think I relate to boys much either - but maybe that's just because I'm an individual?

I've been telling myself a lot recently that I'm just a feminine boy and that helps me feel better but also makes me feel like other people wouldn't understand me. I love dresses and the privilege of being allowed to be feminine which I don't think my brother has and that makes me feel grateful but sometimes I just wish I could just be born as a guy who's allowed to be feminine around. 
My parents aren't very open-minded in the LGBT topics so I feel bad feeling like this a lot of the time. I also think I'm probably bisexual and my parents assuming I'm going to marry a boy one day or get a boyfriend instead of being open about me dating any gender bothers me a lot. I'm too scared to bring up the topic though. Last night they were talking about how my older brother will get a girlfriend one day which made me frustrated both at how they were being heteronormative and how they assumed my brother is going to get married to anyone because he told me he doesn't think he likes anyone. I didn't tell my parents that of course. I've told some students at my school that I like the same-sex but the only person I'm close to that I've told is my brother but he may have forgotten because it was a while ago. He said Mum and Dad wouldn't like me being bisexual if I came out and that scared me a lot so I've tried to avoid the situation a while. I'm not really sure why I haven't come out to my close friends considering they're accepting of anyone lgbt, it just feels far more difficult and I don't really really want to bring the topic up unless they'll accuse me of being homophobic and transphobic for avoiding the subjects even though that's probably a ridiculous thought. The guy that I like is already dating someone and I feel like I should be getting over him but it's really hard considering I feel like he's one of the only people who'd ever understand how I feel and care about me.

I love my body a lot but I wish I could make some changes or at least change my sex if I wanted to without going through the long process of transitioning. I know I don't have to change my sex but sometimes I really want to and I'm worried my feelings with get worse when I'm older (I'm 17).
Also some of the stories about transmen I can relate to but a lot I can't - especially when it comes to wanting to dress masculine or wanting to switch traditional gender roles.

Bzttid,asktransgender,Can't test for estrogen?,"Hey everyone!

So, I asked my doctor about getting my hormones tested and this was her response: 

&gt;Also, I agree with checking your testosterone level which should be below 55 ng/dl but checking estrogen levels will not help as the test form of estrogen and the type we prescribe are different.

What's up with this? Is this true, or possible? I'm sorta irritated because she doesn't want to prescribe me injectables because they're hard to titrate, but how do we know what levels to titrate up to if we can't even see my current estro levels? I'm at 4 mg Estradiol and 200 mg spiro for reference."
LameBuzzard,asktransgender,What does a normal circumcision and raphe look like?? (NSFW),"K so my genitals have never looked particularly unusual and I don't think I'm intersex but after reading about PAIS and MAIS and looking at what pics I could find something does seem out of the ordinary. All the pictures suck btw so thats why I'm asking here.

 Lemme give you a summary of what I've found. So a) circumcision scar that as usual makes its way around. b) what I understand to be the raphe doesn't meet and are skewed. The line down from the underside of the head of my penis, and the line extending up in continuation of the line down the scrotum are off set from each other and are distorted by observation c) an inch long diagonal (though mostly vertical) scar on the underside of my penis. That Even seems to have another line forking off from it on the lower right side of the line. 

Again I'm not making any assumptions, I just can't gather this info on my own. Google image searches for something as simple as ""normal circumcision scar"" and ""penile raphe"" come up with less than detailed illustrations and pics mid surgery. So does what I described sound typical? If so and the scar (like 90% it's a scar cause it looks different from the rest of the raphe and is shaped odd) is actually part of the raphe, what maked it look like that? Result of circumcision? 

(Shit I'll post a pic if I didn't describe it well)

softpeachie,asktransgender,Transitioning while catholic?,"Hi hi so um this is probably an odd question.  
I'm 16 and FTM and want to come out to my parents and transition, at least cut my hair and start wearing boy's clothes. I understand why they would wanna wait on testosterone, and while I don't like it, I get it. I can wait a few more years, but passing at least a *little* can't wait. I've already started binding in secret and wearing baggy shirts to hide my breasts. I'm sure my parents won't mind me being trans, my mom definetly wouldn't care and even though my dad may be on the fence about it (he still calls me his little princess and his favorite daughter and all that which makes me rlly uncomfortable but that's another subject) he'd come around I'm sure of it. However, they're devout, every-Sunday Catholics. They may not hold the same beliefs as the church but that doesn't mean the other people at our parish don't. How do I convince them to let me start dressing and acting like a boy and especially to cut my hair?

Acrosserswife,asktransgender,A confused and concerned wife,"So, recently my husband came out to me after 12 years of marriage that he was bisexual and a cross dresser. A couple weeks later he started talking about being MTF trans. I set up an appointment with a counselor for us to have a safe place to talk and the whole time it wasn't about his admission of being a crosser which I was still under the assumption that that's all it was. (Hence the reason for my screen name) I had gotten over the shock of him being a crosser and had gone as far as buying him clothing to wear, make up, and helping him paint his toe nails and apply the make up. He hasn't come out to anyone other than me and although it's been difficult I'm trying to support him as mich as possible. Recently however he made another Facebook account where he identifies himself as female (again not a big deal) and became friends with another MTF. I approved and thought it was a good idea knowing he needed support until he can find a good therapist to discuss everything with. He has since been doing nothing but talking about HRT and when I bring up that there may be safer alternatives than full on reassignment surgery and hormones he gets upset. That's when I found out that the ""friend"" is telling him that I am being unsupportive and that regardless of what I say he's a woman and he needs the surgery and has gone as far as telling h to fast track it by bypassing the therapy part. I'm worried about this because my husband suffers from depression and has attempted suicide once since we've been together. He won't listen to me when I say I don't think she has his best interests at heart and that she doesn't know him as well as I do so how can she make such a judgement.

Simple shit like learning to ride a skateboard. Or playing video games all night with the guys. Things people in my age group did. And do... I just crave doing all these things now. Im young Im only 21, but I still feel silly day dreaming about just letting go and doing fun shit that leans more towards male interest when I have been conditioned all my life (weather anyone meant instill the ideas) of that at my age I should be out of the house or in collage.

Andig123,asktransgender,I need some advice,"So quick life story:

I was born into a predominantly female family; Both my grandfathers died before I was born; I have no uncles, brothers, or male cousins. All my living direct relatives besides my father are female. Because of this I grew up doing stereotypical little girl things like play with dolls, dress up, and bakeshop. My parents never enjoyed me doing these things and always tried to get me into 'boy' things like sports or playing with toy cars but I always enjoyed playing with my sisters and cousins more then those things. To me that was fun, to me that was normal, to me I was one of the girls. All this changed when I started grade school. It seemed that everything we did in school was segregated by gender; friend circles, work groups, PE sports, what people did at recess, whatever. 
and thus I started to do things that boys did. Slowly I stopped playing with my sisters and started playing with my friends doing 'boy' stuff. 
But I never stopped seeing myself as a girl. It was around 5th or 6th grade when I discovered cross dressing, I would wait until the entire house was asleep then I would
lock my door, and wear some dresses that I snatched from my sister's closet. Those nights that I did cross dress were some of happiest moments of middle and high school.
Through all my life I have remained extremely secretive about this and have never told anyone my true feelings, but now that I have just started college, probably the most accepting place
I will ever be in my life, I am starting to think about coming out. There are a few things stopping me however:

1. My parents, they do not support LGBTQIA rights. In fact on New Years day my sister came out to my entire family as a Lesbian and following a day long fight, they have not talked to her since.

2. I have extremely low self esteem; even getting a new pair of jeans makes me nervous to go out in public. If I start wearing dresses in public I am going to have a panic attack

3. My body is not really feminine. I am 6 feet tall, have size 12 shoes, big hands, and a rectangular face. Probably the only thing going for me is the fact that I am as skinny as a twig.

4. I have no idea where to start, a lot of people on this subreddit say talk to a theorist, but I don't know where to find one. Even if I did I don't know if I can afford them.

Maybe its just me trying to throw artificial hurdles at myself, but if anyone has any good advice for me that would be appreciated!"

BloomingGirl,asktransgender,Am I trans?,"Hello. i am 15 years old and live in Scotland. I am trying to figure out if I am transgender. Here are a few signs I've noticed that may mean I am transgender: 

1. I want to be a girl. I really do. But who wouldn't???? 
2. I feel better when people refer to me as a girl. When I pretend to be a girl online it feels right.
3. I don't want to be a man, I want to be a WOMAN, I want to wake up in the morning with breasts and a vagina and a girl's body. 
4. I hate my penis, how it hangs there, how it looks. It shouldn't be there.

But I'm wondering if it's normal for people to feel this. As far as I know I am cis. I don't understand why guys don't want to become girls. I mean, I do. And I'm a guy. Not a girl. People who are transgender ARE a boy (if they are a trans boy) or a girl (if they are a trans girl) but I'm not a girl. Sure, I want to be a girl. But who doesn't?"

HayleyHailsFrom,asktransgender,Is Spiro meant to do this?,"Hi all,
I've been on low dose hormones six months now, but only just started Spiro about a fortnight ago. I also started taking Finasteride at the same time as the Sprio.

Hormones felt great, so right, I wanted to up the dose but am not ready to fully transition yet. I thought adding Spiro might help increase the good way things are going. 

I thought if I get more noticeable feminisation from Spiro with low dose E, well what the hell? Kind of almost at the point where I don't care anymore.

Anyway, at the end of the first week on Spiro things took a dark turn for me. I started feeling a horrible mix of confusion, anxiety and depression. My thinking became really negative and I was moody and snappy.

Eventually I stopped taking the Spiro and noticed even next day my mood was lighter again. The negative feelings went away. I've since been cutting the 100mg pills up to take smaller doses, but even 50mg a day seems to make me feel that same darkness, it's like a feeling of awful foreboding or impending doom or something!

So my question is, has anyone else had this experience with Spiro? or something like this? Did it go away in time if you did?

Since most people start the other way around, on Spiro first before E, I guess it can't just be that both my E levels and testosterone are too low.

I can't get an appointment with my endo until beginning of December. My regular doctor did blood work when I got the Spiro and said everything looked pretty good although I'll have to wait for endo to discover actual androgen/estrogen counts etc.

He doesn't take my identity seriously.
Everyone does exactly the same by refering to me as a '' young man '' ,... They almost treat me like a femme gay and not like a straight woman.

Yesterday I was looking for cars and when I looked in the '' woman's section '' of cars I got comments like that I need to buy a sport's car, a man doesn't drive a cute little car ,..   

I'm so devastated by the fact that everyone disrespects my identity.
That stupid endocrinologist that took me off anti - androgens like as if they wanted me to remasculinize. I know it sounds psychotic but I'm thinking that maybe she took me off anti-androgens out of transphobia.
I'm not in my normal way of thinking. I'm aggressive :( 

I need someone to talk to and support me :'( 

Edit : I know that this is not right but it almost makes me hate cis gay men. Each time they treat me as one of them it's on the tip of my tongue to yell : '' fag, I'm a woman. ''.

FuckingConfusedHuman,asktransgender,Am I trans? Simply confused? Have internalized misogyny or is it just me unconsciously trying justify my sexuality? Or do I just crave a fresh start?,"When I was little gender didn't exist. I had liked girly and boy-ish stuff. I refused to wear pants, because skirts were pretty and I wanted to be pretty, My best friend )a boy) and I wore dresses and lipstick.

When my parents got divorced and I went to school my life became 'gendered' we had a conservative religious teacher who hated me and had clothing rules for me (just me). I became very good at fitting in and obeying.

I changed schools and asked people to call me the male version of my name (disguised it as a nickname. Like: Christina-Chris, Leonie-Leo...). 
I was 'masculine', it gave bullies ammunition and I was called ugly. I wanted to be normal and praised, so I started to be feminine.

I liked my body because it gave me the attention I craved. But my boobs were neve'mine', a disconnection.
with around 14 I started to get OCD thoughts. OCD was all encompassing. I concentrated on functioning, being there for my little sister and pleasing people. My little sister was the most precious thing in my life, I was non-existent (to me).



After I got OCD treatment I started to 'exist' again &amp; questioned my gender, wear masculine clothes etc. My mother said some stuff so I decided that I had to be 'normal', to stop this 'transgender shit'.

My  relationship with men is difficult. I had several bad experiences with men, plus the stories about my granddad (which my mother started telling me when I was about 11) how he raped his sister, pinched my mother's breasts, whipped her bloody etc...how my great-aunt's husband liked to have intercourse with dead poultry and made his family eat them.
But I still felt the happiest when I was behaving 'manly'. It made me feel strong, confident, more than just an object that fits in, pleases etc.

I'm 23 now and I'm good. I'm in law school, the president and chair of a rather prestigious student association, my OCD is manageable. I have positive thoughts about men.





Now.... Why do I think I may be trans?

I love the feeling of strength being 'masculine' gives me. I'm not saying women aren't strong, but I am not a strong women. Being feminine also doesn't make me happy. I like the looks and compliments (I'm not trying to sound conceited), I'm disconnected. Is this my face?


I indentify with with male characters. I want to be them. Not ""like them"" in the sense of character traits... When I like a female character this is different. they may be awesome. But I do not indentify.
I don't hate my breasts, they're just not ""mine"". I don't really want a penis, my vagina is fine. (maybe because I do not want to penetrate anybody.)
I don't hate people calling me 'Ms....' , I just feel no connection with the word, it doesn't really apply to me. 
am I not too old to question my gender?

I think I'd like to pass as male, but more importantly I just want to feel at peace with myself.

I'm also scared that I would never pass. I want to fit in. I'm also scared that I would never have a relationship if I tried to transition. And I want children (I don't have issues with being pregnant, I've always wanted to be), I'm also scared about mandatory military service, to do this as a man. 


So.... This is so long. Sorry!!!. I don't think I'm feminine, but am I male...? Why can't I connect with my body? Shouldn't the inside count? Like, this just makes me cry. i want to feel happy with myself.

i'm sorry for writing sooo much, and I hope it makes sense. English is my 3rd language (and the autocorrect of my tablet is a mess!!)."

tao-nui,asktransgender,"""Having sex"" Dysphoria?","Hi reddit,

I was thinking that about since almost 8 years now, I am often afraid of having sex with my female partners because of my genitals. It's not because ""I hate them"", but because I have always been afraid that they could be dysfunctional, and often they did at different degrees because of that (bad loop). The ""need"" of a proper boner stresses me out, I just wish I could go without it and have sex without being forced to rely on a penis. That is one of the reasons I really prefer being passive, and since I've come to the conclusion that I'm transgender I also realized that having female parts would be awesome because I wouldn't need to worry anymore, it would be all just great. For so long I didn't consider srs because I didn't see it as an option but now I am confused. I want to emphasis that it's not ""genitalia"" dysphoria but rather ""hating the stress of having to rely on a boner, and not being able to be passive with my front parts"".

Is that dysphoria ? Am I alone?"

chrasz,asktransgender,top surgery w/ minor health issues + low dose t?,"hello, i made a post asking about low dose t but i split these questions into a different post because the other one would have been very long otherwise &amp; the posts couldve easily been split up to avoid that. the other post is about low dose t itself, whereas this one asks about low dose t in relation to top surgery &amp; minor health issues i already have. just for context i am not on t atm &amp; havent been yet

i have lateral scoliosis that makes my ribcage uneven (one side is a little higher than the other - as is one of my shoulders but thats less relevant here) and although it is very minor, only about 12°, it does cause back &amp; shoulder &amp; hip stiffness/soreness/pain, &amp; that in combination with my minor cardiac arrhythmia (i dont have to take anything for it, much less have an implant, but it just gives me moments of trouble every once and a while) means that i don't feel comfortable binding. even without that i would still prefer to have top surgery anyways, but i was wondering - how would those things + potential low dose t impact any chances of top surgery? 

i know that im cleared for general types of surgery, because ive had general iv anesthesia before with no problems (aside from my panicky issues with it but that wasnt physical at all &amp; i can do go through with it anyways at the end of the day), and none of my doctors were worried about it. however ive never had any sort of chest or major surgery, and while top surgery doesnt directly involve the heart from what i know,  i was wondering if any of my health problems would make surgery around the chest area, specifically top surgery, a bad idea? they are all very minor but i just want to make sure. 

in addition,  would a low dose of t have any affects different than a regular dose of t would in top surgery context?  obviously it would as far as overall transition goes, but would the surgery specifically be alright? 

i also have even more questions about how a low dose of t would affect bottom surgery &amp; also whether my specific bottom surgery limitations (i am bigender &amp; would prefer to still have a vagina) would be doable. but again i will put that in a separate post"
ImElissa_WasGQTrans,asktransgender,The 100 microgram patches seam so low compared to the Progynova 2 mg pills. One 100 microgram patch corresponds to 1 pill of 2mg though I see a lot of folks wearing only one patch while those of us on pills have to take dosages of 4-6 and up mg of pills. Are those on patches not in the female range?,"I want to go back to patches.  Pills make me nervous because of the spikes in levels during the day. Patches however seam so '' futile '' to me. I'm like , how could that one patch give me the same changes as the pills. 

I mean one 100 microgram patch is a 2 mg pill .
I take 6 mg now under the tongue ( been told to swallow them by my endo but she doesn't know I dissolve them ) and a blood test not so long ago showed that my estrogen was too high 384 pg/ml  on that. 
A cis woman's E needs to be in the range of 60-300 pg/ml I believed it was. 

The problem is that my endo is so conservative . When I asked to go back on patches she said she would allow me to be on no more than a 100 patch. While I objected and asked for multiple patches. Her stupid response : we need to do it with the lowest dose possible, you will not be a woman much faster by taking more estrogen , it only triggers cells to modificate to cancerous forms '' 

It's just that I can't get over the following thought : 

6 mg under the tongue = 12 mg oral which gave me 384 pg/ml 

So 100 microgram patch ( Dermestril was what she prescribes  ) = 2 mg oral E = somewhat over 50 pg/ml if you divide it through 6 .

I can't seam to think that patches are inneffective because pills are so much more E .

I am a lot lot moodier on pills and want to go back to patches because they made me calmer and such .

When I was on patches the first time ( different endo ) I don't know my blood levels anymore but I remember that I was developing ok. 

Can someone help me with where my thought pattern goes wrong?

Summary : want to go back to patches coming from pills but now that I have had the higher doses of pills , patches seam so worthless and ineffective because they have a lower dose in them.

PS : cannot continue to take gel because I developed a bad reaction on my skin from gel. Beside E I'm on Androcur 50.

Insight appreciated much . My endo is so conservative that I don't really trust her anyways .

catfusion,asktransgender,"Fenugreek, HRT and Breast Development?","Ok, so breast development 'is mediated by an assortment of hormones (and growth factors), the most important of which include estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and growth hormone.'

Estrogen &amp; progesterone are are fairly commonly prescribed as part of HRT; HGH (Human Growth Hormone) and 'prolactin inhibitor blockers' (Reglan, Sulpiride, etc..) not so much.

There are some herbs or herbal supplements, namely, fenugreek and milk thistle, that are purported to increase lactation/milk supply and likewise, probably act by increasing serum prolactin levels if they work. 

So ok, all well and good and it's just an herb, right? So maybe you're throwing your money away, but it's probably not going to *hurt* anything? Maybe.

There are some 'naturally occurring sources' of estrogen and progesterone, i.e., phytoestrogens such as are found in soy and wild yam. Those phytoestrogens purportedly can't be metabolized/utilized by the human body as is, but they are used to synthesize ones that are. (Prometrium, which a lot of us are on, is one.)

There's also kind of some question about these phytoestrogens affect on the body - wild yam cream and herbal supplements for breast development are fairly common (and mostly marketed to cis women - it's not just trans girls who want more bust in their bust, not by a long shot.) although their efficacy is suspect.

And there's the various reports of 'spontaneous gynomastia' in men caused by the consumption of soy products, and warnings against eating soy products in the men's health magazines because it purportedly increases estrogen levels (and gives you breasts, dude!), and in the women's health magazines because it purportedly increases estrogen levels and could increase your risk of breast cancer.

Ok. Again, it's questionable how much the body's actually able to do with phytoestrogens, but I've heard a couple of things:

One is that they can interfere with the utilization of purer estrogens, basically the less effective phytoestrogens more easily bind with the estrogen receptors, and act as blockers for the estrogen you're getting in say, your Estradiol tablet.

So the general wisdom seems to be: Don't 'stack' herbal supplements with prescription HRT; it's ok to do the herbal thing pre-HRT but it may actually hinder things if you mix them and the prescription stuff is more efficient. 

But. Back to our prolactin. Which is something we all produce in our bodies, but is present in elevated levels during breast development (including the development for lactating/nursing during and following pregnancy.) And which isn't part of the HRT cocktail.

What I'm wondering about is the presence of phytoestrogens in fenugreek. Anyone know anything about the pharmacology of that plant? If it just (allegedly) increases serum prolactin levels, then it's probably fine to take along with HRT? (Even if it doesn't actually do anything, no harm done.) Or is it something that has the potential for zero or negative net gain, i.e., sure, you've got higher prolactin levels, but you're also blocking estrogen binding with phytoestrogens.

And, of course, a lot of this supposition may be based on misinformation and phytoestrogens don't actually work that way at all, etc...

Anecdotal experience stories may be helpful, (particularly in support of or discrediting a given theory, if not super scientifically) but what I'm really hoping for is more factual information about the makeup and action of these things, specifically fenugreek, and to a lesser degree, phytoestrogens, in order to theorize a little bit in the first place. 

Thanks.

I've been there fairly frequently over the last month while I was in my temporary self exile to boy mode.

Last night however was the first night I went since I tossed all l my male clothes. I handed them my casino card to start comp (timer for the free buffet) and they told me that I couldn't start my husbands comp! I told them, that no, that's me...

So they asked for my ID and again they said ""Ma'am, you gave us your husband's ID. Is he here? If he comes up here, we can start his comp...""

I said ""no, seriously, that's me. It's a little out of date...""

The manager came up and had seen me there previously enough times that he must have recognized my face, because he just told her ""Yeah, she's (referring to me) him (referring to my ID), drop it and start her comp.""

Kind of amazing to me to realize that I've hit that point where I'm almost unrecognizable.

I was hoping to be able to ask here to find out whether anyone has had a similar experience, and how I should go about this next stage of things. 

Now, just to contextualise this: I've been working on my appearance and passing for a year now, I'm just about there with competent makeup, shoulder-length hair, beginning to be more adventurous with clothing choice etc. So in light of all this using men's bathrooms hasn't caused me any /trouble/ so much as discomfort for me and confusion for other people in there (I still get called he/him most of the time but that might be for voice related reasons). 

Last time I was in a men's restroom begrudgingly I was at the sink in an empty restroom when this poor guy comes in and genuinely all 'uhm... is this the men's?' to which I say yes whilst standing next to the urinals, he replies 'oh.. sorry(?)' and goes about his own thing. 

I haven't used any gendered public bathroom since because I honestly don't know what to do. Obviously I'm keen to start using the bathroom I'd be more comfortable in, I just don't know whether I pass well enough to stir up unwanted attention or conflict. In my mind I presume people really just don't care and are whatever about that sort of thing, but I would really prefer to know what other trans-feminine people think is the most viable option.

2. Can estrogen ""shrink"" me a bit? (Nothing massive of course, just anything at all x3 )

3. I've had two apps with a psychologist, and tbh I've kinda been ready for hrt, but at the same time I'm scared...should I wait a bit?

4. Is it possible to go with hrt, and be considered as living as the opposite sex but not dress and necessarily out myself, and still have my insurance cover srs???"
HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,im absolutely terrified of genital surgery but i think i need it,"i rarely confront my fear of surgery, most of the time i tell myself it'll be fine im ready but its because i can't feel the fear when im telling myself that.  the fear absolutely overwhelms me, fills me with paranoia and doubt and [regret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVHQNGzPbOI) and i can't get past it.  i just bottle it up again.  Oddly, bottling it up also causes me to have constipation--i know this is weird and seems irrelevant, but ive had constipation 'issues' since i was young.  and for some reason, my transgender-ness as a whole seems connected to that.  Weird, right?! I'm not lying though, this is seriously how i feel, and i dont know why.  Also, people have told me they thought I was gay, and I think i expressed my sexuality in a 'gay way', and since the butt is the only ""hole"" i had, to be crude, i think that's why its connected to the transness?  but yet, if that's true, how can i confirm that im trans and not 'just gay'?! 

Essentially, theres nothing giving me definite proof to make me comfortable with transgender surgery. maybe its because its not 'real' enough, even though surgery is very good there are so many risks, and im dealing with what im born with vs what's constructed.  agh D'x i can't actually cry right now but i wish i could.  

i dont know what to do now.  since confronting the fear and releasing my pent up stress/constipation, ive retreated back into my shell of confused numbness.  it sucks"

kernalmustache,asktransgender,How should I disclose my transgender identity to new friends.,"I'm in my second year of college and in the first year I made a lot of great friends who were accepting when I started HRT. On my first night moving back into my college residence I had met a few people who my new roommate has been hanging out with since she moved in earlier. A bunch of us were drinking and went to a house party and I ended up returning home with my roommate one of our new friends. My roommate already knows that I'm transgender, but I didn't have a conversation with her about it and this friend does not know (or at least I haven't said anything to him about it). Earlier in the night he had said that I'm an attractive guy, but then a few hours later when we were all more drunk and had split up for a bit at the party he asked me if I'm transsexual (which threw me off mostly because he said transsexual). My roommate then immediately asked me what my pronouns are. I told them we can talk about this the next day when we're all sober, but I don't exactly know how I should talk to them about it. Should I just bring it up? We all barely know each other so I feel like it might be awkward. Should I wait until somebody asks again or brings it up somehow? I know this is all personal to my own situation, but what would you guys do? What would you say? Are there certain things I shouldn't bring up until we know each other better?"
Tyunre,asktransgender,Fun Times,"Shit hit the fan last night. 

My ""father"" finally understood what ""transgender"" means, and called me on the phone. He went completely apeshit. Saying that he would not allow me to take medicine, or to shove stuff in my ass , or to have my balls cutt off. Saying that I didn't love them, that this was blackmail (asking for love and respect is apparently blackmail nowadays), and said that if I started HRT under his watch, he would throw everything away. The cars, the house, the money, everything. And then kill himself.

My ""father"" is such a deranged piece of shit that he's willing to destroy EVERYTHING (including my mother) to hinder my progress in life.  

So, from this, two solutions offer themselves to me :
-First : I kill myself. A big ""FUCK YOU"", Nice and messy. Problem is. There are people out there who love me for who I am, and I aint no quitter.
-Second : Survive and dance on his grave. With the most expensive dress I can buy.

Fine then. 

I shall be waiting. Lying. Saying that everything is fine. Giving them what they want. Until the time comes and I'm more or less financiallly stable. 

I've learned to control my fire and I'll give him a taste of his own medicine.

Maxpayte,asktransgender,My feel good story! And has anyone had anything positive happen to them recently?!,"Positivity is making a big resurgence in my life. I used to post lots of positivity things under the name ijustdontknow93. Now I'm back on my main Reddit account, no shame, to try to get back to that. 

Encroaching 6 months, things are improving. And I can say with certainty that low parts of transition and be easily butted away by trying to stay positive. Cut out the problems in your life or handle them in small bites while embracing the little things that do happen. For example I only engage my family about once a week now. And I had a nice story happen at work that I am holding on to. The story goes as follows;

A customer comes in and tells me my name is pretty and the main protagonist in her novel she's writing is also Chloe. She proceeds to say it's odd my parents gave me that name because it's a name someone would give them self. She then asked what my middle name was. I retort ""Paige."" She responded by saying my parents did a good job naming me lol. She had no idea that I indeed did pick that name lol. �� passed with flying colors for that moment!!! ��

So I ask citizens of asktransgender, what things are you doing to fix your negatives and what positives are you holding onto?!

33peace,asktransgender,Post op SRS with Suporn question.,"I'm 5 weeks post op and for about the last week I have had a consistent erection feel. It isn't a phantom limb sensation, it's a hard knot right about where the erectile tissue should be. It is just really uncomfortable and makes it hard to move around or sit/lay comfortably. 

I finally got labs done today so I can see if my T kicked back in as he says it can and once blood was taken I restarted spiro, just in case and maybe that will help. 

He says that sexual thoughts during the first few months can cause bleeding and I have found out that's true. I actually had a 'wet' dream and woke up covered in blood. Which is why I am really asking the question. Because if the sexual arousal in sleep caused me to bleed then what is this feeling? It is very persistent- much more than elections would ever have been. But it feels much the same and just started around a month post op. Anyone experience anything similar? I've bothered Sophie a few times already so trying to figure out if this is a big deal at all, what will make it go away, if anyone else experienced something similar?"
Questioning-Alt,asktransgender,How can I get fem stuff without anyone knowing?,"Okay, this is the sequel to two other posts I made, and I feel like they might solve some questions you might have. They are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4zwtcg/im_questioning_and_im_14_any_advice/] and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4zwtcg/im_questioning_and_im_14_any_advice/).

Now that that's been said, let's get on with it. So, as the title says, I am very curious as to how to get fem stuff. There's a couple things I want to say.

* First, I can't use my mom's clothes, the only girl who lives with me. As some people said in my first thread, wearing other people's clothes isn't cool, and in hindsight, kinda gross.

* Second, I'm not 100% sure about buying them from amazon or other online stores. Imagine this: You're my mom, and your 15 year old son just used his birthday money to buy something online. The package arrives, and your son rushes into his room to open it. You don't know what it is, and he doesn't want to tell you. Wouldn't that make you pretty suspicious? Don't even get me started on buying from a physical store.

* Third, in case this comes up, I don't know how I could borrow clothes from a friend. I think only a few of my AFAB friends (I'm saying that because one of them identifies as agender, if I remember correctly, and the other is a transboy) know about this, and I'm not sure if asking them for clothes is a good idea.

Well that's that. I'm probably going to go to sleep soon. Can't wait to hear your responses!"

Long story short I am a bi/pan guy, my boyfriend is gay. I love him very much, he's the sweetest guy I have ever met, but I am a little nervous for our future.  
  
1. He is unable to get access to hormones and is pre surgery/everything but wears a binder. I am aware to a certain extent that gender dysphoria can make life very hard, what are some steps I can take to help him through this until he had fully transitioned?   
  
2.  I am not very good at anatomy but it is my understanding that he does not have a prostate. Generally with guys who are bottoms (he is), alot of arousal comes from pressure on the prostate. How can I help him to ensure he gets more pleasure out of things like that? Is it okay involve his vagina or should that be totally ignored? General tips that fall in this category?

CallMeKali,asktransgender,I feel like I lost my mind and now I'm getting a reality check..,"I'm mtf, nearly 4 months on hrt.

Since then, I've practically buried my male clothes and haven't looked back. I didn't pass, but whatever. I pulled confidence out of absolutely nowhere and just owned it. I still used the men's bathroom though, because it was quite obvious that I'm not biologically female.

But now, I'm noticing that I've started passing some of the time and it's creating some confusion for me. I'm no longer comfortable walking in the men's restroom for fear of outing myself and potentially being assaulted, but I'm not comfortable using the women's restroom because I don't pass terribly often and I don't wanna cause a scene if someone decides to say something.

Also, my voice is meh but not passable. I started training my voice a couple years ago because I didn't want to get to the point of passing and still have a guy voice, but I haven't made much progress and now I'm scared to talk in public most times.

I didn't plan on going full time this early but now I don't want to go back, but my confidence has gone and I don't know what to do about these situations. Any suggestions?"

zirataylor,asktransgender,Should I feel violated about this? Or should I feel like I violated her?,"This happened 6 months ago, but I can't stop trying to figure out how to feel about it. I still think about it every day.

I'm a trans woman. So is my ex. We broke up 3 months ago. But 3 months before that, apparently I initiated sex in my sleep. I had no memory of it, but she did (obviously) and while she said she ""wasn't hurt, she was just annoyed that I didn't stop when she wanted me to"", I've been really afraid that she was just saying that so I wouldn't feel bad once she found out I had no control over it. Apparently she woke up to me tying her up (which we'd always done consensually, and she always initiated. Tbh, I never really liked tying her up, I just know she did and I wanted to please her any way I could), and then I had anal sex with her. My therapist, because of some other relevant information, thinks I was being manipulated, but I'm still not sure. She thinks that my ex was just making it up, and that I was in an abusive relationship.

My ex said, after we finally talked about this, that I looked sort of drugged like I was in a haze or something, but she didn't try to wake me up or anything. If this actually happened, should I feel violated? Because I do. This was sex I didn't want to happen, didn't give consent for, and had no control over. Both her and I know from experience that she can get out of knots, even if I tie them as tight as possible, and that she can lift me up, so she totally could have stopped me, but she didn't.

Right after this happened, she started to get really angry at me about a lot of things, and started talking about wanting to break up with me, but I thought she was kidding about that because I had no reason to think anything was wrong. I had no memory of the thing she was starting to hate me about, the initiating sex in my sleep. I kept asking her what was wrong, and why she seemed so depressed all the time, but she wouldn't talk about it. I didn't even find out about my sleep sexing until a friend told me that my ex had talked to *him* about it, but not me. But before I knew about it, there were months where she would act like she hated me, she would yell at me, and she stopped talking to me at all at one point, she stopped saying things like ""I love you"", stopped giving me any kind of affection, but kept letting me clean her apartment and cook for her and stuff. She started initiating sex without really asking me, and then going back to completely ignoring me after some really painful sex. She always stopped when she was done, not when I asked her to.

Eventually we talked about it, and that's when she told me that she wasn't angry or hurt about what happened, she was ""annoyed at worst"" and that she just started to get angry because she thought I knew what I'd done but didn't care. At that point, she immediately changed her tune to ""I don't want to break up with you, everything is fine now"", but I can't figure out if that was her manipulating me, or her feeling bad that she put me through so much when I didn't even have control over what I'd done. I'm not even sure that sleep sex thing really happened at all, I still have no idea if she made that up or not, because she didn't say anything about it to me, I found out about it from one of her friends. She might have just wanted sympathy from her friends, and made it sound worse to them than it was. Or maybe it didn't happen, idk.

After all that, I didn't recover. She'd damaged the relationship, and after everything I'd been through, there was no fixing it. I shut down. Eventually, I said we might need time apart, just so I could get stable again, and she outright broke up with me because ""that would be the same as breaking up"". A month before we broke up, she told me I should stay with my mother for a while, so I have suspicions she was just trying to get me back home, almost a thousand miles away, so that she could just cut contact with me instead of breaking up, so she wouldn't have to deal with it.

I just don't know what to feel. Even though it's been three months since the breakup, I think about her, and the situation every day. I can't figure out if it was my fault, or if she damaged the relationship through a lack of communication. I also feel really violated, first of all for the sleep sex thing, if that even happened, because it was sex I didn't want, and secondly for the way she initiated sex when I didn't want it. But that would be kind of justified if she thought I tried to rape her, right? I don't even know anymore.

Edit: I just want to say, that I know for a fact that whenever I was conscious, I was reluctant to have sex in the first place, unless she was initiating, and I almost never initiated sex. And I *know* that whenever she said no, I just rolled over and went to sleep, or I went and... took care of it myself. I masturbated is what I'm saying. I never, EVER, when I was conscious, kept going when she said no. And usually I wasn't the one initiating, it seems really out of character for me to initiate sex, but it NEVER happens that I even mentioned anything related to sex after I got shut down.

In any case, I feel like shit, after getting treated like I was a rapist for several months. I can't forgive myself. I don't know what to do.

I talked to her recently, and she told me that I needed to ""forgive myself and get over her"". But she's never apologized for the stuff she did to me. And I feel hurt. But I don't know if that's valid to feel. Like, at all."

I mean if this only happened once or so it could be nice, but I'm definitely picking up a more creepy vibe

And just a few days ago as I was walking towards a friend when she mentioned that C was watching.  I asked her if he was "" watching intently? "" to which she said yes.

In other words they seem to feel keeping t low is more important than estrogen high I guess.  I need to look at it more later today.  But they think Spiro(100-200mg a day) and the addition of finasteride is a great overall plan.  Yes estradiol is added as well but their main focus seems to be testosterone and keeping it low.

So, it should be legal to discriminate based on training and physical ability to do the job (ballerina = legal to discriminate against people in wheelchairs, casting for a film role for a black slave in a period piece = legal to discriminate based on skin colour, etc...).

Changinggirl,asktransgender,Looking in the mirror...,"So lately I've had this weird experience. I will wake up, do my skin care stuff and shave, and then when I look in the mirror... I don't know what or who I'm looking at. I see a face that isn't coherent, and doesn't make sense, and I don't recognize it, it's not male or female, it's just a face I don't know, made up of pieces that don't seem to fit together. And then gradually, minute by minute, as I do my hair and take a moment, it starts making sense again and I start feeling comfortable with what I see, as far as you can be at the start of your transition ofcourse. 

Has anyone else had this experience that they look in the mirror and feel totally estranged from what they see, like it's a face that's just made up of random parts and then starts coming together after a while? It really freaks me out and makes me scared that people actually see me that way and that seeing it come together is only my brain filling in the gaps, or some such psychological process. Also it's scary, I don't like this kind of mind game thing at all. Anyone? "
Vineyardfighter,asktransgender,MtF hard to get close with cis females?,"I've been noticing this issue for a while, and at first I figured it would just be the first few cis women I met, then it ended up being more and more.

Before starting my transition and while still living as a male, I had a very easy time getting along with everybody regardless of gender and other people seemed to like me. I had more female friends than male friends.

Now, being a full-time female, I have almost 100% male friends. Men are a lot more friendly towards me, some even want to hookup before and after finding out I am trans. Most don't really care. But for some reason, every woman I knew or met since being full-time has avoided me like the plague.

Has anybody else had this issue? Not having any female friends really sucks. I also lean more towards women than men, so it makes for improportional dating. I'd like to hear other people's experiences.

EDIT: Since somebody pointed it out, here's a bit more specificity.

- I am 19 (hint: flair)

- Most of my friends/acquaintances are between the ages of 19-25

- These people are from pretty mixed subcultures. Nerds, party-goers, druggies, chillers, hikers, downtown bar addicts, etc. I'm into everything so I get to interact with all of them.

I am Max [last name]. I'm a trans girl and I'm starting HRT next month. When I was dating [ex-gf], she told me I needed to learn to love myself. Maybe that's why I always wanted more from her. But I hated myself. When I look in the mirror, even now, I get nauseous, because I can't compute that the face I see is mine. I don't care about how I dress or look, because I'm more interested in other people. I tend to pick up personality traits from friends and characters because I don't know how I want to act. I love going to parties, because, even if I'm not drunk, I can pretend I am, and not have to apologize for acting however I want to. I can be girly, and friendly, and bouncy, and noone bats an eye. (Although some people have asked if Drunk Max is gay - if only). But I care now. I care that my hair stays long and silky, I care how the clothes I wear make my figure look, and I care what other people see when they look at me. I started working out, eating better, smiling more. Because I care. That's why I need HRT, because, otherwise, I just can't care. And now, even before starting, I'm happier to be me than ever."

[deleted],asktransgender,Did I just experience transphobia?,"If you've read my posts in the past, I'm a 50 year old trans woman that has been on HRT for 3 years, but only 4 months on a full dose. I haven't been doing much to look overtly feminine yet. I have long hair and wear some jewelry. I have visible boobs and wear plain t-shirts and jeans, but don't wear any makeup.

I have been getting gendered female more and more recently. Usually before I open my mouth, since my voice is still a work in progress, but I guess I should be happy that it's happening at all.

Today, I went out to lunch with a friend. We were greeted with ""Hello ladies"" from the hostess. Greeted with ladies from the waitress when we sat down, and strongly called ladies through half the meal. When she asked if I wanted a refill, she squeaked out a sir and for the remainder of the meal would only speak to my friend and would not acknowledge my existence. She handed my friend the check and told her to have a nice day while we were leaving, again ignoring me.

Was this transphobia? or just embarrassment because she thought she had made a mistake? I know that I felt a chill when it was happening. This middle androgynous stage is definitely a strange experience."

Do you think it'd be possible to pass while keeping my guy slacks and nerdy band and tv show t-shirts? I've seen so many people start wearing dresses when transitioning, and... I just don't know if that's me.

TheSavannahSky,asktransgender,How to get better shaved legs?,"So, I'm still pre-HRT and trying to find a therapist who is both open minded and able to prescribe it. But in the meantime I'm trying to do some other things like shaving my legs and chest. Now, I'm an unfortunately naturally hairy person, so its been a bit of a chore to do so. But using Nair I've gotten myself fairly ""clean"" of it. However, on my upper thighs I have a bunch of red bumps like... I dont know how to describe them. I thought it was razorburn or something I was doing wrong so I left it be for a few weeks to let it settle and heal, but after shaving today they're still there and they persisted throughout the respite. Its really starting to get to me that I cant even seem to get close to the smooth and clean look on other girls (and some guys I see).

However I am not certain the others are out(all  are still are called by male names during roll call).  They both are pretty much at full blown male fail(like I thought both were cis female until I heard names) so its rather obvious that HRT has been involved for a while.  I would love to go over and just say ""Hi im ____, I am pretty certain you and I have some things in common."", but I really dont know if that is kosher.

TL:DR
If you meet somebody in a public place who is probably trans but not out, whats the best way to introduce yourself without offending?"

bla_c123,asktransgender,How do you tell the difference between depression and dysphoria?,"I'm a psychology student, and we have learned the diagnostic criteria for depression. From what I know, I am pretty confident that I would be diagnosed (and I plan to seek help about this), but my ""depression"" (using quotation marks because I don't want to self-diagnose) is very much related to my dysphoria. For example, some of the diagnostic criteria is an overall feeling of hopelessness and guilt, a depressed mood, suicidal feelings, sleep disturbance and an inability to get joy from things that used to/normally make you happy. I've experienced these things, but they are all caused by dysphoria. So, is dysphoria just gender-related depression, or do I have both dysphoria and ""depression"" and they influence each other? Have any of you guys experienced these symptoms as a result of dysphoria (you have to have had at least 5 of these symptoms at least once in the past 2 weeks for it to count as depression, by the way), and were you diagnosed with depression because of those symptoms or just dysphoria?

BumbleBeeDude62,asktransgender,My mom says I can't be transgender,"I'm 14, and came out as transgender to my mom a few weeks ago. She said I couldn't be, that I was her daughter, that I'd always liked 'girly' things and had estrogen and a period. She kept insisting that I'd always liked 'girly' things but that was when I was younger. By fifth grade I stopped liking barbies and lost any interest in makeup. The only thing I really liked was reading. I've always been able to relate to male characters in books and even taken on temporary personality tributes from them. I want to be known as Oliver and have he/him pronouns used on me but my mom doesn't accept me and says I can't be a guy. 
I was gonna tell some of my friends, some already know but they're internet friends. I have a friend who might be trans but identifies as a genderfluid demiboy and I know they'll accept me and use my right pronouns and name, because I did the same to them when they came out to me. But I've already had an anxiety attack over this and I can't wait any longer to be known as Oliver. I can't wait till college were people don't know me because I'm afraid if I do then I might be dead by the time Highschool is over. I can't live as Lucy anymore. That's not me. I'm not her.

Now however, I'm lonely a lot of the time and I keep finding myself getting crushes on people. It's incredibly frustrating, as I don't like needing other people. I'm also awkward as hell in social situations, which makes the likelihood of finding a partner (especially one who'll put up with someone completely uninterested in sex) really, really painful.

So, did other asexual aromantic (or otherwise, feel free to comment!) find that their romantic orientation changed whilst on HRT/transitioning? "

throwawthrowaway2016,asktransgender,Brain discomfort closely associated with dysphoria,"I've been experiencing consistent head pain for about 3 years. From what I can remember, I had taken adderall and was pulling an all-nighter for an assignment. I decided to take a break and look at some online pornography (cross-gender erotica/ comics). I've had sexual fantasies of myself as a female shortly after puberty. As I reached orgasm, I came to a very difficult realization about myself (i.e that I was trans) and became very distraught. This sudden rush of feelings was accompanied by intense pain in my head which to this day lingers between the middle of the top of my head, half-way between my ears. There is also a certain degree of tenderness and sensitivity in and around my anus/ prostate. I have long since accepted the the realization I came to that night, but the lingering head pain remains a mystery. I experience it constantly. In recent months it has receded in intensity, but remains nonetheless. Does anyone have any insight about what I am experiencing? Can anyone offer an explanation as to its origin? Is this pain something that can be addressed through treatment? Any other general thoughts or comments? 
To be clear, I just want to deal with the specific issue of headaches and brain discomfort. "
americanpegasus,asktransgender,Saw something that made me sick to my stomach at the mall.,"I mean, it was nearly /r/thathappened material.  I certainly couldn't believe it; I thought surely we had moved past this as a society.  :(  
  
I guess not.  
  
I was at the mall, when I caught a woman walking out of the corner of my eye.  I turned my attention and saw her - dressed to the nines; I mean, she was looking supermodel fabulous.  Incredible heels, flawless makeup, designer clothes.  She was one of those people who looked so good it was hard not to notice.  
  
I caught the tail end of a group of guys giggling nearby.  One guy of their group had just gone and approached her, and was reeling backwards in theatric fashion.  He began yelling incredibly loudly back at his friends, who were twenty or thirty feet away, ""**Yo, it's a man!  It's a MANNN!**""  
  
His jeering was so loud and obnoxious it caught the attention of many others, some of whom whispered among themselves giggling and pointing.  Literally.  
  
The poor transwoman hurried on, doing her best to escape the storm of harassment.  The guys were falling over themselves with laughter as they stumbled the other way.  
  
I wish I could tell you I said something or did something, but the whole scene happened so fast it took me by total shock.  I realized far too late I had just let something terrible happen around me and I had done nothing.  This was in a mall in a major city in *California* of all places, supposedly one of the most tolerant and liberal places in the country.  Apparently not nearly as much as I had thought.  
  
The rest of the day I was stewing over it and it absolutely killed me what happened.  I kept thinking of how they had referred to her: '**It's** *a man*.'  To them this wasn't even a person; it was a thing, worthy of limitless scorn and mockery.  'It' had no feelings or agency - 'it' was merely a hilarious joke in their world, a prank of nature that had been played on them for a brief moment.  
  
I couldn't even imagine how she had felt, with literally every person around her in that mall laughing at her... For simply existing.  I mean, should she have not dared show her face in public?  Should she have especially not dared to put effort into her appearance?  What did they want from her?  
  
She wasn't bothering anyone, just walking and trying to shop.  She didn't deserve to become the butt of amusement for the entire building.  
  
I know the story sounds like a caricature of the truth, but it was Hollywood levels of awkward, and it really happened.  I wish I had said or done something, but I didn't.  And it kills me inside that I could have made some small difference, but chose to just watch it happen instead.  
  
I'm so sorry if any of you have dealt with anything like this; no one deserves such hatred.  All I can say is that next time will be different.  The shocking malevolence of society won't paralyze me to inaction anymore.  I'll take a stand and intervene.  "
nesterbation,asktransgender,Too soon for breast augmentation?,"I've been on hormones for a bit over 18 months. I'm about 5 months post op from GRS.

Gothrenapp,asktransgender,My full story and concerns [advice please],"Some people might notice that I post here quite a lot. The first thing I wanna say is thank you for all the support on here, this is truly a wonderful subreddit and a great place to get advice. This is going to be very long and I'm going to be telling my full story, I hope some people will read and give feedback despite how long it is. 
I'd say I've always been a little feminine since childhood. My Mom used to say I'd beg them for barbies as a child. I always liked girly things to a degree. Dad is also always saying how women are so hard to understand, but to be honest, I've never had that trouble, I do understand them! As a kid and young teen I would also dream about what it would be like to be a girl, what I would do. It was a fantasy for me.
I think what jump-started all this is when I cosplayed for a convention, a cosplay which required me to paint my nails black. I fell in love with them. In fact there was a huge issue with me and my Mom because I wanted to keep painting my nails. I also would wear make-up for every cosplay and loved it. At the same time I also adored longer hair for boys, I've been growing mine out ever since even though Mom disagrees. 
Some time ago, I don't know when, maybe a year, or even longer back I discovered MTF videos of transwomen showing the results of transition. I knew right away I wanted to transition just like them. With my girlfriend at the time, Jamee, it became an obsession, I was so sure this is what I wanted to do. I'm about 16 at this point. After my break up with Jamee I became suicidal, starting to self harm. My parents got me a psychologist right away. It's true that I went in for depression, but my depression went away before I even saw my psychologist. More than anything, I wanted to talk about being trans. 
I think eventually I kinda forgot about it.
At school I would often look at girls and imagine me in their shoes, I was always envious of them. 
I used to talk to girly boys as well, sissies, and don't think it's a mean thing to say because this was their fetish. My ultimate goal was to look as much like a girl as I ever could. 
I started trying certain things. I shaved my legs (which resulted in horrible razor burns) which felt amazingly smooth. At one point I stole my Mom's panties from the laundry. Even though they aren't panties for girl's my age, they felt amazing. 
I always wanted to wear make-up to school but my parents never let me. I can wear make-up to school now. 
One night I came out to my parents, they later admitted they were very enraged by it all and my Mom at one point even joked at me for it. 
Not much was said about it after that, I was given girl's black leather boots though, other than that it just became a inside joke in the family. As I said, it kinda passed while being girly.
I told my psychologist ""I want to be a girl."". He told me how gender works, but that was it.  
Eventually, it was triggered again when I talked to a trans girl, I came out to my parents for the second time and they said they both supported me despite calling me ""son"". I showed my psychologist the message I sent to both of them, but all he said was transgender wasn't his field of work. The doctor handed us some kind of sheet for LGBT people, I assumed it was some sort of camp like a sheet he gave us before. Dad also said all I want is change, it has nothing to do with gender, he says. 
Dad also later said in the car that day that transition isn't done very well yet. That anyone who transitions will be recognized as such very easily and obviously, and that you should just stay the gender you're born with. Mom would often say, not just about gender, but anything to do with surgery, that you should stay the way ""god"" made you. 
My psychologist now thinks I'm lying to him for other reasons, he says trans isn't his field of work, and my doctor is also very old fashioned, so I've stopped seeing him completely. Normally I think you would have to pay a psychologists hundreds, but my family is very poor, so I guess we just got him for free.
I've also talked to some other trans people about all this. According to them, I don't need a psychologist. I could just go to a clinic from a LGBT support group and do it there, but one of my trans friends says that's illegal without a doctor's note in my state.
Lately, I think I've gotten worse. It used to be where I didn't want to crossdress, that I didn't want to stick out and be seen as a freak by the public, but now I want to wear girl's clothes, I want to do everything a girl does, because that's what I am. I'm a girl, but only mentally. 
I've had a third conversation with both of my parents online about pronouns, mostly because they called me ""son"" several times before. They said they can start using my name instead of calling me ""son"", but they cannot call me she or her. My Mom said I was born as a male and it's very upsetting that I want to change that. I just don't understand why it should be upsetting at all. 

Now, I may have my doubts, but I know that I 100% want to transition. In fact a reason I didn't say much to my psychologist was is that I didn't want to say something that would identify me as non-trans and be denied transition. That would be the greatest regret of my life. In fact ever since this all started, I've been wanting to find another trans person, already transitioned, so I can lie my way in, if I knew every thing to say. 
Again, my family is very poor so what I'm worried about is money. Say my family was supportive, could they afford it? Could I ever afford it? 
My Mom is going to college to be a nurse and might even have a job now. My parents are also very paranoid and protective and I've had plans to move away after I'm 18 due to stress, but now I'm thinking of staying on the possibility that I can transition through help of my parents. 
Just today I went to see my school counselor. He asked about my feelings and I told him I've always felt feminine, and that I have researched this, and that I do want to transition. He suggested if my parents would be willing to go to a LGBT support group. He also said if I were to have a meeting with my parents and my case manager, the school may be able to start calling me by my pronouns. He said he would call my parents tonight about this, but nothing's happened. 

For those of you who have, thank you for listening and I would love all the advice and support you can give. "
NateG12,asktransgender,"I hate not knowing who I am, or who to talk to","So first off, I was born male, I just started college, and I'm finally growing out my recently dyed hair. Over the last few months I've really started to question my identity, and it is extremely frustrating to not have a solid answer for myself. I've been fantasizing a lot about how much I would have rather been born a girl, but there are a lot of times where I'll be just fine with being a guy. I know that genderqueer is a thing, and I've considered that too, but that doesn't feel quite right either because it feels almost like a cop out to me, that I don't have to decide what I am. Not to mention I already hate my body because I'm slightly on the heavier side.

The worst part is that I don't know who to talk to about it. I know for a fact that some of my friends and my parents wouldn't be very accepting, and I'm afraid to come out to the few people I know I could come out to, but I'm not sure what to say since I don't even know exactly how I identify. It would just be more confusing to them if I came out as confused. ugh

Any tips?"
start315,asktransgender,"Taking Estrofem sublingually, asking for Lifestyle Advice!","Hey there!


I come here asking for advice from those who were taking their E sublingually for a long time because I feel that it is interfering with my life too much. 

I'm taking 4mg of estrofem sublingually for 4 months already, I like it's effectiveness and the fact it kind of bypasses liver.

But the problem is, one pill dissolves in 30 to 60 minutes for me (50 on avg.) , and i do it twice a day. I know that it's best if it doesnt come into direct contact with lots of saliva, and if i want the most effectiveness out of, it the longer it takes to dissolve, the more effective it is, in other words, the less is lost in the mouth and more comes through to the bloodstream.

As I really want the pill to have its best effects on me, i learnt to not feel its taste, making them stay for quite a while in my mouth as i mentioned. But also I cannot talk during this whole time, which has been huge interference with my life.

Basically, whenever it's time to take my pill, I HAVE to be alone. Just a few words or couple of sentences could spoil it. If I'm at home and my family is there, they can't ask me anything, I can't answer, if I'm in the city, and someone comes up with some question, or I just have to buy a ticket for ex;; it all goes in ruins. Even if I have perfect conditions that day, someone could just call me on phone and that's it...

Being unable to open my mouth for 2 hours everyday is really inconvenient for me. I try to take a pill every 12 hours. If i took it before sleep and after, the gap between pills would be just 6-7 hours and then 17-18, which doesnt sound too balanced... So i have to take at least one pill when im in the middle of the day, usually clearing up all the plans for that hour if possible...

I cannot imagine myself taking hrt for the rest of my life sublingually. Unless I could change to uncoated pills (estrofem which im taking currently is coated, therefore takes longer to dissolve). Switching to injections is maybe a lifetime option but right now it might be not available for me.

Any advices how to lose as little as possible of active time of my day..?

Thank you very much &lt;33"
g4_,asktransgender,Can someone explain this logic for me? (insurance related),"I have nothing to do tonight, so I am scraping through everything I can find on my insurance company's website to see what they can do to help with my transition.

In a document on their site (effective in 2013), the only thing it looks like they will *maybe* cover is GRS. In that document, as one of the criteria for GRS, it states:

&gt; The individual has a documented DSM-5 diagnosis of gender dysphoria including all of
&gt; the following:
&gt; 
&gt; * The desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by the desire to make his or her body as congruent as possible with the preferred sex through hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery
&gt; * Transsexual identity has been present persistently for at least 2 years
&gt; * Disorder is not a symptom of another mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia)
&gt; * Disorder causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning

So they clearly know and acknowledge that gender dysphoria causes distress in social areas, occupational/work areas, etc.

What I don't understand is why, then, do they go to list this HUGE list of things they deem cosmetic (and therefore not covered):

&gt; The following surgeries are considered cosmetic when performed to assist in improving the gender specific appearance of an individual who is planning to undergo or has undergone gender reassignment surgery (this list may not be all inclusive):
&gt;
&gt; * **Blepharoplasty/Brow reduction/brow lift**
&gt; * Breast enlargement procedures, including augmentation mammoplasty, implants, and silicone injections of the breast
&gt; * Chin augmentation (reshaping or enhancing the size of the chin)
&gt; * Chin/nose/cheek implants
&gt; * Face lift/forehead lift
&gt; * **Facial reconstruction for femininization or masculinization (e.g., facial bone reduction)**
&gt; * Forehead augmentation
&gt; * Gluteal and hip augmentation (implants/lipofilling)
&gt; * **Hair reconstruction (hair removal/hair transplantation)**
&gt; * Jaw/mandibular reduction or augmentation
&gt; * Liposuction
&gt; * Lipofilling
&gt; * Lip reduction/enhancement
&gt; * Pectoral implants
&gt; * **Rhinoplasty**
&gt; * **Trachea shave (Adam’s apple shaving)/reduction thyroid chondroplasty**
&gt; * **Voice modification surgery (e.g., laryngoplasty, cricothyroid approximation [CTA], thyrohyoid approximation, laryngeal reduction surgery [surgical shortening of the vocal cords), laser assisted voice adjustment [LAVA])**

(emphasis mine for MTF-related surgeries as only those apply to me)

_______________________________________________

I just don't get it. In MTF's, dysphoria can and usually is exacerbated by outwardly visible masculine features! Why would they come up with this perfectly tailored list to exclude anything that would alleviate that problem?

They also mention real-life experience explicitly in there:

&gt; Individual has successfully lived and worked within the desired gender role full-time for at least 12 continuous months (real-life experience) without returning to the original gender

Going full-time for people can range from super easy to insanely problematic, depending on things that could be remedied *by almost all the surgeries they explicitly excluded in the list above* which, to them, are ""purely cosmetic.""

Literally no one out on the street will misgender someone based solely off of what is in someone's pants. It's not visible. What's downstairs may cause them distress, but so can an overly masculine face that gets them clocked and subsequently harassed, injured, or killed.

So what's with this logic here? Social distress caused by having dysphoria, but they won't attempt to fix a lot of the things that could be causing that dysphoria?"

And after I start, what I will have to expect? What levels of progesterone/estrogen is good for transitioning (MtF)? 
I had to be careful with something when I start (or something during the HRT)??

I'm very happy to have found this community and being part of it, thanks everyone for existence &lt;3

LaSweetmia,asktransgender,"Thank you Androcur and Estrogen. I feel finally like myself. Like the man I'm supposed to be! Wait, what?","So here I'm sitting. Happy, confident and in touch with myself. I haven't felt so alive for ages. All the sorrows are gone. I finally feel in touch with my identity. No more all-day-long compulsive thoughts about my gender. After years of fear, doubt and self-hatred things are looking much more bright. 

That's me after roughly 3 months of Androcur and Estrogen prescribed by my endo. The only thing is: I feel manlier than ever. Or in other words: I feel like myself more than ever. 

Things are just fine now. All desires to actually transition are far far away. I sit here and I'm happy as a man. I can see a future and I want my future to be like that. I don't want to transition. 

The dynamics here are so confusing. Assuming I'm a man, where is the alleged dysphoria I should experience on the ""false"" hormone cocktail? 

Also, cancelling the hormones would probably lead me back to the old patterns, at least that's what I fear. 

How come I have worried for years about my identity and my gender and once I get the right hormones I feel like I was wrong all the way. I kinda feel like a fraud and very stupid. What made me believe I was a woman? 

But that's really just minor concerns right now. I simply feel so relieved that the year long compulsive thinking has vanished and I can lead a life. 

Of course I will need to review the whole situation. Assuming I don't want to transition but need this mix of hormones I will need to get a mix that won't change my body too much, but keeps my happy at the same time. Also, even from a scientific viewpoint I must ask: How is this even possible? 

So yeah, anybody in the same situation? Similar experiences? What can I expect?  inb4: I'm not genderfluid or anything like that.

__its_only_me__,asktransgender,Hooooollly Crap. Titty Skittles are MINE!!!!,"Obligatory: http://imgur.com/WdJ1syG

WOW. Oh my god. Oh my Buddha, as my old english teacher said. I got my hormone prescription today. After a few months of not knowing where to go next, I told my mom I needed to get hormones, now. Got a recommendation for an informed consent clinic, and set up an appointment. And then I waited 31 days. And then I got to today.

I just went in, talked to the doctor for some twenty minutes, and then he sent the prescription for estrogen and spiro to the pharmacy near my house. He then sent my to have some blood work done and an x-ray of my wrist taken, to figure out how developed my bones were.

Depending on how the blood work and x-ray come out, I may also get a blocker implanted sometime next month.

I take my first dose tomorrow morning, in about ten hours. 100mg of Spiro, 2mg Estradiol. A question: if I'm supposed to take the spiro pills twice daily, I'm assuming that means once in the morning and once before bed? do I just have to deal with waking up to pee all night?

I have two things to say:

1. SQUUEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!

2. BOOBS ARE COMING!!!


EDIT: took my first dose a few hours ago. 25mg Spiro, .5mg E. Can already feel spiro making me pee... might be just a placebo, though. Idk how fast it actually takes effect."

P1addec,asktransgender,Will I be able to take hormones with my Factor V Leiden mutation?,"I've known all my life I have had this condition.

Thankfully I'm not born female, because it has all kinds of nasty effects with estrogen supplements, stuff like birth control and menopause, and since I'm biologically male luckily I'll never have to take any of that stuff, right? Yeah from what I've read HRT is pretty much impossible without so much unnecessary risk and being on blood-thinners my whole life which I wish to avoid.

If anyone knows conclusively about the effects of HRT and factor V that would be great, also the best ways to transition without hormones.

A lot of other close minded rambling with me laughing at her follows, and it ends with us getting out the car after she questions if I think I will ever have a normal relationship like this (Pfft, fuck normal), me saying I'm not straight and laughing at her comment, her angrily questioning if I'm gay to which I also reply laughingly no (because she doesn't know any other sexuality besides the binary) She then angrily questions ""Then what!?"", to which I reply asking if she has ever heard of bisexual (I'm not, but she doesn't know anything beyond gay and straight). She and my sister then blame it on the internet, to which I burst out into hysterical laughter as I enter the house. And, well, here I am. 

TL;DR Had shouting match with mother, which has left me in hysterics to her bigotry.

ggxl4f,asktransgender,Proper dosage of E (not self dosing question),"During my second appointment with a new doctor. We were reviewing blood work. Talked testosterone levels which were really low, like 13. I mentioned I am having problems with no sex drive, weight gain, etc. I asked if my testosterone level was too low and what my options were. They kind of shrugged it off saying that it's low but not a big deal. Gave a few other options like testosterone gels or lowering spiro, but not clear options.

So I asked about estrogen levels. The doctor said they don't test for that. Wait you only test testosterone ??  She mentioned something else they test for which detects tumors. That is all they do.

I asked how does she know if I am on the right dosage of patches. Her answer, you are on a medium dose.  I mentioned that I had heard slightly going up in patch doses can also help raise your testosterone. She confirmed it can, but didn't really go further. I also mentioned that insurance is only covering half of my patches at that level. The slightly higher ones they cover the full monthly dose. Her answer, insurance has to cover it in California. I explained that I was told they don't cover it. Asked her what to do and there was no real answer.

After 5 minutes of asking her to clarify how she knows I am on the right dose. I gave up because it's clear she didn't want to give me an answer.

Does any of this sound like a normal doctor ? Is it true they don't check E levels ? Is there no real answer to dosing ? How do I know it's correct ? Should I look for yet another doctor ?

This place is the place to go in San Francisco. Everyone has told me they are the best.

My love is getting an orchiectomy next month. We're both excited because she'll be able to stop taking her T blocker and the estrogen will be much more effective. 

She is also exceedingly depressed right now for completely unrelated reasons. We had a suicide scare last night. She wants to see a therapist, I want her to see a therapist, her friends want her to see a therapist... But she's worried if she goes to see one they'll deem her mentally unfit and cancel the surgery.

Any time I've set goals for myself depression and anxiety have brought me to the conclusion that those goals are unobtainable. Because of that I haven't really achieved anything in my adult life. I finished high school, but dropped out of college. Dropped out of a trade school. I have no idea what to do with my life, and I'm not really passionate about anything. 

The reason I'm posting this here is because of something I read either here, on somebodies blog somewhere, or something my therapist said (I honestly don't remember the source) and that is basically, what do I do after transition?

I can't live my life to transition. I have to go to living a normal life at some point. Being transgender isn't who I am, it's just one aspect of me.

Right now I work a pretty basic low end job, which I enjoy, and where I believe I'll be safe transitioning, but my only goal for the future right now are to lose weight so I can start HRT (which is hard because my depression won't let get motivated to even go for a walk or cook decent food.)

I'm 33 years old and I'm not getting any younger. I'm living with debt (I had a point in time where I had to live off my credit card or not eat, so I have tons of credit card debt) and without goals going back to school just seems like a waste of time and money.

I guess this sounds like a stupid question, but how do I find something I'm passionate about? Something I'd like to do for the rest of my life. "

I plan to start this process the next time I see my doctor because I'm just tired of the male name, it isn't androgynous at all and no real way for me to make it seem like it either.

First of all I didn't think transgender was something one could identify as.  I always thought having a gender identity across from the one you currently have is what makes someone trans.  Of course this by necessity makes being trans binary.

My genitals make me feel weird now but it's easy to cover them, out of sight/feel out of mind and usually my face/height/shoulders doesn't really bother me.

But the other day it was pretty bad, couldn't see any way forward, I'd look at myself and just see all the challenges I'd face in blending and what an idiot I looked like (internalised transphobia I guess). Btw does it count as suicide idiation if it's just a fleeting thought out of frustration/exasperation which you know you wouldn't go through with and didn't think how etc..?

It's all left me feeling like it was better before I knew since maybe then I'd find the solution and be happy and it wouldn't be... This. 

And today here I am and what I see on the mirror doesn't seem so bad, and I can recognise the good things in me. Even if I never 'passed' I would be an attractive person assuming you weren't into binary gender stuff like basically everyone.

thisndthatthrowaway0,asktransgender,So I came out at work today....,"It was amazing. I know you'll probably never see this, but thank you to everyone who works with me. 

I work in education so before the summer ended, I had wanted to come in and inform my supervisors about me in-person. Well I went in twice and never saw either of them so I figured I'd just come in early on the first day and talk to them. 

Then last night, my work supervisor emailed me before our fall training today. It was a notice that apparently there was an error on my name tag. I didn't know we had name tags since we've never had them at past trainings. 

Well I went ahead and mentioned my name change and everything. Then this morning, I went in and no problem. Nobody skipped a beat. Everyone talked to me and we caught up on our summer and how excited we were for the year. Also, I don't know if it was intentional, but we're usually put into ""teams"" of colleagues who teach the same grade for support and I was put in someone's team who knew me and I worked well with last year and I still work well with now. My supervisor even came and welcomed me personally this morning. 

I can't believe it. I'm so, so, so, so fortunate. To think, I was actually about to quit this job because I was super frightened about this. I'm ecstatic. I really hope that this becomes a trend for the future-- that others who come after me can experience the same. It's incredible to know that they don't really see me any differently and will still evaluate me based on how I educate and help students and not because I'm trans/intersex. 

I know that at least in the near future, this kind of reception is unrealistic for everyone. I just hope you all know that it's not a reflection on you. You are awesome and there are jobs and schools and people out there who value you as the amazing person you are."

I'm feeling much better now.  About me so far:

- Decided to start transitioning in January
- Started T blockers in April 2016
- Started laser hair removal in April 2016 (5 on face, 3 on rest of body so far).  My beard and body hair were intense before.
- Came out to parents, siblings and close friends starting in May 2016
- Started E about 2 weeks ago!
- (Edit: Oh yeah, and I'm 34)

I decided on a name (Nicole) a month ago, and came out to work, so I could present 100% at work.  I had been about 80% before -- girl tshirts, makeup, jewlery.  Now I feel comfortable wearing more girly clothes and a bra.

(My work has been great so far, with everyone switching names for me immediately.)

So, my main question is what I can do to improve passing.  I do go to therapy regularly and I'm quite at peace with my look most of the time, but I also can't figure out how to be totally honest with myself or see other things I could do to pass better.

Mainly I want to pass so that interactions with me don't have others sidetracked thinking about me being trans in their head.

They told me that they were just blindsided by how I just totally look like a girl, act like a girl, sound like one etc. They told me they hadn't thought I'd pass and have such a successful transformation. So basically while they'd always respect my gender identity, they basically had hoped I'd be visibly trans and still look like I used to to some extent. They said it was so quick and overnight that it caught them off guard and they weren't sexually attracted to me anymore. I know this probably built up over the last year but I believe them when they say they didn't expect to not be attracted to me. They're horrified about what's happening. I desperately love this person and I know they feel the same. I cried so hard in their arms last night I feel like my soul was trying to free itself and wrap up with theirs to just defy gender and orientation. But someone needs to shake me. I love being a woman. I'm not gender fluid or non binary. I love this new life. But I'm sitting here working out a way to be my partners ""secret boy"" in bed, and sometimes when we go out for the day. I know it'll never work. I know this is heartbreakingly and pathetically desperate but we don't know what to do. My partner isn't straight. I keep telling them they fell in love with a girl and my personality is the same. They say that may be true but that im definitely different. Fucking someone punch me in the face and tell me what I know i need to do. I'm just going to desperately miss this person. They're my best friend. But I could never be friends with them. All the love aside, just the thought of someone else penetrating them is just too much for me to comprehend and i dont even want to keep mine. Ive always felt an intense physical connection with my partners. Sometimes before an emotional one so the thought of the physical loss - someone else getting to have that connection with them - and what that means to the emotional connection in my 6 year relationship with my best friend is beyond devastating for me. I couldn't stick around while they find a copy of old me and me 2.0 gets them. I know thats selfish but this was so unexpected and im reeling. Why does it have to be like this? Why did I have to gain a life to lose the one i had? Wtf it's like a sick joke. It makes me wish my transition had flamed out."

Sigrid_Svartvatn,asktransgender,"Aggregating data for my 3mo HRT followup, anyone care to take a look? I'm going to request E increase.","My GP lets me request whatever labs I want as often as I want so I've been doing monthly level checks to help speed things up and make my demands of my HRT endo more easily met. I figured it couldn't hurt to get another (several) pair of eyes on things before I do a final print off and take it in with me on monday during the 7 hour drive to my endo.

I've been on 2mg sublingual estrace and 5mg finasteride daily for almost three months now (3mo this friday) and everything looks good to me so far. I'm going to request my estrace be doubled to 4mg/day (2mg twice daily). I'm hoping to get my E level up to around 250ng/dL.

[Here's my lab data](http://i.imgur.com/DKv7yUX.png)

Note you can see the uncharted total Estrogens (E1 E2 E3) in the excell section which shows why such data is of totally no clinical significance for those of us taking bioidentical estradiol (E2). Also note the perceived T reduction before starting HRT is likely just a sampling error due to insufficient sample frequency for the graphing program to reflect accurately.

Anonymoose247,asktransgender,MY PARENTS KNOW!!!!!!,"THEY KNOW, AND THEIR SUPPORTIVE, AND WE'LL LOOK INTO A GP, AND OH MY GOD I'M SO HAPPY!!!!!!!"
blynng,asktransgender,"Endo wants me to come out to my parents, but I don't.","In two weeks I have an appointment with my endocrinologist where I should be able to start estrogen. However he wants me to come out to my parents before then. I have no doubt that they will be supportive of my transition, which is what I told my endo, but I'm not comfortable doing it at the moment. I don't feel comfortable telling them anything because I honestly don't feel that I have anything to say right now. Maybe if I was a trans woman I would feel that they should know my real gender but gender, in the sense of being a man or woman, doesn't matter to me. Eventually I will talk to my parents about this, just not yet. I don't feel the time is right.

I'm a practical and private person. Opening up about my feelings is difficult so I only do so when there's a good reason to. As a teen I knew I was bisexual but I never came out because... why should I? I never saw the benefit of telling someone, ""Just so you know, I like guys and girls."" I imagine part of this is from having good friends and family. Within my circle of family, friends, and acquaintances there are various LGB and T people. Being LGBT has never been a big deal. This makes me feel that being bi or trans isn't something I need to broadcast and make a big deal out of. I would much rather tell someone once it becomes relevant to them. Right now I don't care about being called by a particular name, having certain pronouns used, or being treated any differently than I currently am. Explaining to my parents that I'm a non-binary trans person has no practical benefit to myself or them. I feel that I have don't actually have anything to say.

Anyways, the problem I'm faced with is this:

- Do I explain my gender situation to my parents anyways?
- Do I stand my ground and be honest about not discussing this with my parents?
- Do I lie to my endo about coming out?"

cloppyhooves,asktransgender,I have a few questions about getting an orchi RE: sensation and options! [NSFW],"Hiya! I've been considering getting an orchi recently, but have a few hesitations, and I figured I'd ask here! For info, I'm mostly looking to make sure that I'm sterile; not having to take as much spiro also sounds like a plus!

**1) How is sensation in the scrotal skin?**

I definitely enjoy having that area played with during sex, and wouldn't want to lose that sensitivity.  I imagine there's risk depending on how the procedure is performed, but I'm also curious if not having the balls there would, say, cause it to shrink in a way that causes a difference in sensation.

**2) Is getting there a big difference in ability to get an erection?**

I have some difficulty with this, so if it gets even more difficult it might be a problem.  Though, if it does come to that, could it be possible to just take meds for Erectile Dysfunction?

**3) How long is recovery to the point that masturbation and sex are allowed?**

Just wondering what the downtime would be!

And my biggest question that may be a little weird:

**4) Is it possible to put similar-sized prosthetics so that the outward appearance is the same after the procedure?**

I actually kinda like how the whole ensemble looks right now, and wouldn't mind keeping that aesthetic. c:  Admittedly I don't really see this option talked about, so I'm not sure if this is even possible. I figured that I'd ask!

Thank you! :)"
Fxt2fxt,asktransgender,[serious] Looking for serious advice,"My FTM brother has just recently cut his hair and started dressing to his preference. But as he has made these changes, going out has become very dangerous.

Some backstory: My brother (18) has a girlfriend (17). Whenever they are out and about, men will stare at them both, giving them dirty looks or becoming aggressive towards my brother. My theory is that these men are attracted to his girlfriend, see her with my brother, get jealous and therefore lash out on him! 

The last couple times this has happened it results in men following them both to the point that strangers notice and try to help my brother and his girlfriend. Every time he comes home it seems he has another one of these stories and it infuriates me. I'm worried one of these encounters will leave my brother seriously injured. Confronting these men does nothing but aggravates them, running away seems to excite them.. I just don't know what he can do. 

Any advice will be super helpful and appreciated. "

GabiCap,asktransgender,Gender Euphoria = Trans?,"I don't have gender dysphoria and would consider myself trans because you look at me and think ""Dude"" and since I don't have dysphoria (and up until 10 minutes ago I thought I was masculine), I thought cis.

But I crossdress. It used to be once in a blue moon but in the last week I've been in girl mode every time I'm alone. And since I got a wig, I no longer see myself as a ""dude in women's clothing"" when I get into girl mode.

And while I don't experience gender dysphoria, thinking of myself as a girl is euphoric and sometimes wish I was a girl. Not sure how to describe it, but if I could wake up as a girl, no questions asked, I would. But since that's not possible, being a guy is neutral.

I always thought that dysphoria defined trans (where you feel like you're in the wrong body) but now I'm learning euphoria counts as well.

So could I be trans?

Either I'm afraid, not really transgender and I know it deep down and the past two years of surety has been a lie, or both. And everyday I get a little bit older, a little bit farther into puberty (I'm 19), and hate myself even more. 

I'm out to all my friends, even my family. Sometimes it's been rocky but now I have full support. But even though everyone around me is okay with it, rooting for me in fact, I'm stuck in the same place, unable to move anywhere.

I watch all these shows (i.e. Transparent, YouTube Channels, I Am Cait) in the hopes it will inspire me to actually act on my feelings but I can't seem to force myself to budge. Meanwhile I'm still coming out to people left and right because it's the only validation I can get. Yet they all expect me to transition now (because they know that I want too) and now my friends are wondering why it's been months and all I'm doing is sitting on my rear doing nothing. 

I feel like I'm a fraud. I'm unable to do anything about how I feel not because I can't, but merely because I'm scared and a part of me doesn't want to take the risk. Yet I drown my dysphoria and my depression in ungodly amounts of alcohol every night just to keep on going. I'm perpetuating my own hell due to my own internalized transphobia and fear and I don't know how to break the loop. "
calisthymia,asktransgender,"Could Andersen's ""Ugly Duckling"" be seen as an (incidental) allegory of a trans experience?","Something that I thought during the morning commute: there is an almost complete lack of treatment of trans issues in children's literature except for a few very recent additions to the genre. However, some classical fairy tales contain elements of transformation and thus might be open to a modern reinterpretation.

Of such tales, it occurred to me that H.C. Andersen's ""The Ugly Duckling"" seems to contain elements most trans persons could find inherently relatable: a sense of not belonging, bullying, ostracizing, seemingly impossible aspirations and final self-realization. While this most certainly wasn't the original intent (Andersen himself told that the tale was autobiographical) I find this alternative interpretation compelling enough to be moved by it.

So, what do you think? Does the tale of the Ugly Duckling resonate emotionally with your own life? Do you think that the tale could be a good instrument for discussing transness with children when that's required?"

SaysHeyThatsNeat,asktransgender,How can I help my questioning teen?,"First a little general information:   About six months ago, my 13 year old (afab) came out as gender fluid. Since then, he is almost always presenting himself as male and prefers masculine pronouns. 

We're in therapy, mostly to help with anxiety, but also to help with gender disphoria. We took him to buy gender appropriate clothes and binders. He got his hair cut and got new glasses. He is using his middle name now at school (it's gender neutral) and we made sure he can use the boy's bathroom at school. School has been amazingly helpful and supportive!

Needless to say, I love my child and think they're perfect just the way they are. I have a few questions that I'm struggling with and don't really know how to put it all together, but I'm going to try.

Since my child has been presenting as male almost exclusively for 6 months, is it possible that they're actually trans? I've asked him, and he says no, but his body gives him all kinds of anxiety. He's in the middle of puberty and has a really hard time with periods. That week is always particularly upsetting. 

I've found an endocrinologist and have discussed puberty-delaying hormones with him and his therapist. He's very non-commital and won't say yes or no that he wants hormone therapy. 

I think he's still trying to figure out who he is.  I don't want to force anything on him. It's really hard watching him have such a hard time living in his body. Puberty is hard enough as it is. 

So how can I help him get through this questioning time?  Should I push the hormone treatment?"

(And I won't share it here, sorry)

I want to share my experience and hope I can find the help I'm seeking for....

Please be prepared for a loooooong post.

I've been exposed to sexual encounters (movies, seeing others, stories, comics) in a VERY early age, starting with the rape of my mother and also a product of... since then I've seen some amazing and fucked up things happen.  I grew up very introverted and with no social interaction with girls.  And when there was any, it was ridiculed by family and friends to embarrass me (us), or kids picking on me for ever thinking I can have them (girls) for myself.  I grew up pretty angry but bottled it in and, not digressing, physically became a big, strong, angry looking person.  Think The Rock and Tony Soprano put together (lol)... but it is true.  But you can tell by my body language and lack of confidence, I was a big ogre.  Don't take of myself, not dressing well, and quite honestly, not caring.  I did do a lot of day dreaming, a lot of scenes and situations played in my mind and I was the director, actor, and the villain.  Please don't feel sorry for me, I don't (anymore).

Highschool was a change (a little); girl still stayed away from me because either for peer pressure or not being attractive (no confidence, quiet-type, weird, etc.  and I must add, looking back at my young pictures - I cannot believe I thought I was ugly I really wasn't!).  I've had some girls who liked me, but I ended up not liking them.  I've some close friends who looked up to me and I thought they were crazy to think so.  I was indeed the big brother type.  I always stepped in when a bully was picking on someone and ended up being bullied and/or picked on.  Sometimes even beat on.  Picture this... playing arcade at a store, when a scrawny little 12 year old kid from the projects (yes he was black, but that didn't matter much) picking on us for money and he didn't pick on anyone else but me, and he usually succeeded taking my money and beating me up. I knew I can swing my arm JUST once and he'd be dead, but I never took that chance because of the fear of unknown.  Plus, I don't think I've experienced violence other than watching my biological father.... and I never wanted to be him. Ever.

So high school, yes, I've always been an A+ student, my parents didn't have it any other way on top of putting the pressure on me becoming a doctor or engineer and becoming the ""man of the house"" ordeal.  I started picking up sports, just because I was curious and interested in playing.  I was also very natural at it.  Again, because of lack of confidence I always fell in the shadows of others and never really excelled at them.  But I did become very athletic and big.  Must like Haphaestion under Alexander.  As a result, I started drinking...  My father was an alcoholic, he raped women, stole money, and beat my mother.  He was arrested after one day he put my mother into a coma and taken to the hospital (if I remember correctly) while he got sent away.  Met my step-father soon after who was an amazing person (didn't drink, gave up smoking because of me, loved me like his own, etc)... but for some reason to give tribute to the asshole I drank and wallowed in misery to him as his seed.  Because of my stature, I invited the wrong crowd.  I hung out with gangs (never joined, some kind of code of honor in me) did their dirty work, vandalized, ...

By the day, I was that unnoticed kid who got As in school.  And never really met girls.  But... here is where it gets a little interesting, internet changed it ALL.  AOL and its chat room phenomena of being anonymity interested me.  I can be ANYONE, and anyone I was.  At first, I was that cool kid every girls wanted.  I flirted with them, sex-talked (sexted?), even had cute ""relationship"" stats all them teenagers liked.  I slowly started getting tired of young girls, and went after older women and ...I LOVED it!  I learned so much by talking to them, almost as if I matured in my mindset.  Some girls and women I admired and adored got me thinking of how many others do they talk to and I started imitating them to see how much attention they get.  And boy was I in for a shock.  By a ten-fold!  So I played that... and I was hooked, it my own show.

As time went on, I started getting curious in how it is being that out of the norm person and I started testing those waters (I'll stop here...).  In real life, I played that good student by the day, angry kid by the night.  I graduated high school one of the top students with ease (Hephaestion again) but never really noticed.  I was given many stipends and scholarships to different universities but due to some family problems, I never left home.  I opted to stay at a local college and continued to stay miserable.  As time went, my drinking caught up to my education.  I slowly flunked and blamed it on my family.

Remember that ""code"" I had mentioned before?  Well that stayed with me and I stuck to a sport and stayed loyal and disciplined to it.  Which was working out.  I was athletically strong even though I never showed it in my muscle tones rather than my mass.  In time, dedicated to working alone... I slowly saw the spiritual side and realized I need to change myself.  Yes I found that love for myself.  Yes I was very suicidal and angry but I never WANTED to kill myself.  I had thoughts... but never had any intentions.  Failing out of school soon seemed like a blessing because one of the unknown happened and I didn't fear it anymore, because it happened and I don't have to worry about it with displeasing my parents.  It gave me some perspective and I used it to focus on bettering myself from the inside.  However, that online addiction didn't change.  I didn't mention porn, but that has been my daily ritual since I was 8 years old and it grew as my curiosity grew with no limit since the internet had it ALL.  I'm naturally tech and mechanical savvy and I figure things out very quickly, so the logic of finding something was never a deterrence.

I matured with my urgency of ""finding someone"" and needing to get laid (and I wanted to fuck every sec... still do) was getting under control... I became pretty laid back guy.  I noticed once I was out of the school life and joined the work environment -I actually made friends quite easily and with nice adults.  After some work, I decided to go back to school.  With vigilance I did well...

My addiction slowed down, I focused more on life and myself, and things were getting better.  And in due time, I even noticed someone and had a true genuine feeling to meeting her.  I had the courage of doing so and it felt amazing (even without any feedback yet).  ...And after meeting her and getting a positive response it felt really, really good.  I actually found love and shared it with someone I really admired and cared for.  I slowly got to know her better and as time went by I opened up to her.  It was a scary moment for me but it was undeniably life-changing when she accepted me for all the events happening to me and still loving me for who I am.  It was also soon after I had sex with her and I couldn't believe how amazingly we were in sync with our tastes...  (I pushed her a little and then she pushed me a little and we were both surprised with our likings..)  

I really loved her, but this is also where the downfall began.  I noticed something wrong with her, she still had feelings for her ex and she couldn't stop ""that"" for him since he was her childhood friend and been with him for a long time.  At first I was okay with it and told her that I understand... but I also wanted her to myself only.  And that's where my possessiveness and comparison started with him.  If not competition.  I didn't like the fact that he now tries to find time for her and give her attention.  His presence made me go crazy and I started to question everything.  Specifically when she also mentioned another friend who professed his love for her one day when he was drunk.  I have to mention, she's actually a gorgeous girl.  Not only did I love that about her physique... I loved HER for who she was.  So everything became a threat to me now.  One day, in the heat of our sex, she paused and gave me an amazing blowjob after I made her crazy-cumming machine where she focused on my balls and gave me that look that she wanted to suck all my fluids right out of my sack.  ...And she did, once I started cumming, she throated me down and swallowed every drop out of me.  Wow...  At pillow talk, I started picking her mind on where she had learned all the skills she has... not going into too much details - I started imagining scenarios and suspecting the worse.  She was friends with all of her exes and they were all her close friends.  It still didn't matter as long as the trust and loyalty was there.  She was with me and I was with her...

Not too long later, one night we went out to a bar where she used to go with her friends.  Now coming from a time where I can easily drink a liter of liquor and/or 24 pack of beers (anything), I wanted to show off my social ""skill"" to her guy friends.  But biology was a quick reminder that tolerance is a bitch.  I got drunk too quick.  She had to maintain me while I was all over the place.  I had mentioned to her about my ""state"" before about my history of drinking and how I never wanted to be my father.  She managed to keep me composed.  One of the band member passed by (older guy) who chatted up with us and then mentioned who he watched my girlfriend come into the bar for awhile and how much she has grown, pointing to her tits. He was a perv and wanted to know if they were real.  I jokingly made a remark that if she's okay with it, he can check it out.  So she didn't stop him and he went ahead in groping her.  Within one squeeze I interrupted and grabbed and hugged her letting him know that only I'm allowed to do that.  He didn't make too much of a fuss and laugh it out and left.  I didn't make too much about it but I did apologized the next day when I was clear minded.  She said it wasn't a big deal... but did say that I'm different when I'm drinking...  I actually am, I turn out to be the life of the party...

Things went well and we were getting closer and more intense in our relationship.  I was opening up and kept telling her more and more about the shit I was growing through with my family and how much she made it a difference.  It was finally a great feeling to know something good was in my life I can hold on to and love. Soon the holidays were coming and one night we all gathered together for the holidays/birthdays.  As I came home to her house with all the refreshments and food, I noticed she was with her ex in her room, they were most likely talking but I wasn't too sure only that when they realized I was there, he stepped out and left.  ""What was that about?"" not thinking of it in any bad way other than something just happened (talk-wise).  She mentioned that he had got her a nice gift for her birthday even though he never did when they were together...  I thought about it for a moment but I pushed aside knowing we were having a party and I didn't want to make a scene.  Later in the week, I ended up using her computer to do some work for my school and as tech-savvy as I am, I noticed things in her recents documents.  They were pictures of them together from the past...  I wasn't snooping nor prying into her folders, it was literally in her recent documents folder as I was screening through my papers.  I didn't say a word... but it hurt me.

Last gathering... I over heard another friend making fun of the ex and calling him gay.  To my curiosity, I wanted to pick his mind about that.  It was just innocent description of his looks, how he acts, etc... oppose to me on big I am and more confident in my posture (little did he know...).  But it is true, since my change in outlook of life and finding her, my behavior improved and changed.  I laughed it out with him as the night progressed.  Sometime in the night, I watched her socialized with the friends.  I started watching how she looked at others... my mind was playing a game and I was falling... I was falling more in love with her and also failing into fear of losing her.  I started drinking...

At a point of the night, I started slurring and saying some really mean things to her around all of our friends.  It was pretty bad.  She knew something was wrong and also knew how I got when I'm at that ""state"" so she pulled me into the bathroom and started talking to me.  She knew something was wrong and she tried helping me... I don't remember the extent of what I had said... but I do remember saying something about me being gay also or can be gay... something in effect to her ex being gay.  It was crazy.  Just the thought of her ex and those pictures I saw before, all of her guy friends still ""lurking"" around her got me angry.  I held her face and started crying.  I was losing control and in no time I ended up pushing her against the wall.  She screamed my name and then mentioned the safe word we used and instantly, like a hypnotized person I stopped, laid down in the corner and blacked out.

The next morning I woke up with the worst feeling of fear and of the unknown.  What did I tell her?  How did she react on me stating I might have the gayness in me?  What happened?!  ...all rushed in my mind.  One thing I don't get is hang overs (until recently, but even then very minute).  But I did feel my body sluggish and non-reactive to the amount of energy I'm trying to give my body to find her.  I found myself in her pjs in her bed while she laid there beside me facing away from me.  I called for her and ask what happened last night.  She swiftly got up as if she was waiting for me to wake up, and took me to the bathroom.  She showed me that I had broken the sink cabinet, I kept falling everywhere and... I had made a dent in the wall (about 2-3 inch radius) with her head.

Everything including the lights and my heart dropped to the ground.  I had become my father...  I didn't know what to say and I couldn't believe what happened.  I wanted to leave her place and never ever come back to hurt her again.   But I didn't, I became a slave to my fear.  I didn't want to lose her and I started beg for her forgiveness.  She didn't want to talk to me at the time and I left turning into the boy who had nothing to live for.  A day passed, I couldn't stop crying nor did I do anything else, including eating.  I met up with her the next night and she saw how messed up I was.  We talked and she told me that things like this can never happen nor does she tolerate this.  She had managed many men like this but never to the point where she got hurt.  (She played for a band, dealt mental disabled adults, taking care of friends, etc. --imagine where my ideas came from?)  She even mentioned what would happen if we ever had kids and I was like this.  She can never forgive herself if this happened.  I assured her that wasn't the case, and I will give up any kind influence (I only drank at the time) if she would give me another chance.  She did... but it took her a week before opened up to me again, but she professed that she will never forget.  I thanked her, but also started pampering her with flowers, chocolates, etc.  She never like flowers but I used to bring her a rose before just to fuck with her and yet she used to save them...

After about a week, she felt distant again.  I knew something was wrong.  Then I caught her saying lies and giving excuses of why we couldn't get together.  (It came to a point where we knew each others' schedules and everything...)  That night, when I knew the time she goes to bed (I knew this from the time I spend there more than my own with my parents and the times I surprised her with middle of the night heated sex) for work, I came by with my dog just to give an excuse to meeting her.  I noticed she was coming home with one of her girlfriends.  Her faced turned white as ghost.  Her friend said her goodbyes to us and we talked a little to an extent that it was a nice surprise seeing me.  Then I left, still with a worrisome thought of something being wrong.  

As days passed, I started noticing that she was as close to me, nor was she sleeping facing me.  My chest started hurting overtime I was with her and didn't know what was going on.  I mentioned a couple of times if something was wrong, yet she started playing coy.  (...""Coy"", she used to use to that calling me when I played hard to get.)  I started breathing heavy at nights just to get her attention so she would turn and place her hand on my hurt as she once used to when I had nightmares or anxiety.  ...She didn't.  One day she took me to her favorite park near her home and told me that she loved coming here.  I have to mention that I came from a home where we didn't have the privilege of ""enjoying a park"".  I loved her neighborhood, and everything that gave the stereotype of the suburbs.  And to find a down to earth girl who was smart, understood my every thoughts, how much I loved her manners to talking and acting... and not be that ""valley type"" girl along with drop dead gorgeous...  I didn't want to lose her.  She opened up to me again and got really close to me.  She gave a long beautiful kiss and all that pain and remorse that I once had, melted away.  She looked deep into my eyes and told me she loved me.  I wanted to drop down on my knees and wished I had asked her to marry me.  I didn't...

Christmas was near and we were inseparable, everything she did started becoming a video record in my memory (even to this day)... I just loved the way she looked.  I sent her long love letter via emails which I couldn't express in word to her when I was with her.  And we had incredible sex because of that.  It got to the point where she wanted me to become that aggressive man I was before the incident... I did but I yielded with caution...

Day after Christmas, I brought our favorite breakfast to bed and left for work.  Mind you I was very good with her parents and they loved me (or so it seemed...).  I saw her father in the living room sipping on to his coffee.  We talked briefly and then I left for work.

...within minutes, I received an email from her that she needs some space and we cannot see each other anymore.  I didn't understand.  I literally stopped my car in the middle of the highway, made an illegal turn though the divider, and showed up at her door.  She said that she had a gut feeling that we shouldn't together, with all the problems I have with my family, my situation with school, my work.... (just excuses) that its best that we just go in our own ways...  She also mentioned the incident in the bathroom and also what happened back at the bar where I was just too loud and crazy.  She said, she DIDN'T FEEL SAFE WITH ME.  All the feelings and pain that I once had the day I woke up to the day I watched my father rape my mother rushed back in all at once.

I didn't know how to react other than I knew I should've left that morning when I witness my destruction.  I didn't argue with her, I kissed her deeply, and left.  I felt like I just got fired from my dream job and I was just in shock.

There were nights before when everything was great as she laid in my arms, I watched her and wished my life was different and I could've been ""THAT"" guy where she admired me with starry eyes. I once watched the movie ""The Family Man"" with Nicolas Cage and thought of myself that I'd wake up and see her in another life with kids, and just different than where I didn't have all the shit I do with my family.  I also knew that my life and hers where so different.  I was just that poor boy from a poor neighborhood while she was from a well educated self-worth suburban home (not rich, but her parents worked very hard to be where they are).  Not to mention, she's an all american while I'm just an immigrant...

After I left, everything felt numb and everything seemed to move really fast while I stood in that one scene with her.  I stopped getting texts from her as I kept looking at the phone once every 20-25 mins, for the next 7 days.  I didn't even sleep anymore but stare at the ceiling, racing with thoughts of where did I fuck up.  I thought about every situation and how it should've been done differently.  How I should've dealt with the ex problem.  How I should've not been such possessive person emailing with my love notes.  Everything raced through my mind.  I even thought about maybe that I had mentioned that I might be gay didn't settle with her and she couldn't be with me knowing that.  I know I have seen and heard many relationships fall apart once the man is known to be gay.  ...But I have no feelings of BEING gay...  So what else?  I had begged for her mercy that I wouldn't drink nor be my father.  Was she back with her ex?  Did she realize she actually liked that one friend who follows her around and now finally fell in love with him? So I couldn't come up with anything or was it everything...

After a week or so, on New Year's Eve... she texts me that since she hasn't heard from me, she assuming that I won't be going to New Year's party.  I really didn't know how to respond other than how happy I was to hear from her... but broken to understand that she's playing like ""nothing really happened"" card.  I texted her back that I didn't know how to answer her when she told me that she wanted some space...  She didn't answer back.

That night I called her...  She was out at a party with her friends.  She sounded happy and gave me a 
""Hey! what's up?"" reply.  I don't remember what I told her but all I remember her saying ""I'm here standing outside talking to you and its getting cold.""  
...My mind was racing with all the scenarios and one thing I needed to know was ""Are you seeing someone?""  
She paused for a bit and then said, ""Yes, I have been seeing someone."" 
My direct response was, ""Have been?  Its been only fucking 7 days since we broke up!"" 
""What do you want me to say?  We were only dating.""
I don't know how it works in the ""dating world"" but the intensity I had with her, I couldn't just go out and start seeing someone within a week.  Then it dawned to me that she either went back with her ex, that other dude, or she has been talking to other guys while with me.  I started thinking of the nights (after the incident) of us fucking and if she was thinking of them while fucking me...

All I said to her that night was, ""well it seems to me from how you're talking to me is that you didn't really give a shit and I was just your rebound.""
She hung up on me and that was the shittiest new years countdown I even had.
Few weeks later she would send me texts with loaded zingers and I didn't know how to react to that, so I left it as is. About a month later, she called me asking if I wanted my things back. By that time I was so broken that I didn't care, I just wanted to see her.  I cleaned myself up and went to see her.  She looked great, and happy.  She changed her hair color, cut her hair, almost as if nothing really happened between us and we are just friends...  I knew it was over and I couldn't do anything about it.  That girl I fell in love with is gone and that which remained in front of me was just another beautiful girl.  We sat a restaurant as she spoke to me about her graduation, anticipating her new job, etc...  I didn't really listen to her, I just kept starring at her and trying to save every last image of her before I never get to see her again.  How did I know this?  I just knew it.  I wasn't like her friends and I was an easy cut off.  After she had left.  I went to the nearby park, laid flat on the grass, watching the sky, I wished I died there...

My friends have tried helping me, giving me all the speeches you hear about break-ups, the maybes, the destiny... it didn't matter.  In time, she slowly started cutting off everything and everyone that had to do with me.  I didn't stalk her, respected her, but couldn't really stop knowing what she was doing, nor had the motive to do anything.  A couple of months later, I got drunk at a bar in a neighborhood I shouldn't have been and eventually got arrested.  Not only did I drop out from school, I lost my job, lost all my money, lost my car, parents heart-broken... all I can hold on to is I lost her...

Months after that it was just time for me move on, even though I couldn't... I was humbled in everything I did.  I started focusing working out again but I took up yoga as a change, maybe a different calling to heal myself spiritually.  It helped A LOT.  I started helping others that needed help to ease my pain, my friends helped by getting me a job, I was getting better with my family, but I couldn't stop thinking of her.  What was she doing?  How is she? Where is she?  I didn't care if she was with someone, but I just wanted to know.  I never fathomed of losing connection with a person like her and as I to her, but she just didn't care for me.

Soon enough I had a tragedy in my family by someone passing away making me the bread earner.  Yea, my step-father passed away.  I had no one left I can talk to nor knew me well enough for me to share my feelings, except her...  I called her but she just repulsed me as I was no one.  Her words, ""Go find someone that actually cares...""

I just couldn't believe how far things changed and why???  It was then I realized how much of a loser I really am and why I never really had anyone give me respect.

I cried my heart out on my dad's dead corpse and hope he finally understood how I really felt.  That was the last time I cried like that.  I didn't shed a tear at his funeral.

Now said aaaallll this...

I had no intention to find anyone ever again.  A part of me died with her, I guess that night when I got drunk and hurt her.  Till this day I do not know the whole content of conversations and actions of what really happened that night.

Taking yoga classes, I couldn't stop looking at the women in their hot outfits and sometimes in poses that made me want to just breed them.  Haha...  I started exploring the ideas of if I was them what would I do to me and other men.  The idea started entertaining itself when I started noticing how much of all the underwear they left after they showered at the studios.  Mind you since fucking her I haven't even masturbated, so my thoughts kept twisting between her and the girls at the studio.  It came to a point where I imagined her there as them and I fucking her (hypothetically speaking).  It wasn't anymore that they didn't like me but I don't want them anymore.

But at the core level, I was hurting and wished to have the heart cared for even if it means not healing.  These thoughts started to really bother me.  Any man, or alpha man, or wannabes would be already fucking women, just to release their manly aggression.  So why not me?  What's wrong with me?  I've read many self-help books, watched hitch gurus telling how to behave around women, etc. and realized that I'm showing all the signs of weakness.  Not to mention by now in my adulthood I shouldn't have problem finding a girl.

So the thought of being gay started playing in my mind.  I started going online and as the pro I am, I pretended to be a girl as I once did and see how far it gets and be aware if I really liked it.  The thought and I idea has been enticing and so I continued...

Long story short, I am here today addicted to porn as always BUT specifically sissy induced shemale hypnosis porn.  I can tell you this that as much as I love the idea of being a sissy, and enjoy the feelings and cravings I get when I'm in that train of thought... It really ends there.  Being with men, doesn't do anything for me.  And the only way, ONLY way remotely would be in the men were bigger, stronger, and manlier I am making feel like a girl/feminine/sissy/shemale -I don't get turned on. But check this out, I make all the gay men want me even though I have no intentions of having them.  I asked some of them why they are attracted to me and their responses are usually that I'm such big man but well mannered and soft heart.  This mind boggles me since I want this exact feelings coming from women!

Coming down to the problem... I have been practicing and training to be a sissy... and its not working other than the fact I have now learned I have more limits with my body (and mind) and after every masturbation period of me cumming, there isn't a doubt I'm thinking of her AND I don't even enjoy this other than punishing myself.

Don't get me wrong, I have seen and encountered some of the hottest sex scenes, m/f, f/f, m/m, t/m... and I can masturbate and cum to it.... but that's just it.

I want a woman in my life and I want to be able to share those feeling with her that I once did with my ex, have a family, and share that dynamics.  I really do.  Its been over 8 years now. But I'm hung up in the idea of being a wuss/loser, not finding someone, and not completely expressing myself as a man.

I don't want to be stuck in this limbo anymore and really move on.  I know I can't stop thinking of her.  Many years have passed... and I really need to let her go.

I hope you're still with me, I thank you for that, can understand my feelings and hopefully can direct me towards something/someone.

Thanks."
knatway,asktransgender,Does it get easier?,"I don't know what I can do at this point. I'm 22 and I just had to move back in with my parents last month. I've been making plans to transition for awhile now but I just haven't been able to financially. I've been trying to find a job for over a year now, but to no success. 

I received my bachelor's degree last year, and yet I can't seem to find work. I had an apartment to myself for a year, but from the lack of work I had to move back home in the middle of nowhere. My parents are rather against most things lgbt. I just had conversation with my dad where he went on a long rant about how he was baffled anyone would want to transition, saying ""it would make them undesirable by anyone."" 

My mother is strongly religious. She always says love the person, not the sin in regards to homosexuality but it's obvious by how she acts she dislikes associating with anyone, including family who are gay.

I'm not brave. I'm a coward at heart. If I were to tell them, or attempt treatment now I'll only be kicked out. I need the support right now. I've been in a depression, too proud to get a part time job, too desperate to get  a tech job. However, I don't have a car, nor a license. I'm stuck where I live. Which has been my main determent to getting a job or the lack of experience. I don't know I might just be undesirable as an employee. I've been depressed for awhile now and I will admit I haven't been able to hide it in all of my interviews.

I'm sorry. This is mostly a drunken rant. I don't know what I should do concerning transitioning. I love my family and I don't want to lose that. I'm scared to do it even when I'm out on my own. I keep saying that I'll know by the time I'm on my own again, but I know that's a lie.

JustACoffeeLover,asktransgender,Should I start hormones in high school?,"So, my parents don't want me starting estrogen until late into senior year (which I'm in), or after. They don't want me to get bullied because of it, whether I come out or not. I certainly understand this, and bullying could be pretty bad. 

However, I feel like the changes wouldnt be too hard to hide. Even if i don't come out, just starting hrt would be so helpful. I feel like crap most days and I'm filled with sadness that I'm not making any progress. It's really impacting my focus too, it's hard to get my mind away from my dysphoria in class. I feel like it's going to negatively impact my grades far more than bullying would. And that's even if I  get bullied. Do you all think I could hide the changes? Or should I just try and wait?"

Bzttid,asktransgender,"Welp, I'm out to my conservative Christian parents.","This is just basically a summary of how both my parents responded and how this all went down. I originally didn't plan on coming out to them for another 8 months or so. I'm not even presenting as F/asking for pronouns/wanting another name from them. Sorry if it's a bit jumbled, it's very stream-of-consciousness.

Anyway, it went.. less than ideal.

It all started out with me and my wife (who's a lesbian but also not out to them) going to pizza for dinner around 7pm with them. My dad brought up gay and transgender issues and didn't understand why they (we, but he didn't know yet) need protections. Said things like ""this is a relatively new thing"" etc. The usual. My wife and I argue intensely and passionately. My mom is also classically Christian against gay and transgender people, so she sorta hopped on the ""agree with everything my dad says"" hype train.

Anyway, this escalates and escalates till it's 11 pm and my dad is just like ""I have to sleep"" but my mom stays. She says ""I guess we'll just never agree on this."", and I suddenly just lose it. I feel like I'm gonna puke. I'm crushed by that. And I just start weeping, hard. At this moment I just felt crushed. My mom stands there and is like ""What's wrong, bzttid?"" and I can't speak through the tears. My wife holds me and pats my back with a knowing comfort of ""I know what you're about to do, and I'm here"". My mom says ""Bzttid, you've been talking about this issue so much lately. Why does it mean so much to you?"". I finally get a gasp that I can turn into words. I choke down the nausea and spat out ""I'm transgender."". At that point I could tell that she was literally in shock. She asked me a bunch of questions that were non-accusatory. She was actually pretty nice about it. I told her to swear to not tell my dad. She agreed, and said ""look, if you're planning on doing anything please just wait six months. Your dad is actually pretty sick, and his disease can turn into lymphoma. I'm scared that if he finds this out it'll be too much for him."" She then proceeds to make a suicide ""joke"" relating to herself. Welp, now I have the lives of both of my parents on my shoulders.

I went to bed exhausted. I woke up the next morning to a text from my mom saying she was shaking and crying and couldn't avoid telling my dad. Of course, uhg. I can't stop thinking about my dad dying and it being my fault. I text my dad with some heartfelt words and he replies to me with a John Hopkins study. Fuck. I'm not here to argue again so I explain that yeah I know there's studies, but this is my life. I've lived this pain, and much more about my story. He says he'll ""always love [me] as his son"" and that he ""doesn't hate me"" but ""hates all things that turn people away from God"" and that ""it's very sad for everyone"". Topped that whole thing off with a good ol' ""you have to do what you think is best for yourself. Isn't that what everyone says? But I couldn't deal with you being a woman... So yeah it would distance our relationship."". I'm filled with rage. I'm thinking ""*you* couldnt deal with me being a woman? **Well I can't deal with being a man to the point of that I'd rather be dead**"". I'm angry and laughing because it's so fucking ironic how a religion spearheaded by a ""prophet of love and acceptance"" could be so judgemental and hateful.

I don't reply. My mom then sends me an email of some transition regret story and i start to lose grips on it. I start saying things like ""I'm smart and capable. I get to *accept you* as much as you do to me. I'll be fine without you."" Along with other stuff. She comes over to my house. She says things like ""ive just been living too much for my own children"", ""this is the final straw"", and other hurtful statements all while conveying I shouldn't do this cause I won't be happy. I eventually just lose it. Worse than the night before. I say in a very quiet, shake-y, and rage-filled voice: ""You've gotten to say a lot of things that have hurt me under the guise of working through this, it's mine turn:"" I spat these words through tears in the most angry voice coming from the deepest rage I've ever felt:

""this is fucking shit. I didn't ask for fucking any of this. I wasn't given a choice to be born. You fucking made me with your fucking womb; this is your fucking fault. And if you fucking dare say that God made me then fuck him for the way he made me. You fucking raised raised me.  
I don't want this. I don't want to sit here and do this. fuck you. fuck god. fuck everyone. fuck that bullshit book that tells you that I'm a bad person. this isn't fun. this isn't cool. this is horrible. a cruel fucking joke."" I fell to the ground crying, shivering, gasping for breath and choking in between the tears. I think this was a big turning point. My mom just held me while I cried for a long, long time. At this point I think she started to understand: being transgender isn't fun. It isn't ""trendy"". It isn't some people ""deciding they'd rather be women"". She started asking questions like how long I knew and I explained to her. She tried to ask how I was feeling and then related to those feelings with her own feelings of ""well, I always felt more like a guy and always tried to be more of a guy"" (!!! *what*???!!!). I looked at her confused and she was talking about how despite her feelings look at her. She's happy. She's married. She chooses how she dresses, etc. She then went on to say how I don't always have to transition all the way but I can find a way to sit somewhere on between. I quickly thought of a tactic to probe more about this whole thing with my mom's dysphoria and I asked her a question: I put my left hand out and my right and out with my wrists together making a flat surface and asked ""so if my right hand is how male you feel and my left hand is how female you feel. you're maybe.. around here?"" And I put my hand at about what would be 75% male and 25% female. She nodded. I decided to contrast to her feelings in hopes to really convey my point and said ""see, I'm here."" And I put my right hand against my left hand and said ""I'm at 100%"". Anyway, she asked more about what I wanted and we came to the conclusion that she thinks I should try hormones and see if I'm happy (she doesn't know I'm at four months but that's OK) and I agree. Haven't heard anything from my dad.

I gotta say though, through all this, that I'm relieved. It's done. I'm out to all the people (my brother was cool about it) in my family with varying support. I'm out to my best friend. I have my wife. I'm actually decently happy and content. I hope my parents will come around though, especially my dad, but with how stubborn he is I don't know if it'll ever happen. Hopefully my dad ends up ok."

I'm seeing my longtime counselor today and I've got to tell him that I can't put off trans stuff any longer. Like when I first told him he said there's no rush and I sort of agreed. I then did the worst thing ever. I bottled being trans up and put it away for my mom and a girl I was dating and now I've got so much internalized crap it's going to kill me.

Like I cant shake all the stuff I've heard up until this point and I'm just so sick of it. Right now I want so bad to go at it 100% but I'm afraid my mom is right and I'll never truly be happy and that I'm just messed up. I know she's wrong, but I have a tough time actually telling my heart that.

I'm afraid that my family turning me away will be near the same level of pain I have now and I'm close to actually crying in class right now.

I'm sorry everyone I know these posts go up all the time but I just don't know what I'm going to do."

sheldor9billion,asktransgender,had a confusing sexual encounter with a guy. NSFW and the story might be a little tense,"hi there. mtf throwaway account here. i want to talk about my first sexual encounter with guy after transitioning. it left me feeling really confused and kind of hollow and i want to find out why. do all women feel like a tiny piece of their soul was taken the morning after? all trans women? or am i just seriously broken?


story time.
i've been seeing a really sweet guy for a few weeks now, and yesterday we took the next step to netflix and chill.

it was lovely. his chest and arms were strong and he was sweet and tender while kissing me everywhere. it was ecstasy. we stripped each other and everything just felt perfect and electric.


he then started to go down on me and i told him ""nooooo"" in a small mouse-like protest. he then kind of begged me. not in any sort of rapey way. just, ""aww, i would really like to. can i?""


i sat there and shook out an ""okay."" he went to town and loved it obviously, and while there are plenty of nerve endings down there and the sensation was pleasant, i was getting a contradictory feeling in my brain about how unpleasant it was. i guess i'm describing genital dysphoria.


i let him continue and i eased up a little. i think with time it would be something i could teach myself to enjoy. i just had this tension building in my chest, and i focused on not freaking out.


the night continued and i felt myself relaxing again. he smiles and touches and kisses me everywhere. i find myself on top of him and he asks me if i would fuck him. i freeze and tell him ""no""


he could tell this question really affected me and he said we should stop and just cuddle for a while. i relax again and explain how, while dicks feel good in a purely biological sense, it wasn't enjoyable for me on an emotional level. i also took the time to explain how, even if i wanted to, erections are uncommon and rarely hard enough to penetrate someone.


he just seemed oddly fascinated with my dick. focusing on it and wanting to do things with it. in all other regards he is the sweetest thing, and the rest of the evening aside from things involving my dick was amazing. but this fascination of his made me uncomfortable.


i guess i'm looking for advice. i'll communicate with him about what was going through my head and make sure he's aware. but i guess, what's going on with this guy? what's going on with me? it feels so messy in my head right now.


thanks for reading my intense/long story. any advice is welcome."
Giraffe420,asktransgender,The one thing holding me back from taking the plunge and starting hrt,"So recently i have seen a therapist and have been recommended a place where i can start hrt and transition. Im beyond excited and want to start finally living my life as what im 90% sure is my true self. The only thing that is giving me second thoughts, and alot of anxiety, is my sexual preference. I like girls alot so im guessing im 100% lesbian, not really an interest in guys at all. I romantically like girls and thats who i see myself spending the rest of my life with and taking care of. The only thing is im a decently attractive guy and i think alot of the girls i find attractive, wouldnt find me attractive if i transitioned. Honestly idk but im kinda sure. There is also a specific girl i really like and kind of have a crush on, and i think if i ever had a chance with her, it wouldn't be with me as a woman. I know there are girls out there that might be attracted to me as a woman but i just dont know how they might see me and if they are even my type. So pretty much im stuck between a rock and a hard place. Im going to be able to start hrt here pretty soon and probably will go ahead with it, but it gives me anxiety and severe sadness knowing that a girl i might really like or love would just be completely off the radar if i transitioned."
AirplaneAlice,asktransgender,"As I count my pills to see when I need to get a refill by, I noticed a problem. The pill counts aren't equal! Help?","So, as I usually do when I'm running low, I count the pills to see when I should schedule my next refill. However, when I counted I got 10 pills of 2mg e left, which didn't sound right to me (I should run out in about 12-14 days). So I count my spiro and there's 13 of them in there, as expected. Frantically I count my 1mg e and it turns out I have *16* (well 17 if you count tonight's pill). Doing the math, it became clear that I must have took 2mg e in the night 3 times over the past month which would account for the raised 1mg count and lower 2mg count.

So... what should I do? I'm pretty ocpd about having equal pill counts. I don't think taking 4mg instead of 3 for a couple days really harmed anything (might have actually helped). But I'm wondering what I should do now. Should I pick 3 spread apart days to take my 1mg in the morning, so that by run-out day I'm back to equal counts? Or just keep going on with my life and never having equal counts?

I don't really know how this happened, since I have a pretty solid system set up to let me know what pills I have and haven't taken. And it seems weird that I'd take 2mg by itself, when I usually take it with my spiro."

I'm making big mistakes at work, drinking more, I'm tired all the time... there was a time when I felt I was going forwards but now I'm going backwards more than ever. 

The dysphoria is back with a vengeance as well. All the old triggers are back plus some new and exciting triggers that I would never have expected. I feel like with every inch I give this condition takes a mile and I can't keep up.

It used to be that not going out en femme made things worse. Now it's two days after I've been out and it's worse. I can't win!

I'm closeted and non-transitioning. I decided against transitioning because I would not be passable. I used to have hopes about HRT and FFS, but I have done a lot of research and I simply do not have the requisite bone and skull structure for them to be effective.

I am miserable all the time. I've stopped eating. There's nothing that brings me joy or even elation. I don't want to go through life like this anymore, but I really see no solution to my problems. Its either transition, be unpassable, dysphoric, lonely, and miserable, or stay in the closet and be dysphoric, lonely and miserable

I guess I just want to talk to someone, but there's no one I trust to discuss these things with, and my old therapist (who I never cared for much anyways) is back home hours away."

When the cyproterone kicked in.. did it make your gonads hurt.  i checked my level of sperm and there is almost nothing left and it was uncomfortable a little when i climaxed.

Demiboy, Transfemme, Transmasculine, pangender. I don't get it. To be three-fourths a gender, or for your gender to change depending on the social context, I just don't get it, I'm not trying to invalidate Anyone's feelings, but I just don't understand.

And what's with all of these strange Pronouns? He,She, And They are perfectly reasonable. But then there are things like ""zir"" that I just dont get.

I guess what im trying to ask is this an ok routine or would it be more effective if i timed it a bit differently? i was given the option of taking the 2mg estradiol at either morning or night by my doctor so i arbitrarily opted for the morning because i wasn't really sure if it makes a difference or not..

I just related to &amp; identified more with being male &amp; feeling male ect

I've been an absolute mess trying to figure this all out &amp; in some ways I'm still like 'am I trans, am I not??'

I've asked myself 'can you live the rest of your life as female' probably not, I do think I would prefer being seen/referred to &amp; known as male 

But, maybe it's because I have a big road ahead of me, because I've lived 20+ years as female but I guess as a 'tomboy' that I'm like hmm maybe I'm not 

But I feel so numb &amp; strange, like stuck in the middle of what I want? undecided a little bit I guess

I'm not even sure why I'm writing this, just to let it all out I suppose 

I have told about 7 of my friends &amp; everyone of them have been so supportive &amp; understanding, they each said we love you &amp; you need to do what you gotta do to be happy which is rad a fuck, that's amazing that they are so loving &amp; wonderful about it 

But I'm still sort of unsure, but I think I am trans

Is it just me being extremely fearful to start my transition or what? 

I know that nobody apart from myself can answer these sorts of questions, but maybe you have felt the same? 

I also feel as if now I have told people &amp; expressed how I feel I have no feeling towards it so ever I feel really numb 

Maybe it's because I've finally figured it out &amp; accepted it? or maybe I am not trans...

cardiffsarah,asktransgender,susan is a scam money grabber,"i now have proof that susan is a money grabber and is only looking out for her self and to fun her life style

this is a announcement i had from her site which proves what we all thought.

It is now 20 days into a 30 day month, and we are still significantly short of the monthly goal; and we need your help reaching it. 

At this time we are still $1,230.64 short, which if not met would leave a significant portion of the bills unpaid in the upcoming month. 

In additional Susan has had almost $860.46 in unplanned medical and other expenses over the last month.  As she stated last month: 

Quote
My passport fees were $155.66 needed for January, see the September issue of the Advocate magazine for details. Plus an additional $20.00 for passport photos. $8.00 for new drivers license! I have blood tests for hormones coming out at the beginning of the month  which will run me just under $300.00; plus doctors visit $88.40, I was sent a bill from the doctor for another visit which I do not think I owe, but if I do that's another $88.40; plus refilling the hormones $200-ish. Not counting 2 months rent $800 ($400 per month).


Things were tight enough she only paid a single month rent for the first time in several years. 

The monthly goal is the basic amount required to meet the standard monthly expenses (Rent, Internet Service, Electricty, Gas, Water, Transportation, Car payment and Insurance, food, etc), and all of the above expenses are not figured in that total. So she is down a total of $860.46 personally. (It really wouldn't hurt to exceed the monthly goal now and then)

We also had expected a significant donation to help cover the hardware expenses a couple of months ago, Susan covered them out of what she had on hand, expecting the donation to come in within a couple of weeks to make up for it, however due to an unforeseen situation, the person who had offered to send it was unable to do so

Between these two groups of expenses all of the buffer Susan had carefully built up was eaten up.  

Susan can continue to squeak by skimping and cutting at much as possible from her portion of the monthly goal, but the situation will only get worse each month, until finally that will no longer be possible.

The monthly goal has not changed since 2013, so anything over that amount helps out more than you can know.

For those who are unable to help out, we understand totally! Many people are in tight financial situations, something Susan understands quite well. This message is for those who are able and willing to step up and contribute! Anything at all will help!

Thank you for your consideration! Together we make the difference!

tao-nui,asktransgender,"Away from judgement, what are you?","I was half asleep in my bed last night, and half conscious about myself and my envelope. I was in many ways naked, half away from my own judgement and far away from people's opinions. And then I came to a realization: For a brief moment I was able to feel that my gender struggles weren't weighing on me. I was what I truly am deep down inside, and it wasn't biased by anything. Not by others, not by myself. Not by my physical body. Not by my fears, not by my dysphoria. I was a beautiful human being with a feminine energy and it brought tears to my eyes as I was slowly waking up to that sensation.

To those who are questioning. When you strip away every noise that surrounds you, until the only thing left is your true self, unbiased by judgement from yourself or others, what are you?

Notoremo,asktransgender,Arguing with strangers on Reddit has made me incredibly depressed. Again.,"This is a recurring issue. Every year or so I just get drawn to this site, get sucked in. I know it's not good for me. I know it yields no benefit and just makes me feel like shit but I go anyway. And worse, sometimes when I go I get knee-deep in shit with self-righteous closed-minded fuckheads who think they know everything about you because you're one of ""those"", and because you're one of ""those"", you think this way and you're like that and you're wrong and you're probably a fucking loon. And to that I'm calm and rational and the downvotes come and I brace for each one because I can feel the individual person doing it, the real person somewhere out there clicking the damn thing. Feels like a hard shove from a passerby. And then when there's a lot of the downvotes piled down it's just a crowd all turned against you.

Even when I don't comment and just browse it's this way. Better a little but not by much at all. It's so unhealthy. I can admit I have an issue with this. I'm too sensitive, I take it all to heart. It's always been this way. I hate the people on all the sides. I like 2 or 3% of those I encounter here in the hours and hours I invest daily and even those feel like trifles. There's nowhere I like. I know people are different online and that's what makes it worse. And yet I keep doing it. What can I do? I've told myself ""this is it, last time ever"" and then I go again the next day, and if not the next day the next few, or a week. And it starts all over. I've even installed a website blocker on my browser but the fact I can disable it on my own is what kills it. I take the time to disable it every single time.

Sounds like addiction, but I get no pleasure out of it. I've had this problem all my life, for years, ever since I could use the computer. The years in therapy didn't fix it. It just takes my discipline, but right now I've got none. I hope hearing some voices here is what will help me muster it, and then finally when I say ""this is it, last time ever"" it really will be. God, I hope.

Thanks a lot for reading this. I hope after this thread I'll never see this hellspawn site again. And maybe it's not a hellspawn to others but it's a hellspawn to me."
ContagionDS9,asktransgender,Electrolysis in Portland under OHP,"I thought I would make a comment on this: I had my electrolysis tech, who finally figured out all of the insurance items and is enabled to be paid by OHP.

Sounds pretty good right? Well, two requests for authorization later, we come back with some weird requirement that states they need a surgery date set, which conflicted with the requirement from OHSU to have surgery scheduled after approximately 80% electrolysis done.

So, two more requests go in, many calls are made and two letters are received. Complete rejection. Because OHP - FamilyCare was not able to get my recommendation from a qualified mental health care worker. 

For the record, there should be no reason for the electrolysis technician to be having a recommendation from the psych people, but that was the rejection letter.

So I called them up, a week after they had sent the rejection letter, to get complete clarification over what was happening.

It turns out, that all of the above was correct, but then negated as the Medical Director overturned the previous rejections, today.

Now, I am scheduled for 1.5 hours of genital electrolysis.

I guess I wrote this for a journal entry, a guide post since I am not seeing many posts with OHP listed. I've seen plenty of girls getting breast augmentation (I choose note to), but not so many doing GRS/Electrolysis/Orchi here via OHSU.

So I am hoping to shed some light for those that do find this and other threads to give a path to what I have been doing.

Thank god for opiates, that should help."

OnlyFiguratively,asktransgender,Hair help?,"Hey guys,

So long story short, I'm genderfluid, leaning towards the more girly side of things. Sometimes I lean towards the guy side of things but more often I feel somewhere in between or (especially recently) more feminine. I've been more or less conscious of this for six months or so, so I've had a few haircuts between then. Ever since then though I've been constantly changing my mind about what I want for a haircut, and it's been in between growing my hair out shoulder length into a bob, or just keeping my hair the way it is now, in a fairly manly looking undercut.

I tend to incline more towards the short hair when I'm feeling like a guy/feeling in between and incline more towards the long hair when I'm feeling like a girl but even when I feel like a girl I like the idea of short hair I just don't know how to not look like a guy with it.

My dad is very important to me and I'm important to him. And I know I gotta come out. I was originally considering waiting until our financial situation Improves to come out, but I don't know if I can stand holding things in much longer.

The thing is he grew up in the 60's and while not Completely hateful, he doesn't understand the concept of being trans and thinks that Transwomen are men who DECIDE to feel the way they do. With enough education and legitimate proof, I'm sure he'd understand. But he's proud of me and I know that he'll still be upset about ""losing"" his son.

It's a heavy bombshell to drop and we're all under so much stress. But I'm sick of going day by day feeling this way, and telling him will make it easier to get to a therapist when that becomes possible.

I'm so scared though. I'm scared to do it. What If he doesn't believe me? What if he tells me that I have to wait until I'm on my own? 

And I considered the route of getting to therapy before coming out, but then he'd likely think that Said therapist convinced me of this and that I was influenced(which would be reasonable under different circumstances).


It's not fair to him to wait until things are better again to come out.

I just don't know. Ive gotta do it, but it's so scary and it wont be as easy a coming out as others may have had.

Give me advice or warn me and tell me to wait. I just need some opinions to think about."
harley-katherine,asktransgender,Depo Provera and anxiety,"Hello all!

I recently spoke to my doctor about incorporating progesterone into my HRT. He brought up depo Provera, told me about it mainly being used as a form of birth control (ha!) and such. I'd read about it, and was ready to give it a go. The only thing that made me apprehensive is it being a 3 month injection. If I reacted badly, it was gonna be a rough ride.

Well, aside from the listed hot flashes, headaches (already had those, so now they're constant - yay!), a touch of acne and other side effects, it did something curious: my (sometimes crippling) anxiety is now incredibly easy to manage.

I can still get heavy bouts of it (such as getting called on in class *shudders*), but they just make my chest hurt instead of shutting me down and soaking my clothes in sweat. While out with friends I can talk a lot more easily. I keep expecting to be anxious, and it rarely, if ever, comes. It's crazy.

It's only been about a week or so since I've been on it, so things could change. What I'd really like to know is if anyone else has had similar reactions to the medication, or if there's anything else about it that I should be made aware of. Thanks~"
TwoSpiritsTG,asktransgender,Erections returning after a 6 month hiatus? [NSFW],"So, yesterday I got an erection. For a few hours until I caved and relieved myself. I haven't had an erection in nearly 6 months. I've had close, but nothing this... rock hard or long lasting. My sex drive is back too. Full swing. I've been getting them again today too. Constantly.

There are three major changes, and I'm worried. This kicked off all kinds of dysphoria after having so long without having to deal with it.

Here are the changes:

1. I've been in a marriage with a dead bedroom since I decided to transition. No sex at all. That was over a year ago. I just started talking to someone who is, without lack of better terms, a bombshell. Total knockout. She's what's causing all... this.

2. My insurance pulled ut o the pharmacy I was going to and I moved to another, smaller, family owned one. My hormones went from $30 with insurance to $14. I'm extremely worried they're sub-par and what that would mean for my transition.

3. Time. Sex drive returning is something I know happens. I've been on hormones since mid-Feb.

Is this normal? Am I freaking out over nothing? I'm really, really worried my hormones aren't doing anything anymore and I'm taking garbage... but it's a regulated pharmacy."

Maybe we could even start a small fundraiser here on /r/asktransgender to help put some of our users. "
dexrlybeloved,asktransgender,Am I trans or is this just a phase?,"I've been lurking here for a few months but I haven't really had the courage to post until now. I'm just really confused and frustrated and I don't really know what to think anymore.

I'm 18 and AFAB, but I feel like a boy. A gay feminine boy. It's how I imagine myself in all my daydreams, fantasies, etc. And in my mind I know that this is okay and valid, but I'm still constantly battling with the idea that I'm ""not trans enough"". It's really discouraging because I KNOW what I feel, and yet I just can't seem to fully accept it. I don't feel trans enough because if I were to physically transition, I don't want to take hormones. The only thing that I'd really want to do is have top surgery, because for myself, I just don't feel that anything else is really necessary (besides maybe changing my name, and other non physical stuff like that). I looked at bottom surgery for a while, but that whole process just makes me squeamish and it doesn't seem like something I'd be satisfied with anyway. 

I just don't really have a problem wearing dresses or skirts or other things that are generally considered feminine. I'm comfortable with it. I'm comfortable with what I am right now, just not with the fact that I'm considered a girl. It just feels wrong when people say it.

And maybe it's just because I'm still generally young, but the thought of being an old woman or an old man just grosses me out. I can't even relate to the words ""man"" or ""woman"", they just feel so ghastly. Is it weird that I prefer using the term ""boy"" more?

Is this a phase? Am I not even ftm at all, but somewhere in between? Are these fears normal? I'm struggling. Any advice is appreciated."

JunBrun123,asktransgender,Am I Transgender or OCD?,"Hey guys, I know that it is lonh but please read the whole thing, thx
So it all started about six months ago when I had a dream about being a girl during sex, having sex with a man. I have had many weird different sexual dreams but usually after I wake up the dream doesn't arouse me anymore and I shrug it off. But for some reason after I woke up I would still get aroused by this idea and it really started to scare me. I was constantly obsessing over that fact that I was still aroused by this and my brain kept on telling me I was transsexual. These intrusive thoughts happen a lot and I would always find myself obsessing over them for hours. The thing that scared me the most is the fact that the sexual fantasies of being a girl was now may more prominent then my regular heterosexual fantasies. Also I would like to say that before all this I was a normal heterosexual man. I was attracted to girls and always imagined myself in the mans role . Before that dream I have tried imagining my self in the womans role (Just out of curiosity) but didn't find it arousing at all and I actually found it quite uncomfortable. So these intrusive thoughts started giving me alot of distress so I decided to see a therapist. After one session with my therapist she said that she was 100 percent sure I wasnt transgender but rather I had OCD. She also told me that what I had was a pretty common fetish and that i shouldn't worry about it. It made sense to me, when I thought about it I did display ocd behavior in my past. After that session I felt releived. The intrusive thoughts were gone and I felt like a boy again. This lasted for about 2 weeks and I stated getting the intrusive thoughts again. Since my family is broke,I didnt want to ask them for another session and medication so I decided to solve this on my own. At first whenever I had a compulsion I would always ask the question would I rather be a boy or a girl. At first I always answered boy which would give me temporary releif but the compulsions would come again. I feel like I was obsessing over this so much I started to become trans. Now whenever I Imagine my self as a pretty woman I would get this rush of excitement for some reason. Also for some reason whenever I imagine being a man I feel weird and my brain keeps on telling me that I am not a man. This has caused me a lot of anxiety. And the more anxiety the more I obsess. This cycle has caused me to  spend any free second I get to obsess whether or not I am transgender. I can imagine being a man without feeling weird anymore, my brain keeps telling me that I am not a man. Now I am suddenly uncomfortable with all  my masculine traits. For example usually I love my Adams apple but now whenever I lift up my neck I feel weird and exposed. I also started feeling weird and uncomfortable when I take off my tshirt. And for some reason whenever I imagine myself as a cute girl my brain gets excited. On top of that I feel like I cant get off on my normal heterosexual fantasies and only get aroused by the fantasies of me bieng a girl. This is really starting to worry me, I feel like I am becoming transgender. i understand that people REALIZE that there transgender at different ages but I genuinely loved being a man before this. All my role models were males, I wanted to have a six pack and muscles and be a husband and have a wife. And I swear I was not in denial. But now it feels less and less like ocd. I read through some of the other r/asktransgender posts and many people say that it started off as a fetish which really worries me. On top of that i feel weird being a man now, and I think I am starting to feel euphoria when I Imagine myself as a woman. The only thing that relieves my anxiety is the fact that I used to love being a male. plz help"

When I'm coming back from work and taking my pants off, it smells horribly. I don't know how to describe it, but it's kinda fishy, pee? Something like that and it's really bad. Does anyone knows what causes it and how to get rid of it?

I've got Progynova that I ordered (without prescription). I was out of estrogen for a month and couldn't stand anymore (I had a skin rash, bad sleep, fatigue and overall I felt terrible). I've had blood tests done 2 weeks ago and they showed that my estrogen level is in ""norm"". I didn't get a copy of them because they sent it to the GIC, but I guess it was a male norm since testosterone was marked as ""abnormal"" and nurse looked it up for me (1,9nmol/l/55ng). How long do I need to wait until my levels will come back to the female norms?

And since I switched from patches to pills, how long it takes until it start working?

amon_erin,asktransgender,Is this common when starting HRT?,"So I've been on HRT for a week as of yesterday (YAY!). I obviously haven't noticed many physical changes other than body odor. I do have a couple of things I'm worried about, though. I've noticed that I tend to get small headaches occasionally, that I get tired really easily, and sometimes I get a bit short of breath. I'm attributing this to the spiro, but I'm worried this is something else. Obviously I need to discuss this with my doctor, but did anyone else have this happen? I'm wondering if injections or something else might be a better route to go. (4mg sublingual Estradiol/100mg spiro a day)

It's in my nature to be worried about things, so I'm worried that these are signs that I'm just some deluded cis person who is now only developing dysphoria. Which is funny because since starting HRT my desire to be a girl has generally increased. And it's also funny because right now I'm only worried I'm going to end up with one giant breast and one tiny one. (My left breast has had more tissue than the right since I was a teenager, and was one of the first things that made me wonder if I was supposed to be a girl when I was younger.)"

Lethrowawayeri,asktransgender,Have any of you kept a strongly gendered given name or even changed your name to something for your assigned gender? (A question but mostly a rant),"I have loved the name Dahlia for as long as I can remember. It has everything I want in a name. It's familiar, easy enough to spell and pronounce, but uncommon. It's sweet, floral, folksy, even old-fashioned, but it's also got a darkness, an edge. I could imagine a soft butch punk girl named Dahlia and the name would fit her perfectly in large part because of how much it wouldn't fit her. But a Dahlia could also be a CEO. It's sweet but edgy, folksy but professional. It everything I have ever wanted in a name and I love it so much.

But I'm FtM. Changing my name to Dahlia would be all different kinds of ridiculous. I mean hell, my given name is Kendall, I'd be better off just keeping it than changing to Dahlia (side not, I used to dream about getting people to call me Dahlia as a nickname for Kendall because of the similarity of -dall/Dahl-.) But Christ, I've never in my life found a boy name so love the way I love Dahlia, never found a name that has felt so perfectly me. I don't think there's a masculine name out there I haven't seen at some point, but none of them fit.

I'm in a band, and obviously it's be cool if someday I could support myself with just my music, and then I feel like I could be a male Dahlia. Especially if I was open about being trans, cause then everyone would just assume it was my given name that I kept. I could go by Dahl (which I sounds too much like doll for me to use as a standalone but is cool as a nickname.) I can imagine it. I can imagine me.

But realistically that probably wouldn't happen. And in no other context could I ever imagine getting away with being a guy named Dahlia. Too many questions, you know? And plus the issue of sexism in academia, and I'm probably gonna be an archaeologist and it'll make it harder to get shit published with a girl name. So Dahlia just isn't realistic.

I know that.

It wouldn't work.

But I want it to. Because I am tearing my hair out over trying to find a name. Nothing feels like me. There are plenty of perfectly fine masculine names, yeah. Names that I'd love to see on other people. But they're not *me.* *I'm* Dahlia. But so can't be Dahlia. And I am struggling like crazy to accept that.  

Am I alone in this? Has anyone else felt too connected, probably to your given name, but to a name from your assigned rather than experienced gender, to let go of it?"

Anyway, I've been upset because current medical technology won't let me get pregnant. Before anyone says that ""having biological children isn't a right"", I know that. That doesn't change how I feel. This isn't about validation either. I think I'm just bummed like any other woman who can't carry her own child.

Anyway, I've deliberately gone down a career path that pays extremely well so I can chuck money around if some surgeon decides to do this someday. Additionally, I've lost weight and I'm staying healthy so I'll likely be in a good position to have multiple surgeries. The way I see it, I've given myself the best chances, so why can't I just let this issue go?

idk, what helps everyone out there who feels this way?

Thanks

Daughter_of_Discord,asktransgender,Turns out it was only a dream...,"Yesterday morning I woke up in a great mood! My cousin showed me an article in the newspaper that announced the coming of a clinic in my area that will serve the needs of transgendered people!

It took me the whole morning to realize that the article didn't really exist and nothing of the sort actually happened at all. I was crushed and heartbroken over spending something like 6 hours with that anticipation quietly sitting in the back of my mind.

Do any of you frequently have experiences like that, where your dreams confuse the hell out of you because they aren't wild and completely implausible works of fiction?"
shoelaze,asktransgender,An unbiased opinion?,"So I've been seeing a therapist twice a week for a while now (not a gender specialist but someone I was referred to by my GT to sort out some stuff with first) and it's been going pretty ok. I went in today and was describing how I had a shift sometime last week where thinking about trans stuff and transition stopped feeling nice and instead felt 'not worth it' (it's a complicated feeling but I described it as ""like a combination of lower dysphoria than usual and like fear and confusion and depression and doubt the results would be good both emotionally and physically and its like somewhere between 'am I a girl' and 'whats the point anyway'"" in a message at the time. Although I will say that my dysphoria, if it is that, isn't actually lowered, I still very much hate the way I am. Anyway in the process of describing that to her I spoke about how when I first see a woman in the street every now and again I am struck by sort of just a sharp feeling, it's attraction but not necessarily in a romantic or jealousy sense just like a pang of something. Then following that immediately comes all the thoughts like 'do I wanna be you', 'do I wanna be with you' etc. This made her suggest that, due to trauma from being bullied by a girl I liked at an early age, I'm using the trans stuff as a way of not dealing with the anxiety of being attracted to someone, because, for me, being trans would be 'easier'. I don't necessarily think she's wrong, and it doesn't definitely invalidate my trans feelings, but it felt shitty to hear and know on some level she's probably right, and internalize that a professional may also doubt my transness...

So basically I'm asking for peoples thought's on this. I know it sounds like she could be like gatekeeping me or whatever but she really isn't like that so 'find another therapist' isn't really helpful. Sorry if this is all over the place or makes no sense, I'm a little shaken but I'll clarify or elaborate on anything in the comments. Thanks :)"

One exception to that though, they seem to think I need time to decide... Why? I've kinda had feelings since I was 7, thought about them till 13, and at 13 I did some real hardcore questioning. I posted multiple questions on here over the years on me questioning and how much more do I have to do? I mean,  I picked female and then I decided to completely hardcore question myself with the most bigoted text available and nothing really changed. My mindset has settled for 2 years now.

HijraShejra,asktransgender,I've been on HRT for almost a year. I still don't feel like a girl,"I feel like a man who hates being a man. One who's been so scarred by toxic masculinity and sexual trauma that every thought of being male just disgusts me.

Hormones have changed me a lot. Both the way I feel and the way I look. I feel more like myself with the emotional depth of estrogen and without the weird sexual twinge of testosterone. My body feels so much more comfortable with feminine features. I like being treated and accepted as female even though I don't really feel like I fit in.

I can't imagine myself living the rest of my life with a male anatomy. I don't even want sex as a female. I'm not asexual but I still want any kind of sexuality gone from my life.

It's not like I find my female body attractive. I'm attracted exclusively to men.

But I still feel like a gay man. And I hate it. A gay man who hates being a man. A gay man who wants to be a woman but isn't. Or what if I don't really feel that way and I've just fooled myself into it? That I've just gotten so far in that I've started lying to myself...

I bring this up to other trans girl friends and they think that this is just ordinary insecurity. It feels like so much more, though. I really feel like I'm a man, honestly, but like 1% of the time. But I mean, why can't that one percent be right? The feeling is so intense. The rest of the time I feel so normal and content as a girl, but what if it's denial? I feel like I've been having these thoughts so strong for months... What does it mean..?

Please don't tell me that I'm just being insecure. Please don't tell me that ""men don't want to be women"", because I think that sometimes it's more complicated than that...

I still live with my parents, though, and they don't really allow me to ever express myself, so I don't have a good sense of identity if that makes sense... Dysphoria is not really that big on a day to day life. Sometimes I experience it, sometimes not.

wellgolly,asktransgender,Nearly 10 months into HRT and I'm constantly worried about being 'too transgender.' Should I go about things differently?,"So uh, I'm MAAB and have been taking HRT since New Year's Day. I feel....stuck. In a lot of ways.

My current doctor has been prescribing very low dosages, it feels (2 2mg estradiol, 4 25mg spiro, 1 5mg provera). I kinda feel like my physical transition's halted since around April. Daily progress pics dwindled until I'm only doing it once a month and feeling like I see no progress. And I almost wonder if that's for the best.

My family learned, one by one, all around december - february. They seem wary, but not angry. Some try to talk me out of it, most are supportive but prefer I not discuss or acknowledge it. And I dress in boy mode around them, terrified of a bra strap showing or whatnot.

I'm constantly ""sir'd"". I think the least masculine thing strangers call me is ""buddy"", which I'm noticing a lot more of, lately. [This is my physical look.](http://imgur.com/Wr97Vda) This post kind of happened because I'm about to get a haircut for my perpetual bedhead hair, which I kind of like! But I honestly am not sure if it's due to reluctance to being too clearly transgender - I spend a lot of time doing what I essentially did by waking up in bed.

Now, at the same time, I get a some weird looks, I get questioned, and I'm in the middle of the longest unemployment spot of my life right now (3 months!!) - I quit my last job with a month's notice because I wanted to start over and be openly trans, meaning this has been really closer to 4 months of searching. So far, no dice.

Now, to be clear, there are bright spots in my life. I'm way more in tune with myself, and feel actual emotions, and I have an incredible boyfriend. So life isn't misery. But I feel the transition is really not going well at all. Any advice? Do I lean into things? Slow down? Calm down?

ekv44,asktransgender,What is the best way to deal with repressed memories when they come crashing back into consciousness?,"Yesterday there was a post on the Facebook Transgender Alliance where a teenage trans woman made her own dress out of a garbage bag, because that was all she had to work with.  That post made me remember that I had also made a dress out of a garbage bag, when I was 18-20 years old.  (I was still living with my mom, and I was very drunk at the time, which narrows down the age range.)  

Despite such a seemingly obvious display of gender confusion, I didn't accept myself until I was 44 years old (11/22/14), and suppressed this memory for more than 25 years.  In fairness, at the time I was at least 5 years away from knowing that transgender was a thing, but still.

Clarine87,asktransgender,I wish more flairs had age.,"When first researching, and then reading here I feel like many of the posts/comments I ~~have to~~ dismiss about peoples' personal experience, very much regarding 'YMMV ' content would not all be worthy of dismissal with that information.

For example, I might dismiss 8 out of 10 [otherwise **useful**] comments because the author's age is unknown, but half of the eight might be relevant to me, and the other very not relevant, by the same token, to another person the reverse might be true - but neither of us can know.

I have no problem with YMMV - but often it seems that saying YMMV could be forestalled by a poster's age and this would be thus then less necessary.

The social climate for trans people of different ages is very different as is the effects of HRT treatment *on that sociability* and it seems like in some cases what someone says has to be straight up ignored because you lack such a simple piece of data. 

I wish more flairs had age. I have to dismiss or filter so much content. I think age is more important than your gender ID or geography or any other piece of information when making discourse in this sub. Does anyone feel the same way?

(Note i'm not saying I wish more people set flairs, only that I wish of those who do, that age was a prominent feature).

EDIT: I realize the counter points are really difficulty to defend against, but there is a validity in knowing the age of someone you make discourse with, especially people in vulnerable situations and when giving advice.

EDIT2: For me it's when taking advice that age matters though.

liebehass,asktransgender,"People on HRT, Has your sexual orientation changed since starting HRT?","This is something I've noticed in myself, and I wondered if it was a common thing.

Previously, I wouldn't have dared to do anything sexual with someone with a penis because I wasn't attracted sexually to the idea of that, but now I find it to be a pleasurable thought/action, even as pleasurable as doing something sexual with someone with a vagina. So I just wanted to know if there have been more people that have noticed a change in sexual orientation after starting HRT.

throwawayaskt,asktransgender,I'm stuck with autogynephilia.,"Hello ladies and gentlemen, so the title pretty much says it.

First of all I must say I strongly disagree with Blanchard's fashion of labelling trans people by sexuality and failing to recognize the incredibly complex nature of gender identity. That said, I do have AGP and it has always been my main source of sexual drive (although not the only one). I never really questioned my gender identity until this year and I seem to fit all the criteria for this paraphilia. I know; women get aroused by their own image in sexual situations and that's alright but it is in no way the same to getting aroused by your femme image in non-sexual situations. Like, I see myself seeking magical transformations and forced fem narrative since my young teen years and that is just erotica. 

When I question my gender identity I usually get nowhere because AGP gets in the way. I try to dress feminine and I get aroused and I just wish I didn't, but I do. I feel like with this *am I trans* thing I'm just trying to flee my male-with-a-fetish identity and would rather be a woman to make it go away. I can't really identify any clear signs of dysphoria and if I could make the fetish disappear I would be in terms with my current identity. Maybe I would still wish to be a woman? I have no idea and I will probably never know. 

What are your thoughts on this? AGP is obviously flawed when trying to explain gender identity, but it exists and I don't see any real signs of dysphoria within myself. Thanks! "

CaptainToodleButt,asktransgender,"Felt the need to share, even though it's not particularly interesting.","Context. I'm 13, I came out in August, parents are being assholes about it and made me wear the female uniform. I've always had a short, male haircut and I look fairly andro. 

I started school at the start of Sept and on our first biology lesson, my science class had a new teacher so she didn't know our names, what ways we learn the best n stuff.

She asks us ""does anyone have any preferred names?"" Before she began the lesson. And I don't know why it pisses me off so badly but at least 4 people turned 180 degrees to look at me. And they're not the bullies. They're the oblivious, well behaved kids that are a bit ignorant with LGBT people and how outing them or making others question them isn't a fun idea. Like the type of 13 year olds that still play chase in secondary school.

It wasn't a small turn to look at me. They craned their neck to take a good look at me like they're goddamn barn owls.

And the teacher stared at me for like a split second. Longer than a glance, but not long enough to the point where it seemed like she was expecting an answer. I didn't say anything cause anxiety and an annoying part of me thinks it's unfair to confuse teachers by having some of them call me by my Masculine name while I'm wearing the girl's uniform.

My anxiety is bad. I get defensive n irritated when people ask questions like (for example this morning in school a guy in my class said this loudly) ""do you want to be a boy?"" And ""why do you wear a skirt?????"" Then I have to explain to them on how my parents are being assholes and it's so *fucking tedious*. So when I have four people- possibly more people cause there's people sitting behind me- goggling at me with big eyes, expecting an answer I get pretty damn pissed off.

If I could describe the feeling in a drawing. It would be me backed into a dark corner with millions of eyes staring down at me. 

To add to that, I told my older sister (who has had this teacher before) about it and she told me that the teacher never asked her class anything like this. 

So it's petty that I still think about this when it happened almost a month ago. Yeah, I still regret coming out cause it backfired and now everything is ten times more tedious. This homophobe in my class thinks I'm weird and is disgusted with me, i get called out by chavs more, the younger ones in my school think it's fine to stare at me like I'm an animal in a zoo.

I am having a ton of anxiety and this is feeling like a huge deal for my in my life that I have to solve right now, but I know it will take time. And I also know that plenty of trans people did have second thoughts before / while they went through with it. I mean, could I just stop taking hormones? I'm only 2 weeks in, so I might stop for another month and see how I feel. I'll probably never have my beard back at this point, and I feel like that wouldn't cause me anxiety if I was ""really trans"" but then again I don't want to fall into the trap of ""really trans"" thinking. I definitely don't seem to relate to the world and to men the way they seem to relate to the world, and to each other, but I'm no longer sure that going all the way with HRT is the answer.

trrSA,asktransgender,"Testosterone levels low, advice on how to raise it (MtF)","I've been on HRT for about 2 months now, I had an initial blood test two weeks into HRT and another just the other day.

Current Daily:

Androgen-blockers: Sprionolactone 50mg, cyproterone acetate 12mg

Estrogen: Oestradiol hemihydrate (sublingually) 4mg, split through the day

Progestin: medroxyprogestrone acetate 10mg, split morning and night


My original T count was 1.0 where the correct range is 1.0-3.0 for females (nmol/L). As I was just starting HRT I figured that my T level would drop if I kept taking the same level of anti-androgens, so I halved the dose.

At this time my T level has dropped to 0.5 nmol/L. I am very tired and such. I think it may be that I should stop taking anti-androgens entirely, as it seems my natural T level is around 1.0? I almost feel like I should take T supplement medication? I will probably drop the cyproterone acetate today and maybe halve the spiro? Is there an issue with discontinuation of cypro* at such a low dose?

Also, my original SHBG was 180 nmol/L, so I switched estrogens and took them sublingually to reduce liver load and now they are 87, which is in female pubertal range. I thought this drop would increase my free testosterone, but it hasn't seemed to help. Also, what is the effect of SHBG on transitioning. What level would people think is good and why?

Also, prolactin has dropped from 158 to 32 mIU/L. How important is prolactin in pubertal breast development?

Overall I am happy with how things are going. Breasts have gone from flat chested to approaching B cups and my face, skin, hair and mood have all improved. The low testosterone is making me tired as fuck and affecting sexual function, however. Any advice on the above is appreciated.

Edit: I do see a doctor, but not an endo often enough. The above doses are safe and there are no health issues connected with my HRT."

Problem was? All fricken day was a blur and the game itself was the immensely shitty part.  Now of this group of people I was with, no one knows my true inner identity. I've been hiding waiting for that time.  I don't know.

To no fault of their own, they don't know and it's not their fault that I haven't told them yet.  I was being unusually quiet the whole time.

I wanted to proclaim to them ""I'm a girl, call me ********"" please"". Just being a guy is getting painful but all the the things that come along with it. Vocabulary, pronouns, perceptions whatever are worse.  But I obviously couldn't say that it's not that simple.  I'm not ready yet.

The car ride back was similar.  I never said anything and just stared out the window.  My aunt and mom noticed I was really quiet.  I'm always boisterous and energetic as a person. But not today, not much more. I'm faking this attitude a little more. They knew something was up and I just said I was tired and that was that.  I'm am tired. I'm tired of being male."
Cityman,asktransgender,How do you feel about the way tumblr and Social Juatice Warriors are handling the transgender issue?,"I've been to various soapbox subreddits, but it occurred to me that I never got the opinions of actual transgender individuals. 

One on hand, tumblr and SJWs are making it much less acceptable to insult and discriminate againat transgenders.

On the other hand, what they define as transgender and the way they talk about it and made-up genders seems backwards at best.

Throwawayzztop,asktransgender,"In regards to my doubts, confusion, and lack of direction"," So I don't expect this to get much response because my title is rather bad but if you relate or have related I'd like to know.

I am currently an 18 year old boy living in college.

I guess I'm posting here because I don't know what else to do, I feel like I'm finally at the end of this rope of doing nothing and I am really scared and don't want to let go of the rope. My feelings of being transgender have kept coming and going for around 4 years now and it's recently been quite bad. I did come out saying I have gender issues to my girlfriend and she has been extremely supportive and loving. I've made a couple of posts like this before and deleted them but now I feel like it's worse and I should do something. But I feel like that I just can't be transgender and yet nobody normal has this much of an issue with their gender.

A little about my past to attempt to put my situation in some light.
Around preschool age I used to go down the slide in my backyard and imagine that when I went down it would make me a girl. Then later on in elementary school I had nearly obsessive compulsive thoughts saying that if I did something wrong/not in a certain way then I'd become a girl. I found my self saying to my self nearly constantly that I was a boy. And every night I would attempt to get rid of the girl in me and be rid of it. Then later on in middle school/high school age I started crossdressing and masterbating to sissy, forced fem, gender swap type of porn. I have extreme envy of the girls I see around me and desperately want to be like them. But i feel that I couldn't be transgender because I don't think I have gender dysphoria. I don't find myself wanting to cut my penis off or anything like that. I feel that my situation isn't legitimate. Yet I just shaved my legs two days ago in attempt to feel more female. I feel that even if my girlfriend accepts me, I'd still have to come out to everybody I know and my family and I can't ever see myself doing that, or going to family events as a girl. I can't see it at all. I wish I could split with my life and my family and friends could continue to know my male body while I left and transitioned completely alone and new. 

Something else is that I'd feel fake, I want to be a real girl and have her experiences growing up and being treated as a girl by their family but I won't have that. And from videos that I've seen transgender people's voices aren't the best, while some are quite good some are quite telling. My voice can go pretty deep and I don't think I could ever get it to sound passible. 

I guess what I'm trying to say about gender dysphoria is that I don't think I have enough of it to really count. At the moment I don't see myself having any future but being a guy, and I can't envision myself living as a girl. 

This was a rather nonsensical rant and I'm sorry. I am just really scared and confused.

tinyshain,asktransgender,Anxious about coming out at work,"I love my job and I love the people I work with. I work for an LGBT-friendly company, and I have protections where I live, so I can't be fired just for being trans.

But I'm worried that my coworkers are going to treat me differently after I come out. Besides the misgendering that happens (people saying, ""hey girl"" and my manager saying ""yes ma'am""), and male coworkers always wanting to hold doors open for me, I don't have any other problems with how they treat me. I believe I'm pretty well-liked, and I have good relationships with everyone I work with (there's about 60 people that I work with regularly).

I'm worried when I come out, my relationships are going to fall apart. I'm worried my male coworkers will be weird about it, and my female coworkers won't feel as close to me or be as open. I'm worried my managers are going to see me as a different person, even though inside I'm the same, it's really just my exterior that's going to be changing.

I wish I didn't have to come out, but I'm going to start looking different as the months go on, and I can't hide it forever.

How do I come out with as little impact to my work relationships as possible?

Also, because I'm nonbinary and not a binary transmale, I'm not sure how much detail I should go into exactly about my identity. I'm wondering if it'll be easier just to come out as a transman and have everyone refer to me as ""he,"" rather than ""they,"" which is what I prefer."

Trilly_n,asktransgender,Am I transgender or just confused?,"Hello everyone I'm a 20yo individual DMAB who is extremely confused about their gender status and I was hoping for some insight/advice. So without further ado I'll give some backstory. 

Several months ago, at the beginning of 2016, I was experiencing a certain degree of gender dysphoria and would question whether or not I was happy or comfortable in the male position that I was in. I would often browse r/transtimelines, r/transpassing, and r/mtf and imagine ""What if?""  scenarios where I would place myself in the position of some of those women and wonder that if I was in a position of more easily ""passing""  (I have a relatively feminine face similar to my mother's, but I'm over 6', have a large frame (from the wrist test) and have rather broad shoulders) whether or not I would be comfortable transitioning.

Soon afterwards I experienced a couple of traumatic losses and these feelings took a backseat to my handling of those for several months. 

However, in the past couple of weeks I've experienced a resurgence of those feelings and I wonder if I'm merely confused because I'm relatively aware of gender issues and alternative lifestyles, or that I might have an identity that is significantly more female than male. 

I do have a psychiatrist who I've been seeing because of the aforementioned losses, and he, coincidentally,  has had experience with transgender individuals since the 1980s. However, in our initial session (without me at all mentioning my dysphoria) he explained his experience with transgender individuals and how he identified them as extremely depressed individuals because they were sure that every day they were waking up in a body that was not their own. I do not feel nearly as sure as he believes is necessary to be considered transgender, and so I've been hesitant to discuss this with him due to his preconceptions. 

I've looked back on my life and I believe I've identified several instances where I may have been feeling dysphoria, but did not have the knowledge to identify it as such:

Relatively early in my life (about 5-8) I remember imagining myself as a girl while taking a bath and using soap suds to enhance that illusion. 

When I was 8-10, I remember coming up with an imagination game with my best friend at the time where we were girls with magical abilities. 

When I was in the 6th grade (~12yo) I was taking an AP Psych class and when the topics of gender dysphoria and transgenderism came up I remember I felt a degree of shame/embarrassment and tried to make myself as uninterested as possible. 

In high school I felt a degree of body dysphoria but I associated that with weight issues and worked to fix that. Afterwards I felt better about myself because of my progress in my own health and a realized infatuation-based relationship. 

Later in a healthier and more truth-based relationship I realized I was bi and decided that I felt gender was a social construct more than anything else, and that nothing truly separated men and women (at least mentally). 

Since my senior year of high school I've been shaving my legs and have been relatively disgusted with my own body hair (while at the same time choosing to take weightlifting) (I understand that the removal of body hair for women is a social construct in itself, however I felt it worth mentioning considering its tabooness in straight male society) 

And that practically brings us to where I started this backstory, at the beginning of 2016 when I started to become aware of my feelings of dysphoria. 

However, despite my dysphoria I still feel a degree of comfort in my male body and worry that if I began the process of transitioning that I might find myself regretting something I couldn't take back, especially since I worry about ""passing"". 

(TLDR) I guess I the simplest way to put this is that I'm extremely confused about my gender identity and I question what path is right for me. On top of that, considering I'm struggling with this while I'm still relatively young, I don't want to miss any window of opportunity where HRT might effectively allow me to outwardly express as female. Any experience or insight that anyone on this sudreddit could offer would be very much appreciated. 

Thanks very much.

Shockingpink13,asktransgender,Advice on Buying My First Dress,"This Tuesday, after classes, I was thinking about buying my own dress for the very first time.  Obviously, I have not transitioned yet, but I still feel as if buying a dress is an important thing to do before I start.  (Also, I want to wear it as I meet with my therapist.)  Anyways, I have some questions to ask about dress buying:

If you are a biological male walking into a dress store, or a woman's clothing store, does anyone ask any questions?  A trans friend of mine who I chat with online has told me no, but I was wondering if you all had a similar experience.

Also, I'm not really sure what sizes of clothes I'm looking for.  For boy's clothes I'm an adult medium, but I don't really know how that translates to girl clothes.

I thought I would have more questions, but that's all I have.  Let me read your advice in the comments below.

Hugs
Alexandria

Oh wait!  If a person from the store asks ""Why are you here?""  what is a good way to respond.  Should I lie and say it's for my sister?  Should I just tell the truth and say that I'm transgender and am buying my first dress?  

Thoughts?

Okay, now I'm done.

Hugs."
lyaa55,asktransgender,being hyper judgmental pre-transition?,"So I went out with some cis guys whom I haven't talked to really about my gender last night.  I realized this kind of social mold I fell into and that was super familiar, when I was out with people I liked, but in a masc., gendered setting.  For most of my life, I of course got very anxious and felt very alienated in these kinds of setting, but didn't think of myself as trans.

So I would need to find some other reason to explain my feelings, and latch onto every ridiculous thing I could find.  I used to be an extreme cultural elitist, more recently I would go out and judge people for being elitist themselves, whereas I got over that bad disposition.  I would sabotage many conversations with performed awkwardness because I wouldn't want to carry them out, etc. etc.  

Anyone else wanna share experiences about this?  Going out of your way to find reasons why you were unhappy b/c you didn't realize you were trans?"
X0utcastx,asktransgender,Question regarding HRT and continuing therapy.,"So first off I hate the fact that I even have to go to a therapist. Makes me feel like I'm wrong for being transgender so I have to see this doctor just to get hormones to make me who I really am. My question is after I get my letter for HRT is it really necessary to continue with a therapist. I don't plan on doing surgeries for years and I really hate going to this place. I'm happy and healthy besides my gender dysphoria and I just don't like jumping through hoops. My therapist keeps pushing to live full time first but I keep telling him I want to start hormones first and start my physical transition. He sounds like he will write my letter next visit but we will see. "

I've wanted to kill myself and was admitted to a hospital for a suicide attempt after being informed that my father was trying to take power of attorney over me. (I didn't know much about it and it fucking scared the shit out of me the way my mom said it). I have done cognitive testing with the psychologist and I did well but, again, troubles with OCD and Depression say I'm not ""mentally healthy"" enough to make this big decision even though I've had these thoughts since I was 16 and healthy and was healthy when I made the decision I was trans. I don't know what I'm supposed to prove to them. My suicidal thoughts only really started developing after my parent's reaction to me being trans and what followed and my depression got worse with it too, even though it was fine before. I have no idea what the hell I need to prove. 19 MtF if it matters. "

I had what I thought was my lightbulb moment last week when I read a ton of threads on here that were almost exactly like my situation.  I even saw a video on one of them that gave several signs of being trans and I had all but one.  I was so excited.  I was gonna walk into my appointment today and say that I wanted to start hormones.  

Well, last night the doubts crept back in and now I'm unsure.  I cant see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Like so much will change with transition that I can't even imagine how the life will be on ""the other side"".  This makes me feel like I should just stay male.

MxMusician,asktransgender,Do cisgender girls ever want to be men?,"I mean there's a saying ""girls want to be her and boys want to be with her"" and vice versa. Of course boys won't always want to be with whoever is 'her' and maybe girls will want to be with 'her' but do boys ever look at female celebrities and wish they could look like or be them and do girls ever look at male celebrities and want to be them without being considered transgender?

TrickyCharlotte,asktransgender,Question about suspicious dosage?,"Hey everyone,

Just asking for a friend as she doesn't use Reddit. She is soon due to start oestrogen but the details that she have been given have begun to worry her when she discussed it with our friends.  

Apparently, she has been told she will be receiving 6 monthly injections for oestrogen. To us we think she may be getting given the wrong information as none of us have heard of 6 monthly injections.

I want to point out none of us are doctors so it's entirely possible such a thing exists and we simply haven't heard of it but it just seems funny none of us have heard about it especially as we are all from different corners of the globe.

She is planning to see her doctor soon and will be asking about it but she is terribly worried so I thought we'd ask here and see what everyone thinks.

What should she do if this is misinformation?

I'm happy to convey any questions or queries if she is happy to answer.

After a few years I got the habit under control by using tricks to fulfill the urge without causing damage and eventually stopped completely. The urge never went away and I developed a severe need to fiddle with things and tension headaches so bad that I had to take muscle relaxers to get rid of them. The headaches went away after a few years but the urge to cut has dictated my idle behavior ever since.

I realized today, a week and a half on hormones, that this is gone. Completely. I don't know why but all of the tics are unnecessary. Maybe I feel I have control of my life or something but it feels amazing.

Ive come so far in the last year, but I still don't pass. Or maybe I do. Or maybe I pass some of the time.i really don't know.

But when I walk down the street people stare at me. Not as much as they did 4 months ago, but i get a lo of intense stares (from men and women alike).

It hurts. Its like a stab in the heart every time. I never thought I would place so much importance on passing. But what I want more than anything else in the world is to just be ignored. To just be another random woman walking down the street. To not wonder every time some one looks at me... Do they see a man dressed up as a woman? Are they confused when they look at me? Do they see a strange looking woman ? Or are they just staring at my boobs because they think I'm hot?

Often, but especially today (no makeup, jeans and a T shirt) I feel like I'm not girling hard enough.

I'm typing this as I leave a coffee shop and another woman goes out the door with me and the owner guess ""have a great day ladies"". And all I can think is, he must be mistaken. He must not have gotten a good look at me. Or he did and hes calling me a lady out of pity.

And then the voice dysphoria hit me. I still have a completely male sounding voice. Last night I went out for drinks with friends and the thought hit me. No matter how girly I look, how pink my nails are or how much my shirt shows off my boobs, everyone in the bar will immediately per me as a ""man"" the second they hear me talking.

So yeah. I'm not thinking of quitting, I don't regret a single thing, and I know my life is far better as a woman than it ever was when I still thought I was a man.

I feel like everytime Ive envied a girl it was when I saw her with a partner, something I haven't been able to experience because my mind can't bear committing time and energy for a partner. I feel like I only want to be a girl because I admire their ease with social relationships.

I feel like a lone wanderer on the world trying to grasp on straws to escape his loneliness. But this loneliness is also a comfort zone, it made me survive years of bullying and directionlessness. But it holds no future for me. I could wander in this loneliness forever, but it holds no motivation or desire to live any longer on this planet for me. I would never kill myself and thats why I needed to a goal for my life. I chose transition.

I know I want to be a girl. But it feels so ultimately unbelievably invalidating to listen to yourself, experience little to no body dysphoria because youre the center of your universe and youd never hate yourself and you feel like youre grasping on straws trying to validate your life goals.

id post in r/mtf but there are more people here, and this sub just seems more idk, i like it here more.  idk, anyway---

Post from [7 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/43g3ba/suporn_retiring_any_validity_to_these_rumors/)  that is inconclusive, but very alarming, to say the least.  Im kindof freaking out.

If his error rate is increasing, and if he's retiring, i feel hopeless, to be quite honest.  

someone said this means he wont need to keep their method a secret (both learned from the same mentor surgeon, the non-penile inversion), but that doesn't give me much hope at all

firstly, do low doses still inject or would that be a little overkill for a lower dose? the reason t isnt ingested is because its hard on your internal organs i believe,  but would a lower dose still have that problem?

secondly, how would the process differ if i was on low t for an extended period of time vs regular t &amp; easing into the low dose to maintain the changes regular t wouldve brought about?  would the first one take longer for the same effects the regular course causes, or would it just not cause some things at all &amp; in that case it would be better to do full dose at first if possible? 

also, i had even more questions about top surgery &amp; bottom surgery/t effects on that but this got very long so i made separate posts for those."
[deleted],asktransgender,Testosterone is destroying me...And it's making me incredibly depressed.,"Hi all. Firstly, allow me to preface this by saying I'm not transgender and I apologise if I'm not posting this in the correct subreddit, but I would like to vent so here it is. I've become rather disillusioned with life, sexuality and my gender in general. I'm a male, currently 19, soon to be 20 in just under half a year but as I've grown older I've become increasingly depressed with the effects of testosterone and it's masculinising effects on my body, so much so to the point that's it's driven me into an downward spiral of depression, made me hate myself and induced suicidal thoughts, which I've tried to act upon in the past.

Now as I mentioned, I wouldn't label myself as transgender, I feel doing so would greatly undermine the plight that actual trans people have to suffer on a daily basis and I have nothing but admiration for those people. But in many ways I feel that what testosterone has done to me has ruined me immeasurably. I feel sick to my stomach and look at myself in the mirror, my facial hair, chest hair, coarse 'manly' skin and as male pattern baldness runs rampant on my father's side of the family, I live absolutely terrified that I may one day lose my hair like my father. This would absolutely destroy me as what little confidence I have left lies in my hair.

Having done much extensive research into this issue,  I've learned that HRT can remedy a lot of these effects. I don't feel like a female at heart, but I would say for a male I'm rather feminine compared to most guys around me in terms of my interests, tastes and body language, something that's been pointed out to me many times by friends and family, much to the dismay of some. I even wear my hair long and shave my facial hair as close as possible to my skin as to not appear as masculine. Some of my more 'macho' guy friends often tell me to cut my hair because I look like a girl (I'd say my some of my features are more feminine than masculine, but things like my facial hair and such give me a slightly more masculine appearance.) I know they say this with the intention of mocking me and coercing me into changing my appearance but whenever I get told this it sends a surge of happiness throughout my body, being told I look like a girl. Very few things nowadays make me happy, bar this and the thought of dying.

As for my aforementioned issues with my sexuality, this has hurt me most out of everything I've mentioned. The thought of sexual intimacy with somebody else both disgusts me yet I crave it, I would do anything to eliminate this part of me and be free of my desires, especially as I doubt my chances of getting laid were ever high to begin with. I've scoured the web for threads from like-minded people and the usual argument against measures as drastic as this is that having sex with someone you truly love is what 'make us inherently human' and to never experience sex would be to miss out on 'one of the greatest pleasures someone could experience', but this simply doesn't matter to me. I know this sounds crazy, but I cannot express how much happier my life would be if I could remove my sex drive, or at least greatly curb it, as I have read reducing testosterone can have this effect, if I do decide to change my mind, I can always freeze my sperm just in case. I feel like if I ever were to have a girlfriend, she would be willing to overlook my flaws and accept me for who I am. But I just can't imagine ever meeting 'the one'. I'm much too shy and most of the women I've met, while a few have been interested in me, have virtually nothing in common with me so I feel I can't relate to them. I'd much rather just cut my losses and live my life happily.

I am fully aware of the potential health risks, osteoporosis being the main one, but I just don't care anymore. The longer I remain stagnant, the more I'll grow to hate myself. I feel like I'm going insane and given that I'm soon to be 20, I have to act now, as I cant bear the thought of wasting my life as I am anymore. I live in the UK by the way, I'll be seeing my GP and discussing this all with them soon, do you think they would be willing to help me? I would appreciate all comments. Thank you.

TL;DR: I'm not transgender, but I hate my male traits and would do anything to get rid of them. Would I be prescribed hormones? If not, would self-medicating be the way to go?

TonyRealm,asktransgender,"I came across this short documentary series about life as a trans person, thoughts?","By chance, I stumbled upon three short documentaries (~10 to 15 mins), each exploring the life of a trans person. The series is called *TransCanada* (the subjects are Canadian), and is created by Nootka St. Film Company, with support from Telus. 

I thought they were well made, and I thought they did a good job portraying them as regular people who happen to be trans. It was very insightful for me and I was touched by their stories, so I wanted to share! I'm also curious to know what you think; do you like the films? Has your trans experience been similar?

FavoriteColourGreen,asktransgender,Ftm asking: to date or not to date?,"Hey I am in the middle of getting my diagnosis to able to take testo. It's been almost two months now since I broke up with my Ftm boyfriend, we were together for almost a year and he meant allot to me. Now I am into, and actually have been for a while, into this cis kind of hetero girl that seems to be into me as well. She has got two kids though and is newly separated ok more than a year but still it was a long relationship. I feel like I might need time to process my breakup and she is a little bit or seems to be troubled and kind of ""lost"" in a way. I feel like I want to get close to her and get to know her better but I am afraid it is a bad idea. We said we'd be seeing each other as friends and if we feel like dating we would.

genderlich,asktransgender,How do you approach potential relationships as a trans person?,"Currently I don't present feminine ever as I'm still mostly closeted and don't have the resources to do so even if I was fully out. So if I wanted to ask someone out or something, someone I just met who I'm not friends with already, that seems like it would be a major complication. Do I tell them straight up while I'm just chatting with them a while before even asking them out, and if so, when and how? Do I wait until they've agreed to a date? That seems like a bad plan - ""btw I'm actually this whole different person haha gotcha"". 

Should I even bother, since someone who's into girls wouldn't even be attracted to me in the first place if I'm not at least presenting feminine and I should resign myself to being alone until I maybe eventually start transitioning within a couple years at best? And if so how do I cope with that and not just die of loneliness?

My friend said I might ""scare"" someone by telling them too readily, which I didn't really take too well - I get enough about how trans women are monsters and predators already. So I'm sorta back into a depressive patch, and no amount of being told ""you don't need a relationship to be happy"" or ""you need to love yourself first"" helps when that's the one thing you've always wanted."
tanzanite_robber,asktransgender,"Am I ""agender""?","So, a few days back I posted a question about [appropriating trans voices in writing] (https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/54djaa/is_this_appropriation_of_trans_voices/) and got some lovely responses from the community. In the post, I noted that I identify with the term ""agender"" yet am not comfortable using the term ""trans."" I'd like to elaborate on that a little, share my feelings, and get some thoughts :)

First of all, biologically, I am female. I have never been very feminine all my life, but neither have I been masculine either. I went through phases of liking unicorns and dresses. Similarly, I've been through phases of liking board sports and action movies and stereotypically ""male"" things. Now, as an adult, I can say I'm quite gender-neutral. I'm not butch, nor do I want to be, and I dress rather androgynously. Button shirts, trousers, rarely dresses, short hair, etc. I've always attributed these traits as being just a not-so-girly girl, but that was before I even knew genderqueer and non-binary identities even existed. Upon learning about NB ids fairly recently, I thought: hey, this sounds like me!

What comes to mind is: I used to do this thing where I ask my friends ""would you rather be a girl or a boy"" and 9/10 of my girl friends who say, without hesitation, that they'd rather remain a girl. To me, this sounded strange. I thought they'd be curious at being a boy. I'm *very* curious about being a boy. If a genie were to let me do my life over and pick a gender, I'd pick boy I think.

I've never wanted breasts. I've always wanted a straight, un-curvy frame. I don't like bras and will wear a sports bra as much as I can. Once, I was interviewing a trans woman for a school project and for the purposes of the assignment asked her to describe what it's like to be trans. She said: ""imagine waking up in the morning in a man's body."" I thought about this and came to the conclusion that I wouldn't mind. In fact, I'd be excited. Yet, I'm not a trans guy. I don't feel the dysphoria trans men describe, the seriousness of it. I'm ok with ""settling"" with my body. It helps that I have a bit of a boyish figure and small breasts, perhaps. 

I reiterated this story to my friend, who said: ""That's what genderqueer is.""

So I guess I'm genderqueer...?

The thing is, when I'm alone in my bedroom I do not think of myself as ""a woman sitting at a desk"" but as ""a person (a genderless blob) sitting on my desk."" Is this what being agender means?

I've also been thinking a lot about pronouns. I think I'm OK with both she/her and they/them. I think of she/her as words pointing to my body, my genitals, my biology, and they/them as pointing to my *mind*. Both, in this sense, are correct. I've even mulled over using she/her in everyday life and using they/them only when it pertains to my writing/artistic work (as writing is a product of my mind). Is this fair?

I also stilllll don't feel comfortable being under the trans umbrella for some reason. I feel with my relative privilege of being comfortable with she/her pronouns and going into women's washrooms and speaking from a woman's point-of-view on feminist issues makes me ""not genderqueer enough"" and thus ""not trans enough.""

Does this make sense? Sorry if this was a long post. I just wanted to express myself and share my thoughts and hopefully get some insight :)

(By the way, I currently use the term ""queer"" as a flexible catch-all to describe both my sexuality and gender identity :) As a biological female I am attracted mostly to females, though my attraction goes all over the gender spectrum as well)"

pangwell,asktransgender,I didn't Recognize Myself As Trans Until Now and It Worries Me,"I know this is a post that has probably been made multiple times already, but I have a little bit of doubt about being trans. It might be a little long, so I don't mind if you skip ahead.

Granted, I started to question the binary™ at around the age of 10 in elementary school, and I started crossdressing at around 16, but there wasn't that immediate connection to wanting to be a girl. Like, I remember distinctly talking to a trans person online when I was 13/14, and she was like ""if you're not 100% certain then you're probably not trans"" and I was like ""yeah maybe I'm not."" That, coupled with being at a private school where I dormed with boys, liked girls, and wanted to fit in with my stylish guy friends, made me think I was a normal cis man who just fetishized being a girl.

Fast forward to a few years ago, and I started identifying as genderfluid in college, which worked to me at the time. Some time in the last month, I suddenly felt like I couldn't present as masculine anymore, and it made me incredibly anxious whenever I put on clothes that made me look boyish. I am uncomfortable with using men's bathrooms and I hate it when people misgender me. Part of it I feel like came from perhaps the stress of being genderfluid: I didn't want to deal with having to inform people every day of what pronouns/name I wanted to use. But I know it's larger than that. 
I am already socially transitioning at college (I describe myself as ""probably trans""), and planning to come out to my parents (I've already made it known to my brother). Still...

I've been on a TedX talks binge for the last few hours and I notice almost all the speakers have had the trend of either discovering that they were trans at a very young age, or being parents who denied the signs from their children until it was basically dropped on them like a sack of bricks. And I keep reading stories online about how people knew straight from the womb. And while I recognize these stories don't de-legitimize my own circumstances, they make me feel a little apprehensive about starting HRT. Am I really a girl? Do I just like the aesthetic? Am I just trying to avoid switching identities and am genderqueer? What's my deal? I definitely want boobs now, and I'm a little upset about down below, and not having hips and long hair, but I'm also worried that what I'm feeling is not the dysphoria trans people generally feel."
privateaccount95,asktransgender,[MTF] What if I have been misinterpreting the signs?,"I feel as though I may be trans, but what if I have been misinterpreting all the signs and it is something completely different? I don't really have much dysphoria, I just think that my current body is kind of disgusting but who wouldn't? I can't really expect it to get better. I don't really know what it means to be a women, so how could I know if that is what I want? There isn't anything interesting about me so what if I am making this up to try to fix that? Make there be something notable about me? "
SlowWovenSleeper,asktransgender,"Just came out, how do I even start?","Yesterday I emailed my father a +1000 word essay detailing way too many things about how I feel about myself and my identity. He's willing to help me but he's sort of in shock at the moment and I'm still unsure of a lot of things.

I'm MtF, early 20s, pre-everything, the usual story. I grew up without any real exposure to non-traditional identities and lifestyles so I'm still learning a lot, but I can say that I've done an astronomical amount of reflection this past year on my thoughts, feelings, and beliefs and I'm confident that transitioning is the path that I need to take.

Right now I'm looking into finding a therapist or counselor because in spite of my confidence, I want someone experienced to help me. If I can't get hormones prescribed I'm willing to self-medicate if it comes to that. I have some issues though; I live in a low income part of Florida, I have no health insurance, I have a job but the pay sucks and I can rarely save money, I probably have an anxiety disorder, I live with my family, and the only women I know are my mother, grandmother, and coworker who are all people that I'm not capable of trusting.

Basically I'm at a loss with a lot of things. How do I learn all the stuff girls learn growing up with appearance, behavior, and social norms? Are there transgender support groups that offer guidance on how to be a woman? Is it possible to just order all my woman stuff online? Can I just join a LGBT commune, work an apprenticeship in a bakery, and have a motherly elderess teach me about clothing and makeup?

I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance. I'm terrified of everything that's been going on inside my mind lately and I just want someone else to make all my decisions for me."

Blairnatalie,asktransgender,"relationship with Mother dearest, your input.","Here comes a wall of text, I do apologize but it does give insight to my issue at hand.

So to start things off I came out as a transwoman at the age of 22, around 9 months back. I'm 23 now, and 4.5 months Into my transition. For some back story I've been on my own since the age of 17/18, I moved out by choice from a shitty home life. That's thanks to my mom and her shitty boyfriend. I left quite abruptly and a fight in sued that day. 

Now fast forward to the age of 20/21. My mom and I have had some contact, she had been in the hospital a few years prior, and my brother had passed away a year after that. So I felt the need to keep in touch with my parents solely for support. Despite me finding him, I couldn't imagine what it would be like to lose a kid, and I felt horrible about the situation. Needless to say our relationship was getting better... slowly. 

Now fast forward to 9 months ago, I made a FB post about my coming out. I'm fairly introverted so this was the best way at the time. I went ahead and told my mother separately, and she well lost her shit. I'll never forget these words, but the first thing she said was ""I'm balling my eyes out"", ""both of my kids are dead"". Obviously a fight in sued, and I felt I had been fighting for my right to be noticed. I ended it by saying  ""if you can't accept your kid for who she is, then we have no business with each other"" and that was that for a few months. 

2 months into HRT I contact her and to say happy mothers day, and we talk a little. She says she's sorry, which to be honest I don't believe. I tell her she should add my new fb so we can keep in touch regardless. She goes ahead and makes a second account and adds me claiming ""she doesn't want to be hounded by questions"" I take this as she's embarrassed.

To this day we talk very little, and when she comments on my stuff it's always 100% negativity. It's gotten to the point where I just ignore it. I'm sorry but she was barely there for my teenage life, and wasn't there for me when I grew up into a full fledged adult at the age of 17 (partly my doing, however a kid should never feel they need to leave home in my opinion). 

I saw her on the bus a few weeks back after work, I was still in half my uniform, hair tied up, exhausted from dealing with patients for 12 hours, so I didn't really realise it till afterwards. But she didn't even bat an eye, or say hi, and completely avoided me.

So what's everyone's opinion on this? I'm seeing my dad in a week, and I'm pretty sure he has no clue about me. I am scared shit less of telling him because he has a way more conservative way of thought compared to my mother. I won't tell him next week, I'll likely wait until it's super ovbious... but changes are taking place quick, like at 4.5 months I fit an A cup, and my face has feminised quite a bit. Also my hips, woah, those blew up quick lol.

 And once again sorry for the wall of text, but what's your opinion on this relationship I have with my mother? How should I approach her moving forward. "
awesomepaigegirl,asktransgender,Trans or not Trans... my thougts. Possibly NSFW.,"I’m making the decision that I am Trans because more often than not, for the past five or six months, I feel I am.  But there are times where I feel my normal self that I’ve always been and during those times it makes things difficult.  I’m writing this more for myself, but I feel it may help someone in their discovery, so please, if you have any thoughts post them in the comments!  For the record I am a 31 year old MTF and pre-everything.

Part of the reason it took me until I was 30 to come to the realization that I might be Trans, and why it’s been such a difficult process of discovery is that being a man has never really been an issue in my life.  Like many of you I don’t follow the narrative of knowing since my youth.  I loved being outside and I love my Ninja Turtles and video games (though I never cared for GI: Joe).  My mother dressed me in boys clothes and I wore the clothes she provided.  But at this age, for me at least, I mostly just focused on being entertained.  I was a boy because they said I was and I had no reason to question it.

My mother has always been the only girl in the house along with my brother, father and myself.  We also moved a lot and in the neighborhoods there never were many girls so I didn’t get a lot of interaction with girls in my youth.   My father was and is very handy, a trait I didn’t seem to inherit.  He never had me help him when he was doing things like working on the car and I never had any interest in watching or helping, though if he asked/ told me I would of course, however reluctantly.  When I was eight or nine I remember seeing a talk show that had a transgendered woman as a guest and I don’t remember what they were talking about as I was too focused at looking at her completely amazed at how this apparent man looked like such a pretty woman.

By the time I was 13 I had developed an attraction to girls but I was very overweight which killed my self-esteem so I was much too shy to talk to them.   So I would just talk with my fellow guys though even then my friend circle has always been small, do my school work and when I got home I’d watch cartoons/play video games until bedtime.  Rinse and repeat.  My years in high school were pretty much the same.  I rarely had any interaction with girls and my nights were spent watching tv or gaming.  My senior year my Aunt once asked me why I was home on a Friday night and I responded by asking her ‘what else would I be doing?’

My point in saying all of this that I believe my late realization is that I’ve had little interaction with women in my life in particular, and people as a whole in general.  This lack of interaction has made it difficult for me to be in a situation where I might feel more like a girl than a boy.  Honestly most of my life has been me not really doing much at all, masculine or feminine.

I can only think of a few examples that could have been some sort of sign.  When I was 17 I was hanging out with a friend and his girlfriend.  He and his girlfriend were in the bathroom and he called out for something, I don’t know if he’d asked me a question or needed something.  Either way I walked over to the bathroom and saw him shaving his forearms.  This took me by surprise, a guy shaving anything besides his face, but for some reason I was drawn to the idea.  Though this is something I wouldn’t actually try until after I graduated.  I really wanted to try it but I had no idea why and was afraid of what people would think.  When I finally did I loved the feeling of my forearms being so smooth.

The other example is from the same time period and one night my mother was in the living room applying clear nail polish and I just really wanted her to paint my nails and saw this as a way to try it out safely since it was clear and no one would know.  It was around this same age that I discovered transsexual porn.  I had only been viewing porn for maybe three years at this point and it was always hetero-porn.  But when I saw this, in my opinion, beautiful woman, who to my understanding at the time was not, was a huge turn on to me.  This would be the third time seeing a trans woman, the first time from that talk show and the second time when I was 13 staying up late on a Saturday night watching an episode of Real Sex on HBO I think, real late at night.

This would start me on my long road of watching transsexual porn and feeling ashamed of it, worried someone would catch me one day.  I was worried watching this porn was making me gay.  I was so confused.  I liked women, obviously that was what was attracting me to trans-women, but I started to fantasize about being with one and having her penetrate me.  Which eventually just changed to me fantasizing about being penetrated by men which confused me more because I didn’t really feel attracted to men, watching gay porn didn’t turn me on, but fantasizing about being penetrated by men turned me on.  Also, it didn’t happen often but what would really do it for me was when the planets aligned in my brain so to speak, and it’s hard to describe accurately, but I was fully able to realize that this trans person was a woman and her “backdoor” was her “vagina” the fact that she had a penis in this moment never even factored in.  In this moment I was putting myself in her mind set and experiencing sex from her point of view. And I did on a few occasions contemplate what it would be like to become a transsexual.  I liked the idea of looking like this sexy woman who can have sex with a man as a woman or with a woman as a man, but I usually shrugged it off as a silly thought.  That would be a bad idea, I’m obviously only in this for sexual reasons.  Real transgender people have known since birth and are attracted to only men, and are doing it for more than sexual reasons.

Then fast forward to ten or eleven years later.  I have yet to have a girlfriend, which gives me constant sadness, I’ve been on a few dates but they never go anywhere as I don’t know what I’m doing apparently, and my only sexual release causes me constant shame.  This all gets cranked up to high gear when I discover sissy porn.  This just adds to my shame and confusion, because up until this time I had kind of come to terms with my transsexual porn habit.  I’d looked it up countless times and read that it was very common for a straight male to like it.  No, now I was exposed to captioned images or animated gifs of men being sissified.  Though I never liked the ones where the man was forced into it against his will.  I enjoyed the stories of the man who dresses up as a woman for one reason or another and ends up finding out how much he likes being screwed as a woman.  Or even better where the man is magically changed into a woman and eventually gives in to these new female urges.

I also found sissy hypno around the time as well and even though I don’t believe in hypnosis, or at least that these videos have any actual hypnotic abilities.  I like watching them and it scared me because deep down I was starting to realize I wanted to the videos to work.  I wanted to be more feminine and act girly and while I didn’t like the serving men aspect, the idea of being submissive appealed to me.

Eventually I decided I wanted to embrace being a sissy.  I watched hypnos, I bought a chastity devise I tried to learn to climax from using a dildo in my ass.  Which I never accomplished but I did reach these full body like orgasms from stimulating my prostate that I love getting because they make me feel feminine on top of feeling really good.  I don’t remember how the conversation went, but one day while browsing some sissy sub-reddit someone made a comment telling someone why they might be transgender and it hit me like a ton of bricks that I might be trans.  It was so bad that I couldn’t go to work or sleep for three days.  It was on my mind all day and night.  I was confused and I was terrified.  But I was also kind of excited at the thought that I could become a woman after all.  That eventually led me to here where I ended up creating this account and making my first post.  This started on my still ongoing self-discovery.

There are times like I said earlier, where I feel “normal”.  In these moments I think of the thought of me transitioning and I’m not sure I should.  But yet I still feel compelled to experiment with cross dressing and makeup.   I wear women’s clothing but I don’t feel right yet, mostly because I’m morbidly obese and don’t like my body male or female.  I have found that I really like makeup and with practice I can get myself to a place where I see a girl in the mirror, I may not look like one to an outside observer but I see one in my eyes and the last time I did I was hit with a feeling of happiness I didn’t know was possible and this made me realize that I’ve never actually been happy before.  I’ve just managed to live my life not sad, if that makes any sense.  I’ve had moments of sadness and I've had moments of contentment but not actually happiness.  When I put on women’s clothing I only see a man and I look silly.  But when I put on makeup I see a girl.  This is why I know I am trans, I may never been very girly but I know that seeing a woman in the mirror makes me happy and those times when I feel “normal” are just me feeling not sad.

shininasai,asktransgender,"After you out and transitioned, who still cares about your life now?","Hi everyone, who cares about your life, after you transitioned? This has to be people who genuinely care about you. Your exhusband? Your current wife? Some unbelieveable long old friend without contact? Share the joy?


I ask this because I found that I must have lived a life so wrong. I told a friend I got divorced, and he said get a drink, and forgot about it and went to have his own family celebration of some sort. I told a great friend and she finds that I am too negative and stopped messaging recently. I told a religious friend and she laments the shit I am in. I feel like no one really cares about most other people now, and of course me included. People growing up is scary. They may care if you really did commit suicide, but only due to the inconvenience that you are introducing some unexpected events in life, and no one would knock on the door randomly to see how you do. So I ask myself, who cares about me? I've had trouble finding out any.

I hope the others have more positive answers for us to hint us to a brighter future."
MxMusician,asktransgender,"Transgender isn't about gender roles, right?","Everywhere I go it seems people keep basing transgender dysphoria off of feminine/masculine personality traits or traditional gender roles in order to invalidate transgender people, but what I keep basing it off is what you'd prefer your body to look like and/or which community you feel best represented by or comfortable with. Seeing people saying that because they play sports but don't identify as male or they can wear dresses but don't need to be a transwoman means transgender people are just silly and don't exist keeps bothering me - I feel sometimes the majority must be right and I'm just stupid but surely the people saying transgender people aren't right must be wrong, right?

RabidRadish,asktransgender,How does asktransgender get employed?,"I am 26 years-old MtF, completely passing, legal name, though my ID still says Male. I have NEVER been employed. Ever.

Sarah-RT,asktransgender,For those questioning but all input welcome,"Hey everyone, I kind of bounce in and out of this forum as my mood goes up and down so if this has been posted I apologise.

To skip any introductions and back story to keep it short;

Do you think the questioning aspect can be relieved under certain circumstances?

For example, with me, my brain fires 'what's ifs' and 'could be's' at me literally all day. for the last 9 months my brain is being bombarded by it that I get moody, suicidal ideation(more from an inability to tolerate it rather than a lack of will to live, I don't feel depressed, I want to live, I just don't know how anymore) And it leads me to dislike myself so for example a thought would enter my mind such as 'if I was female I would be much more social because 'blah blah blah' I then start acknowledging Where I lack in social aspects and feel down about it, I do that with my appearance, hobbies or lack there of an so forth because these invasive thoughts are comparing forced thought up 'could be's' to perhaps unfulfilment.

Moving on, I question whether I am actually *transgender* or something has happened to my brain and its feeding me bizarre negatives. I don't recall ever doing the idealised 'known from a young age' or praying to god I'd wake up female. I've a very vague and not exact memory of when I regularly crossdressed as a teen of going to bed presenting as female and hoping I'd wake up female but I can't recall exactly and question if that's truth or wishful thinking. So while I don't believe I am female trapped I think more like I could be female, and I like the idea of it and it could potentially relieve some of my issues in life.

Now to the original question, under certain circumstances could this questioning stop? If say You became ship wrecked On a deserted island without a gender stimulus and no social context would your brain begin to forget about it in the same way you may forget how a friend looks or an ex partner given enough time?
I'm wondering this in the hopes of comparing whether you would just know you are physically wrong or is it based off of a comparison to the opposite gender? 
I know this is quite 'fantastical' but a lot of people's stories here often feature being triggered by something.
If there were no triggering stimuli would a person know they were wrong if they had no idea what was right?

I thought I would add a little of a backstory/intro to the end for anyone still reading but basically I went to counselling for 9 months or so for gender issues. (Here in Ireland there is no informed consent clinics, it's a long winded route to transition medically and I believe only the most dysphoric people reach the end). I visited a psychologist as a result in the hopes of starting the HRT process as I felt at the time it was something I wanted to do despite the drawbacks etc, I also felt which was influenced from here from the talk of informed consent that I could try HRT medication and then I would KNOW if I was on the right path, a baptism by fire so to speak.
The psychologist seemed like he felt I had some gender dysphoria issues and suggested aiming for anti androgens to begin with to ease myself in(due to my hesitation) might be a start. 
He eased my mind towards trying to have facial hair removal because of the doubts that many questioning people have. I felt if I had all my facial hair removed and came to the conclusion that I wasn't transgender I'd have made an irreversible mistake and felt I wouldn't be able to live with myself for screwing up.
I booked a hair removal consultation but discovered that they'd only be able to remove 50% due to the lighter hairs. After that I stopped going to counselling and tried to forget all about the idea of transition. I even felt I had tricked the psychologist even though I tried very hard with my counsellor to not sound generic in the sense that I wasn't sure what was happening to me and there was no clear cut way to help, only potential possibilities.

A few months later and I'm here again, my mind crumbling under the thoughts yet again after avoiding anything to do with gender questioning, I felt fine for about a week before it creeped back in and now I'm debating have electrolysis done and emailing the psychologist about organising anti androgens, I've started going to sleep presenting as female again and I'm beginning to not be able to cope and I just don't know what to do.
I went through a period before thinking I had OCD, depression, bi polar disorder, anything under the sun to explain why I'm doing abnormal things for my gender and just not 'thinking' normally like I perceive everyone else to be doing (what is normal? I know but I feel like an internal mess in comparison to my friends and strangers on the street). I thought maybe it was a fetish or a porn addiction so I stopped masterbating. I've thought about everything and I'm running out of excuses to explain what's wrong so I've begun smoking heavily and I'm beginning to drink by myself to avoid drinking in bars with my friends because I get jealous of other girls which opens the flood gates of my brain

So my question directs at would it be possible to not feel this way if there were not a triggering stimulus?"
CrocodileGirlMika,asktransgender,Equal levels of E and T (AMAB),"At the time of my last blood test I was on 100mg spiro 2mg estradiol, and my T was ~500ng/dl and my E was ~200ng/dl. These are both within the appropriate range for either sex. My doctor was confused as to why I would have these levels in the first place, considering a low dose of estradiol, and still having significant testosterone, which normally dominates over estrogen. Her assumption was just that I more readily metabolize estradiol, but she would talk to someone with more endocrinology experience.

jenn4u,asktransgender,How to get smaller?,"So I found out definitively that I was trans about 3 months ago and decided I wanted to change how I look before I began HRT. In June i weighed close to 320 and 30% body fat now I am down to 280 and about 21% body fat. If you do the numbers that's about a 3 lb loss of muscle/lean body mass out of a ton. I have not worked out since that time but have been doing a lot of long distance cardio work. My chest is also the same 48 inches it was when I first started. I honestly wanted to start HRT when I got down to around 240-230 but I don't know now. I still have a lot of fat to lose which is coming off very slowly nowadays and would be much harder to lose if I start HRT. But it feels like if I don't start HRT I wont lose the muscle I want to, in my arms and chest area. Suggestions? 

Edit: I am dieting as well and currently at 1500 calories. (thanks Brinaboo)"
[deleted],asktransgender,Endocrinological advise,"Hi ,

I would really love to have some advice on this :

I just went to my new doctor and they have a completely different view than the previous one.

I have been taken off of progesterone because my doctor says it unnecessarily increases risks.

I have been taken off of patches and gel and put on Progynova 4 mg daily. 


She is of the opinion that I need to stop taking anti-androgens and that they are bad for the liver. She said that estrogen will also decrease T sufficiently.

I was on anti-androgens for 3 months and she says it's more than long enough .

What do you think of it?

I'm unsure what to think ."
LorenaDal2016,asktransgender,Is this normal...(changes in dysphoria),"Right before I started HRT I was a wreck... HRT even at low doses (1 mg of estrogen and 50 mg of spironolactone) made me feel different within a week.... Over the last 4.5 months the dose has been gradually increased to 2 mg of estrogen and 200 mg of spironolactone (and the spiro dose will go up in the next 2-4 weeks). Over the first 3-4 months I have felt progressively calmer and better... But for the last 2 weeks I have been feeling increasingly dysphoric about my body...I had some physical dysphoria before but my main issue was my brain (and the constant state of short circuit)...and that has improved...but now my body and the slow progress (maybe from my perspective) is starting to drive me nuts again...it is just a different type of anxiety. I am expecting too much from just 4.5 months of treatment? My E level was right at 50 a few weeks ago, and my testosterone was 73, down from 571 before HRT, and my free testosterone was at 0.84, down from 7.9 and at that time I was still 150 mg of spironolactone.

f30bim,asktransgender,Hip/pelvis growth while on HRT,"Hey guys,

I have been on HRT for 7 months so far and I started just before my 19th birthday. My hips have grown very slightly in width and they still feel like all bone. I have really aggressive stretch marks on my upper thighs, hips and butt. When I sit down with my legs facing forward, my hips look almost as wide as my shoulders. I know that in many cis girls, their hips are much wider than their shoulders when they sit down due to the size of their pelvis and fat surrounding it. I still look slightly awkward in jeans because my hips are just so narrow.
I would consider myself a late bloomer for a male because I just started growing facial hair at age 18 and I still had new stretch marks on my arms and legs right before HRT, indicating that I probably wasn't done growing yet.
Looking at some other trans women that started hormones around 18-19, it seems as if they don't have feminine looking hips. Their hips look way too small for their body.

What can I expect in terms of the pelvis itself changing shape? I don't expect huge hips like Kim Kardashian, but I would like to obtain a pretty natural looking female hip that's almost the same width as my shoulders. You know, kind of like the average skinny girl you see every day with a distinctly feminine yet skinny body, kind of like a Selena Gomez or Rihanna body shape.
I'm mostly concerned because my shoulders aren't wide by any means, but my extremely narrow hips kind of makes my body look disproportionate for a girl. "

I must say that I'm toying with the idea .

Now is my question : would I continue the hormones for my mental health and stop expecting physical results or would I stop hormones all together and let T come back?

I feel that I would at least have less worries if I was going back to male and completely detransition.
I would restore contact with my family,... 

Transitioning is good for folks with good genes ,... 
But if your face and voice are nothing near where they should be it isn't going to do wonders.

I might retransition in a few years when I will be able to afford FFS. Without FFS it's hopeless.

SelfLoathing91,asktransgender,I know HRT is different for everyone but.. This is kind of freaking me out? exciting me? I have no idea....,"So I went to see my Doctor on the 10th of August to start HRT, and I started on well you can see the 18th(Complications with my pharmacy) Ever since then I've been instructed to take 1 mg estradiol sublingual and 100 mg spiro every day, once a day.

When I was checked out first for my health issues on the prior visit done on the 3rd, I believe.. My doctor said it was good and nice that I already had breast tissue developed(I'm in the healthy weight range for my height and build.) She also stated that everything else looked good so I was good to start next visit.

My starting T levels were diagnosed as 478 ng/dL and my starting Estradiol levels were put as 36.0 pg/mL. I told her I did minor DIY with herbs in the past and some brain frequency stuff but I cut that out by a year of my first visit.

Fortunately for me, my mother and father are accepting of me being trans.. and it was my mother who pointed out to me yesterday. Yes, I didn't notice anything myself.. long story short? I also suffer from delusions to the point where I hallucinate myself as this extremely masculine man with flaws I don't even have in reality. (Not fun.)

Anyways, my mother got annoyed with me and told me a lady my age shouldn't be going around with her breasts exposed. Now at the time, THIS really confused me cause I was like, but I'm.. almost as flat as a board? Now just to clarify, I'm full time so my wardrobe is already updated and I was not shirtless but I was wearing a low cut tank and obviously no chest support.

Well, I tried to get some other opinions.. now ASKING PEOPLE like, hey are my boobs getting bigger? Is literally some of the most awkward side topic stepping I've had to do in my entire life. Managed to get a confirmed consensus of.. Yeah, your boobs are getting bigger. Plus, had to get past my delusions and feel.. my shirts are poking out more despite me not physically seeing them. Granted pretty sure my areola haven't changed size but I'm delusional so who knows.

When I was talking with my doctor about the effects of HRT on my body, she stated that the effects are different for everyone but breast growth is usually several months in. Softening of the skin, features is some of the first things to happen and that's what hasn't happened to me.

I.. kind of plan to ask my doctor when I check up with her in about 2 months but I'm honestly scared. On the same hand, I'm also happy? I have no idea what I should be feeling right now...

TL;DR : Basically I'm only about a bit over 2 weeks on HRT and the first change noticed was my breasts are getting bigger. I started with small boobs, moobs whatever you want to call them but they got bigger. I don't know whether I should be scared or happy. This is also the only change so far... and I don't think the areola have gotten any bigger?"

mamory-,asktransgender,I think I might be trans but I don't know what to do about it (Long),"So first off - I'm 14 and a half and have been diagnosed with severe OCD by my therapist just as a note. I've been taking medication for it but it obviously doesn't make it just disappear. I was born male and I'm questioning being female


So basically, first off. I'm not completely sure I'm trans and do kind of want a second opinion. 

For all of my life I've felt something wasn't right. I never really liked my name and when I would imagine my future I was able to but didn't really feel great about it. For a few years I used to escape to a fantasy land in my head with people I made up (All male, which is kind of interesting.) but none of those things ever felt great to me either. For a while I got into crossdressing stuff (Around maybe 12 and a half or something) although never did it myself. At the time I just brushed it off as a fetish. I never really felt happy after childhood, I had a really short temper and was depressed a lot of the time. I figured out that I was attracted to solely men in this time period also. At one point (december of 2015) I thought I had figured out that I was trans, but I went back and decided I was a gay male after not too long because I thought I had figured out wrong. In april of this year I started constantly worrying about gender and actually realized that it was my OCD that was making me constantly worry, and blamed the gender confusion on it. In around June of this year I also thought I had figured out I was trans...again. This time it stuck for a month or so until august when I thought I had figured out wrong...again. 

This brings us to now (How soon is now?) where I've been thinking about it again, and this time OCD hasn't been fueling it because as I mentioned above (Well, I think I did) I've been taking medication for my OCD. I decided to add everything back together, young childhood memories and all and decided that yes, I am probably trns (and I hope I don't back out again), but I',m still not *sure* on it.

But either way, at my age and with my parents in a conservative state that Donald Trump won, I won't be able to transition for years. I plan to talk about this stuff with my therapist when I see her next week, but I really don't know what to do with all of this or how to express myself as transgender."

I tried one of my dress shirts and it looked like I stole it from my boyfriend (if I had one..), in fact, I could wear it as a dress now. I tried a fitted one and my boobs show through.

TheresNoRightOrWrong,asktransgender,Finding a Gender Specialist,"After talking with my doctor for 2 months about finding a gender specialist in my area, he had finally told me that he was going to contact people.

So I wasted another 2 months, he finally called me. The next next thing he said was the very thing that I had feared. He said that the people that he talked had said that they won't see me until I'm 18.

Now I'm just wondering if would be possible to find a gender specialist without my doctor.

Country: Canada
Province: British Columbia

Sorry for the spelling. I'm on mobile and sprained my wrist.

EDIT: I may need to clarify that during most of the year I'm in the interior and during the spring and summer is really the only time I'm in the lower mainland.
The reason I said that I was in the lower mainland us because there's more there on terms of medical help.

AgnosticThalassocnus,asktransgender,"As a transwoman living in the South, how much hatred should I expect? How much hatred have you experienced where you live?","Background Information: I am 2 months away from turning 20, and I have been on estrogen and t-blockers for a little over 6 months. I am about 5' 5"" and soon to be about 130 lbs. Overall, I got pretty lucky. I have feminine hands, small feet, great hair, feminine facial features, and most of my weight is below the waist, so HRT is going pretty well. I haven't even started part-time yet and I get gendered correctly more often than not, until I open my mouth. I'm currently working on my weight, voice, and makeup skills and I'm pretty happy with my progress. I plan on starting full-time by next semester.

I was born and raised in northeastern Texas, which is pretty much like the Mid-West but slightly more conservative. After graduating from high school, I attended what I would come to discover was (literally) the most conservative and least LGBT-friendly large college in America (Gig'em...). After about 6 months of Hell, I came out to my conservative Christian parents and withdrew. I was terrified, but they surprised me. They left their Southern Baptist church for a LGBT-friendly one and my mother decided to attend a trans discussion group as part of her residency to become a psychologist. I've experienced nothing but love and acceptance from all of my friends and family members. I know I'm extremely lucky, but it was honestly a huge surprise following a lifetime of fear and doubt. I was accepted into the most liberal college in the state (Hook'em!) in the most liberal city. I'm an honor student with a plan to attend grad school internationally. While transitioning is very important to me, it is not my entire life.

So back to my question. I feel that I have been spoiled. That my experience has jaded me and that I may be shocked to discover the true depths of human bigotry once I go part-time, full-time, and even once I go completely stealth. How cautious should I be? What should I expect? What sort of hardships have you faced that I probably will as well? I just don't want to build up these unrealistic expectations of human nature and be massively disappointed. "

KLC_R_VD,asktransgender,Looking for advice on coming out and transitioning at work...,"[tl;dr I'm so close to being full-time except for at work. I want/need to come out and transition at work soon and I'm looking for suggestions from others' own experiences and/or just general advice in the following two areas:
1) I'm feeling totally overwhelmed by the size of my department (1500+) and coming out to the large number of people that I regularly work with both internally and externally.
2) I'm not sure who in my office to talk to about this first, options are primarily: an HR rep, my team leader, a coworker or two who could possibly be an ally.]

A little bit about me and some background: I'm a mid-twenties transfemme and have been out to my closest friends for a year and a half. I've been transitioning since January and have been living out and as myself with amazingly supportive roommates since March, and my transition has been speeding up significantly since then (started HRT in late April). About two months ago I came out to my extended family (did not go well at all, but I'm dealing with it pretty well considering) and then a few days later I came out to my extended friend groups on Facebook to an overwhelmingly positive response of love and support. Except for work, I'm full-time now.

So that obviously leaves transitioning at work as the only thing left stopping me from being full-time, which both excites and terrifies me!! I've been at this job for two years (as of next week), working at a large university in Boston, so I'm not particularly worried about the culture or general acceptance being a problem. I'm in a very fast-paced and intense executive department where I currently work for two different executives and a finance director, and work with well over 100 different people on a consistent and regular basis and many, many more on an infrequent basis. While I technically report to the two executives, I'm directly supervised/managed by my team leader, who I work very well with and we are friendly.

As I said at the top, I'm hoping for advice from your own experiences but I welcome anything you have to contribute!! I am most focused on these two things:

1) I feel totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of people I will need to come out to and how I'll manage that process. Given that the three departments I am currently working with have over 1500 people in them combined, an e-mail announcement just doesn't seem like the right approach but I can't really figure out how else to do this. I also work with a large number of external groups so that is something else adding to my anxiety. Has anyone had similar experiences in this type of setting? What seemed to be the best way for you to handle/deal with the process of repeatedly coming out to and reminding so many people?

2) I'm uncertain who in my office I should talk to about this first. I think I've narrowed it down to either an HR rep who works in our office, a couple of my direct coworkers who could possibly be allies, or my team leader, who I am pretty sure would react to this fairly well. I know a lot of this depends on the people themselves and how I expect them to respond, but I'm wondering what has been the best route for others, or if you could have done something differently, what would that have been?

Thanks in advance everyone :)

transterrified,asktransgender,"I need help/advice! Came out to my mom recently, have a doctors appointment tomorrow and everything just feels too real now.","Hey /r/asktg,

So to start off, I'm 22 and mtf, and I came out to my mom about a week and a half ago. She took it pretty well, really as well as I could've hoped. She's been super supportive and says she only wants whatever is best for me. We talked about it and made an appointment for me at a semi-local university hospital that has a trans health clinic for teens and young adults. It sounds like a good place, I'm lucky its nearby enough to get to go. They offer pretty comprehensive care (hormones, therapy, mental health treatment, surgery referrals, almost everything).

So the thing is, I've been taking hormones DIY for the last 4 months or so. Moderate dose (100mg spiro 3mg estradiol daily), and I can definitely feel and have seen results (I don't know my levels yet, I know, stupid). Anyway, I guess I know I have to tell them that I've been DIYing, but can anyone attest to whether that hurts chances for getting hormones, or how doctors might react? I don't want to screw this up.

It's just all too much. My mom was pretty easy to talk to and we have a very close relationship, but now I have to come out to my dad sometime in the near future (he's a great guy but we don't talk about this type of thing ever really and I have no idea what his opinion of trans people is). I know my brother is supportive at least, though I haven't told him yet, but he's said many things in the past that make me pretty positive. Ugh, sorry for the wall of text, this is probably a disorganized mess. I'm just sitting here having a panic attack not knowing what I'm going to tell the doctor tomorrow.

And while its allowed me to be truthful to myself I find it incredibly difficult to move in any direction. Like if I were to do anything one way or the other I'm somehow losing apart of me.
In the end I battle with this feeling of inadequacy on both sides everyday. Its starting to wear on me so much. I'm really starting to wonder how long I can hold up. How much longer can one do this before they decide its enough?

ConfusedKitty122,asktransgender,Where do I go from here? I still feel trapped (followup for a post from a week ago),"Heya, like the title suggests, this post is a followup to a post I made a week ago on another account which has since been deleted. Sorry that I can't link to it anymore, but thats because my therapist somehow found it when it was still up. Since the post contained mentions of suicidal thoughts, he had to let my parents know I was posting suicidal stuff online and they took me out of school for a week. I'll try to make this one a little more upbeat even though theres not a whole lot of happy stuff to be found here.

**what happened in the original post?**

Basically, in that post I talked about how I had originally came out to my parents as a transgirl about half a year ago, but eventually decided not to transition just before the scholar ended in order to preserve my relationship with my family (cause at the end of the day, I still love them and don't want to make their lives anymore difficult) and also to try and live a normal lifestyle. I've wanted to be a girl since I was very little, but I would easily let this all just be a pipe dream if it weren't for my dysphoria, which is extremely life crippling. I basically told everyone my issues magically went away when they didn't, and ever since I've been trying to put on a happy face and just make it through life as to not cause any complications. I tried to find alternative methods of curing my dysphoria, which really boiled down to just forcing the gender critical mindset upon myself. That worked for a while, and it might have worked if if I didn't have constant horrible effects of my dysphoria involuntarily beating down on me every day.

**What is your dysphoria like?**

The symptoms I have are mostly physical in nature; I really don't like my male biology and the masculine features I have really drive me up a wall with sadness. Heck, even writing the phrase ""my masculine features"" just now made me a little sick to my stomach. Everything I want to look like is in stark contrast with what path being a guy takes me down. About a month ago for instance, when I was allowing myself to at least be a femboy, I went into my sisters room to find some cute shirts, sweaters, pants, and pajamas to keep for myself; Caught one accidental glimpse of myself in the mirror, and the total mental separation between how I expected myself to look vs. how I actually looked completed ravaged me.  All in all, it mostly leads me to wallow in depression and self-hate while sitting in my bed all day. I don't want to go outside and be social, because I feel uncomfortable presenting myself to people (and I also kinda hate my dorky masculine sounding voice; opening my mouth in general is not a fun time for me). 

**What happened since the original post?**

So, since that original post i was sent home from school for a week (I go to boarding school), and had to explain away a reason for why that was the case. I wasn't able to tell them what was really going on in my head, because I really didn't want to reopen that can of worms, so I lied and told them it was just an issue of homesickness and being afraid to fail classes which caused me to feel suicidal. I know if I bring up my dysphoria again, my parents are just gonna be extremely annoyed that its still an issue. When I first came out to them, my dad got in touch with Paul Mchugh, a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, whose like one of the only of his degree to publicly go out and call being trans a mental illness. On that front, i'm fairly convinced that my dad is unchanging in his beliefs, now that he has someone with credentials who shares his way of thinking. My mom knows this still bugs me, and she understands at least somewhat that this isn't so much a selfish desire, but rather something that causes me significant mental distress. She also just kinda wants me to ""get through this tough time"" so she isn't exactly full of bright ideas on how to actually get me help. And finally, my therapist knows that this is bugging me still, but really all he's done so far is just talk to me about not feeling well and then made some analogy about us both being on a boat during a storm. Needless to say I don't exactly think he knows what to do to help me, and I don't think much of anything is gonna get done with his help alone. 

**Where I need your help**

So i've returned to school, and the only thing I've been given in terms of actual help has been anti-depressants. Lexipro I think, 5 mg? once daily. I dunno if this is gonna help me, maybe in the short term, but its definitely not a long term solution. Honestly I don't even know about HRT at this point; Its something I want but its not going to really make me the person I wish I was from day 1, nevertheless its a lot better than the poison that is T (sorry my Transbrethren). Every day is a incredible struggle to get through and I don't know if I have the energy to go to school and be attentive in every class. Im away from home, and I don't exactly have a swift path to something that'd make me feel better soon. I feel like everyone around me is just kinda ignoring my feelings and frankly isn't willing to actually help me out; I haven't even been given any alternatives besides 3 weeks of intensive psychotherapy, a couple of anti-depressant pills, or most commonly, ""Just be brave, you'll get through this.""

So, what is a guy/gal/confused person like myself to do when I've got literately no options left to take?

TotallyNotAntiChrist,asktransgender,3 years later: thank you asktransgender.,"Three years ago my best friend was struggling with wanting to be transgender or not and had been going on and off hormones. I didn't know at the time but she was also suicidal. Nervous, out of place, shy and self conscious I came here to ask for help (on a very different account) and took what was said to heart.

3 years later my best friend is going back to college in two weeks as a female and she will be my maid of honor. 

The statements that stuck with me over the years: the brutally honest facts that were explained to me. Having concrete facts and information gave me a place to start an action plan. Hearing opinions, some of which were totally counter to each other helped give background and fleshed out how I wanted to proceed with my best friend in helping her become the happy, geeky granola girl she has always been and letting her gather courage, step forth, open up and shine to the world. 

I have had the honor of going clothes shopping together, standing up for herself, and the one she was worried most about: bigots. We showed them. She showed them. Seeing her get to a point where she wants to talk about her journey so she can help others.

Know this: your words are taken to heart when people come here looking for answers. Know that what you say has meaning and it impacts people even if you don't see a tangible benefit like karma. Your words reach so many people, and what you say and who you are, your unique perspective matter and can touch others deeply. 

This subreddit saved my friend. 

Thank you."
A_Cool_Bear,asktransgender,Clarification on gender innate vs learned,"I've heard two different arguments that both kinda make sense but also totally conflict

1: gender is a social construct. We are told what women are and what men are. This shapes how we behave and ultimately creates gender. Women do not have an innate draw to dresses or makeup or stereotypically female things.

2: Transgender people are born in the ""wrong body"" for their gender identity. Upon birth, they are already going to be the opposite gender because of the structuring of the brain.

I'm not trying to offend anyone. I was raised by bigots and I'm trying to learn about other perspectives now that I'm away from them at college and meeting new people."
Kannoss,asktransgender,Looking for support in a situation i can't talk to anyone about yet.,"I am 16 and pre-hrt and have only come out to 1 person (my best friend).

So i have been playing a game alot recently and have been really enjoying it. I made a really good friend who i simply told i was female. Later on i trusted her and told her that i am trans (second person to know) and took it really well and was really supportive and gave me reassurance and tips and our friendship continued.

 But today, we were joking around with another friend where she wanted to marry him and have his kids and things and i was competing with her for him (i am fond one of his characters). Another friend started marrying them when she got kicked from the server for spamming and I took that as my chance to marry him &gt;:). But when she came back she was mad and told everyone that ""I can't marry him because im not even a real girl"". As soon as she said it my mood was killed and i began crying. This was all in the heat of the moment and she then went to try and play it off that she was joking. But even after i privately confronted her about it she wouldn't apologize and just made excuses saying that noone saw and it didn't matter. 

She then gave me the option that i could either block her or just put it behind us. Thinking it over it seems silly but it still really hurts because I trusted her with something very important to me and she would throw a remark like that in a silly little roleplaying thing.

I just feel completely betrayed by someone i thought i could trust. How can i tell her what she did really hurt me and I want an apology? What should i do? Do i block her? we are still close, i know her sister and her kids as well."
Daughter_of_Discord,asktransgender,Can I get a little bit of outside perspective on this? (questioning &amp; relationships),"(warning: information overload imminent)

I've managed to go and make my life so complicated in such a short amount of time.

I'm pretty certain that I am transgender, and for the past month or so I had been fairly certain that transitioning might be the best option.

I came out to my wife of 10 faithful years. She had known about my crossdressing and gender-questioning for the past 6. Our relationship was suffering terribly for it. I talked to my psychiatrist and she nudged me to finally confront it. I told her that a transition was not out of the question, but I hadn't committed to a decision yet. Within 3 weeks I was moving into a new home after she expressed her feelings on it. We have 2 kids who know and are generally accepting.

I live in a very rural community. Population: 5000. Juicy controversy travels fast, so I felt like I needed to cover my ass faster. In a panic, I came out to my boss, a handful of co-workers, my close family, some friends, and everyone was supportive.

As expected, the word got around, but it hasn't gone over nearly as poorly as I feared... or maybe it has...

I talked to my wife's brother and his fiancee about it. My wife and her brother hadn't been on the best of terms lately because of internal family controversy. My wife and her brother's fiancee don't really like one another, but once I moved out, she started asking them for favors again and using my shit as a bargaining chip to work her way into getting help with her finances, help with babysitting, and various favors. They saw that it was happening too.

Him and I go back as friends all the way to 3rd grade. I respected him enough to be forward with that. He was accepting. He even started unloading some heavy secrets of his own on me about him questioning his sexuality and the sexual abuse he experienced at the hands of his grandfather and uncle, and the subsequent rejection and bullying he received from his father, because he apparently felt comfortable doing that.

His fiancee was very accepting and supportive of me also. She empathized with my situation with my wife. She offered to be there to have someone to talk to when I needed. A shoulder to cry on, as it were. I don't have a whole hell of a lot of those, so I took advantage of it.

This is where it gets stupid.

At first, it was 'girl talk' - strictly platonic. Tit-for-tat on Kik. We shared our frustrations and empathized with each other about all kinds of things. We talked about how distant from my wife's family we feel/felt. I talked about my feelings about my wife, she talked about her relationship problems. I talked about my dysphoria and answered her curious questions in detail. She talked about her insecurity about her own body. We were getting to be really close friends...

And then I mentioned one day about how I was repulsed by my own reflection. In an attempt to make me feel better, she disclosed that she thinks I'm actually kind of attractive and she actually had a crush on me. In tit-for-tat fashion, I called it out that she was probably just eating it up that 2 years ago, I told her not to be insecure about her appearance because she's actually kinda cute, right in front of her fiancee (then boyfriend) and my wife, and how that made my wife jealous.

My 'brother-in-law' started getting jealous of all the time she spends texting me. He went through her phone and misinterpreted some ambiguous sarcastic remark I made (thank god he didn't keep scrolling). I was expecting both of them to come over that evening to watch a movie. She showed up alone and crying because they were arguing about it. She expressed that it was the first time in a long time that she was trusted enough to have friends because of his extreme jealousy. She said she feels trapped by him and having a taste of freedom from that situation has her second-guessing her commitment to him.

What... the... fuck...

Things have escalated. Quickly. I'm falling for her. She's falling for me.

One problem: She wants me as I am, not as a woman.

And I can't sort out my own feelings about this...

I'm starting to think she is worth abandoning this whole notion of transition. She's starting to think I'm worth abandoning her engagement. We're both starting to think that what we have together is worth causing a huge mess...

tit-for-tat

dra6000,asktransgender,I need help looking at what I should do about transition after high school AMAB,"Hello all again. I love this subreddit so much &gt;.&gt;.

I guess I'm transgender? Never really had any proof other than me saying I wanted to be a girl many times and all the stress its caused.

Either way, here's the jist of it. I'm in high school right now. 3rd year out of 4 years. 

**background information**

For those of you unfamiliar with the US school system... This is also the year that college applications look at due to applications submissions being in the summer to fall of the 4th year of high school. Ya know... for those of ya that don't know about the US school system.

Either way, I'm a pretty good student? I'm taking mostly college level courses, in a variety of extracurriculars, and just do fun personal projects (making a game, recording a series once, and writing some prose) looking to get accepted into some prestigious university to study robotics and engineering. I have my sights on MIT, but eh, I doubt that's too likely. Ya'll don't have to tell me that at the least. I've been quite assured of the unlikeliness already.

**background information**

Anyways, i guess my question is what to do after high school about transitioning. My parents don't really want me to saying it's unnatural. I'm actually usually really depressed due to how not understanding they are of a lot of things I have. ADHD, being a major one. &gt;.&gt; They've just recently kinda let up for a moment.

Sometimes I feel like killing myself because of how much of a failure I am as a man. I feel like I'm influenced somewhat by the pro-transition narrative and I'm actually just a very pathetic beta male with zero self-esteem and that I need to man up.

I'm so tired. So fucking tried of not having or partaking the very thing that makes one a human.

And as I feel more and more subhuman, the more transgressions I face as I feel myself slipping away from society. Slowly the anger and isolation is rearing it's ugly head and driving me to to anti-social ideals.

At this point I feel completely outside of society. I can't quite describe this feeling. I enjoy some aspects of it I suppose. The feeling of freedom, breaking free, breaking bad.

I wish I had someone I could confide in real life but I will probably push them away when they do exactly what I long for in the first place.

I'm a true piece of shit. I feel like I'm slowly heading towards a border of no return, no redemption. It's exciting, and scary at the same time. 

I guess I'm still trying to weigh if transitioning can have a positive impact.

zauraz,asktransgender,How do I stop wishing to go back?,"I started seriously considering myself to be trans about 10 months ago. I am on my way towards ""gender investigation"" in Sweden and I feel pretty sure of my trans status and keep trying to validate it for some reason all the time. 

It has been a rough ride but I am now more in favour of being trans than cis. However I wish at times to go back. To the times before I seriously considered being trans.. I know that this will be a lot of hardships and atleast before I started thinking I made due with life with the occasional fantasy of being a girl.

Now its impossible for me to stop thinking that I am trans and some parts of me don't want to step back. But at times it felt so much easier living with the ignorance, not thinking about my gender.

I am sad whenever I think back at it as I have done things like coming out etc reinforcing my stance. And I feel like I am moving forward. But for some reason I still want to go back. Go back to the time where I could just ignore this and live a depressed life but without knowing that I want to transition and causing so many unknown consequences for myself and the world..

So my question is. How do I stop looking back wishing I could just forget all of this and kept pretending I was cis..?"

2. Is there such thing as injectable anti-androgens? And if so are they preferable as well?
3. Are there any girls here who didn't have insurance that covered injectables but opted to pay for them anyways because of said results? And how much did they cost for you?

chem4u,asktransgender,Am interested in hearing a trans individuals perspective,"Hello everyone,

I am not a trans individual but am interested in trying to understand some thing. In particular, I find my self often confused about distinguishing between gender roles and transgender identification. What I mean by this, is that, I have seen some people write about how they knew they were transgender because they played with toys and wore clothes classified with the other gender. For instance, a person with XY chromosomes prefered barbie dolls. I think my main question is, do you think that these gender roles are associated with the female and male sex innately or socially? The reason I ask, is because to me, I feel that toys, interests, clothes etc. are not innately tied to being a woman and a man. Do you agree or disagree? I feel that all this gender stereotype stuff is bullshit and harmful (for lack of better terms). (not trying to offend, just sharing my thoughts so if someone wants to counter they can). Thoughts?

I can understand in some way having body dysphoria, but I just have a really hard time understanding why prefering to do ""masculine"" activities as someone with XX chromosomes is some indication that they are ""in the wrond body"".

Can you let me know if you are open what it is like to grow up trans? Is it something else beyond the gender-associated interests or how do you percieve this reasoning for being transgender? Would some issues related to destroying gender roles help or hurt you?

Can anyone shed some light and give me their perspective?

Edit: My view has totally changed and I feel that I have more of a grasp on what being trans is about. Thanks to the new information."
throwmeawaynthetrash,asktransgender,I don't know if I can handle life much longer,"I'm so sick of all this. I'm just ready to go now. 

I've known I was trans for as long as I've known trans was a thing. I've felt like I should've been born a girl for as long as I've had memories. 

But hateful ignorant people will always be ignorantly hateful. Years of hearing their vile filth in my ears has conditioned my to be internally transphobic. I hate myself so much I considered ""repairative"" therapy 3 years ago, and I was still on the closet.

The day I came out I thought was going to be a new birth for a beautiful woman who had been hiding away for *19 years.* Instead she was forced to go down deeper than she ever had been. Repressed in a prison, held back in a hell of the mind.

Now I'm ready to die because of it. More than ever, I just want to die. Everyday is another day lost, and I'm tired of losing days. 

Instead of having the courage to just forget all the negativity I want to do the cowardly thing and cease to be. And I'm so close to doing it. For days now, I've stood there wondering if I was really going to end it. 

But I can't. I can't kill myself. But I can't transition either. And the next best option is suicide. A quick painless release instead of facing years of change that I'm not brave enough to face.

I'm so done with it all. Why couldn't I have been your average cis person who has other problems? Why did I have to be born trans in a time and place where being trans is almost the modern day equivalent of being a leper? Did I commit some great sin in a past life? Am I paying for the sins of my father? Will my suffering ever end?

I guess I'll just muscle through today, and tomorrow, and next week, and next month, and next year, and the next 10 years. I'll just continue to put on the face I've been wearing since I was a child. Maybe one day I'll die in accident and my pain will end. 

Because as of today, I'm too weak to do the one thing that would make me happy. As of today I am too weak to take the chance of transitioning, and therefore take the chance to be *happy.*

Sorry for the rambling rant, but I'm just at my wits end now."

surlyguffaw,asktransgender,"[Advice] My partner has dysphoria and esteem issues. How can I be supportive, or, what do/did you wish *your* partner(s) did/do more of?","Hello! Former lurker out of hiding, hoping this post isn't out of line. Sorry in advance for the wall of text. :)

My partner (30/AMAB) has always had issues with dysphoria, gender identity, and social conditioning/gender roles. Over the 2+ years we've been together, they've felt more comfortable talking to me about it, and about how it's been an issue in the past, both in how they feel about themselves and how it's impacted their relationships. 

Most of their partners have either been deeply unsupportive and pushed them into stereotypically ""masculine"" roles, socially and sexually, or have gone the other way and complained that they're ""not femme/queer/whatever else enough"" to fit other stereotypes. My partner's identity *is* quite fluid, and while these days they're leaning more towards genderqueer as a label, in the past year they've talked about feeling ""trans"" in some degree is descriptive of how they feel. They talk a lot about being disgusted by overt masculinity - both in their body and other people's - though there are some parts of their body/looks that are ""male"" that they like.  

Right now, life is quite hard for both of us. We're long distance, both dealing with chronic health issues, and - in the past ten months - we've both dealt with personal losses, plus my partner's long-term girlfriend (we're poly, or were... but that's another issue...) broke up with them in a way that really exacerbated a lot of fears, insecurities, and sensitivities my partner has about themselves, their identity, sexuality, and pretty much everything else. They are also looking after their disabled mom and - due to ex-gf moving out of the apartment they share - probably facing some significant financial problems in the future. 

So, with all of that going on, everyone's got plenty to feel terrible about. Dysphoria probably isn't even near the biggest issue right now, but it seems to be a big part of the root of how they feel about a lot of things. I'm going over to spend some time with them in a few weeks, and - though they're trying not to show it - I know that they feel just awful in terms of self-confidence, body image, and everything else that their dysphoria connects to. Hitting 30 has been hard, because they feel old, unattractive, and like they can't pull off the androgyny they could when they were in their early 20s, among other things.

I know I can't fix any of this for them (and nor should I try to), but how can I be the most understanding and supportive for them? We do talk about this, and I've reiterated to them that they're my favourite person, regardless of how they choose to present. I try to make sure they know they're under no pressure with me, sexually or otherwise (this has all done a bit of a number on their libido, and they're probably somewhere gray-ace to start with, or at least a bit idiosyncratic sexually), and to focus on creating safe, comfortable, relaxing spaces when we're together. 

We have long-term plans, and we're looking in the future at ways they can be more open about their identity, including but not limited to dressing sometimes and/or presenting in a more non-binary way generally. 

If anyone has any suggestions or advice on things that might be helpful, or things I could do to be a more supportive partner, I'd be so grateful. It hurts to watch someone you love feeling terrible, and saying such awful things about themselves, and I know how frustrated they are right now. 

Thank you! :)

Very recently, within this month, I have been questioning my gender and been asking myself alot of questions. The problem I'm having is that I'm very confused, because when I tell myself ""I am a girl,"" it just seems incorrect. Now, I'm a pretty feminine guy, so it's not that I'm super masculine. 
So I don't really feel like a girl, but when I ask myself: Do I want to be a girl?, the answer is yes. I've only been researching and thinking about this for less than a month, but does anyone have any insight into what could be going on. 
Also, when I crossdress, it's not anything sexual (not anymore, but when I was 12-15...), I just enjoy feeling like a girl. "

eabrmposr,asktransgender,Misgender / pronoun problems in theatrical spaces. Maybe just venting,"Ok so! I've been ""full time"" for quite a while. I think I'm at a stage where I probably pass in public most of the time, but that strangers would probably clock me within a minute or two if we had any kind of prolonged interaction. I'd love to have the option to be stealth but I'm just not there yet and may never be.

I'm out at work, with my family, my partner is supportive, all that's going pretty great. Everyone *knows* I'm trans but everyone also gets it and treats me how I want to be treated.

My problem is this. I'm an actress, and I do a lot of what people call ""physical"" theatre. This involves a lot of time spent in the studio wearing e.g. loose fitting athletic pants and a tank top, devising scenes and creating characters. It's kind of my happy place. But there's not much you can do in this environment to emphasize your feminine features. And my voice isn't great yet so ... I don't really pass at all in this environment. On *stage* it's different because of costumes and makeup. In the studio, it's practically impossible. And anyway, everyone already knows I'm trans.

Acting and theatre are my passions in life. And transition has let me finally reclaim that passion after years running away from it due to dysphoria. I'm good at acting. I'm good at theatre. I love it. Lots of trans people will say ""oh I knew I wanted to be X when I was 6"". Well for me ""X"" wasn't ""a girl"" it was ""an actor"". The whole trans realization came much later.

So the shitty thing is, rehearsals and acting studios are the one place in my life where I still experience a significant amount of misgendering. Whether it's because of the close prolonged interaction, or because I'm working with a lot of people from an older generation ... I don't know. But it fucking sucks when you finish a scene and you're in a super open and vulnerable state and your scene partner turns to the director and says ""oh, but I thought I was supposed to catch him here ..."" 

And people will apologize and say ""oh we support you it just takes getting used to blah blah blah"". But it just keeps happening and it fucking kills me every time. Like, I will have a great rehearsal and then go home and cry alone in the kitchen because I also got seriously misgendered. It's affecting my confidence. It's affecting how I see myself in the mirror. It's messing with me and I don't know what to do. 

Actors and theatre people think they're so liberal and open minded. They assume they are the trans community's greatest allies by default. That arrogance drives me up a wall, because it breeds a certain complacency - like they don't realize that ""accepting"" trans people actually requires that they do a certain amount of internal work reorganizing their own understanding of gender and how they perceive it. 

So yeah, that's my rant. I don't have a question just wanted to throw it out there because it's weighed on me a lot these last few months. However, if anyone has a similar experience to share or even has any advice etc I would love to hear it all. Thanks.

tl;dr I don't get misgendered anywhere except when I'm making theatre and it bloooooows"
shonkshonk,asktransgender,Anyone guilty about possible surgeries and cost?,"I am 50% about FFS, 40% about BA, maybe 10% about bottom surgery.

Being in Australia means no chance of getting any Medicare or health insurance coverage.

I've been on hormones for about a year and I'm nowhere near failing boymode. But considering I have a few years of changes to go I think I can reasonable expect to pass most the time as an ugly girl. Is it selfish of me to want FFS to pass a little bit better, or to be prettier? It feels superficial and I'm also worried my girlfriend wont like my face if it changes too much.

LightningZombie,asktransgender,Sharp pains on hrt,"So i started hrt august 2nd of this year. First day after 45 minutes on first dosage i was hit with verigo and had pain all over felt like pinches of pain. My skin was like bubble wrap and it was being popped all over. Panicked called dr said it was normal for some people and not to take the night dosages. Followed instruction next day was so much more bearable. 

Anyways i had pretty emediate changes within a few days my skin and hair were different and my mind felt different from first day. As i went through it i started having sharp pains in my right thigh. Sometimes hip join pains. The pains feel like im being stabbed a few times like a throb. I also sometimes get like slight vertigo when it happens. It got to the point where i went to both urgent care and the emergency room the other day. I had throbs of slight pain on my ankle and my dr had said watch out for ankle pains because of blood clots. Well both urgent care and Emergency room did nothing. Urgent care literally did nothing while Emergency room just said doesnt seem likely to be a blood clot and discharged me. 

I made an appointment with my dr but he doesn't take walk ins or emergancy appointments. As of last night the pains migrated to my other thigh and i got a leg cramp. This morning my muscles were still tight and i had the sharp pains again though this time both thighs and they lasted longer. I understand there is muscle pain but i was not expecting stabbing pains. So my appointment is on the 29th cant get any help inbetween now and then. Any help greatly appreciated please it may be an Emergency i have no idea. Its very scary, painful and the drs at the hospital had no idea what a transgender person even was

For reference I am in California and im on 50mg spiro and 1mg estradoil twice a day have not have my dosages changed yet. My blood and urine was checked before starting hrt, though my hormone levels were not checked."

ella-evolved,asktransgender,Coming out to friends today. Read my letter?,"Coming out on Facebook (to friends, not family). After seven months on HRT and some great experiences finally being myself and meeting people who only see me as who I am now, I am ready to shed my old identity. Everyone so far has been completely supportive and encouraging.

So, my letter:  

For the past few years I have been meditating on thoughts, feelings, and memories from throughout my life. Taken in aggregate, these memories have revealed a clear and unremitting truth. Actually, it is a fact I have known about myself at some level for most of my life, even before I had the language to describe it.

The truth is that the gender I was assigned at birth—the gender by which most of you know me—has always felt ill-fitting and burdensome. And my body itself has felt oppressive and alien; seeing myself in the mirror or thinking about how I looked was painful and overwhelmingly distressing. I've felt this way for as long as I can remember. For most of my life, I truly did not believe that happiness was possible. I was fragmented, petrified and lifeless. By last winter I was at an excruciatingly low point and I knew that I had to take action.

So, I am in the process of transitioning to female. I have been on hormone replacement therapy for around seven months now, and I feel like my life is finally on an upturn. For the first time in my life, I feel at peace. There are so many firsts—I feel motivated, passionate, and so optimistic. Most importantly, I feel happy and I feel whole.

So, a few things will be changing. For one, I am going to be changing my name to ______. It's what I would have been named had I been born a girl. I will be using the pronouns she/her/hers. You might have already noticed some changes in the way I look; that's going to continue to change over time.

Otherwise, most things will be the same. I'm the same person, so I'm not suddenly flipping my interests or anything. I've never let gender binaries dictate my interests before, so I'm not changing that now. My transition isn't about playing with barbies as a kid or wanting to wear dresses. It has nothing to do with any trans person you know or have heard of in the news. It also has nothing to do with sexual orientation. My transition is about who I am on a fundamental level and how I relate to my body. And with my body and my gender in alignment, it will be possible for me to move forward and more fully understand the person that I am.

That's pretty much it! I'm fairly open to respectful questions for the time being and I understand that it can take some time to readjust, but I appreciate the effort.

I've chosen to be open about my transition because I don't want to hide or feel ashamed about who I am ever again. No amount of fear is worth wasting another single day not being myself.

Thank you for your support and love,

______

Any crits/suggestions for improvements are appreciated!

_emma93,asktransgender,I (23 MTF almost 2 years on HRT) still not full time and in the closet. Big anxiety to make the next step. How to start living?,"Hi!
First of all, I would like to say hello, as it is my first post here. I am here for a little bit of time, but so far I was only lurking this forum. :)

I am 23 years old, living in Eastern Europe. I am on HRT for almost 2 years, but I still haven't made any progress so far. I mean that I am still living in a boy mode full time and I didn't come out to my parents.

In the past, before the HRT I tried to talk to my parents about it, but they were saying that it's only a phase etc., and each time they didn't want to talk about it. I know that they are not educated regarding thee topics, but they don't want to learn anything. I have decided to give up about telling them, and start doing decisions without their knowledge (I mean starting transition).

I would like to make the next step, because I am tired of staying for so long in a closet and I would like to start finally living (I feel like I am loosing it now).

The problem is that I am afraid of making the next step. I was hiding for so long, because I didn't want to loose my family, my house, and I wanted to save money for my SRS (and did that - I saved enough money for this operation). I know it may be stupid, but I am just afraid of these 2 things.

I am reading on forums about all trans people that they are starting living full time so quickly (sometimes even before HRT) which makes me sad and ashamed, because I am still stuck on going out of closet, even I am on HRT for almost 2 years.

My parents are living in Spain now. I am living independently (but in parent's house), in Poland (because of niche work). I am thinking about sending them a letter, because I will be able to see them for Christmas. They are not religious, but still they are not tolerant enough.
On the other hand, currently I have sister (22F) which is currently till Friday in Poland (she is moving to Spain for her studies). I was thinking about telling her, but I am also afraid that she will not accept me and will tell my parents and will have bigger problems...

I know that I am an adult, have a work, almost graduated from my school, etc., but I really after loosing the family, probably will not have anybody else - to be honest I am also having big issues on making friends, so most of the time I am alone.
I really don't know how I should manage to do it...

I would like to ask you - how I should manage to progress in my transition. Any tips, experiences, something motivational, etc.?

Thanks!

tl;dr: I am on HRT for almost 2 years, but I am still in a closet, and living as a boy. How to deal to make the next step?"

gwynforred,asktransgender,Have your eyes changed on HRT?,"I'm researching the effects of HRT in trans women for something I'm writing and Wikipedia says ""ocular changes"" are a side effect of HRT in mtf individuals. Now I'm ftm and have been on HRT for over a year and my eyes look the same (I think) and I've never heard of trans men having eye changes. But maybe I just haven't been paying attention.

Is this a thing? Has anyone's eye color changed?"
SecretOfficerNeko,asktransgender,How much do you change in future after 4mo HRT? [MtF],"So I guess I'm here because I've been struggling a bit for a while now with some dysphoria considering my body, and I know this is going to sound unreasonable, but I'm still asking because I'm neurotic like that.

How much will my body change on top of what's already occurred after the 4mo I've been on Hormone Therapy? How much did you change (if applicable) from the way your body was at 4mo to later on in your transition, and when did these changes occur.

I'm just feeling dysphoric and discouraged about how male my body still is, despite my efforts, and my having to present female, so its made my life a bit more difficult (ie. I always have to wear a jacket because I feel like my male-ish figure will give me away). I feel like I'm starting to develop. Breast development is definitely going strong (to the point I have a visible bust when I put a tank top on), but I'm not sure if muscle or fat changes have started at all...

I know its kind of irrational to expect my body to change a lot, but I just feel like I need to know how much different my body will be (on average, so just give me the average mileage ;]) in the near future, and whether I'll be stuck looking like a guy for the rest of my life....which is a pretty hard train of thought to be on a lot."
throwaway040896,asktransgender,Let's talk about antiandrogens. Alternatives to spiro?,"So I've been reading a little bit about T blockers and apparently spironolactone is by far the most common antiandrogen for HRT. To my understanding, this is used as a diuretic that is mainly aimed to hypertensive folks. In addition, it also seems to be hard on the liver and kidneys as well as causing hyperkalemia which can lead to irregular heartbeats and some other fun stuff I might not be aware of. So, when looking at the whole picture it sounds a bit concerning to me, as those are pills you have to take until you get surgery if you ever wanna pull that trigger. I'm trying search for alternatives, and so far they seem to carry significant health concerning effects with them too (i.e. Cyproterone acetate and liver toxicity). 

What are your experiences with AA's? Do they feel safe to you? How common or intense are the side effects? As someone who gets somewhat frequent dips in my BP (at around 90/50) I feel I have to be cautious with spiro and should not consider DIY. Also, is finasteride of any use to reduce T levels? I'm aware it's mainly a DHT blocker that slows male pattern baldness but it seems safer and it's apparently still labelled as a mild androgenic blocker, so is it of any use that you know of (?). Anyway, thank you, you are such a great community n.n "
the_stalking_leopard,asktransgender,Informed consent or not?,"I am transitioning MtF. I found a few places and doctors that offer informed consent for HRT to begin my transition, however I'm unsure. I'm 16. I would like my diagnosis of gender dysphoria because I feel like I need to prove a point to some of my family, and it would feel really nice for me as well. However I want my body to begin this transition as quickly and soon as possible.

What would you all recommend I try to do?: 
 A) Informed consent - no therapy needed
 B) Limited therapy - given my approval for Hormones
 C) Full-time therapy

Bonus: since I'm 16, I'm not quite done with puberty. I still have yet to get a deeper voice, broader shoulders, weight and muscle definition...can I get on blockers BEFORE estrogen if need be??"

I'm in Sydney, and will likely go to The Gender Centre in Annandale. I'm INCREDIBLY nervous though, and have a few questions. First, some background. I've grown up in a fairly conservative area, some homophobic family members/friends, Catholic private schools etc. So it's taken me 5 years just to accept myself as transgender. I've always presented as a straight male, out of necessity.

My 'transition plan' is to see a gender therapist, confirm that I'm transgender, talk about my whole experience, and get a recommendation for HRT. I want to come out only to my mum and sister, and maybe one close friend. This whole time I want to stay in boymode until I'm comfortable enough to come out publicly, or until boymode fails due to me looking too feminine from HRT. I guess my question is, if I go to my gender therapist visits in boymode, will they doubt that I'm transgender? For everyone here who's been to a therapist for a HRT recommendation, did you go to your therapist in boymode?

I'm so nervous about all of this. Any advice will really help!"

EmmaTheDalek,asktransgender,How do you deal with this?,"I've known I was trans for a while (years)...but the past couple of days things are hitting me like a ton of bricks, like I've been living in blissful ignorance this whole time. I just...can barely take it anymore. I'm constantly on the verge of tears and trembling all the time. I can't even jerk off anymore, can't even touch it, all I think is that a real woman wouldn't get pleasure from having a penis. Before this week I didn't have this, I've wanted to be a woman as long as I can remember but I also had times where I thought I could just suck it up. It wasn't so bad. Now...ugh. I'm constantly on the verge of tears. I can't stop thinking about my childhood, that I can't get back, that I can't spend being a girl. I'll never experience the things normal girls go through, and I can't help but ask why? WHY THE FUCK? Heart problems, lazy eye, horrible eyesight, severe depression, panic disorder, anxiety disorder and transgender to top it all off! Plus I'm a lazy fuck! Fucking genetics. They killed my dad when I was 14. I mean, what the hell? I know there are people worse off, but goddamn.

If only I'd known earlier, if only I'd realized. I'm a moron. People tell me I'm sooo smart but no, I'm as stupid as they come. It's just an act! If I had any sense at all I would've petitioned my mom for T blockers as soon as I knew. But nooo, little miss toughguy thought she could suck it up. Be a fucking man, huh? Oh what a idiotic choice that was. Now I've flunked out of two universities and I sit home alone on my ass all day. Maybe if I'd been the stereotypical trans kid, I could've started sooner! No wait, my dad probably would've kicked my ass and my mom wouldn't have stopped praying over me. I saw how my family, how the church treated people like me, so I kept my yap shut. Wish I'd spoken up, at least I might've been able to talk sense into my mom. She still says she wishes I wouldn't do it. But she's trying, I guess that's better than nothing.

Instead I spent my childhood playing with cars in the dirt, not caring how I was dressed. But goddammit, girls can like cars and racing and electronics and science too! 

Oh, but now my mind is going back to all the missed female childhood experiences! Can't be a real woman without those, right my dearest mind? Oh how glorious it would have been, to not have to sit quiet next to all my friends in high school, I could have just been one of the girls. It would've been so great! So fun! I even want the drama that comes with it. It's no fair that life doesn't have mulligans :-(

I keep telling myself, ""You're just 21, it's not so bad! You could still be a normal woman!"" and then I look in the mirror. That piece of shit looking back isn't me. I'm not even that masculine yet and it's killing me. Fucking facial hair. Fucking big hands and feet and man mannerisms. Ugh, I wish I had a vagina to bleed out of every month.  No one is ever going to take me seriously as a woman are they?! I wish I wasn't so afraid of death, I'd get this shitshow over with already and just shoot myself. But noo, I want to exist. Not existing terrifies me! Ugh.

I'm going to die alone too. No man wants a fucking fake woman. No woman either, for that matter. Society screams that everyday! Not to mention I'm ugly as fuck! It's useless. I wish I was cute and feminine, and guys would make eyes at me and I'd flip my hair and blush, oh I want to be that girl so much it's killing me! I just...I can't do it. I need to work up the nerve to just kill myself already. No one would give a shit anyway. Ugh!

I'm sorry, this has kind of gotten away from me. I needed to rant, to get some of this out and this was the only place I could think to do it. But seriously, how do you guys deal with this? It's horrible. I can't take it anymore, I'm sooo not strong.

EDIT: I know it's not likely anyone will see this, but I'm sorry for some of the things I said in this post. I wasn't thinking at the time, I didn't realize that it may effect others the same way the words effect me. So, that's all. I'm sorry."

amon_erin,asktransgender,Does this get better?,"Okay, so today is officially two weeks on HRT. I'm not really feeling better, and in some ways I feel worse. I know in my head and my heart that I want to be a girl, but I'm worried that feeling kind of crappy right now isn't going to go away. By feeling crappy I mean my head sometimes feels a bit foggy and I feel kind of down. Perhaps the reduction of testosterone is just letting me feel things that were numb before? I'm not sure.

I'm meeting with my doctor and therapist today, so I'll bring this up then. I just don't know what to do. I know I don't want to quit, but if this is a sign I should then I guess I have to figure out how to deal with being unable to transition. Which, at times lately, makes me seriously consider less ideal options...

Then again, my mood will probably shift soon anyway and I'll feel fine. Stupid mood swings.

Shockingpink13,asktransgender,Friends,"When I am at work, or in public, and I am talking to people who view me as a boy (not the girl that I am), I sometimes hear a lot of transphobic comments and opinions.  For example, my boss told me a few weeks ago that trans people fool themselves into believing they are trans through drugs.  It just bothers me because I don't want to come out to those people, and it bothers me to be around them because I know that if they knew who I was then they would reject me.  This is awful because I legitimately like these people and for the most part enjoy being around them.

Even the friends that do know I am a girl try to convince me otherwise.  Well, I say friends but it's really only one.  He told me that while he respects my feelings, he doesn't understand or believe that trans exists.  The whole thing kind of baffled him.  He even threatened me with the possibility of being miserable for the rest of my life.  I know he means well, that he only wants me to be happy, but it's just so frustrating when people can't understand your emotions.

transthroa,asktransgender,another 'trans-OCD/anxiety' question,"hey,

I see this topic is brought up quite a lot but it's something I feel is kinda personal, to the point where I'd want the answers taylored to me

So I'm a gay/bisexual male (mostly attracted to personality, I have my likes and dislikes of course). I'm quite 'big' (6ft, 200lb, broad etc), and until recently I've had problems accepting that I have no interest in 'playing the role' expected of me, being muscular and 'fitting my shape', other than to appease others around me (I really hate negative attention, if there's a choice of positive and negative attention or no attention at all I choose the latter. I'm still in the closet with my sexuality regardless of acknowledging it close to 10 years ago). This is why I've only really come to properly having in-depth thought about this now. 

I also am one to get stuck in 'fixation loops' where I'll constantly think about a topic to the point of the thoughts being intrusive. I've known for a while that I'm more of a feminine guy, but despite that I've never really expressed it because I was too anxious about judgement from others.

one of my really amazing (trans) friends kinda talked some sense indirectly with sharing their experiences, making me realise that having a constant 'facade' going does nothing for me - It'll protect me from judgement, but any friends I have will be friends of my facade rather than the 'true' me, etc.

my problem from where I stand is trying to figure out whether I'm trans, or just a feminine male, and how much of an impact the answer to that will be to me.

Because of how I am with OCD, regardless of whatever the answer to the question is it'll nag away at me, which means I can't trust the nagging feeling to be my subconscious answering for me. That said, when accepting/acknowledging that I was gay, I went through very similar feelings to the feelings I have now, which is part of the problem...

any advice/help would be much appreciated, and I'm willing to answer any questions that'll help...I really suck at writing stuff like this "
finallybeing,asktransgender,I don't feel I am in the wrong body but I am starting hormones anyway,"TLDR; I don't feel like I am in the wrong body but I think what I experience is gender dysphoria. I am starting HRT to understand more and posting this here to help others but mostly to thank Reddit for being my friend! 

FULL;

I don't feel trapped in the wrong body. I never felt that way to be honest. I did however feel this constant sense of something being off. I watched as a young 10 year old kid, I started fantasizing about being treated badly and somehow getting a sense of pleasure from that. Even then I knew it was dark and I didn't want it but all I could do was helplessly watch it happen to me. There was no reason for it to be happening -  I had loving parents, I wasn't abused and I had a pretty normal childhood. I used to be a pretty happy kid. I now know that it was puberty happening and confusing my brain because it perhaps didn't know how to deal with my body. I say perhaps because I can't be sure. Gender dysphoria manifests in so many ways that it's almost impossible to compare notes, not that I had anyone to compare notes with in India in the 90s. 

I struggled with my sexuality for decades, trying on different labels and paths. BDSM came the closest to fitting well - I thought I was a submissive and just enjoyed being denied the male privilege. It still felt very dark but in the absence of a better understanding it worked for a while. Once it hit me that I may be Trans, my attraction to BDSM disappeared overnight. I still value my friends in the community but I lost my personal attraction to it.  

When I discovered the Trans community, I realized that a lot of people knew from a very early age that they were in the wrong body. That made me less sure of being Trans. I read around a lot and figured out that it's ok even if you haven't felt that way. Some people almost never experience any obvious dysphoria. Everyone's experience is different. A part of me still doesn't accept that I am Trans. I do however know that I spend a lot of energy keeping my head above the water. I am talking about the depression that I have learnt to manage with sports, meditation and a healthy lifestyle but which never truly goes away. I have decided to try out hormones (I started spiro today and starting E in a few days) and see if that helps. I still don't know if I or want to be a woman. I know I am not Cis and I want to see if hormones can help me achieve a mental peace that has always seen so elusive. I know I am too old to probably ever be the woman I would have liked to be but i’ll take mental peace over everything else. 

Edit: I did try therapy for a few hours and my therapist recommended me for HRT and I am doing hormones on prescription. "

throwaway54465446,asktransgender,Changing your name to that of someone you know?,"I like the name Brett. I think it's a cool name. I could see myself being a Brett. It's maybe a little more leaning feminine than I'd like (FtM), but I'm mostly resigned at this point to the fact that I just like unisex names.

But I'm very close to my older sister. She was the first person I came out to. She's always there for me, always supportive, we've always been good friends, I've always really admired her.

And my older sister's best friend in named Brett. They're in grad school now, and they've been best friends since 6th grade. They were even a couple for a while in college. And my family knows Brett's family *really* well, in part because of how close my sister and Brett are. Hell, I dated her cousin for most of high school, and my younger sister is currently dating her (Brett's) younger brother (no one sees it going very far, but hey, it happened.) 

And it's not just the name Brett. I love the name Riley, but my twin brother has been dating a Riley for like three years now, he talks like he's gonna marry her. I love the name Thomas, but my older sister has been dating a Thomas for a couple years now too. I love the name Rory *but one of my friends from high school changed their name to Rory.* 

I am seriously struggling find a name that I like that isn't ridiculous that isn't also the name of someone either significant in my life or significant in the life of a family member. 

Am I overestimating how weird it would be to actually use one of these names? Has anyone ever changed their name to the name of someone they know pretty well?"

Arduinan,asktransgender,Having Gender Confirming Surgery in 48 Hours AMA,"The past two weeks without hormone replacement were a lot harder than I expected.  

Most of the time I felt spacey, like part of my brain was turned off.  I couldn't think very clearly at all, so I missed some work.  It was sort of surprising how much my chest, cheeks and skin roundness decreased too. 

The hardest thing though was an almost constant headache, which I guess can  happen when you stop birth control too.  I couldn't take any aspirin or ibuprofen either, since they're not allowed before surgery.  I feel better now, but it was so painful for a while.

Otherwise I spent a lot of time preparing, like packing, setting up a private room at work to dilate, and stocking up on anything heavy (after surgery I was told not to lift anything over 5 lbs).  I also spent a lot of time just being with my husband, since there is tiny but real chance of not surviving a major surgery.

The company I work for has treated me really well.  They use Aetna insurance too, who pre-approved to cover the surgery. Maybe it makes sense to them financially since otherwise they would be paying for Lupron hormone suppression (like $3500) every 3 months forever.  I have to be out of work for 6 weeks to recover, so my doctor helped put me on ""short term disability"" for partial pay.  

So now I'm on the way to the hotel with my mom. I feel so grateful she volunteered since a surgery companion is required for the 2 week stay near the hospital.  I can only have liquids from now on, and I'm soo hungry, but fruit  smoothies are making it easier.

This is the most important step for me, because I want to feel ""normal"" and stop the dysphoria that's haunted me since I was 8.

If I can answer any questions I'll try."
LiberalTransGirl,asktransgender,Is Hillary Clinton a champion for transgender rights?,"Hillary Clinton only recently jumped on the 'trend' of LGBT rights recently and as we all know she was anti gay marriage and probably anti transgender too since she seemed to be very conservative.

I think Hillary Clinton's main issue is Feminism before anything else and as a transgender woman who is not a feminist but an anti feminist instead, i want to have a president who is going to protect and give me the rights I deserve as a transgender woman!


If Bernie Sanders was still running I would have voted for him as he has been a long time supporter of LGBT rights and often speaks about LGBT issues! Apparently Hillary Clinton even let thousands of us LGBT people die and has borrowed money from anti LGBT countries.

I'm worried they'll never be comfortable with themself because of their family. Is there anything I can do, besides showing my support that will help them?

I'm nearly 30 and just want to salvage what's left of my life instead of being seen as ""trans"" and aggressively misgendered as male everywhere I go.

I'm starting to think transition isn't worth it. If I detransition I'll still have dysphoria, but at least I can live a normal life. At this point I'm just sick of it all, sick of looking like a ""middle aged man"" who is ""trying to be something else."""
DiscoBombing,asktransgender,"The closer I get, the more nervous I get?","About two weeks from now, I'll finally be starting the official ""evaluation"" with my therapist, and if all goes right, getting on the path to transitioning, but the closer I get to that date, the more I seem to be freaking out.

Lately I've been unable to stop thinking the square shape of my hairline or any stubble on my arms that I missed.

And I'm more nervous around people.
Just today a new hire was being introduced around the office and when I heard them behind me, I felt pressure in my chest and my palms began to sweat. Thankfully they skipped over me because I looked busy but it's never been this bad.

_But on the plus side, I have a boyfriend now and he helps a lot._"

I'm just one of the girls. If it takes me being stressed for a couple of minutes to achieve that feeling, I'll deal with that stress."

Currently tho, I've no attachment to my gender identity, that is i have no dysphoria what so ever, I see the body as more of a 'means to an end' rather than a core aspect of my personality.
What I'm trying to say is that I feel no attachment to the physical because when you look at it, it all boils down to gender roles and how you express yourself. I don't need to be in a different body for me to feel 'complete' or what have you. I can express myself in a way that suits my 'inner compass' just fine without changing the physical. Kind of makes you wonder about the various obstacles and roadblocks we place on our self, but im starting to ramble now so my question to you is:

I have a friend that I talk to daily (she is trans), and I have a tendency to keep pointing out things to her that ""prove"" that I might not be trans, for example, I do like some women's clothes, on occasion; or like I don't really have bad top dysphoria and not sure I'd want top surgery. (She always counters with ""There's no one way to be trans and no one way to transition."")

The other day he messaged me, nothing unusual at first, just a regular conversation, then things seemed to go downhill. I don't quite remember what brought it up, but he told me he was super uncomfortable around me because I had everything he ever wanted and I was ""just throwing it away, "" which quickly escalated into him saying things that were flat out transmisogynistic. 

I've met plenty of other transdudes and have never had this happen before, is this something common at all? He apologized later but I'm really not feeling comfortable to talk to him yet. "

footworshipper,asktransgender,"To get prescribed hormones, did anyone use Welbutrin to quit smoking?","I know there is a subreddit for this, r/stopsmoking, but I figured I would look here anyway. Plus, I wanted to give a little background for anyone who still smokes and wants to transition. 

I made an appointment with my endo, and honestly, it was going amazingly. She was incredibly supportive, didn't question (mostly how I arrived in her office), and was ready to prescribe hormones to begin my journey. And then she asked if I smoked... 

I was honest, and told her I smoked about a pack a day. Her eyes went wide, and she was almost astounded (I know people much worse, and I used to be two packs a day for a while). She explained that, while it was disappointing, I needed to show that I either quit, or had made significant strides toward quitting before she would prescribe hormones. She even apologized, but nicely explained that the nicotine would significantly raise the risk of me getting a blood clot with estrogen, but she still gave support. Her biggest ticket item was that she suggested I take Welbutrin. 

I had had welbutrin recommended to me before by my last therapist, but when I read that it can cause seizures, I put it in the back of my mind. I've tried cold turkey, vaping, and similar substitutes to no avail, and I'd rather avoid using gum or patches because they just replace how you get the nicotine (in my eyes, if it works for you, keep on truckin). 

Has anyone here had any luck using welbutrin to to quit smoking so that they could start hormones? Is there anything you wish you had known before taking it? "
DarkLeach7,asktransgender,Anyone else start to feel attraction towards others during HRT when previously they never felt attraction before?,"Just passed 8 months of HRT not too long ago and I'm really starting to feel comfortable in my body and how I'm changing. I've even been told by a lot of people that I know that I pass well. I get gendered correctly when I'm away from home, passers-by refer to me a female so I mean I obviously do anyways I feel like these thoughts have cleared my head from a lot of doubt about my self image.

It wasn't all that long ago that I noticed myself becoming attracted towards physical features of people and trying to find out what features I was attracted to. Until about a week ago I didn't find myself attracted to people, and now I do. I felt uncomfortable with identifying as asexual any longer because I found myself feeling attraction and other stuff like that.

I brought it up with my therapist and when I mentioned that maybe my asexuality was a mental barrier because I wasn't comfortable with myself she agreed with me.

I wanted to ask if anyone else had a similar experience. Excuse the long post, my questions tend to come with stories.

(Also yes I know my flair still has the icon with the asexual flag, I haven't been on Reddit in awhile and the app I use doesn't allow me to change flairs.)"

If i stopped I would be initially very happy but ultimately crushed. Five ten years down the road, I would be living a lie that would ultimately be tied up with parental resentment, and thoughts of regret. One other convenient truth that nailed me in the head was, right after I posted last and went to sleep. I took my hormones no hesitation. They symbolize future, and I wasn't going to queer ;] the possibility of having one!

 For those of you who don't speak spanish, it's an inherently gendered language, with things usually either having masculine ""o"" and ""os"" suffixes, or feminine ""a"" and ""as"" suffixes. Additionally, if there is even one guy in a group of girls, the whole group gets gendered male, ""ellos"" for ""them"".

Me on the other hand, I have like 3 or 4 different tones in my skin. The back of my neck is visibly darker than the front, my neck and face are just slightly darker than the rest of my body, and then comes the infamous farmer tan.

The back of my hands and forearms are considerably darker than the rest of my body. Its been like this for years even though I use sunscreen daily, without fail. I started using long sleeves whenever I could since high school to try to stop it, but with no results. 

I have talked to my dermatologist about this, and he didn't took me serious. He said it was normal, and that it wasn't worth it trying to get rid of it.

This is only one of a lot of issues with my body, but it is one I feel like should be easy to fix, yet I have been struggling with it for years. Sometimes I look myself in the mirror and wish this darkened areas on my forearm would just have the same color and my shoulders and underarm. I feel like it makes me more masculine.

She is living in another country for the time being, and there is quite a bit of a language barrier between us (she can barely speak or read English, and I read and write in Mandarin (her language) at about only an elementary school level). 

I've tried coming out a few years ago with a letter written in her language. She got the general gist of it, but I communicated myself badly and she began using some slight semantic mistakes as proof that I wasn't really trans.

A few weeks ago, I tried to just come out and say it over a phone call, but I kept freezing up and couldn't bring myself to do it. I know that I can explain myself much better verbally, but I am having trouble initiating a conversation where I can do so. 

Right now, I want to send a short text message explaining to her that I felt I was trans and telling her to call me when she was ready so we can talk about it, but I am worried that might seem too impersonal.

* Got asked why I am so active in LGBT rights; ''Don't you like guys?''. Also if I liked girls or guys, in that order

* When I said I had to go to ''the doctor to get my vocal chords treated'', one girl answered ''to make your voice higher?''

carefreearchgeek,asktransgender,"Feeling depressed, anxious and doubting myself","I thought I was going to have a pretty good day today, the one day a week I get to hang out with friends. I'm not out to anyone, but I only get to see people once a week and it's always good. It was fun, but I once I left I just felt awful; ""I'll never pass"" ""I'm being stupid, I'm not trans"" ""It's too late to reverse your hair loss"".

I got home and swung by here hoping boost my confidence and instead I read two posts about hormones not working or not doing much of all. I know that ymmv, and that there's other work that goes into it, but I'm terrified it won't do much of anything to me.

I feel stuck. Whenever I try to do anything that would require talking to someone or risk someone finding out I get anxious and can't go through with it. I keep swinging between confidence that it'll all work out somehow and dread and fear that it won't and can't work out and I'm stuck; that either I don't transition and hate being a man or do and never quite ""get there"" and hate myself feeling like a freak. Or that I try to transition and money just falls short and I end up stuck. I'm unemployed and have been for some time. I'm UK based so the bulk of stuff can come through the NHS, very slowly, but you still need to sort some stuff yourself. And then there's the NHS gatekeepers; I'm terrified I won't be able to communicate myself properly, I'm autistic and I've never been good a explaining myself. The policy documents are vague and I can't put this in words to myself. I literally don't have the words to explain how I know.

And then comes the doubting, in the midst of all the fear and anxiety I keep wondering to myself ""maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm male"" but I don't believe myself. I can't stand the thought of growing old as a man, but transition scares me too much, I don't have a support network I can be sure of; I'm living with my parents who are not very open minded, and all my friends live an hour away and have a lot of their own problems.

Has anyone else had experience using a compounding pharmacy or received injectable estrogen from a compounding pharmacy? Is this safe and as effective?

when i take hormones, its like all my emotional and self awareness shuts off. i turn into nothingness.  i believe that i created a trigger where whenever i swallow the pills, i stop feeling, because when i started pills, they were DIY and i was scared and hating myself and depressed. its like im continuing that lack of feeling whenever i take the pills. and whenever i forget to take them and my levels start reverting, its like i become my ""old self"" and then i worry that that old self is more real than this real actualized self that lets me be happy, because i can't feel the happiness. In other words, when i forget to take a dose i start getting more irritable but also more aware.  its scary and it bothers me and to be completely honest, im lost and dont know what to do, but i believe i can take hormones and be happy about it instead of numb.  (and ive been on hrt for over a year, although i have anxiety about being trans in public, feeling like less of a person being a woman, so much patriarchy that i see and feel and i let it convince me to keep myself that way for them, instead of for me)  

i guess my real question is...i hope my real question is, how can i let myself feel good about taking hormones?  

dont get me wrong, im pretty sure im not trying to make myself feel anything that i wouldn't naturally feel; its just that i think i block all the natural feelings out, but they come out when i forget to take hormones because i dont know why, i was used to living without hormones for so long i guess?

Sad thing is I'm highkey desperate to have a more feminine voice, and my worry is that if I was to undergo vocal feminization surgery/training whatever, I'd lose any sort of credibility and wouldn't be able to continue my career on youtube which is my absolute dream job. 

I had a look around online and I've seen people with something (correct me if I'm wrong) called a Bifocal voice? Which gives them the range of a low sounding male to a feminine sounding voice. Regardless of how difficult or rare it is to achieve this sort of thing, I'd like to know at least my chances on achieving it and furthermore  the steps to take to achieve it.

TL;DR I'm medium-sized on youtube for my deep voice and want to know if I can achieve a female-male vocal range through tranining/surgery.

I am really confused for the past two months. I doubt myself. I am searching for a way to suppress or cope with this weird state that I am in right now.



The first memory goes back to when I was 9 years old. There was a school play in which I had a part where I was to ""disguise"" myself in order to escape... police or an investigator, don't really remember, but it made sense at the time in a way only school plays do. Anyways, I had to put on some lipstick and powder for the scene. As soon as I got to the backstage I shamefully wiped it all off. I felt really embarassed wearing it. I felt and knew it was inappropriate for a boy to wear makeup and I didn't want any of my classmates to make fun of me... But something clicked. I actually enjoyed it despite my internal strife.

Later at the start of middle school, just about a year before puberty hit me I discovered the joy of crossdressing. Everytime my parents left the building I leaped at the oportunity to dress up. I taught myself how to apply makeup and nail polish. With the progress of time I let my hair grow long as I liked it better that way. 

But as the hormones started circulating my body I regarded my crossdressing as a weird kink since it suddenly brought a lot of sexual arousal. All of my fantasies and wet dreams consisted of me being a girl having intercourse with a boy, very occasionaly a girl from my class that I liked. Sometimes I imagined actually being that girl. I never thought those fantasies were gay or wrong. I just accepted them naturally along with my puberty. Never have I wondered if and how they deviated from those of my peers.

I continued my habit of crossdressing for many months. But then came one fateful day, the day I almost got caught. I just applied pink nail polish onto my fingernails. I was so entranced by it that I didn't notice the absence of nail varnish remover. Just moments after the realisation my mother got home, earlier than I anticipated. I quickly ran into my bedroom, terrified, and locked myself in. I was stuck there with no means of removing the pink coating. The only solution I found at the time was sandpaper from my arts and crafts kit which resulted in a very painful experience..

My mother got on to me as she asked me about a pair of panties that disappeared from one of the drawers. I actually managed to scrape up a lame-ass story as to why they've gone missing. A convincing enough story that she never brought it up again. 

Since then I was scared to the bones and hid my habit somewhere deep into my subconsciousness. I had no need to wear women's clothing again.
The puberty did its number on me. I started sprouting a patch of beard and thick hairs all over my thighs and arms much to my dismay. I watched as my whole body slowly got engulfed by body hair. I hated body hair sooo much, didn't really care about facial though.

In highschool I fell for a girl from my class. I've never been so infatuated in my life. Fast-forward a year or so I cut my hair really short. I also started working out to the extreme. In the span of summer holidays my daily exercise consisted of hundred push-ups, thousand sit-ups and one to two hours down at the local fitness. A sudden rush of testosterone flooded my toned body and for once since the beginning of puberty I felt 100% aligned with my physical sex.

Fast-forward again, about two years later, I was rejected and friendzoned; she said that she saw me only as a good friend and also that she wasn't keen on dating guys anymore. I had to go through classes while she and one other girl from my class were kissing or cuddling all of the time, even during lectures right one or two rows behind me. I fell into a major depression. To battle it I started working out even more, to boost my shattered confidence and trust.

The dreams of being a girl subsided at the start of highschool, but my fantasies still carried on. I used to crawl around websites such as TGcomics to blow off some of the steam. When I wasn't searching for adult content I watched videos and vlogs on youtube of people transitioning. I remember admiring Kim Petras, the transgender german singer. 
If I ever questioned myself I'd go around forums where I'd diagnose and remind myself on a weekly basis that I'm just a fetishist. No more than that.

Later I continued my education at the university where I'd meet my girlfriend. Quite contrary to highschool I became quite an overachiever. I worked really hard at the university, which resulted in some quite outstanding grades but at the same time in a rapid decline of my mental fitness. Due to my stubborn character I aimed not just to finish but to reach the highest possible grades. In february the exam dates were set. Each consecutive day I finished one exam and upon arriving home started revising for another. In that week alone I must have drank around twenty energy drinks. My body wasn't tired, but my mind took a beating. After the exam week passed my tired brain blew into smithereens.

I was rushed into the ER. At the time I thought that was my last day on earth. I couldn't feel my fingers, my nose, hands, actually no limbs at all. My whole skin itched as if something was crawling under it.

It was that crash that caused the reapperance of what I think could be dysphoria. I was told not to overload anymore or I will end up again at the ER. The absence of any mathematical/programming challenges made me think about myself, not my career but my body and mind. I couldn't put my finger on it but something nerved me once again after many years.

During the summer holidays I went to visit some relatives with my family. That is when my dreams of being a girl reappeared, really vivid and erotic. In one of them I dreamed that I was naked between the sheets with the ex of my best friend. I awoke exhausted and didn't want to go back to sleep. 

Driving back home on the autobahn I had a really terrible headache as my mind battled against itself. After several hours only one thought remained. 
*I am transgendered.*
Suddenly I fell into an euphoric state. It felt so liberating.
Some things made sense. Why I occasionally mispronounced myself with a female pronoun. Why I secretly liked it when people commented that I was the woman in the relationship or whenever my gf said that I was acting feminine. Why I hated body hair. Why there have been occasions where for a moment people looked at me weirdly or doubted my sexuality because I reacted or acted just like a girl.

But on the other hand some things didn't make sense. If I really were trans then I wouldn't feel that comfortable in my male skin and gender role all throughout highschool.

That euphoria of fake realisation lasted for a few days but was cut short by the disappearance of my father. He went alpine hiking and was never seen again. My family lay in disarray. Me and my uncle took a week off and together with the police and the rescue crew scavenged the whole mountainous area but to no avail. He is stil missing.

From then on my mother started reading the bible and religious texts. She has alwas been open-minded, to a certain degree, but what happened left a heavy mark that changed her forever.
It also pulled me down from cloud nine back to earth. Not only was I in shock and feeling depressed, I had to take on the role that I didn't like. I've been a shoulder to cry on for my mother and my grandmother for the next few weeks.

Now I crossdress in my free time when I am home alone. I get almost zero sexual satisfaction out of it. When I look in the mirror while dressed in female clothing I don't like seeing my reflection. I wish I truly was female, but that wish arises only when I'm dressed up. When I am not I just feel confused and uneasy, most of the time wishing that this thoughts would fade away.

I know it isn't wise to draw any conclusions without a proper consultation with a specialised psychologist but I'd like to hear your opinions. 
Am I a fetishist? 
How can I fight, subdue or avoid what I presume could be(hope not) dysphoria? 
Should I go back to fitness and heavy daily workout, has anyone tried masculizing themselves and did it help in the long run?"
Samara_blue,asktransgender,"Looking to start hormones, not sure where to begin. Can someone give me some insight on how to get started?","Ok, so I'm looking to start hormones.

My gender dysphoria has been getting worse lately and I really feel like I need to start my actual medical transition. I'm not honestly sure how to go about acquiring those magic pills though. 

I just moved to Toronto a few weeks ago and I don't have a GP nor did I have one back home in Nova Scotia. My counselor back in NS recommended Sherbourne Healthcenter to get started. Seems like a great place but they told me they're currently not taking on anymore patients. So where should I go from here? I know I need to get tests done before I can get a prescription for hormones. I'm just terrified of seeing someone who isn't trans-friendly nor do I even know how I would go to. I tired to look up some information on the internet but honestly it was hard to discern where to go or what the first step I need to take is. Any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated, especially if you've done this process in Ontario. Even if you're not from Toronto but you have some insight into the process of acquiring hormones I would love to hear about it. Thanks! &lt;3 :)"

carefreearchgeek,asktransgender,"Going to speak to my GP in two days, any advice","UK based. I'm not going to get a referral to a GIC yet, I'm not at the point where I'll be comfortable with things being that ""real"". I'm going to get advice on finasteride, and to see if she does private prescriptions for it. I'm planning to come out though for two reasons; one, so I don't get brushed off and stonewalled on the finasteride, and two so she has a chance to maybe do some research and get comfortable with the idea of having a trans patient, or if she seems particularly resistant to the idea of having a trans patient so I know to change GP.

Anything I should consider? I don't think I'll bring the current NHS trans protocols; I've got a copy but I'm not looking for a referral so I don't think it's necessary.

Well it's one week down running on E, so I figured I'd just share what's happened to me so far and see what others have experienced when they started E or started T.

Slight smell change! I don't smell as much while sweating, I don't smell like a girl either there is just no scent now.

Slightly dry skin, had to change to a coconut milk body wash due to this.

I feel better! Probably just psychological but my anxiety is way down.

Nipples are a little sensitive. Not sore I can just kind of feel them there now and they are hard most of the time no was opposed to before they were innies mostly =P

Sleeping a little better, probably psychological.

That's mostly it for now, I really wish more would happen so I'd know if it's working &gt;.&gt;

fekalvi,asktransgender,When should I come out to my school?,"Hi!

MtF here. I'll *hopefully* be starting on hormones late October and I'm for sure getting my legal name change early March.

I'm attending a meeting with my school's advisor on Friday where I'll be coming out to the administration, presenting a doctor's notice etc. etc. Mainly just bureaucratic shenanigans. *However*, one of the topics will also be when to announce it to my classmates and teachers. The deadline is March when I get my new legal name and that'll appear on the list during role call. I figure that's not a very good way to come out.

My first thought is to check ""female""... as I am female :P But, I want to make sure I don't need any other information fixed so that I can update that field. I'm pre-op and I have not updated my birth certificate or license yet. Do I need any other information updated in order to update that field to indicate that I am female?"
RachelleKali,asktransgender,Keeping stealth mode for as long as possible,"So I'm only about three months in on my HRT.  There's been ups and downs and plenty of uncertainty wondering if I'm doing the right thing... you see, I want a female body for myself in private and to present (mostly) male as long as I possibly can.  I'm way, way, way behind on my voice and getting many other things fixed before then.

The scary thing is how quickly the changes are happening.  On the positive side I am definitely happier, catching myself grinning like an idiot at random times while driving (which would NEVER happen otherwise).  The dull ache behind my nipples was unsettling at first but now is a welcome reminder of the changes that are occurring inside me.

However, I put too much faith in a oft-shared diagram that the onset of breast growth might take months, perhaps years.  Mine are definitely forming quickly, much faster than I was prepared for.  As an example, I was speaking to a salesman at a motorcycle dealership, and in a moment of his breaking eye contact I saw him glance down and look at my chest.

That really, really caught me off-guard.  I can safely say my boobs at the moment are small and round, a bit too perky to be man-boobs and ... well, to his mind I'm sure he caught on 'there's something unusual going on down there'.

I suppose my question is; how long can one present in guy mode in public and really depend on a sports bra or binder?  I'm sincerely hoping people might think they're just man boobs, but sooner or later that's just not going to work anymore.

tl:dr: my boobs are coming in a little too soon and I'm in no way ready to have boobs in public.  How long can I get away with it?"
Invisible-Elephant,asktransgender,"Follow up to ""Got gatekept pretty hard today in Alabama""","So you can see my original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/52ghw6/got_gate_kept_pretty_hard_today_in_alabama/). If you saw that post, you may know someone on this subreddit advised me to file a complaint of incompetence to the Alabama State Medical Board. You may also know that someone else on this subreddit got outraged enough on my behalf that they contacted the clinic about this experience of mine. The clinic director made a Reddit account and posted in the thread specifically to ask me to call him the next day.

So, yesterday, after filling out the paperwork to file a complaint with the state medical board against Dr. Scott Weisberg of Magic City Wellness Center, Birmingham, AL (I'm gonna repeat his name every single post I can b/c he's a Harry Benjamin-style nightmare of a physician), I called up the director of the clinic. He apologized to me for my experience and tried to clean up the damage Dr. Weisberg had done, saying Weisberg had maybe not been clear enough--that Magic City Wellness does *not* require RLE. Perhaps there had just been a misunderstanding between the doctor and I, he wondered?

Yeah, perhaps, I admitted, I may have misheard him. But, as I pointed out to the director of this clinic, that's still on Weisberg. As the physician, it's his sworn duty to make sure I am informed, and make sure I understand. Particularly when dealing with a medical condition as sensitive as being transgender, I pointed out, having a doctor who is kind, polite, and very, very clear can make the difference for some trans people between elation and a possible suicide attempt.

But, furthermore, I noted, I *hadn't* misheard him about RLE. I reminded the director that according to the 2011 WPATH Standards of Care--which I imagine this supposedly trans-friendly clinic follows--RLE and full social transition should *never* be a prerequisite to HRT; furthermore, neither should a certain number be put on the amount of therapy a trans person needs, since doing so can make them see therapy as a hurdle rather than a helper. Dr. Weisberg, I informed the director, seems to be hewing to the 1970s-style Benjamin standards. I pointed out, in case the director was unaware, that it's actually 2016 now.

I let him know I appreciated his call, but that I would not be coming back to his clinic, and that I would be filing a complaint with the Alabama State Medical Board. After I finish typing this up, I'm going down to the library to make copies and I'm going to be mailing off my complaint at the local post office.

Fuck this shit. No one gets to set the standards for my femininity or for my legitimacy as a woman.

After this I started to want to get a complete outfit, makeup, breastforms and go out in public.  I eventually did so in for the first time in August and have gone out dressed 5 times.

I have noticed when I am dressed that I like how look in the mirror and I'm even willing to take selfies.  When I am dressed as a guy,  I absolutely hate taking selfies because I don't like what I see.  I thought this was just because I was overweight, but I lost the weight and just found new things to hate about my body (too much body hair, not a big enough butt, balding).

The softer skin thing though - although it's lovely to have softer skin, that has taken some getting used to: Between cultural stuff where it's ok for guys to have cuts and bruises and my literally being thicker skinned pre-transition, I was used to just kind of crashing around - now I cut the hell out myself if I'm not careful with a kitchen knife, get scratches all over my legs if I do yard work in shorts, and am constantly trying to keep my cats from clawing me and leaving marks when they cuddle me. And I bruise much more easily as well. 

I'm not complaining (even if it sounds like it), but it is something that I notice in little ways and it's something I've had to adapt to.

I have spoken to a couple of local hair removal places and they said they are unsure as well where to go and I should contact my GIC (as you all know contacting a GIC is about as effective as a chocolate teapot)

SO. Please can someone help me? I want to get underway because its already been too long. 

Should I contact my GP to apply to NHS England for funding? Or should I contact NHS England myself? Or do I indeed have to attempt to contact the GIC?

Many thanks to anybody who can help me.

Kind regards

SammyXO7,asktransgender,Name change in Wisconsin?,"I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me out with some more information on changing your name in Wisconsin than I can find online. I know you have to get a bunch of forms from the city hall, and I have to publish the name change in the paper once a week for 3 weeks before my hearing. 

Since I am away at school across the state, can I start the process here, even though it is not my hometown? Can I do it all here? What does the newspaper publish have to say? How expensive about is the whole process?

It'll probably be easier for me to do it here since I only go home once every 2 months or so, for a weekend at a time and I'm not sure if it's possible.

Thanks!"

Zoequest,asktransgender,Why am I seeing unicorns everywhere!?,"By unicorns, I mean other girls like me. 
I work IT support for a school, and I was called to troubleshoot a computer lab. There was a young woman who was in the room, who informed me that two of the eight computers were out of commission.

After I spoke with her, I knew we were kindred and I could only admire her courage from behind my own eyes. She was living a life that I wanted to so badly at her age. I was silently giddy as we crossed paths. I slyly attempted to speak within earshot to my coworker over the phone that I needed to fix this room so I could leave the poor girl to study. I hope she heard what I said and felt better because of it.

Still, there was a longing. I wish that we hatchling girls had some sort of secret handshake, where I could just somehow impart to her my feelings… “Sister, do you see me? I’m here as well, and I love you for who you are.” 

She was my god damn hero today.

Reddit is popular for girls half my age. Hopefully she’ll see this. Zoe says hi.

And yes, I fixed the computer lab.

Then, I got my first exposure to laser treatment. (Too long, different post. Tldr: fear, anxiety, weird feelings)
And I swear I bump into another god damned unicorn coming into the spa! She was tall, attractive, and as I pass her I think to myself, “Well, there I go again.” Whoever you were, Zoe says hi.

Fucking bonkers day. I’ve wasted enough time writing my thoughts down today. I’m going to shower, put on some makeup, slip into something cute and relax. The universe is funny sometimes.

So, I'm still trying to figure things out. However, there is still something else I need to know.

twasanotherthrowaway,asktransgender,It will be my first time experiencing Halloween. I have a couple of questions.,"Okay, so I know about a treaty-threating and I know that it's for kids. I'm almost 20 (in a few months) so I'm waaaay too old for that. But I've seen people on /r/transpassing and here dressing for Halloween and I thought that it may be an opportunity to go out in a girlmode for the first time without getting beaten or anything.

So, if you're dressing up, what for? It may sound weird, but I never experienced Halloween before and I don't know anyone in this country except for a people at work and my housemates (and one friend who's a straight guy but he accepts me the way I'm). Maybe I could meet with someone, because I'm sure that there's someone over here from Yorkshire (UK).

Is there any rules or something that I should know before? You know, it's all new for me, back in Poland only Halloween that I experienced was back in a middle school and kids were doing it only for fun. There were even guys who dressed like girls and they well, had a lot of attention. But in a bad meaning :P

It's not really trans-related question, but I thought that it's the right place to ask if I'm going to try going out in a girlmode then (but I'm scared since I will be only 5 and a half month on HRT). Also I know makeup basics and my friends say that I would pass with a little bit of an effort. But I don't believe them and I'm going to buy my first set and start experimenting. Who knows, maybe this security officer who kicked me out of a male toilet few days ago was right?"
shleyneedshelp,asktransgender,shrinkage,hey all how long did it take for testes to shrink after starting hrt
linguisticsdude,asktransgender,To stop transition or keep going? I'm just so tired. (FTM),"Hey everyone,

We've all seen those posts that say stuff like, ""transitioning isn't for all trans people"" and so on. After 6 months HRT.. I think I may be one of them. Case-in-point: I can't handle the stress. I'm done with the comments and the questions. I'm. Just. Tired.

**In the past:**
* Nov. 2015: Realized/acknowledged I was transgender. I didn't quite identify as FTM at this point, but just **knew** I was trans.

* Dec. 2015: Began experimenting with male pronouns, dress, and manners in private/at home only. I came out to my therapist, my boyfriend of 3 years, and a professor. 
* Late Dec. 2015 - early January 2016: Experienced suicidal thoughts and extreme depression due to being trans. I cried every day, called multiple suicide hotlines, and almost self-harmed because I didn't want to be trans. But, as the saying goes, once the box was open.. I couldn't close it again. I couldn't be in denial anymore.
* January 2016: Identified as more FTM. Began looking extensively into top surgery and everything and *anything* I could find on FTM transition. I must have spent 6+ hours per day online reading everything that I could. Also began using he/him pronouns and a new name.
* February 2016: Began HRT.
* March 2016: Came out to my siblings as FTM (both negative reactions).
* April 2016: Began getting the ""what happened to your voice..?"" and ""are you sick..?"" questions.
* May 2016: Came out to more people including my roommate, teachers, friends IRL and online, etc. because I couldn't hide my voice anymore.
* June 2016: Started a new job where I was perceived as male 100% on the first day. I was shocked because I didn't feel like I was ""trying"" to look masculine. The first time I felt doubt that transitioning was the right thing for me. 
* July 2016: Came out to my mother as transgender (not FTM specifically, but I didn't get a chance to go into detail). Extremely negative reaction including her disowning me/kicking me out from the family. Legally changed my name and gender.
* August 2016: Made an appointment for top surgery consultation, 100% sure I want it, no matter if I'm FTM or trans masculine or genderqueer. 
* September 2016: Came out to some new co-workers after they saw a picture of me pre-transition and got confused. /shrug, nothing I can do about it. 

Yesterday, I had a top surgery consultation where my surgeon essentially told me this: *I wasn't ready*. 
I could barely listen to her after she told me this. I felt like I wanted to jump off the roof of the medical center's building. I cried and shook in my boyfriend's arms, barely keeping it together long enough to make it out of the building. As soon as we got to the car, I let everything out: I cried, and sobbed, and screamed, and yelled. 

And I kept crying until I felt too tired to cry anymore.

**Currently:**
At this point, I've stopped T for about a month. The changes were happening too fast for me. I've lost my hips, my voice, my curves, my feminine face, and gained an abysmal collection of body hair (thanks genetics). 

But honestly, at this point? I'm thinking about de-transitioning altogether. I'm so f*****g tired. Tired of the comments, tired of explaining myself, tired of the stares, tired of panicking at the bathroom doors, tired of my family, tired of my co-workers, tired of just.. everything related to my transition. 

It's not that I'm not trans. I know I am.. of some form. I guess I don't identify as male or female (whatever that means). But my life will be SO MUCH EASIER if I were to just be a girl. No questions, no stares. No comments. No getting told I'm not ready for top surgery. No .. anything.

YES, I want to be myself. But I don't see that as the best option. Transition has DESTROYED me, mentally and physically. I almost killed myself several times, I'm depressed, and I'm exhausted (i.e. battle fatigue). 

Maybe some people can handle transition, but mentally? I don't think *I* can. I already have mental health issues, and this has just added onto it 10 fold. 

Life would just be easier as a girl. Would I be the happiest person ever? No. Would I be more comfortable? Maybe. Would it make my life easier? Hell yes.

I would like to know if others have felt the same way as me.. that what I'm feeling isn't uncommon, maybe? Do all people who transition feel this way? 

**TLDR;** Been on HRT 6 months, stopped HRT 1 month ago, considering de-transitioning back to F because I'm so damn tired and it would make my life easier. Are these doubts normal?

pherhaps,asktransgender,Could this be because of my Dysphoria?,"Hey guys,
So I identify as a MtF 14 year old. So, I don't have too much dysphoria, but enough to know it is there. I hate the idea of having thick hands, fingers, legs, arms, etc. I also dread the idea of one day having a masculine face, hair everywhere, thick body as a whole and a masculine body overall. So, ever since I was small, I have picked on my skin, scabs, pimples etc. I was wondering if this is because of my dysphoria, and could possibly be a subconscious form of self-hurting as a way to relive stress. I also have Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder, so it could be that/also that. Any input on this?"

hey_im_allison,asktransgender,Went full time at work...Update!,"Hey yall! I wanted to share with you how the rest of my week went. 

The next day I came into work and the announcement email about my transition had been sent out. Definitely a day late and a dollar short, but I thought it was really well done and very professional.  You can read it [here](http://imgur.com/a/wGHzL)! 

Everyone in my department seemed to still be very supportive. I was also impressed by how fast my colleagues adapted to my chosen name, as I havn't gotten deadnamed once since the email. 

I've had a lot of girls from outside my department at work come up to me and tell me how cute I looked, which I was expecting. One lady even stopped me and said my legs looked amazing and were way better than hers. I'm just not used to this kind of attention in person!

The only real mishap was yesterday when I got my new work badge. Someone who obviouslly wasn't very smart made my new badge with my name but didn't put my updated picture on it. So i felt very terrible when I saw Allyson with my most hated picture ever on it. I emailed the head of HR who had been helping me with everyone and she said she would get it fixed ASAP. They take this shit seriously!

Yesterday the vice president (wow!) called me in for an impromptu meeting. He asked me how my experience had been so far. I told him everything was great except the badge incident and that everyone had been very accommodating and accepting. He assured me that he and the company had my back and wanted to do whatever they could to make my experience go as well as possible. I thanked him, and he told me that if I have any issues or need anything to feel free to come right to him as he would make sure that it gotten taken care of. I just really couldn't believe it.

Today went well. I work in a call center doing web design tech support so I'm being forced to practice my voice all day long which is great, as it definitely needs work. I get misgendered on the phone every once in a while, but I try to just use it is motivation rather than let it get to me.

Overall I'm just over the moon on how well everythings gone in my workplace. I guess I just want to say that if you are looking for a very forward thinking company to work for, First Data is an excellent place to be. First Data is a credit card processing company if you don't know, which has careers of many different paths including call centers to technology etc. Their policies to protect LGBT employees are absolutely fantastic, and my experience is proof that they actually follow through with what they say. I honestly don't think it could have been any better, and I don't see any reason to leave this company.

TuffTuffy,asktransgender,Can anyone help me with my confusion?,"Warning: Long Post.
I cannot bear this confusion any longer. I really am clueless as to whether or not I am actually transgender. Let me give you a backstory. I’m going to start from the… well, start. I don't know if this is considered personal agenda but I need to explain everything from the beginning.

My mom gave birth to me and was assigned male, based on my genitals.
I grew up as a male, and never questioned it. I mean, I DID use to play with dolls secretly, but my 3-4 year old brain thought it was normal. That sort of began to change when I was watching an episode of a cartoon, where there was this girl who turned out to be an alien that could transform to anything. That got me so excited. That still didn’t make me think about my gender, but it made me interested in transformations. Not any kind of transformations, I’m talking about transformations from male to female. 

This REALLY escalated when I found out that there are videos of these transformations on YouTube, I was obsessed by them. An interesting thing that I noticed is that I don’t like other transformation videos, whether it’s animals, objects, other creatures, they just didn’t interest me. I’m afraid this might mean it’s a sick fetish, but I don’t think so, for reasons that I will touch upon later.

I began realizing, around 10 years old, that I might’ve wanted to REALLY be a girl. I liked wearing makeup, nail polish, dresses, skirts, panties, bras, high heels, boots, etc… And I also looked for hypnosis videos (although they didn’t work)… Until puberty started. 

I did all kinds of “boy” stuff, things that I usually don’t like: playing football, acting rough to all people around me, having some “private time” (I hate this the most), and other stuff that makes me pass as a teenage boy. I didn’t really mind. 

But then the girl feelings came back, 3 or 4 years later: I hated body hair, my deepening voice, the fat going to my belly, the shoulders getting broader and broader, I felt a disconnection looking at my reflection in the mirror, and that awful, awful thing between my legs. I despised having random, uncontrollable erections. It just felt uncomfortable.

At the same time, I was jealous of other girls. I was jealous of how good they looked, how comfortable they felt being themselves. I envied their ability to talk about whatever they wanted to discuss with ease. I craved having what they had, doing what they did… and I couldn’t understand why, at first.
It took me years. Surfing on the internet, looking up things like “How to be a girl”, “What does being a girl feel like”, and most importantly, “I want to be a girl”. These keywords helped me find what the word refers to as “Transgender”. Surprised to find that such thing (hopefully the term “thing” isn’t offensive, I’m just writing what my mind thought at the time) existed, I kept researching. I wasn’t the only one, apparently. So, I kept looking for information. Can, and did these people change the way they feel? Suppress this feeling? I found out more and more. Things like HRT, surgeries to change your genitals and other parts, the fact that there are different kinds of transgender people…

2 side notes: First, I didn’t watch any of the TG transformations videos at all since puberty started, I find them boring now. Second, is that, when I found out about FtM transgender people, my immediate reaction was “Why would someone transition to a man? It’s disgusting!” And I don’t mean this as hating on the FTM transgender people, I actually like, understand and respect them. It’s just that, at the time, a man turning into a woman was understandable, but not the opposite, because I told myself “Why would someone change his body to an inferior form?” (Again, don’t mean to offend you, it’s just that my mind thought like that, at the time.)

It took me years to actually accept that I am transgender, or at least that’s what I think I am. It took me a bit of time after that to actually tell my parents, and it wasn’t easy. I couldn’t tell them directly, face-to-face. So, for mom, I sticked some notes on my bedroom’s door, and she read them. She didn’t talk to me about it, aside from telling me “We’ll talk about this with your father.” She also told me the next day to get a haircut, which has stung me a little. For dad, I hinted at the subject using his job as a way to make telling him the news easier. See; he’s a psychiatrist. His reaction was something alongside the lines of “You’re probably confused. What you’re feeling is most likely a lack of masculinity, not being transgender. Just wait a bit.” This line made my eyes water, something I usually can’t do. I still wasn’t able to cry though. His comment also made me depressed and had me spending the night awake. 

But, at the same time, it prompted me to do some research. Research about if being transgender is just a phase, if it’s a choice… the answers were clear, but I am still unsure. Unsure if I’m really transgender, or just confused because of some sick obsession? I’ll talk more about this later.
I also came out to my sister, and her only problem was “Nature created us one way, we shouldn’t tamper with nature’s creations.” Bear in mind that she said “Shouldn’t” as a way of just stating her opinion, and not trying to make me feel bad about myself or anything.

Additional information: I hate everything about puberty. Voice getting deeper, thick body hair everywhere, facial hair (right now it’s only the mustache but uuuggghh), shoulders getting more broad, muscle development, fat distribution (STOP GOING TO MY BELLY), sweat smell, bone structure, and most importantly, the random, uncontrollable erections. They look horrendous and they feel very, VERY uncomfortable.

However, I don’t feel as much dysphoria as many others would. I don’t get immediately irritated when someone calls me by male pronouns, but I do get sad when someone tells me “He looks just like his father!”, “He’s going to become a great man!”, “Sorry, but it’s only girls allowed.”, “Nice mustache!” It just feels weird. Basically, it wouldn’t be absolute hell if I stayed as male, but I would very much rather transitioning to feel better. I wouldn’t become suicidal if I wouldn’t transition, at least, not yet.

Also, I have diabetes and live in Tunisia, where transphobia and homophobia is off the chart, so I doubt I’d find a gender therapist or anything related to that. Religion doesn’t matter.								

UPDATE: This is a terrible day. My dad did a psychological test on me, which is basically answering 479 yes/no questions on a computer screen. My father supposedly said that my answers indicate that I'm a 15 year old male, but I can't shake the feeling that he's lying, as no questions had anything to do with gender roles/gender preferences, except for a question that states: DO YOU WANT TO BE FEMALE? Obviously, I answered yes, but I guess it doesn't matter. 

He also took the opportunity of me having my blood test today to see if my testosterone level is ""normal"" for someone my age. And if it is, it's going to prove to him that I'm male. And if THAT wasn't enough, mom forced me to cut my hair, since we're back to school tomorrow and I looked ""Ugly with hair like that."" 

I don't know what to do anymore."

transtossawayaccount,asktransgender,"[NSFW] Tucking. Little P, big T, lots of issues. Need some help.","NSFW since, well, ladycock. 

MTF, and full time. My full time wardrobe has been moving slowly but surely more and more feminine as the weeks go by. I jumped the fence as a new years resolution, finally, after putting it off for a very very long time. 

Now, as my wardrobe has become more suitable, I'm having more and more of an issue hiding the fact I'm sporting a ladycock. The thing is though, the penis portion of said is extremely small, but testicles are not. 

First intimate relationship actually referred to me as freakishly wrongly proportioned. Did nothing good for my self esteem, but in the end, it's a fair assessment. Flaccid, without pulling on it, I've got about an inch to work with. If it's really cold, I have an 'inny'. Hard, for good measure, under 3 inches. 

Yes yes, I know, surgery's going to require additional skin grafts. 

Testicles are another matter. Left one's broken. Literally. It was smashed when I was a kid, accident while hiking and a tree limb involved. It feels more like a blob of silly putty that squishes than a testicle. The right, grew to make up for the lack of the left. It's about the size of an average lemon, a little larger than the average lime. The left tried to grow too, so it's a largish mush ball, so to speak. 

I can link guide after guide after guide, and none of them work for me. They talk about stretching the penis over the balls to hold them in their channels. Mine doesn't make it past them. The length of my one good testicle, the long way, is about the length I am, hard. 

My few experiments with sports tape have been spectacular failures. A maxipad didn't help much to hide things either. Is there any decent 'this is how you use tape to hide your balls' guide, or a garment that would take the place of the penis for a tuck? Tigher pants and inability to keep them in their hidy holes tends to end up with a crushing desire to find the nearest bathroom to rescue myself from my pants. 

If a garment is involved, that's fine by me. Extra pairs of panties doesn't help too much, since due to ball size, I usually end up with one popping out the sides, and oh god does that hurt so so bad. 

Any suggestions very much welcomed.

konrankonran,asktransgender,"I feel like transitioning has made my life futureless, empty, just like nothing.","Separated with my wife I love dearly. We are on good terms. Started HRT a month ago, but in guy mode I'll feel dysphoric once every few weeks and one large dysphoria every couple months, but nothing too bad. However, now I take meds and lost my wife, feeling empty, sad, hopeless comes in at almost any time. I cannot even drive without thinking the hell I've carefully crafted out for ourselves. I wonder if I can just stop taking the meds and endure - but either way, seems like both cases are a lose-lose. Not transition - pain gets more. Transition - sadness and regret for a long time or even the rest of life.

This is driving me towards suicidal despite I try so hard to comfort myself. The thoughts don't show up mostly but when it does it is almost crippling. My negativity has overflown so much I think I'm just a pure annoyance and nuisance to my friends, that I decided to mute them so I won't bother them for now. I've no one to talk to now, albeit close to a 1000 ""friends"".. Anyway, I don't think I can talk about it without sounding like a negativity foundation. The only thing I can do is I pay people to listen (therapists). How lame. I think I brought this upon myself, completely. What should I do?

meetmario,asktransgender,Is intense sexual desire a symptom of dysphoria?

I had of course done this before, but never in such a short timespan, and never so successfully (I got my nails and wax done rather than doing them myself, and it shows).

In the evening I went out with a cis girfriend. First evening out, ever! Yay! As long as I didn't speak a word, amazingly, I seemed to pass. People would look really surprised the moment I'd talk, and I saw a few guys check me out from head to toe. A cute waiter - to whom I had spoken earlier - came over at the end of the evening to express admiration. I loved it. 

I had a fun night and went home. This morning I woke up to the most intense sexual fantasies about men, and I can't seem to stop them. 
They are not unpleasant, quite the opposite, but they are unwelcome, because I am on a monogamous relationship with a cis woman I love, and I am terrified at the prospect of losing her. The sexual pull towards men is driving me crazy though.

It's really hard to miss the connection between the change in presentation, the exciting night out, and these ridiculously hot fantasies. Does anyone else recognize them as part of their dysphoria?

How do you cope?"

PennyLisa,asktransgender,"Does anyone find ""I am supportive"" a bit offensive?","I mean it's nice to hear that people are supportive of you transitioning and all, but I feel like it's sometimes a bit... IDK. 

Like, first of all it really doesn't mean they're ""supportive"" it's more like they accept it. I don't think I've actually had someone who said that give actual support, as in asking if I'm OK, or if there's anything they could do. I don't *expect* people to give their actual support, I kinda got this one. Plus I have had some wonderful friends, but they didn't ""declare their support"" so much as just be good people and good friends.

Secondly sometimes I feel like they want some kind of prize or recognition for being so accepting or something. Like accepting someone's transness somehow makes them a good person, whereas really it just means they're not a total jerk. 

I'm always appreciative of course and happy when people say it, and give my genuine thanks and gratitude. But people don't declare their support for you like... getting married or whatever. ""I'm pregnant!"" ""Oh and I'm supportive of that!"". 

Still, ""congratulations"" seems a bit trite too, congratulations for getting to a place where you had to make this radical life change and deal with all the shit that shakes out? 

IDK I guess people just don't quite know what to say. I almost feel a bit guilty about thinking these things about people declaring their support. I get that they feel the need to say something, like to acknowledge that elephant in the room. You get this ""Holly shit you sure look more like a girl than last time I saw you"" look, and then they don't quite know what to say, so they declare their support. 

I think what I most like is when people say stuff like ""You look radiantly happy"" and ""You seem much more at peace with yourself"". Those are the real gold comments. Acknowledging what this whole process is all about to me - being at peace with myself.

It's really such a strange process. "
BroatCaptainGary,asktransgender,"Overwhelmed Cis Male Here, Looking For Some Advice Off You Ladies About Androgynous/Non Gender Identity","Hi! 23 dude from Ireland here, long time lurker, first time caller. This is gonna be long sorry(not really sorry)


For the longest time I was unconsciously suppressing the female side of me while trying to live up to social masculine norms that were completely self imposed. I found myself quite drawn to the whole sissy porn thing, watching hypnos and all that. This would further compound my masculine guilting and make me feel so much worse. I think by suppressing the female side of me it was manifesting in a hyper sexual way, but idk I'm not Freud. Anything I considered camp or effete I would worry endlessly that people would think I was womanly or gay, this became a big OCD obsession.

All this, with other factors, added to me basically having a breakdown last summer, I became major depressed and my OCD went off the charts. After a winter of moping about the house watching Withnail and I on repeat and crying about my shit life in the shower, I got myself together and into therapy. I basically transformed my whole way of thinking over the summer and I FEEL AWESOME, life is class!! How cool are people sometimes!? Apples are so tasty wow!! Doggos and my nephews!

I realised there are two very strong male and female parts to me, it almost feels like they're running in parallel to each other, like they're not competing if that makes sense? If I'm hanging out with a group of male friends, there's always a certain point where I'll feel ""I don't belong and I can't relate"" and it's the exact same when I'm hanging out with my female friends.

But recognising and actively encouraging the female side of me feels so great, it gives me a sense of peace and contentment I have not had for a long time. But I feel quite overwhelmed in the sense that its like, what do I do now? What do I call myself? Should I act more masculine or feminine? How do you figure this stuff out? If one of you could be so lovely as to point me in the right direction, I would be hugely grateful. I'm very clueless, in many, many ways.

Sidenote: I've also found the more I explore this the more I feel a connection to the experience of trans people and I have a desire to try dating a trans woman, how do I go about this without coming across as a weirdo fetishist type? I follow some trans folk on Twitter and this seems to be a problem for them on dating sites.

a_username_0,asktransgender,"Why do people use ""Male"" or ""Female"" as a label for their gender?","This is an issues I've had for a while and would love to hear peoples thoughts on it.  I see people now and again say their gender is ""female"" or ""male"".  To me this seems like an artifact of the conflation of sex and gender in our society.  ""Man"" and ""woman"" are genders while ""male"" and ""female"" are sexes.  It seems like when people use words generally associated with describing ones sex to instead describe their gender, it confuses people and them meaning of the words.  Anyone who ID's their gender with the words ""male"" or ""female"", why do you do it? Why not ""man"" or ""woman""? 

Also, non-binary people who identify as a ""non-binary trans man"" or ""non-binary trans woman"", why?  Isn't ""non-binary"" a contradiction to being a ""man"" or ""woman""?  Why wouldn't you use a term like ""gender nonconforming trans man"" or gender nonconforming trans woman"" to describe yourself?"
MauricioBabilonia,asktransgender,"A better alternative to ""What is your preferred pronoun?""","Hello! Many in the student activist circle in Canada open events by getting people to go around and say their name and preferred pronoun. I have always felt uncomfortable with this practice. While this question is a very easy one for cispeople to answer, every trans/non-binary person I've ever seen asked their preferred pronoun gets uncomfortable as they have to decide how to present their gender to a group of strangers.

At the same time I think that the question does raise a conversation that is useful. I recently said I was trans at a meeting, prompted by this question, and someone else in the room later told me they were trans too, and now we're becoming friends. The question is kind of awful to answer but offers the option to out yourself or not in a pretty quick manner.

But due to circumstances (and that I have extremely mild dysphoria and a fear of making life altering decisions given my history of changing my mind on things) I don't think I'll ever transition.

Thing is I'll occasionally think of being on hormones and transitioning, and it'll make me emotional, down, and feel like crying (but I never do). Is this normal??? Part of ke is thinking it's proof not to transition because I'll regret it (at least I think I get that way because I'll regret it deep down).

Tgheidi,asktransgender,I keep denying that I am transgender.,"I made a post about whether there is a scientific way to tell if we are really transgender.

I told her I honestly don't know how to answer that, then she looked at my post history and quoted something I said a few months ago, ""deep down I want to be a woman very strongly"". 

Why did I say that? Surely I don't want to be a woman, right? But after a few minutes of self reflection, I realised yes, you are right, I still very much want to be a woman. It is because I can't transition so I told myself I wasn't transgender. But I could never say I wanted to be a man because that would be too blatantly a lie so I told you I didnt know how to answer the question. 

Another commenter told me cisgender people never do tests to confirm whether they are transgender. If I am looking for tests and questionnaires to answer this question, then I'm up for ""a surprise"".

Yes I am finding something to tell me I am not transgender because I can't transition and need some tests to tell me not transitioning is the right decision.

Bronzefrog,asktransgender,Does anyone know trans-positive intellectual/philosophical literature or blogs exploring the concept of gender and gender identity?,"Hello!

Being trans myself, I want to explore the concept of gender and gender identity from an intellectual and philosophical viewpoint (rather than only from my personal experiences). It is easy to find on the web a trans-negative/bigoted/Terfy opinion on these matters; but I want to find well defended and trans-positive viewpoints/analyze of gender and gender identity. 

I mentioned ""literature"" and ""blogs"", but it can be academic papers, books, blogs, videos, podcast or other media. 

However I'm primarily searching philosophical/intellectual/sociological/etc sources, so I'm not really interested by biological/neurological studies. I'm aware of these papers, don't disagree and find the studies interesting, but I don't believe that it answers all the questions about gender identity and gender per se (for example : how to define and separate a male/female/NB gender identity from the other?). However, I have no problem with someone using them as arguments to defend their conception of gender and gender identity.  

I should also say that I already know the work of Zinnia Jones; and that the blog Natalie Reed (so sad she closed it a few years ago) and the book ""Whipping Girl"" from Julia Serano are on my ""to-read"" list.

I would be really glad if I could find other well-tought and trans-positive viewpoints on gender and gender identity."

Hannah_86,asktransgender,Is it really dysphoria?,"Okay, so I'm pretty sure that I want to transition but I also find it important to understand the things I'm experiencing and don't want to fool myself so I've got a question about physical dysphoria.

I realized I'm trans about 3 months ago and before that I've had a couple of things that I assume fall under the category of physical dysphoria, for example:

* I've always wanted long hair and it was depressing to learn my hair was thinning.
* My arms/hands/legs/feet always felt too big/long.
* I was always frustrated my face didn't look more masculine (or in other words: I couldn't radiate masculinity the way I wanted to).
* I was frustrated my voice deepened because I loved singing high notes.

Besides that I've always had this nagging feeling that something was wrong. Now that I've come to realize I'm a trans girl that nagging feeling was replaced by very specific things, such as facial structure, shoulders, hips, that stupid deep voice and of course that thing down there ...

Suppose I hate my life and I want to die but I suddenly get it into my head that I might be trans and use that to escape my shitty reality. Then it would easy to ""develop"" dysphoria because when I look in the mirror I don't see who I want to see because I know how a girl is supposed to look like and I'm not seeing that.

For example I have never experienced genital dysphoria until 3 months ago but since then I've come to hate that thing dangling between my legs because it just looks wrong. Hm, maybe 2 things: (1) when I was in high school I had this fantastic realization that a penis is ""sort of like a clitoris"" and I was super excited about that and wanted to share that with people and (2) I've never wanted to use it the way it was intended to (I sometimes even tried to masturbate without an erection ... if that makes sense). Also I was always fascinated by girls ""not having something there"".

Okay, so now that I've come to think about it maybe I experienced *some* genital dysphoria so maybe not the best example, but still ...

tl;dr: 2 questions:

* 1. **Has anyone heard of people thinking they're trans and then developing dysphoria because they've had a shitty life and used that as the ultimate escape/excuse but then later realized that they just needed to work on their other issues?** I'm pretty sure this is not the case for me but I'm still curious if this is a thing.
* 2. **When you realized later in life: did you notice a change in dysphoria after your realization?** I feel like my nagging feeling of ""something's wrong with me"" was replaced by ""I know exactly what's wrong and I am increasingly frustrated by A, B, C, ..."". I've been feeling like this steadily for 3 months now so I guess that's a sign I'm heading in the right direction.

ps: it's funny that you can suddenly link things together when you're writing about it :) I need to write more!

(edit) pps: okay ... apparently I really did have genital dysphoria before I had my realization ... ugh. I'm still kicking myself in the head that to this day I keep remembering stuff from now to when I was 10 years old that screamed ""You're trans, you moron!"". But nooo ... just repress it all ... that'll turn out to be great. /rant"

SmolBirbPrincess,asktransgender,Does anyone know how much the HRT services provided by Planned Parenthood cost?,"I cannot find a reliable answer to this question online currently and I figured someone here may be able to answer it for me.
I'm 17, and still haven't really told anyone about that fact that I'm trans or at least think I am (aside from having a conversation with a friend regarding me questioning my gender, though, that was to just test their reaction more than anything). My parents are not really the worst in the world, and have made it clear before that if I were to come out as gay that they would love me all the same, but I know they would never be okay with me being trans. This of course means they would never help pay for any kind of transitioning. 
The questioning of my gender started around the time I turned 16, and I didn't really accept that I did not feel right as a male; of course here we are now, so you can see how that was resolved. So as of late, I'm trying to make a plan for the next few years of my life after turning 18; essentially outlining costs, and what I will need to do to cover them to try and transition as soon as possible.
While working on that, I learned fairly recently that the Planned Parenthood in my town in now providing HRT services, and naturally I would very much like to know whether it costs more or less than what I would expect elsewhere. But two problems get in the way of finding this information:
A.)The specifics of how much Planned Parenthood charges is nowhere to be found on their site, or any affiliated source. Just the statement that costs will vary based upon insurance. (And in my case, I do not have insurance. In fact, my family does not have insurance.)

and

B.) My father actually tracks my texts and calls; and with that being the case, I cannot call the Planned Parenthood in my town without avoiding a conversation with my father as to why I would call Planned Parenthood.

... I wrote a little too much for this question...
Tl;dr: I cannot find out how much the HRT services cost, and am unable to contact the Planned Parenthood in my town."
wildwriting,asktransgender,I'm writing a book and I need your help with pronouns,"Hello, people of this sub. I'm a writer. I'm working in an alternate history novel.

Without boring you with my dark-low-urban fantasy too much, let's just say that I have this character, an intersexual transgender. I've taken the concept from the Mexica culture (they recognized seven intersexual categories... or something like that, we don't really know a lot about it).

This character isn't male or female. They are one of the three most powerfull mages in the world.

Problem is... as you can see, English isn't my first language. The novel is in Spanish, the there is no chance to use the plural to refer to this character. Most words have genders in Spanish, totally binary, to the point that, in real life, whenever I meet a transgender I just ask them how they want me to call them.

So, to the point: how should I refer to this character? They have MOSTLY female traits (hips, breasts, etc). Should I just roll with calling them a she?

I can't use the plural, again, even that has gender (ellos - ellas).

Thank you for the help."

When I developed gynecomastia as a teen, I was so happy I never lost weight and continued to gain it. Or rather, SHE was so happy about it.

The more I try not to be her. The harder it is getting. She comes to the surface and I let her have a moment but she won't be denied, she is taking over and its terrifying me. It isn’t something I can just stop feeling, it isn’t something I can control. 

I'm losing the battle with her and it feels inevitable. I don’t want to be trans! I don't want to be this woman! I keep trying to suppress her and push this woman out of me and she comes back more and more frequently and I can suppress her shorter and shorter. I went to a gender therapist and after several sessions I was given a diagnosis of gender dysphoria in the moderate to strong degree. 

Even now, I'm in tears typing this. This would kill my parents but it's getting overwhelming for me. I can't make her go away under my own power.

I'm inclined to stay stealth in order to facilitate my girls having normal childhoods.  I don't think it would be good for them to be known as the kids with the transmom.

Since I was completely rejected by my former family, there are no issues there.

Anyone else out there in a similar position?  I'm open to anyone's thoughts though."
TheBatIsBack,asktransgender,What my parents are doing to my brother is really not cool.,"Not really a question, so I'm sorry in advance.

I'm just really upset with my parents, I finally came out to them a few weeks ago because I felt forced to for health reasons. My brother was one of the first people I came out to a few years ago and has been incredibly supportive the entirety of the time, and now that my parents know they're forcing him to read this book ""Living in the Gray.""

 He's reading it, but at his own pace, and my mom is chastising him for it because she feels he's not reading it fast enough. My mom has continuously been shoving conservative christian values down his throat when she gives him rides to and from his classes at college (because that's the only time he's alone with her) and now she's pulled my dad into the mix (who seemed to be previously neutral on the whole matter) because my brother got upset with her today for her antagonizing him over reading this stupid book.

Now my brother feels alone in his support for me and I just hate my parents for making him feel this way. I hate myself. Why can't I just be normal? All it seems like I'm doing is causing the people I love pain. I hate that I'm doing this to them. I'm such a shit person."
demcmd,asktransgender,Went shopping for girl's clothing for the first time. Thoughts?,"I posted this in /r/MtF a few hours ago, but want to see what recommendations people have about my outfit.

To summarize it quickly, I went to a Walmart with people from my pride club and one of them helped me pick out clothes.

If people want to know. I spent a total of $50 on the top, the long sleeve, jeggings, straight-short jeans and curvy-fit jeans. My size seems to range from 14-16 (jeggings are 14, the other two I think are 16) and my shirt size was XL and XXL depending on comfort (I'm pretty sure L could fit as well, but never grabbed it).

Thoughts? Any outfits you recommend me? Just to clarify, I like the plain-colored shirts like the ones in the images and LOOOOVE jeggings (normal leggings would be cool too!). Thanks! Link to pics are below.

I'm not out to my parents, but as soon as I turn 18, I plan to come out. I'll get disowned, I've already asked. It was like:

Me (Luce)- Hey mom, what would you do if I was transgender?

Mother- Disown you. I didn't raise a mother####ing transgender kid. Those ####ing perverts should be happy with the body god gave them, instead of making everyone else uncomfortable with their ####ottry. 

Me (Luce)- Alright, mom, nice talk.

So thankfully for me my family is poor. Like, really near the poverty line, single parent with one kid already in college poor. So most colleges with their net price calculator say that need and grant aid will cover most everything.

*But they need my mom to sign the FAFSA.* Ooph. So, given that I hope to go to a college in Pennsylvania (out of state), in either Temple University, Pennsylvania State, Carnegie Mellon, The University of Pittsburgh, or the University of Pennsylvania (really anywhere outside of Texas tbh), does anyone have any advice after I  get disowned by my parents?

BTW: When I get disowned, I'll already be in my freshman year. I'm just worried about sophomore-senior.

Also, I have 5k saved up (6-8k by the time I graduate, I did some technical writing online and drawings for a legal office, under the table) and hopefully I can use that to get HRT from Mazzoni in Philadelphia or other transition-related items."

I didn't look up any guides or anything. It was entirely spur of the moment, and I haven't shaved them since. And now I've got hundreds of red spots all over my legs (and some on my arms). My skin is absolutely awful to begin with and my really poor technique didn't help things.

Does anyone know what I can do about this? I've read posts saying that they clear up within a day but it's been weeks now.

I felt so uncomfortable being near them. It may sound mean but I just didn't want to talk to them. Maybe its like a fear of passing in myself that made me not want to interact with them. (Also some people really need to check out youtube makeup tutorials rather than just guess)

It made me feel a little ashamed but I don't want to choose who I talk to or be friends with just because of them being trans. Maybe its a form of transphobia.

jenlb714,asktransgender,Changing gender on birth certificate in Michigan,"Hello,

I was wondering if anyone here has gotten their birth certificate gender changed without anything stating surgery was completed? If you have, can you tell me what you did to get it changed?

Aside from all the typical reasons (money, desire, etc.), My wife and I feel like it is a complete invasion of privacy, discrimination and completely unnecessary to request such documents to get important documents to match who she is. It is noone's business what is between her legs. She is a woman and she has no reason to share anything that private with anyone besides herself and me (if she chooses). As far as I am concerned, if we cant get the documents changed easily, I will write to the governor or representative and try to get them to approve the change. If that doesnt work, then I will take it to a lawyer and work through a lawsuit. We haven't lived in Michigan in a decade and we shouldn't have to deal with this bullshit from another state, especially when our current state doesn't pry into the privacy of a transgender person's anatomy to get things changed. They only require a simply letter (if that) that states that she is being treated for gender dysphoria. She has enough to deal with already; she doesnt need the hell of getting documents changed with push back at every corner from Michigan. 

Sorry for the short rant. I hate dealing with Michigan in general but especially the court systems, and moreso because we are in another state and can't deal with people face to face to get shit done.

Anyways, thanks for any assistance anyone can provide."

I'm 18, and the women in my family are all fairly busty, my younger sister is easily a Dcup, and my mother is definitely a bit larger. I feel that due to my age, general good health and family I will probably have some significant breast growth, and probably fairly fast( I know ymmv). 

I'm scared that I might have some issues with stretch marks, because when I lifted weights for a while, the new muscles started to cause them on my arms in a matter of months. 

Is there any way I can potentially lessen this effect?

girlatnight,asktransgender,I'm having doubts again. I feel like I'm getting fake trans thoughts.,"**Just some info: I'm AMAB, turning 14 tomorrow, and started getting serious trans thoughts around 5 months ago. Please read this and leave a suggestion or something.**

A month and a half ago (before school started), my mind was set: *""I'm trans! There's no other explanation! I think of it all the time!""* This was when I spent the whole day at home, with not much interaction other than my parents and sister, so it was all I thought about.

However, now that school has started and I'm busy with other things, my trans thoughts are much more in the background; they're not something I worry about as much. Now I think: *""Transitioning would be too much work for something so relatively insignificant to me*"", which is a very different mindset from me a couple weeks ago.

&amp;nbsp;

This thought still stands though: **If I could live the rest of my life as a woman, with minimal harassment for transitioning, I'd definitely want to.** Simple enough, I'm trans, right? Well...

When I think of why I feel this way, I come usually to the conclusion that it's because I want to wear feminine stuff without getting harassed for being male. Really, most of it is cosmetic. However, if I could choose between being :

* a man that wears feminine stuff and doesn't get harassed at all for it

* a trans woman that wears feminine stuff and gets minimal harassment for transitioning

I'd probably pick the second option (mainly because I want to be pretty like women lol). Like, I'm fine with my body (mostly) and I'm usually fine with having the label of being a guy. But I'm not fine with having to conform to male gender norms and I'm extremely jealous that women can wear feminine stuff without being questioned.

I'm a strong believer in that in a perfect society, gender norms wouldn't exist, and the fact that the biggest reason for why I ""want"" to be a woman is so I don't get questioned for being feminine makes me feel really guilty.

And then at the end of the day, I think: *""I'm too young for this shit*"" and become sad.

I'm getting a security deposit back from my old landlord. The check is going to be 1800 bucks give or take. It will be made out to my old name. I've legally changed my name, gotten NY State Drivers licence with new name and gender, gotten SS card with new name and updated gender there. The one commercial bank where have an account has me listed as my new, female name after I had it changed. They would have my old name on record somewhere. I'm not sure if an on-site teller or banker would be able to look this up though.

I'm getting my check in the mail this week. My plan now is to go to Bank of America in person, bring my change of name court order form, maybe bring my old passport plus newer license, and cover all my bases by just showing them a ton of documents with both names on them.

This has to work, right? I don't see why it wouldn't. It's just that it's 1800 bucks and I would love to avoid any kind of delay on deposit or whatever other nonsense may occur. And no, I can't have the check re-written. At least not with ease. My former landlord is a Hasidic Jewish guy here in Brooklyn who won't acknowledge me. This would be a much, much, much larger hill to climb I think.

Thoughts? Advice? Would love any advice from someone who has dealt with this specific situation on how to get this done as efficiently as possible.

So I’m 22, almost 23. I’ve gone through life so far sort of getting by and not paying enough attention to myself and who I truly am. About 4 years ago I started to realise I wasn’t totally into girls. Like, I was, but something else was there that I couldn’t quite discover. I grew up to admire femininity more than seek it, if that makes sense? I think secretly I wanted to embody some of those values myself, but due to particular social/peer influence and my own inhibitions, I’d pressed that down and chosen to ignore it. Fast forward to me here today and I feel like an absolute mess. I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m definitely not straight - that I’m somewhere closer to bi - but I also feel that doesn’t really sum me up either, and although I’m not overly bothered by the terminology and semantics of it all, I am bothered about who I am and what I’m interested in. So here’s the deal so far: I find myself wanting to shift away from normal gender conformities, and approach a more androgynous identity. I’m obsessed with feminine boys and that ‘aesthetic’ (it might be worthwhile mentioning there that I may trip up on the correct terminology and/or attitude through bad habit, so I apologise in advance for any mistakes and want to stress that I mean no-one any offence whatsoever!). Anyway, I began to try and reflect these interests in myself. I couldn’t fight the urge to try and cross dress, and although kept things super tame in the timeframe I had to experiment, I enjoyed it… I messed around with some light makeup, and the same story there. I don’t know, it just left me feeling a bit more… genuine. I’ve started growing my hair out long too, and although it’s a bit of a mess right now, I can’t see myself cutting it back to the length it was before! Sorry to dwell on the details here, but what I’m trying to say is that I don’t know how far I’m going with this. On occasions I really yearn for that female lifestyle… I feel I identify more with the opposite gender, in my sexual orientation (sort of…), my interests, my emotions… I mean, this is all in keeping with stereotypes to a degree, but it’s the best way I can illustrate my point. So I’m at a point now where a few weeks back I went to the doctors about my mental health, and after some friendly coaxing from him on the matter, plucked up the courage to blurt out ‘gender’. He asked me about how I feel and I told him as best I could. I found it difficult to answer some of the more straightforward questions because a lot of my responses were ‘maybes’ and ‘sometimes’. I feel a bit stuck in the middle and struggle with the idea of transitioning, and yet the attractions of doing so are sometimes too great to ignore. And yet other times I tell myself to stop being so ridiculous, and, unfortunately, often convince myself I’d never pass as a girl… nor even pull off that androgynous look I find so attractive. I don’t know… I’m thin but tall, and sometimes I obsess over my face… I think my nose is wide, and my eyes/eyelids are a pain to put eyeliner on (creases!)… truth is  I’ve been seriously depressed and anxious over this matter in the past 2 years, and have found myself in some seriously dark places. Suicide was on the cards, and sort of still is, because this dysphoria with life and who I am drives me right to the edge… I don’t know what I want, and when I think I do I’m not convinced I can reach it. Add to this the fact that I’m no longer living by myself: just last month I had to move back in with my parents who, although are caring enough, seem to be stuck with this image of me from before that doesn’t represent me now at all. I know that if I told them how I felt they’d almost not believe me - and that’s why I’ve refrained from sharing this with them for now. I feel like I need space to experiment again, with clothes and such, but can’t now I’m in close proximity with them. I don’t know, I just feel trapped. Like, seriously trapped. I keep promising my parents I’ll talk them through what’s going on with my mental health, but I’m seriously stumped as to whether it’s worth mentioning this particular issue. Do they need to know? Would it be best if I feel I need to spread my wings a little more? I keep thinking back on how I’ve fucked up in the past, how I’ve ignored my feelings and made stupid decisions, wasted time etc… I wish I were having these revelations 4 years prior when these feelings started to mount, but I ignored it all, and now I feel like I’m running out of time to act/getting old :( Those years were supposed to be formative, yet I didn’t grow at all. Now I’m back at home where I grew up, where everyone knows me for who I was and not who I want to be, and it sucks.
So… sorry to ramble, but I had to get it all out there. I need some guidance on what to do, and how to break these inhibitions, else I’m fucked to stay shut up for the rest of my life… the idea of which crushes me. I want to be someone else than who I am right now… I’m tired of feeling like this!

So yeah... sorry for the rambling nature and length of this post, but I gotta cover it all somehow. Thanks for reading :)"

Wogman,asktransgender,Looking for resources,"So I've been out to my parents for a few weeks now and things are getting a little heated. Nothing terrible, mostly my parents trying to ""debunk"" or dissuade me from the feeling that I'm trans. Lately one of the arguments I've had to encounter had been that they've read that people who pursue HRT and other surgeries almost always regret it and end up more depressed because they didn't get the relief they thought they would( I argued that this is rare and that most people are often very happy after transition). 

What I was hoping I could find here is someone that could lead me to some good resources from a respectable source that I could provide as evidence. Currently my parents are getting their info from a faith based website with pretty terrible sources. (think ""we love lgbt so much we make them hate themselves to normalcy"")"

mymtfthrowaway,asktransgender,Gender Marker change (Birth Certificate) CT,"So i'm trying to change my gender marker on my birth certificate.  I'm following [GLAD Birth Certificate Tool Kit](http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/publications/ct-birth-certificate-toolkit.pdf)'s instructions.  It says I need a notarized affidavit from my doctor.  I printed out the form on that page not knowing that that particular form needs to have the notary be a witness to it being filled out, so my doctor refused to fill it out. I still had him write me up an affidavit regardless from his letterhead.   My question is do I need to actually somehow get a notary to my doctor's office, an hour away, during an appointment and have them witness said form being filled out, or can I simply get the one he gave me notarized now, post drafting of it. Do they really expect me to do that? I don't know if thats even possible for me. 

Also, do I need anything else to send to the department of public health besides both affidavits? The GLAD stuff didn't link to any regular forms or anything. Do I just accompany a letter that says ""Hey, want to change my gender""? I don't understand any of this and I need it done ASAP"

lasertime9,asktransgender,How noticeable is getting laser?,"I'll be starting HRT in a few weeks, so excited! I've decided to get a head start on laser since it sounds like it takes a while. I have really pale skin with all black hair so I'm hoping laser works well. Pretty lucky that my facial hair never really came in too much. It's pretty thick on the upper lip and neck/chin but really sparse everywhere else. Most of the time I'm clean shaven but even after I shave there's still noticeable shadow on my upper lip/chin, can't wait to get rid of it.

Haven't really given much thought to how I want to start coming out so I was wondering how noticeable laser gets. Will it be obvious after one session that something is up? How long does it usually take before things are noticeable?"
GabiCap,asktransgender,"""Trying out"" pronouns?","Ok, so the title isn't really accurate. I went to my first therapy session today, and while going over the basic first few questions, she asked gender identity. I responded ""Not sure."" (this was the first indication that I was there for gender). She then asked my preferred pronouns.

My response? ""Well, I've gone by he/him all my life so that's what I'm used to. I've wanted to try she/her and see how it feels, and the couple times it's been used for me online I like it. So whichever.""

She told me that didn't help but then said, ""whichever I feel like in the moment?"" And I said yes.

Would it be weird to ask for she/her pronouns even when I'm still unsure and present as male? For me, it would be an exercise of having one person referring to me by that and seeing how it goes, like a first step.

Is this weird or inappropriate to do so? (I also didn't give her my girl name yet)"

catfusion,asktransgender,Questioning: What to ask if 'Am I trans?' isn't enough?,"'Am I trans?', particularly when put out there for external validation, generally doesn't result in any very definitive answers. (And rightfully so, IMO.)

But the need to 'know' and maybe accumulate evidence also seems to be a big part of questioning for a lot of people.

So. What are some things to ask yourself if you're questioning besides just running the 'is I is or is I ain't' line around in your head?

I know for myself, it was more of a matter of 'Oh f.... What do I do now?' and even there, I didn't realize that was what I was wrestling with, and wasn't able to acknowledge that until later, probably later than was really good for me..."
TheGrandRebel,asktransgender,Is it okay to use non-gendered language for everyone?,"I am battling and deciphering a lot of thoughts in my head recently about gender and how it exists in our culture and how I fit into the picture (if I'm to give myself some type of gender label, I think I am realizing I am agender). Something that I have started doing is using non-gendered language universally. So even if I know someone identifies as a specific gender and know what their preferred pronouns are, if I am speaking about them I default to using they, them, their regardless of how they identify. Is it disrespectful to do so?

In my mind it is simpler to abandon gender as a social construct entirely. One of my friends pushed back on this idea when talking with them presenting the idea that it is disrespectful to other people's identities because I am not recognizing them. But in my mind, I don't want to recognize gender at all. Ultimately I don't think it should exist as it serves no purpose and only leads troubles like discrimination. 

TL;DR Is it disrespectful to use non-gendered language to talk about someone who has made it clear that they identify with a particular gender?

EDIT: If you answer ""yes"" to the question at hand, can you share your reasoning too? It isn't clear to me why using non-gendered language is disrespectful as it is neutral and universal. You are still being recognized as a person of value. Like using footwear to describe both a pair of sneakers or a pair of tennis shoes. It isn't calling them something they are not, it just isn't being specific. 

Thank you for everyone being so willing to share your thoughts! "
youngjessie,asktransgender,What's the best way to flatten my chest when I exercise?,"Hey all, I'm trying to get back into exercise, but I'm closet genderqueer/genderfluid (AMAB) and I would really prefer to conceal my breasts while working out.

somefknusername,asktransgender,People don't know how to treat me. Any of you have this problem?,"First of all I come from a place of extreme privilege, so this issue is barely even a problem, it's just been nagging me for a bit now. I go to an art school which is probably the second best place to transition. There are already many queer people so I am accepted easily. About half of the people treat me respectfully with no hang-ups or anything. However, some people aren't at all sure about how to interact with me. They find that rather than trying to sustain a conversation with me it's easier just sort of answer a question then just let it awkwardly hang. I don't blame them at all because they are really trying their best and it is more of a societal problem. They don't know how to treat someone that's not a ""girl"" or ""boy."" They will joke around with guys and lightly tease girls, but they just don't talk to me friendly at all because they aren't sure which one to do. So instead it's just ""How's your day?"" ""Good."" And then it's over. 

What are yalls experiences with this? I feel I'm probably overreacting and this issue might be more on my side; I tend to be anti-social. "

AtomykFlare,asktransgender,Feeling disgusting and physically dirty as a manifestation of dysphoria?,"I know for a fact that I'm trans and I have typical dysphoria and discomfort with my body, but something happened last night and I wanted opinions on if you all thought it was caused by dysphoria.

Has anyone else felt disgusting and physically dirty from dysphoria? I live with my unsupportive parents and I'm stuck unable to do anything even vaguely related to being a trans woman. Last night I had to shower, and I was having a shitty day (dysphoria, depression, frustrated with parents). I got in the shower avoiding looking down at my body as much as possible as I showered, and I felt really filthy and gross. Now objectively I was aware that I was not extremely dirty, just a mild amount of sweat and body oil from working. I ended up soaping up and rinsing three times, and shampooing and conditioning despite the fact that I knew I wasn't that dirty.

Has anyone else had a similar feeling? Do you think it was a form of dysphoria? I'm aware that cleaning more than is necessary can be caused by OCD but I have no history of OCD at all and it's not something that happens usually as part of me showering."
LvaKq,asktransgender,How many of you changed both your forename and surname?,"Hi all, I'm planning on changing my name fairly soon. I've decided on a forename, which is one I've always really liked, but it just sounds very unnatural when coupled with my surname. Moreover, I'm concerned that keeping my surname, which is very uncommon if not unique (I am certainly the only person on Fb with it), will make it easy for people I meet in the future to easily ""figure out my history"" and potentially out me, through a quick Google. I also just don't want to stand out too much.

Is this a legitimate reason to switch both names? Not sure whether I'm being capricious and/or overly cautious, or whether this is a generally acceptable move. I'm slightly torn because I don't want my family to think I'm trying to separate myself from them - they've been supportive and I wouldn't have any reason to do that.

Anyone want to share why they changed/considered changing both names, and what friends &amp; family thought of it?"

Alex-is-Alexis,asktransgender,Why I hate being genderfluid. (RANT),"Sometimes my identity feels so gloriously right, and in the back of my mind I try to forget that this is the calm before the storm. If I'm honest to myself I can't enjoy these brief periods of feeling like the puzzle has fit together, because I know at some unknown point that will be ripped away from me. Soon that identity I felt so at home in will suddenly feel like a strangers house. 

Sure I have some sense of romanticism with having the chance to see the world in so many ways. But in practice it is emotionally draining having the ground shift under my feet like an earthquake, destroying everything I'd built up and forcing me to start over. I've even tried stopping it before, but once it gets moving attempting to hold it still is like trying to stop a freight train.

Pre-transition I felt like I wanted to transition to female, and once I got access to HRT I felt some improvement, but I'd soon realize things were not what they seemed. Almost immediately after starting transition, I started experimenting with various non-binary identities, sometimes identifying as different things to different groups of people because I couldn't bother to bring them up to date as to where I was.

Then I began to get these brief periods where I could barely bring myself to take my HRT, and would go back to my pre-transition habits, being too lazy to shave, return to the more masculine bits of my wardrobe and let my voice get all low and mopey. During these times I even began taking tamoxifen to shrink my breast growth and appear more masculine.

This is when I started to think I might be genderfluid. See in the past my dysphoria had never been persistent, but I had only been noticing the times when it started to drift in a feminine direction. But when it was on the masculine side I felt well, cis. Now that my hormones had been reversed my dysphoria had also switched polarity, making me feel dysphoric when my identity drifted to masculine.

To make matters worse, I had a few different people suggest that I might not actually be genderfluid and instead I could just be afraid of transphobic people who might harass me if I fully transitioned to female. Honestly I am terrified of what might happen to me while presenting feminine, but that doesn't necessarily point to me being female or fluid. All that suggestion did was confuse me more and have me constantly questioning which was the case.

Then while doing research I noticed that all the changes I had associated with the positive benefits of HRT (becoming more extroverted, adventurous and confident) were actually the residual symptoms of my schizophrenia switching from the male to female pattern. A phenomenon that like most other gender dependent traits is governed by which sex hormone is dominant.

Here I am now totally fed up with this constant chaos surrounding my gender, and I almost want to just pretend to be binary because it feels like I have no way to satisfy this constant back and forth. On one hand I could stop taking estrogen and go back to being an egotistical recluse, and on the other I could stay as I am and appear increasingly less cisgender unless I learn to live as a woman. Honestly I don't know which is better, they both seem daunting. More to the point they feel like giving up, and living a major part of my life as a lie.

But I'm at a loss here."

Lilstephanie,asktransgender,Forgetting your hormones anxiety.

throwawaytransam,asktransgender,Estrogen vs. Estradiol levels?,"Ok, long story short, MtF, I've switched endos a few times over the past few years for various reasons of their lack of competence, to their lack of respect when it comes to how I identify.

While my latest endo's office is very respectful, and seemingly competent, I've been suffering from low Estrogen levels for over a year now, after being post-op (bottom surgery).

However, I recently noticed that usually the endo was only doing bloodwork for Estradiol levels, and not Estrogen levels, which may explain the difference, as Estrogen should be higher than Estradiol (I think?).

So anyway, what level should I be looking out to manage my Estrogen levels?

Guessing it's Estrogen, not Estradiol, but want to confirm."
TransGingerly,asktransgender,"I just came out to my conservative mom, any help really appreciated","So I decided to bite the bullet and tell my mom. I've known for sure that I'm trans for several months now, and I've been seeing a gender therapist. I decided to come out to my mom today even though my family is pretty transphobic. She kept telling me things like ""I don't think you're a girl"" and ""men can be feminine too"" and ""I don't want people to be horrible to you."" The good news is that she said she'll love me no matter what, and I'm really grateful. But she also asked if she could come to therapy with me or if I could get another opinion from another therapist. I think she's scared that the therapist I have is forcing me to be trans? I really just needed to vent/get some opinions on what I can say to help her understand. "
Rabahber,asktransgender,I'm getting more and more confused,"So a few years ago I started toying with the idea that i might be trans. Now, since then, I liked that. It just... felt right to be talked to with certain pronouns, names and so on an so forth.
But the more I looked into the whole gender-discussion-thingy, the more I fear that, despite how or what I feel, because there seem to be so many details about everything, that I might be wrong.
Or rather, since what I feel is stable (is that the right word?), that gender-experts might try to explain to me, that I'm not what I think I am and that I should've tried to educate myself, so that I don't assign myself to, what the deem to be wrong.

Does this make any sense?
I just don't know if what I feel is the thing I should go off of anymore. It just feels like there are so many things someone could tell me, I'm wrong about, that I fear... not fitting in? I guess?

So...
Can anyone tell me, what I can trust? Is me feeling a certain way enough or are there like... specific qualities I have to bring to qualify as transgender?

orbital121,asktransgender,I feel amazing! (Temporary dysphoria alleviation),"Today was my first day back at school after coming out... It was pretty sub par but i found out that a few new people at my sixth-form are totally supportive of me which is amazing!

But that's just the start. A few days ago i purchased a butt, hip and waist enhancer. It arrived and i think i'm in love! &lt;3
Honest to god i feel more feminine than ever before! (especially as i have literally no ass or hips!) 

I'm not sure how long i'm gonna be cool with faking it like this but it works really well right now! So if you have some money to spare i recommend anyone who is trying to present themselves more femme (even if you're not out yet and its just a you thing to make yourself feel less dysphoric) i highly recommend investing in one of these things whilst you wait for HRT/HRT effects/for the funzies.

As this is *ask*transgender its only appropriate i end in a question... I've heard that binders can be pretty bad if used too regularly so do you think a tight one of these would be bad if used regularly?

Oh, and this isn't an advert... ^ ^

tinyshain,asktransgender,What is gender and identity? Confusion further into transition,"So I'm 1.5 months on T. I went from not really knowing much about trans people in general, to figuring out that the constant discomfort with my body and it's female characteristics meant that I was trans. It was jarring but also a huge relief, to realize I didn't have to put up with this constant discomfort for the rest of my life.

But still, I didn't think I could fully call myself a ""man"" because I didn't feel like one. I didn't look in the mirror and see a guy, but still, what I saw wasn't me.

I also wasn't sure that I would be ok with all of the effects of T. But every day, I feel a little more like myself. I didn't used to want facial hair, but now I can definitely imagine myself with a mustache. I don't mind being hairier. And etc...

So now I'm thinking about my non binary identity. I'm struggling with it, because while I don't want to invalidate people that are non binary and comfortable identifying themselves in that manner, I don't really understand it. 

I don't understand my own identity, really, or what gender is. I feel like my body should look like a male body. I want broad shoulders and narrow hips and a deep voice, and if I'm truly being honest with myself, male genitalia. So doesn't that mean I'm a guy?

I think my biggest obstacle to completely identifying as male is the fact that I grew up believing I was a girl. I was socialized as female and treated as a female. So I think I'm having a hard time separating my upbringing from who I actually am inside. 

I don't think my cis brother ""feels"" like a ""man,"" but because he is comfortable with his sexed body and doesn't want to change it, he just accepts that he is a man. 

I guess what I'm struggling with is how my identity can evolve from nb to trans guy without invalidating people that are stable and comfortable in their nb identity. I mean, just because I'm not a super masculine guy and some of my interests and how I experience emotions are more feminine leaning, doesn't mean I'm not also a man. Right?

Again, I don't want to invalidate people that don't identify as a binary gender and experience physical dysphoria. But on the other hand, I'm struggling with understanding how people can identify as trans but not experience physical dysphoria. And I don't know why I still would identify as non binary even though I want a fully male body and want people to see me as a man, despite not being a typically macho guy. 

This is just a long ramble, but I'm hoping for a discussion and to understand different perspectives. I feel like gender is so...confusing. "
amon_erin,asktransgender,Today's the day!,"I've had the hormones for two weeks, but I didn't feel like I was enough to take them. I thought about it a few times, but I didn't follow through. This morning I realized I feel like I either needed to start soon or go back to ignoring everything. So I went to work without taking them.

Then, just before I left to go see my therapist I decided that today is the day. Not my smartest decision because I had to drive immediately and my initial reaction to the Spiro was, unpleasant. But that may have just been me over thinking things. Either way, it has been done and I mostly feel okay right now.

Time to see where this path leads me. The flair has been appropriately updated."

f30bim,asktransgender,How to adjust to social life as a passable female?,"Hey everyone, 

I started to notice that I'm passing 100% and people are treating me like a natural born female. It's actually quite scary to me because I basically came out over college summer break and only saw my friends during that time. I'm from a suburban area where I just drive in my own car and never have to interact with strangers. Now that I'm back in college in a large east coast city where most people walk and take public transportation, I'm struggling to cope with a lot of things about being female. Guys are super creepy with me and constantly say hi and stare at me wherever I go, and girls are extra chatty with me, whether they're strangers or classmates. I also learned that girls love to gossip with each other. These are all very new to me and they just hit me as soon as I came back to school in the city. 
The most difficult part to me is dealing with sexual harassment or unwanted attention.  I can't even go to the grocery store with no makeup on without getting cat calls or getting creepy stares by men. I can literally feel eyes following me on the sidewalk and it's just men. Just yesterday, I was walking on a busy sidewalk when a guy asked me how I'm doing and continued to walk side by side with me for 4 BLOCKS while occasionally glancing over his shoulder to look at me. If I slowed down, he did too. It honestly left me so creeped out and shaken and he didn't even leave me alone until I asked him why he's following me. Other things get to me too like my uber driver smirking at me through the rear view mirror and calling me adorable. 
Sometimes I actually burst out laughing when guys eye me because it's so funny and pathetic to me but that's not always the case. It can be funny most times but also very scary.
I know that this sounds like such a first world problem, but I'd really appreciate some help in adjusting to this. I do get really nervous when I'm put in situations like this and it's kind of unfair that cis girls had so many years to build up coping mechanisms for this stuff and I just kind of jumped into it lol

What should I do? It feels like I get weird interactions like this whether I'm wearing pajamas or a mini skirt. "

Fim0458,asktransgender,"[Rant] If you're a GSRM who still discriminates against other GSRM people, you're worse than cishet people who discriminate against all of us, and should seriously fuck off.","I'm getting absolutely fucking sick of seeing people like ""Oh, I'm trans and I'm accepting of all people, except those damn ""nonbinary"" attack helicopter fuckers AMIRITE?

The reason you're worse than cishet people is AT LEAST they have the minute excuse that they can't feel empathy towards us because they don't know what it's like to be discriminated against in that way, you KNOW what it's like to be discriminated against for who you love, make love to, or what you identify as, and yet you STILL decide to put other people through the same intolerant SHIT that people put you through, if you're the kind of person out there who does this shit, you're the reason why some people feel like they can't even feel at home among other people like them, like they constantly have a knife at their back 24/7, you're the reason some people feel socially isolated to such an extreme level that they would rather not live, you're part of the problem, and if you honestly fucking cared, you'd stop posting anywhere, keep your toxic shit from spilling all over the rest of us.

arkwald,asktransgender,Where to go from here?,"So after you admit to yourself you are trans, what really is the next step? I know that there is no one way to be trans and that everyone has different desires and goals. That said, I feel a little lost about what my actual options are. I know for many that HRT is a thing, but is it really the next logical step? If I just dress, how is that any different than being a crossdresser? How do I know I didn't just lie to myself about being trans in the first place? How can I trust myself at all after being so ignorant about this part of me? 

To put it another way, I spent 20 years in denial about this thing. If I decide that all I want to do is keep being who I thought I was then am I not simply repressing again? The more I think about how this all works the more and more lost I feel. Where do I go and how do I handle life when I have tossed aside all the guidelines I had followed? When I talk to people about this they generally and sympathetic or supporting... but it feels like all they do is watch the drowning person drown. While I appreciate that I am not being ignored, I really wish I had a better idea of what I need to do. Sitting around and trying to figure this all out on my own just makes me frustrated and depressed. Is it really worth pressing on if all I have to look forward to is this sort of hell? I dunno... I just don't know and increasingly don't care."

So that being said how do you prep?

Do I not shave between now and then?
Should I take some advil or grab some numbing cream or something?
I'm looking to be paying about 85 bucks for an hour and I live in a city, is that crazy expensive or is that to be more or less expected?

She didn't recognize me, and asked where I knew her from. I told her (school name). She looks puzzled for a minute,  says she doesn't remember me. Then she says ""wait, do you have a brother, [deadname]?""

Dustman28,asktransgender,Should I save my marriage?,"Hi, first off I am 28, I have a beautiful wife, a great well paying job, a new house and vehicles, pets and now working on having a baby. The problem is that I'm coming to terms with being transgender lesbian and being torn apart by possibility coming out.

I had known that I wasn't a normal male since I hit puberty but didn't know that transitioning was an option until I was 23. Incidentally, this was when I first met my wife. She's on the conservative side, but she's a loving and supportive partner. I thought that maybe I was too old or unattractive enough to transition so I thought living like a cis-male would be the best option. That and all my friends and family think I'm a normal guy, just slightly odd.

Now our lives are going well, but I feel like I'm faking the male role constantly. She tries to push me in more masculine directions, and I dig my heels in each time. I tired cross dressing, but it was never satisfying and had to give it up for her anyways.

Now I get frustrated that I keep living a lie as a successful husband, employee and family member. We want children, but my anxiety is making holding an erection difficult (I'm amazing at foreplay and oral so that's the only issue). Should I keep up my current male life to keep my life together and hide myself. Should I come out and risk my wife, job, family and all I hold dear. If I come out, should I wait till after having children (I really want to pass along my genes and family name.)?"

superwonderguard,asktransgender,"current situation regarding hrt, need advice","ok, so hey. i don’t really post here that often, but i’ve recently run into a bit of a conflict regarding when i can start transitioning. currently, i’m attending college as a freshman, and have come out as trans to most of the people close to me (immediate family, close friends, etc.). my parents, although supporting, don’t want me to start transitioning right away, and want me to focus on college for my first year before i start hrt. 

is this a smart idea? currently college is kinda hell in terms of how much more difficult it is than high school, and i wonder if adding hormones to the mix would make it more stressful than it needs to be at this point.

but at the same time, dysphoria is becoming harder and harder to deal with. too often i run into little things that end up setting it off (like people referring to me and/or seeing me as male, or me getting jealous of how feminine other girls look), and it’s slowly eating away at me, little by little.

so, what do i do? if i do end up having to deal with a year of college and dysphoria (which will probably be likely at this point), how do i cope?"

SomeScatteredThought,asktransgender,Advice on coming out?,"Since my last post I've been doing a bunch of thinking and a bunch of reading. I've more come around to the feeling that I'm trans, a woman, albeit still sort of unsure (but thats no surprise, I've always had absolutely abyssal self confidence, I second guess literally everything even if its not important). 

So I've been thinking a lot, how would I come out? Specifically, to my mother. I've been thinking about it a lot and if I want to start trying things to see how I feel, even simpler things I feel like I'd have to at least come out at home (since we live together). Other than that I feel like it would be a relief to simply be able to voice those thoughts, even if nothing comes from them for a while. (Assuming, hoping things went well)

So, yeah, ultimately, I want to be able to come out with these thoughts so maybe I can start taking steps towards acting on them, (even just becoming a bit more androgynous for the time being), but I'm completely unsure how to bridge the topic. I've rarely had any serious talks of these sorts and I can hardly guess how it would go. My mother is pretty open minded, shes never had any problems with gays or lesbians (shes always said if I was gay she wouldent care, that sort of thing), shes even said shes probably asexual not all that long ago. When all the Caitlyn Jenner stuff started hitting the news and things like the transgender bathroom issues started coming up she said trans people should just be able to use whichever restroom they were comfortable with, that most everything people against it were saying sounded like a load of BS, its not really anyones business, etc. Shes always very much been for equal rights all around. So I certainly know her as open minded enough.

But, I still have a large amount of anxiety around confessing these thoughts. Its easy to worry things would be different when her ""son"" would rather be her ""daughter"". So once again, I'm very unsure how to even begin bringing this sort of thing up. If anyone would have any advice that would be great. "

Araeza,asktransgender,Insurance and SRS (USA),"I'm sure this gets asked all the time and I'm sorry for making the subreddit sound like a broken record, but I'm super bad at Adulting and nobody ever explained the process of obtaining insurance and the company I work for doesn't do a good job of it either.

I've pretty much finished my transition, and pretty much the only thing I need to have done is confirmation surgery. However since I am a mere mortal, I can't obviously just pay the cost of surgery out of pocket so I need to figure out if it's possible to get on an insurance plan before I plan for it.
(And I mean, I'm sure that if I lived frugally and saved up I could afford it myself in several years but...I don't want to wait several years and I have other things going on in my life that I need money for anyway)


How would I go about finding out what surgeons accept what insurance, and how do I find out if my company provided healthcare will cover it? 
And if not, do I have access to buy insurance outside of what my work offers?

docusoap,asktransgender,"Should we start labelling posts FTM, MTF, etc.?","I think we all agree that we want asktg to be an inclusive sub. We've talked before about how trans guys sometimes get sidelined here. And it's pretty common to see a post that's by and for trans women/men, but the heading doesn't specifically say that.  

Labelling posts is the most practical and sensitive way I can think of to address this issue. I'm thinking of something like:  
&amp;nbsp;

&gt; [MTF] Are there pickle-flavoured Skittles?  
&gt; [FTM] My left eyeball just popped. Is my binder too tight?  
&gt; [NB] Do these eyebrows go with this hoodie?  
&gt; I lurv you all so much!!!1!  

&amp;nbsp;

The label at the beginning says who the *main audience of the post* is, not who the *poster* is. The last sample post doesn't need a label because it's for everyone.  

These labels aren't perfect. How can we make them better? I know [not everyone](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/2knm50/is_anyone_else_bothered_by_mtf_and_ftm_labels/) likes the MTF/FTM thing. Something like TM (for transmasculine) may be better, but I feel like FTM and MTF are clearer.  

This is a communal space. What I like about labelling as a solution is we all get to be together, but everyone becomes more visible. Love you!"

She asked me if I was 'normal' and I said yes,she asked me about the post and I made up some bullshit no one would believe..she asked me if I liked guys(I like guys) and I said no,she told me there wouldn't be a place in the world to.hide if I.did anything. She continued saying im a perfectly normal male over and over and I said yes..she told me that any thought I have on my mind is wrong and kept repeating that im gonna destroy the family.

I also worry that it's inconstant: I often just disappear into bouts of intense work when I don't have headspace for anything else. Only when life calms down a bit do gendered worries arise. 

Anyhow, this summer I felt pretty rotten about it all, and resolved that I *had* to seek professional help. And I'm sort of halfway there: at the moment I'm seeing a therapist fairly regularly for depression/anxiety (I don't know how that stuff relates to the gender stuff). I have my third appointment tomorrow. On my initial consultation form I mentioned that I was conflicted about my gender, but they don't seem to have picked it up. So I'mma have to bring it up, the problem is that I just chicken out everytime. In part the problem is that because I'm now back into the middle of the semester and drowning in work I'm not feeling it as intensely as I was a month ago. 

I've printed out a written spiel that I can give her, but that feels artificial and weird. Is there anything else I can do to help save me from cowardice/cold feet? Or oughtn't I to bring it up in this setting? (advice from my school LGBT peeps was to start by speaking to my current therapist)

So I have no clue what cis girls smell like ""down there"".  Anyway, ever since my hrt has kicked in and I take off my panties I smell this weird odor I didn't have before.  Kind of pungent and sweet I think.  It's an unusual smell but not unpleasant.  Just weird. Sooooooo...what's that smell?"
Whatifimtg,asktransgender,Okay Im just going to ask. Do I sound like a transgender person to you?,"This is probably going to be an interesting post to collect my thoughts. But I just have to ask if what Im experiencing is normal or out of the ordinary, or ordinary for people here.

So Ive always been uncomfortable in my body, I dont like the way I look (though other people seem to) I dont like having a dong, Im depressed all the damn time and I figure my horrid issues with self appearance dont help matters.

The first time I tried to cross dress was mind blowing. I figured I would try it because I was feeling adventurous and figured why not? The first time I saw myself looking that feminine was the first time I have pretty much ever felt good about my appearance. I started crying to my then girlfriend right there and she, being the kind soul she is, consoled me. 

Ever since then Ive been trying to snatch that feeling back as much as I can, and it has happily manifested itself in my sexuality as well. I really dont like using my dick, it just doesnt feel right, but getting bent over and used like that feels much better.

So heres the questions, what do? Is this transgenderism? Would I feel better if I had a female body? Am I too old to start transitioning (24) to actually be passable? Is this just all some dumb fancy that Im being idiotic about? How do I deal with this? Why can I only find myself attractive as a woman?(I dont actually expect an answer to that one because of its obviously personal nature)

axlslashduff,asktransgender,Gender transformation fetish an indicator?,"So the other day I posted about my situation and my own gender confusion, including crossdressing and some strong feminine/sexual feelings when dressed up.

Well I forgot to mention one other important aspect to this. Regular porn/sex/ whether straight or gay or bi has little to no effect on me. Sometimes seeing pretty girls kissing is a turn on but that's it. Regular relationships have failed because of this fact.

I have a huge transformation fetish. It extends to other areas. But the biggest one is MTF captions, stories, erotica, imagery, etc. It's what I get off to mainly. And I have no idea why. It's maddening sometimes, because I want to feel something for someone. Love, romance, physical attraction. I have found girls attractive and even had a few hook ups. But I do wonder if I've let my fetish/paraphilia control me for so long now, I can't get off to anything else. 

I don't want to equate being transgender to having a fetish. But I just need to differentiate whether I'm actually a woman, or whether I have a serious problem with looking at this kind of erotica. "
MsDovina,asktransgender,I need some advice,"Hi Everyone. This account is a throwaway.
I am a 22 year old male(?), and have identified as a cisgender gay man for nearly 10 years. For the past 18 months I have been at varying degrees questioning my gender identity.
I started being interested in makeup and being more exposed to transgender topics in March of 2015, at first I thought I just wanted to be a drag queen and then started becoming really interested in trans topics, Cait Jenner coming out happened around there and I started watching all these YouTube transwomen and right now I've purchased multiple books written by transwomen or written about trans topics.
I'm also really into drag queens (I am not one (right? lol)) But I love watching RuPaul's Drag Race and follow a lot of queens from the show and am really interested in the drag scene I guess.
But I also find myself envious of female FaceBook friends when they post photos and that I'm not so pretty or aesthetically pleasing. 
I find myself yo-yo-ing between wanting to be masculine and wanting to be feminine. When I see attractive men in porn or on social media or in person, I want to be more like them and be in shape/muscular, and be more masculine acting/appearance-wise, etc. But when I'm devoid of that influence, or right after masturbating, I feel more like ""I wonder if I really am transgender?"".
Earlier this evening I was trying to put together a makeup look (which I do most Monday nights because I have the house to myself) and it started going wrong and I go frustrated, and I washed it off and took a shower but I felt like I was in the middle of some kind of manic episode because there was just too much going on in my head.

Some days I feel male, some days I think I might be transgender, sometimes I think I just want to be a drag queen or stop caring where the gender lines fall and blur them. Some nights my attitude on who I am changed by the hour or less frequently, but I'm always bouncing around and can't decide where I belong.

It doesn't help that I'm sort of easily influenced and have a history of being interested in different things or trying to find who I am/where I fit in. I've been through every religion trying to pick one (I'm an atheist I guess), I try to find subcultures where I can fit in, I try everything to no avail. And I'm only getting more frustrated and more desperate for this bullshit to resolve.

I have an appointment with a therapist Wednesday morning, he's a cisgender heterosexual man but he's in gay-affirming FaceBook group(s) because I did some snooping.
Tonight I found a therapist online that is a gay man, and lists in his bio that he has extensive experience with LGBTQ individuals. I emailed him, I guess I'll see therapist #1 Wednesday just in case the second guy never responds to me.

I'm sorry for being so all over the place, but any thoughts??"
PrettyGirlsDontEat,asktransgender,Question about breast growth,"This is going to sound super weird but I think my situation is slightly unique. I'll preface this with a trigger warning for eating disorders. 

I'm 20 (turning 21) and I'm MtF trans and I also have an eating disorder (self-diagnosed eating disorder). I want to start hormones soon and I'm scared about breasts. Basically I want to not really have any if you know what I mean. So I'm curious as to how it works exactly, does it just redistribute fat? Will I not really grow any if I'm underweight? I'm just curious because I'm terrified of gaining weight or having weight that you can't really lose. Sorry if nobody knows the answer but I figure some of you have experience. Thanks in advance to anybody here that responds to me :)"
mtc6,asktransgender,Struggling with breast growth:( tips please!,"I have been on hrt for a year and two months, but have had very minimal breast growth :( I have like 32A ish (at most tbh, idk if it is even a full A).

I am already at the top dosage for pills.

I am trying to see if there is anything else I can do before I get a breast augmentation. (I would be getting it in May if I don't see any growth soon.)"
Maxpayte,asktransgender,Utterly Crushed,"My relationship with my family has been no secret. It's been stupidly shaky. At the moment they are in a working it out stage. Fine, I get it. 

But, this is where things get depressing.

My father who is crushed most by my transition called me today. I was kind of surprised considering we don't really talk much. I answer almost expecting him to have had a break through. To my excitement he started off by saying ""I have been thinking and...."" my hopes raised as high as they have ever been at this point. To my devastation by finishing his sentance by saying, "" you have a mental illness, you need to fix your head not your body."" 

Many more things were said. Including that I'm hiding behind being trans. And the liberal media twisted my mind. He also compares being trans to global warming and said what if he wanted to change his skin color, saying that being trans is as stupid as being trans racial. He also claimed I have nothing g else to worry about in my life so I worry about my gender. Oh and gender is not a spectrum because he said so.

What do I do? I had such a great relationship with him prior now he thinks I'm a deranged maniac. How do I cope with an unsupportive family, dysphoria, and the ultimate fact that they may never come around?"

throwaway24562457245,asktransgender,"""Stop self-diagnosing yourself as trans""...","Something that my wife keeps telling me is to ""stop self-diagnosing""

It's really starting to get to me, mostly because it seems to be her saying ""slow down, wait for the GIC appointment, because I don't trust you to identify your own gender""  And its even worse than her just being trouble, because other than this, she's being really supportive.  I think she honestly thinks that I cannot be certain enough without the GIC's say-so.

It's worse, because anything I throw at her to show that being trans is basically *only* self-diagnosed, counts as self-diagnosing, and is therefore ""bad"".

And all I wanted to do was get some sperm banked so that I can start hormones as soon as I get to the end of the *six month* waiting list for the GIC.

I'm starting to think that by then I'll be desperate enough that I'll go ""fuck it, no kids for me""

Casianh,asktransgender,Anyone had/getting SRS in Maryland?,"So, I was super excited back in November when I saw that CareFirst was removing exclusions for SRS and other transition related care from all of their contracts in the state - even more so when I found said amendment in my contract. I've been working with a surgeon to plan this out and was supposed to be having top surgery yesterday. However, when CareFirst finally replied to the preauthorization request, it was denied. I spent a few hours on the phone between my surgeon's office and CareFirst and am still waiting on another call back but I was hoping to find other local transfolk who have had SRS or are in the process of getting it to ask if your experiences with insurance have gone any better. I'm really hoping that after the next call this will be resolved as a big misunderstanding but hearing from someone who did get their surgery approved would do a lot to calm my anxiety over trying to pay for this out of pocket."

-Naven-,asktransgender,For some reason my dysphoria took a dip. I could use some reassuring.,"I have known I'm transgender for almost two years now. I finally started puberty blockers a few months ago and was planning on starting on HRT soon. For some reason, dysphoria has taken a drop since yesterday. I feel this might be because I was informed by a friend that a girl has a crush on me. I feel like my brain is trying to hold on to its last grip / possibility of being cis gender and straight (AFAIK, I'm bisexual). I think the girl is kind of cute, but that's about it. I've come such a long way, I've dealt with my anxiety and depression head on. I don't want my world to crumble beneath me again like it did not too long ago. I feel like I want to be transgender, which means I probably am (especially after feeling this way for so long). I could just use some help and maybe be reassured. Thanks."

I've known for a few years and have been growing out my hair which is pretty long now. Anyway, about 2 months ago I was helping my mum sort some things out on her computer. I was looking in the web history and I found a bunch of websites and questions about trans people. I thought maybe it was random but a lot were very specific and typed like ""my son is transgender"" so she obviously found out. When I seen all these questions and websites I panicked A LOT. I have no idea how they found out, maybe they went through my things or diary.  

So it's been 2 months now pretty much and we haven't spoke about it still. It's been making me super anxious that she knows but hasn't said anything. I have very bad anxiety and struggle to talk to people about even meaningless things. So talking about being trans and very sensitive things is super difficult and I'm too scared to bring it up.

So I'm just looking for some advice or something. I'm not sure what to do."

goombiya,asktransgender,Personal trainers for trans people,"So I'm an MTF trans woman still in the closet. In other words, I live my life as a dude. Right now my wife and I have a personal trainer that we use to give us a little extra motivation to keep going to the gym and make sure we're doing the right stuff while there. Well, if (and when I hope) I start HRT, I feel like I'll have three options: a. drop my trainer and do my own thing (which I'm no stoked about at all), b. tell my trainer what's going on and hope he can tailor my program accordingly (also not super confident this will work for a number of reasons), or c. find a trainer with experience working with trans people, mtf specifically. 

I currently do a fair amount of weight lifting, mostly moderately high rep stuff that has helped me to lose weight and feel better without getting super bulky. I know most trans women want to stay away from weights (esp. upper body) but maintaining some strength is actually kind of important to me for sake of my work. Obviously if I go on HRT I need a trainer who understands that they can't just continually add weight over time as even if I'm working out regularly, I'll probably be losing strength. Additionally, someone with a good understanding of HRT can make sure that my program works for my needs, to not only maintain as much strength as possible, but also work up to a more feminine figure - ultimately balancing those things out.

I'm putting the cart before the horse here, I know. As someone married and in her closet I've got a lot to do before my training sessions become an immediate concern, but nevertheless this is something that has been on my mind for a while now, and would love to discuss this as a distraction to my more pressing issues. 

Thanks for any help/advice!!

Hi Reddit,

I am at the very beginning of my path through my trans identity right now, and I found myself really suggestible. Recently I came across [this](https://youthtranscriticalprofessionals.org/2016/07/21/i-thought-i-was-trans-really-i-was-just-scared-of-being-a-woman/comment-page-1/)

tl;dr: gender critical post saying: ""I thought I was trans, but in fact I was just scared of being a women""

I WANT to be a woman. I really dislike trying to fill the role of a man. And all my life I struggled to figure out ""How the heck am I supposed to fit in this society?"". I finally found an answer that did not sound like an excuse to fit in because it felt right. By meeting you guys, and this fantastic community.

But now, there is this. Here is how this made a scar in my confidence:

*You are pissed because you are failing as a man, and you tricked yourself into thinking it is because you would do so much better as the opposite role. As when in fact, you are just lying to yourself. You are delusional.*

I really want to have your opinions: What do you think about this kind of argument? How do you fight it?

edit: Wow, all the hate, I didn't want to hurt anyone. I was shaken by the hate and the criticism out there, I just wanted to know how you guys handle it. And please I'm not trolling, read my story first."

And I spent part of my male puberty on OCD meds, I really don't want to do it again.

Way too recently I found myself wondering whether or not I'd be forced into temporary homelessness, and it was super scary.  The whole having a place to keep your stuff/being able to get it all from point A to point B was totally daunting and I was really afraid that I wouldn't be able to do it.


Thinking about it today had me wondering about all of our brothers and sisters who might have to face or are currently facing homelessness/couch surfing/etc.  Is there anyone here who thinks that having a private list of users willing to float somebody for a few days would be worthwhile?


I figure it would be something like a list of usernames that maybe mods alone have access to or something.  So if *I* was afraid that I was going to be getting kicked out (and wasn't just running away as a minor) I theoretically could message one of the mods who could check if there was anyone on the list in my area, and then message those users to see if anyone would be able to lend a hand.  If there were any, those users could then message OP (in this example, *moi* ) at their discretion with terms like set number of days, acceptable meetup locations, etc.


So, anybody think this is something worth considering?  I don't think it would be too hard to maintain, it would be low risk for anyone interested in potentially helping out, and maybe it could really do some good for somebody in need.


Cheers,

cv512hg,asktransgender,"I'm feeling confused about the nature of gender dysphoria, gender, and gender roles","I'm having confusion over over the nature of gender dysphoria, gender, and gender roles.

When someone says that gender is socially constructed, do they mean gender roles are socially constructed? This seems to imply that gender is more than just social. 

Does the fact that some people feel gender dysphoria mean that gender is more than a social construct, that there is a biological component? 

If there isnt a biological component, are we socially constructed to the extent that we are essentially blank slates at birth? But if we are blank slates, why do some people feel gender dysphoria? "

Invisible-Elephant,asktransgender,Got gate kept pretty hard today in Alabama,"I went to an appointment for a therapist's referral this morning at the only openly trans-friendly clinic in Alabama. Since I was looking for a trans-specialized therapist, I figured going to an LGBT-friendly clinic was probably my best bet. But like I said, I was only going in for a therapy referral, since I've already decided I don't want to start HRT until sometime next year, particularly since I'm still saving up to bank my sperm.

Anyway, first I see a nurse, and I tell him what I'm there for, and that I'm transgender. He asks me, ""since you want to see a therapist for gender dysphoria, are you looking for an HRT letter eventually?"" And I said, ""yeah, for sure, but I'm not in a massive rush for HRT, I've spent 22 years in this shit male body, another 9 months or a year at most isn't gonna kill me.""

Then the doctor comes in. He is immediately skeptical in tone. He said that he would need me to see a therapist for at least a year and have at least a year's RLE everywhere full time before he or his preferred therapist would even CONSIDER giving me access to hormones. ""HRT for people who don't begin presenting full time beforehand, I find, usually ends in failure."" Idk whether he meant failure to pass or some sort of regret, but either way, it was messed up. ""We want to know that you're presenting as female reliably and consistently,"" he said, as he eyed me up and down, as if to hint that what I was wearing was inadequately feminine (I wore a t-shirt and athletic shorts to the appointment. Sorry, I didn't realize trans women had to put on makeup and a dress to go to a doctor's appointment at 8am.) ""I need confidence that you're serious about this,"" were his last words to me. 

I noped the fuck out of there and drove home chain-smoking while my hands shook. And this is the most openly trans-friendly clinic in Birmingham. It had gay pride stickers on the walls. And yet. I'm really dispirited, guys and gals. My heart hurts. I'm not sure what I did wrong or what I could have done better. Any advice?

Also, fuck it, people should know: this was Dr. Scott Weisberg at Magic City Wellness Center in Birmingham, AL.

EDIT 9/13/16 - just so everyone knows, I woke up first thing this morning and filled out a complaint with the medical board. Next I'm gonna have a cup of coffee and call up the director of this clinic.

pherhaps,asktransgender,People with OCD/OCPD help...,"Hi...
So, lately I have been identifying as MtF, I am 14. I have already come out to my sister and my bf, both accepting. One thing that keeps on bothering me is this: I have OCPD. I don't experience too much dysphoria, but enough to know its there. It goes somewhere along the lines of hating the idea of one day having a very masculine body, and being very jealous of pretty girls because of their feminine body and I also don't like male pronouns SOMETIMES, especially when being refered to as a man. I think I prefer female pronouns, and I have crossdressed and enjoyed it, being sad having to take it off. I know by now many of you are thinking I am trans, but thats the problem. I also sometimes think I am trans, to the point where I think ""Alright I am coming out this Friday"", but, before Friday, I begin to doubt myself highly, and no matter how much I am sure I am trans, or other people tell me I am trans, I can't convince myself. I must have made 20+ of these threads similar to this. I don't hate my body, and it is my favourite male body, and it doesn't particularily bother me at this point, but the secondary sex characteristics coming are the ones I fear, and even now I would rather have a female body. I did not really ever think about being a girl previously, however, I did use to use female characters in games, and I would try to find ways to turn my male characters female, and I would put them female clothes, but, again, apparently this can't convince me either. I go to a pshychologist, but I live in an extremely anti-lgbt country (Peru), and I am terrified of coming out to her for help, even though I have been seing her for about 10 years, for my OCPD, so I truly have no idea of what to do. This is getting really annoying, and if I wasn't trans, I would want to be, but my OCPD makes me think everything I think is Bullsh*t and made up by myself, and that I don't really want to be a girl, etc... Previously I have convinced myself I have aids, cancer, diabetes, you name it. The thoughts I have over being trans aren't the kind of thoughts that make me feel very stressed out, but rather the ones that I may not be. I would rather not come out to my parents before being sure, since it might be a big mistake. I don't know if it is relevant, but I will go ahead and say it: my parents are divorced. I just wish I could be trans, 0 obsessive thoughts and thats it, but I don't know if that is me or my OCPD speaking (well, typing really) and that is what stresses me so much If you put me two people, one male and one female, either its real or fictional, I will always choose to look like the female one, but sometimes its hard to determine whether I'd rather look like her than ME. I also experience a tad bit of voice dysphoria... I really need help, as this ocassionally causes me to break down and cry... Help I guess?"

efgi,asktransgender,How to deal with sexual dysphoria?,"The story:

For the first time since coming out, I had a breakdown during foreplay. I think it was sparked by a comment I  had made just a bit earlier about envying my sweetheart's menstrual cycle. Afterwards, we were getting intimate, but before long I could hardly even get into it, with a dull sense of unease taking over. I was definitely having urges that my body isn't equipped to meet. She asked if I was okay, and within minutes I was a sobbing mess. This went on for a good 30 minutes or so, by the end of which I had asked if we could just watch Steven Universe (hello, escapism).

We hung out peacefully for a bit, talked about how I was feeling, about how I don't think I can call myself pangender anymore, and about the (im)possibility of surgery. I've been slow to admit that it's more than wanting to be feminine, but that I also don't want to be masculine. She was extremely supportive, as always, but I feel like a burden.

And then she left and I slept the entire day away. A good 16 hours.

I don't want this to happen again... how can I cope?"

Basically, no matter how many experts come out and say that trans women have no statistical advantage when compared to top cis athletes, they'll always allude to ""biological advantages"" (which they don't usually list, mind you, and when they do they just say vague shit like ""bone structure""). It doesn't matter that the IOC has cleared trans women to compete in women's sports, and many other sporting bodies are following suit. Heck, it's so obvious many of them have no clue what they're talking about. Still, this shit bums me out.

I mean, I'm a bit shorter than the average WNBA player, but if I tried to play women's basketball (which I'm genuinely interested in) people would *still* claim I have some advantage.

Sorry_for_the_mess,asktransgender,I came out to my father and step mother..,"I know it isn't a question but I had to share. 

Back story:
Two years ago I came out to my mother and step father. Step father is a Christian conservative and I would say bigoted but that's too harsh..he draws his own assumptions on race, other religions etc and can be relaxing or homophobic based on that but once he learns about something or is exposed he more or less is ok with it. So I took a chance. Bad plan. My parents would have rather believed all sorts of things instead, including possession and influence by Satan. 

Fast forward to sunday, I sent a Facebook message to my step mom and my dad explaining that I was transgender, that it was a question and that I've been on hormones 3 months. My step mom had a couple of questions up front but was actually very accepting and was letting me know she was there for me. My dad needed to process and he messaged me this "" I still don't know what to say. Something like this is not something that will make me think you are dead. I won't abandon you like a red headed step child. I just never knew anybody that has done this before. When &lt;step mom&gt; told me to read the message Sunday, I thought it was a suicide note. Thank the lord it wasn't that. We will get through this just like everything else in life."" 

I was sure if have lost my second set of parents and it turns out this wasn't the case. They live 8 hours away though, otherwise I'd hug them. I feel a lot less alone, and that I have someone I can rely on if things get shitty. I just wanted to share. If anyone is having a rough time coming out to loved ones and wants to talk about it, please feel free to get it off your mind. Thanks loves!

Skyewarn72,asktransgender,Omg! Whats happening to me? Dosage increase.,"Just recently changed E dose from 4mg to 6mg sublingual estrace(been on progressive doses hrt for 11 months).  All other meds stayed the same.  The reason for this was that my last test says my e2 levels were at 73pg/dl.  My t was spot on.  So I asked my doc if I could increase my dosage to get my levels higher to like 150-200 pg.  He said that my numbers could be a little higher like around 90 pg however granted my request up my dosage to 6mg a day.  I told him I wasnt feeling right as when I did beginning my 4mg dosage and believed it was due to low estrogen. 

So, while I was on the 4mg dosage, I felt good or what I considered normal in the beginning but as time went by (6months or so) I progressively became  less motivated (about many things) and more I guess sad or down half the time.  Now a week into 6mg I felt a short spurt of euphoria and happiness and now Im weeping and getting emotional.  Of course, I have lots of negative things going on in my life but I feel like its harder to cope with those situations.  Dont get me wrong, I have my good or happy times in between and not sad all the time.  I'm still feeling that I'm still in that teenager puberty state.  I guess this will take a couple more years to get used to?"

throwaway864927,asktransgender,Will a mental illness diagnosis prevent me from being able to transition?,"While I don't currently have an diagnoses I, for a variety of reasons, suspct that I may have schizophrenia or some related mental disorder. I also have very severe dysphoria (which predates the things that are making me suspect that I'm schizophrenic), and am afraid that if I'm diagnosed with something that it will prevent me from being considered mentally fit enough to be able to transition. 


Is this a reasonable thing to be afraid of?

DiscyD3rp,asktransgender,Have anyone else used VR to cope with dysphoria?,"I recently had to opportunity to play with the Vive at a friends place for most of the day, and one particular game sticks out in my mind. It was a horror/adventure game (I can't remember its name), and you play a female reporter investigating the scene of a (supposed) murder.

The big thing is that, somewhat unusually, the player character is actually a fully modeled woman, and the first thing I see when I started the game is this big mirror with my reflection. And it felt like *my* reflection. Her head moved and twisted when mine did. Her body moved under my control. I could look down, and see a woman's body there. It was surreal and incredible, and I just kept coming back to that mirror to sorta revel in the sensation and idea of it.

So I was wondering, have any of you had similar experiences with VR? Are there any games/demos designed with this in mind? Do you know any game(s) that really captured this experience, inadvertently or not?"

lilah_christopher,asktransgender,Was anyone else in unusual denial about being trans?,"My life story follows that of a lot of trans women with the big exception that I can't ever remember consciously wanting to ""be a girl."" I knew that I preferred being with girls, and wanted to do the things they did, though I knew it was ""wrong."" I used to go play Fashion Plates with the neighbor girl and then lie about where I was to everyone. I used to try on my mom's clothes from time to time, but I thought everyone did that just out of curiosity. When I was in theater in high school, I loved putting on makeup, but never looked for the girl in the mirror. I used to buy unisex-looking clothes at women's clothing stores to be ""edgy."" And on and on and on. All this stuff happened but never once did I say, ""I wish I was a girl."" I remember reading Jenny Boylan's *She's Not There* and being weirdly disappointed, thinking I must not be trans because I didn't grow up wishing to be a girl. (So what *is* wrong with me? I asked.)

And then in 2011 the realization hit me like a freight train, and hasn't ever really left me, though I've managed to go back into denial a couple of times. I was watching the video of Lana Wachowski receiving her HRC Visiblity Award and I just broke down sobbing, finally ""getting"" that this was me. This late-breaking realization has really messed me up because for a long time I didn't feel ""trans enough"" even though my current experience is quite typical for a trans woman beginning transition and I feel extreme dysphoria, and this has been going on for like five years. (I managed to put myself back in denial for a couple years in there, just willing myself to not be trans, basically.) It's clear to me now that I am definitely trans, but it was a really weird route to getting there.

Rather than imagining myself as a woman, for my whole life I imagined this sort of ideal female companion that I assigned all of my feminine desires and tastes to (I went nuts for Doctor Who as a kid for this reason). When I was little, she was my imaginary best friend (sometimes a robot or alien, natch). When I hit puberty, she became an imaginary love interest, my ""perfect mate"" but who had a vast imagined existence outside of her imaginary relationship with me. I thought about this person quite a lot, well into adulthood, until I realized that I was trans, and I haven't thought about her since. So I guess maybe I projected all of my female desires onto this made-up person?

Am I the only one this happened to? Anyone else's denial manifest itself in an unusual way?"

NotFromSilentHill,asktransgender,Bigender vs DID,"Hello again friends, it's another ""Heather asks things that are possibly transphobic""!

So I somehow got caught up in the mess that is the divisive 'transtrender' label. While I did hear some rather unsavory activism on both ends of the spectrum, my only real takeaway was on some genders that fit into the non-binary category.

We have varying forms of bigender and genderfluid, 'non-binary trans men' and 'non-binary trans women', and disregarding the oxymoron of those two identities, I felt like this is something I needed to ask. While I do feel that there are more than 2 genders, does bigender really count as one of the many forms of non-binary gender? Much like how transgender isn't a gender, I feel bigender isn't a gender because it's a state of being rather than anything psychological or culturally ingrained. ""To be bigender is to experience two genders either simultaneously or at different times"". When I read that description, it reminded me of this: ""A mental disorder characterized by at least two distinct and relatively enduring identities or dissociated personality states that alternately show in a person's behavior"". This is one of the many descriptions of Dissociative Identity Disorder, previously know as Multiple Personality Disorder, that I found on google. There is no diagnostic criteria or treatment for this disorder so it's hard to say for certain, but the idea of having two or more gender identities that you fluctuate between sounds something along these lines.

**TL;DR:** Do you think bigender/genderfluid are gender identities or forms of DID?

**PS:** Please don't interpret my relation to these as some sort of criticism of nonbinary people, and please don't make any comments that demonize mental disorders."

The doctor was amazing (anyone in Sydney Australia looking for trans-friendly docs, PM me!); long story short, I have referrals to a psychologist and sperm freezing centre, and can return to this doctor at any time for blood testing and HRT prescription.

I could have done blood tests straight away, but I'm terrified of needles so I'm going to do it next time. This is my first fear: the blood tests! How many do they do to check my baseline stuff? Is it just one tiny capsule of blood and that's it? My mum has high blood pressure and I have a highish resting heart rate, would this matter?

Coming out is another enormous fear. I want to come out to my sister within the next few days, as I think she'll be supportive. (I'm going to do it in a text message... then maybe chat after she responds). I want to wait until I've been on hormones for a few months before I come out to everyone else. I'm honestly expecting the worst from most people. Any tips for coming out?

I'll lose my job when I publicly come out (long story, I'm okay with leaving this job anyhow), and I'm not financially stable at the moment. This is something I need to sort out ASAP. Especially considering I could be told to move out, depending on how parents react.

I'm struggling to feminise my voice. I live in a busy household with thin walls, so training to talk like a girl in my bedroom while in the closet isn't exactly possible, as others can easily hear. I live close to work so I don't get much opportunity to practice in the car. Coming out publicly but still having a deep male voice would be horrible. A few months of HRT + somewhat passable voice are to me, extremely important before coming out publicly.

Fear of regret. The closer I get to transitioning, the more I feel like I might regret transitioning later on or that I'm making a mistake. At the same time, I could end up with the regret of not transitioning... and that would be even more painful.

I need advice! Trying to make all of these decisions and process all of these thoughts, by myself with no one else to confide in, is getting tough. :/"

asktgthrowaway66,asktransgender,HRT and/or nuking testosterone levels?,"Hey guys,

So i'm not trans at all, but I figured some of you might have advice for me. This might seem entitled of me as a cis male or whatever you want to think, but I really want to get rid of the testosterone in my body. Not only do I really like the idea of no longer having a sex drive, but aesthetically speaking, i'd so love to look androgynous, plus male secondary sex characteristics (facial and body hair, balding, etc) just really don't appeal to me at all.


So anyways, I'd really like to either get my balls chopped off via orchiectomy or start taking cypro; however, both of these require (a.) my ""coming out"" as eunuch or whatever to my family and to everyone around me, (b.) my finding a doctor/therapist/psychiatrist willing to give me a prescription for anti-androgens + estrogen (i'm not even sure if i need est but apparently it's bad for my bones not to have any sex hormones), (c.) possibly finding out how i could get an orchi, and (d.) not going so far with medication as to either develop liver/bone problems or start looking like a legitimate MtF. I'm ultimately just so confused about all of this, as self-medding seems so risky and costly, and doing all of this stuff requires a lot of explanation that no one seems to have gone through before. Anyone have any advice?

EDIT: oh yeah, and financially speaking, I'm a college student who pretty much relies on his parents' money. I have a job but it's minimum wage and I'm not sure how much medication i can leverage out of that/if i can get an orchi with such little money + health insurance that probably doesn't even cover it. My parents are pretty conservative, but at least coming out as trans would elicit some sympathy from them. The idea of explaining my feelings here just seems kinda outlandish and weird, and there isn't a huge ""support network"" for this sort of thing, i don't think."
ts_curious,asktransgender,"For those that repressed your transgender identity, how was the journey from realizing the possibility of being trans to questioning to accepting to transitioning?","So I am just wondering if anyone experienced that you had to untangle sort of you transgender identity, and if you felt that you had compartmentalized sort of in you efforts to repress it?


I am currently slowly coming to the acceptance of the possibility of me being transgender. I am still a bit hesitant, but I guess that might have to do with what might happen if and when I accept what and who I am. I have shared a bit about my journey before, and I've been on a waiting list to see a physiologist who specializes in gender identify issues. Its been a heck of a long waiting time from when I first asked for a referral to him around february, when I first started to really question this. I live in the Nordic, and things move a bit slowly here. I am hoping to see him within a month or 2.


Anyway, the last months have been a bit of a roller coaster where I have felt ok at times, down and depressed at times, and also anxious it think (still struggling to accept that I might experience some anxiety, but nervous energy and constant heavy sighing is difficult to attribute to anything else). I have also been more grumpy than normal, which I feel really bad about.
So there is a part of me that is like, ""yep there's the dysphoria again"", and then on the good days: ""what the heck was I thinking, its just the fetish acting up"".... its been on repeat for a few months now, so I guess there is a sign there. 


Also, old memories that I had repressed or forgotten is coming back to me, like my first crossdressing experience when I was around 6/7, a few instances where I was envious about my sisters and what they got to wear, between age 8-11, and then remembering that I had a few periods in 20's where I had thoughts like: ""If I was transgender I would disappear, and just create a new identity somewhere so that my family wouldn't have to deal with all the shame"", and then the usual retreat, but I am not transgender, its just my crossdressing acting up.... 


There are a few other things as well, and its getting harder and harder to deny that I am transgender, but there is still a part of me that is holding on. I feel that I cant't fully let go until I see the physiologist, but I am also afraid of what might happen when I start to open up pandoras box so to speak. Wondering if these feelings will intensify, and how to cope. Does it make sense? Anyone that can Identify? 


I do feel sometimes that maybe it is possible that I have compartmentalized this part of myself so much that when I open up there will be a river of feelings and memories resurfacing.... "

Maybe I need to transition further and hopefully find a friend, or better yet a life partner and things will sort out...

But then I'm faced with the inevitable aging. 20 years of my life were shit and stolen. Now I got 1-2 years of transitioning and 8 years to do all I want. Not sure if I'd like to live past 30 or 40... Lol

And this is all assuming I even like how I end up after transition (i.e. Passing). If I don't, there's no reason to live for real

Anyone else? What do you do? How's life??

chaucer345,asktransgender,Any thoughts on handling the complexities of discussing trans issues with minors?,"Hey all,

So recently I was typing on this sub in the ""What percentage of your sexual fantasies were you female in?"" and I responded ""Oh yeah me too"" to a person who said it was 70% of the time before noticing their flair said they were 15.

I deleted the post and had a panic attack, so now I'm wondering what to do about stuff like this in the future. Obviously talking about this stuff is important, but many trans issues involve discussions of very intimate pieces of ourselves and it can be a nerve wracking dance trying to talk about it.

I don't know, any advice?"
Nynjahob0,asktransgender,Hrt blood lab questions.,"So I'm looking into hrt but I have an incredible fear of needles, and I know I'm going to need blood work. So from your personal experience, how much blood do you usually need to give for the panels?"
Emily_1567,asktransgender,Transitioning during college?,"My plan is to transition during college at some point but I am not sure how to go about it. I am planning to get my paralegal certification and get a job in 2 years(really need a break from school). Then I would use that job with insurance to pay to transition(no surgery, maybe later down the road if I wanted to). 

My other option is to go my full 4 years at once for my history degree and then get a job then. 

I was just wondering how some of you(if you did) transitioned during college or at a young age (18-22) or younger did it and any advice you can offer. I am currently 18."

(The video does seem a bit biased, since it uses T slur and ""real woman."")  

I haven't even transitioned yet, and I can do it just fine.  Am I some anomaly?  Am I doing it wrong?

Also, the video compares a long-legged, lightweight Asian woman to a long-torso, broad shoulder White man.   

Furthermore, note the complete lack of an actual trans woman who has been on hormones, which redistribute center of gravity."
BackFromOtterSpace,asktransgender,"Did you ever think a relationship could ""fix"" things?",I only recently came out to myself and am still putting the pieces together. A lot of the problems from my past that I now attribute to being MTF in denial I thought I could fix if I just met the right girl. My few attempts at dating were very forced and awkward. Does this sound like something that could happen if I am indeed transgender?
Loriellea,asktransgender,The mystery of why I'm not passing bothers me,"Yesterday I went out to the mall to pick up some gifts.  I had to go into a very tiny store, where it's crowded and there were lots of face-to-face ""excuse me"" encounters.  I heard a guy laugh and say to his friend, ""I would have been very disappointed!""  I assumed he was referring to me.  He was starring at me after he said that and was only about 5 ft. away.  I shrugged it off, but on the way home I started to really doubt if I truly pass or if I'm just glamouring myself into thinking that I do.  It wasn't his words that hurt, as it was him revealing a truth about me that I may not have seen.

From under my nose down, I think my face looks male.  It's a total mind distorter how I'm struggling with youthful and feminine looks, because despite being in my 30's I've always looked very young for my age.  I was mistaken just a few years back, living as male, for a teenager when I met a guy about my age. He was shocked to find out that I was actually older than he was.   Now that I've been on HRT for 5 months, I feel that everything is coming along except my face.  It actually looks older to me, despite even vamping up my health and hygiene of my skin.  I've always been an extreme health nut for most of my life.  I've never been into alcohol, and I've never been a smoker.  My face has this odd shape now that appears more long and wide at the bottom.  I have slight jowls forming, which makes my lips to my chin protrude forward from my face.  It looks like I have a foomanchew going on with my face tissue.  I've just got too much detail going on with my face, as it's anything but evened out.  Maybe the lack of full electrolysis is also contributing majorly to the busyness of my face. I look fine straight on, but all other angles seems sketchy at best.  I feel like I've went from a baby face to that chiseled look when Squidward had his face done, which doesn't make sense to me as it should be the other way around.

It just really messes with me how I don't know what I look like anymore.  I struggled with my looks living as a male, as my opinion always seemed to shift and especially in public.  Once I came out as a transgender woman, I thought the look doubt had mostly faded.  I want to put a pic up here, but I don't really feel like that's going to solve anything.  At best, I do need better opinions on makeup as I only have my mom with poor eyesight and she's only wore one color of eye shadow and mascara at the very most.  Maybe my makeup that day sucked, because I did do the mistake of trying a new foundation that seemed a bit light and too coveragy.  I'm also terrible at the art of concealment with contouring, and makeup is a struggle.  I think I'm a bit naive when it comes to what looks good, especially on myself.

I don't know if I should retreat from HRT, as I don't know if this will get worse or better.  I guess it's possible that the face hasn't developed yet, but I don't see it changing the tissue very much for the better.  I feel my voice is very feminine now, but who knows maybe I'm blind in seeing that too.  Feeling pretty and passing is important, and I hate that it's a top priority.  I don't see facial surgery as an option.  I feel really defeated from this, and it's no longer as joyful as it has been in the beginning.  It feels like I can no longer go out and play with the other kids, so to speak."
ICantMakeThese,asktransgender,Did anyone else feel happier after starting HRT?,"HEy all, I usually have feelings of complete helplessness when I see my masculine features. Starting HRT in a few days once the drugs actually arrive... Should be Friday but I'm considering waiting until Monday just to keep everything neat. As female features started to become more predominant did your general mood improve? I am going to go full time next September once I start university so a year of HRT before that should really make things go a bit smoother."

After finally telling my dad I was so happy. And now it feels like just telling someone about it solved the entire problem. Like none of this trans stuff matters anymore and I'm back to being a normal guy.

Im not in denial or repressing shit, I just thought id give more of a damn about this stuff. I'm absolutely gonna see a therapist and all that jazz, but at this point in time I feel like I'm just gonna work through my feelings, most likely not transition, and move on with my life.

I just don't know. Things will be more clear when I start counseling, but I'm just baffled at how indifferent I am to the thing I've been obsessing over for months."
nate4ward,asktransgender,What is your opinion?,"Let me start off by saying, I am 22 MtF pre-transition and I think I might have Klinefelter's syndrome. I know you guys aren't doctors (maybe you are), but maybe you know someone or have the syndrome yourself. Don't know how much the test is but I heard it's a lot which is why I'm asking you guys. I looked at a few websites for symptoms so, 1) My testicles and penis are very average. 2) My IQ is actually much higher than average as opposed to, the typically 15 points below average of people with the syndrome. 3) My facial hair is very average as well as most of my body hair. 4) I have a ton of muscle mass although I did work out most of life and I'm much weaker than people with similar muscle mass. So those are most of the things that go against having the syndrome, now for why I think it's possible that I do. 1) I am much taller than my parents 6ft 5, 6in taller than my dad and I stopped growing around age 14-15 which is typically female. 2) Iv'e had gynecomastia since about 8 despite being relatively thin back then, nowadays I'm about 20% body fat yet have c- cup breasts. 3)My hips are very wide almost 1:1 ratio with shoulders as well as having a very feminine pelvic tilt. 4) My legs are abnormally long compared to my torso. 5) My chest hair and stomach hair is basically that of a 14 yr old boy just getting it, compared to my 15 yr old brother who has nearly a rug to match what my father said he had at his age. I have also lost about 40lbs and almost comically have seen no reduction in cup size or butt size (which is pretty unnerving since I'm not trying to pass at the moment). If there are any other tell tale signs that can help form opinions please let me know. Or I was thinking, is it  possible that I can just have a really high level of testosterone and a really high level of estrogen at the same time? "

furriosa,asktransgender,How do you react to articles about Jeffrey Tambor asking producers to give transgender talent a chance?,"Full disclosure: I'm a cis woman.

I was wondering what your reactions were to this sort of thing. I've been aware of some of the conversation surrounding movies like Dallas Buyers Club and The Danish girl (and others), where cis men are seen as daring and brave for playing the role of a transwoman but actual transwomen, or women with a transgender history, aren't even considered for the parts.

I have a mixed bag of reactions to the attention that Jeffrey Tambor is getting, but obviously I'm coming from a place where I am not personally affected. I would love to hear from different viewpoints on people's reactions (positive or negative).

Thank you to anyone who take the time to share their perspective, I really appreciate it."

But as the title also says, I have doubts about not being trans when I am around some specific people. Those people are a couple of my female friends who I am very close to, and have been for many years. I don't know what it is, but whenever I'm with them, I feel the urge to act a lot more feminine than I usually do. It's like they bring on a ""whole new me,"" and sometimes these feelings of femininity can get drawn out into me wondering A) what would it be like to be more feminine all the time, or just flat out be a girl, and B) am I trans? 

All of this is very confusing to me, so I'm hoping you guys and girls can give me some advice. I'm happy to answer any questions if info is needed. Thanks a lot :)"

morgankingsley,asktransgender,My sister is trans,"So I have/had two older brothers. One was my biological brother who is five years older than me, making him 23 years old. 

The second one was nine months older than him because he was brought into the family. He died last year due to drug over dose, at the age of 22. 

Now I have/had two sisters. One two years older and one thirteen years younger. But that is changing now that I have come to accept the year long confession my older sister gave to me. She is transgender, a male, not a female. 

So that means that I really have/had two to three older brothers. The naturally born biological brother, the one who came in but died, and the one that was born as a sister but is really a male. Now I only have one sister, my younger one. 

Only one out of five of my parents kids were really female, and that was the by far youngest one, with all of her brothers being at least 13 and as high as 18 years older than her. 

Just wanted to speak my mind and put this somewhere so I won't feel like my head is about to explode from not telling anybody. Plus I can't really talk to my parents about it, since they hate it. They are fine with us being gay, but not trans. I don't get it. Well, I do, but I don't. I will stop before this gets confusing. "
yangxiu,asktransgender,so... have anyone ever felt or experienced similar situtation?,"ok, sooo~ i just started my E yesterday! yay! except it isnt much of a Yay! for me, i felt close to nothing. I take it because i felt there' a need, i take it even though it neither make me feel happy or sad, i take it because being trans fits me and i can finally make sense of all the things i didnt understood before.

i heard for most of us that starting E is like a major relief, but why arnt i feeling anything but fear &amp; uncertainty?

a friend said it' because i started both my AA&amp;E at the sametime. i thought maybe she' right.

for me being trans seems a little weird, i only realized im trans 2 month ago, and i know i wanted to become a woman. but sometimes it' difficalt and even uncomfterble to refer myself as a woman, where as other times im happy to be refered to as a woman.

I never had much of gender dysphoria, i knew i didnt like my penis, and wouldnt mind if i lose it, didnt mind living as a boy but prefer to live as a woman much more. but it wasnt to the point that i needed to end my life with. i didnt get break downs when looking at my body (i guess it might be i dont look at myself nake much).

prior to relalizing that i am trans, i went through a rough patch. i lost a good friend whom i was also romanticly attached to, and due to that and my many years of attemps to start a romatic relationship being a complete failour i went to deep depression, and finally started to consider taking my own life seriously. taking anti-depressent only levels my moods but it doesnt change my mind, if anything, it prob only made it clear to me that my life is a complete joke. i see no light at the end of the tunnel as a boy, and for the next few month i lived as a lifeless lump of meat to only live until the time when i ends it all. that is until i realized im trans.

when i realized im trans, all my depression was gone, i no longer think about killing myself and right away i started to work on my transition and getting hrt. and for a time i was happy, i felt everything makes sence, and i finally found my place, and is no longer an outcast. i often question if im trans, but i also know that i am, because one of my earliest memory are that of dressing up as a girl and questioning my parents why i cannot dress as a girl, and the fact that i always wanted to be a girl. 

i know my fear of transitioning is the fear of not being able to pass (less of a fear more of a stress because there' ffs) and the possiblility of detransitioning and transition regrets. maybe that' why i didnt felt the relief that everyone was talking about? because not only do i see the benefit E will give me, but also the hardship  i will have to endure?

so... have anyone felt like me? where there was no relief after starting E? where there' no emotion assocated with starting their hrt? and or that you take it because it fits and makes sense?

im truly scared."
Gleekguy,asktransgender,Advice?,"I have been out to most people I know for about a year and a half now, and it feels good. However, I often think about how possibly I brainwashed myself into beliving im trans, and into having dysphorIA.  Also, I didn't know when I was a little kid, only a little while after puberty hit. My parents  (I'm a minor) said when I first came out that I was doing it to manipulate people. (I have a history of mental illness, so that doesn't help.

I've reading a ton of articles, and stumbled apon some by Turfs. Now I'm worried that when/if I start hrt, I will have dysphoria about that.

DebbyL,asktransgender,"Started a new job, feel like I'm taking steps back in my journey","Over the past weeks, I made huge progress in my acceptance of who I am (MtF). I had started seeing a therapist, I had started experimenting with fun clothes and makeup in public, and I had started contemplating coming out and hopefully start HRT soon (which would still be more than a year from now).

But, I had all the time to do so. Coincidentally, I started a new job this week. The content of the job appeals to me, and I have good faith that I will learn a lot there. I was even hoping it would take my mind a bit off of dysphoria. Now that I started, I feel like all the progress I made is being destroyed. I work in an office with only exclusively older men, and only a few (older) women. I had considered experimenting with my look, but I feel like it would be very, very deviating from the office norm. I'm not required to wear a suit, but everyone kinda looks alike. I'm afraid to show any signs, since I'm still on my probation period for the first few months.. I'd rather now show any unusual behavior during this time. So I'm back to wearing semi-formal men's clothes and being seen as a man all the time. Which I haven't been used to in a while now. It's not that I don't think my office wouldn't be accepting of transgender folks, but it feels like too much of a leap. I don't know, the people are just too different from me to really feel comfortable around.

Any advice? What can I do to still feel like I'm making progress while safely getting through my probation period?"
[deleted],asktransgender,Done,"Ive made it this far, pretty sure it's over. Tonight I tried boymode at my parents. My dad and I bonded over our Denver Broncos barely winning tonight. Jumping up and hugging after the missed field goal. I can't give this relationship up with my dad up.

To complicate bullshit further, after the game my mom and sister proceeded to make me upset. During the game and time over I still had trans thoughts, that I had before. But that aside my mom straight up told me Chloe isn't real and she will never accept her. My sister claimed Chloe is a piece of shit that's tearing apart relationships because she's selfish. Ultimately she's not even a she...Further reinforcing the idea of finally putting the kibosh on my transition.

Still conflicted but I think it's time to stop chasing this dream. Because it's nothing more than that, a dream. I think I might be able to maintain life as a depressed guy that still has family, regardless if they are worth it or not.

Lots of love ands hugs but the next 48 hours will be full of very intense thought and introspection. I just thought I'd let yall know how I'm doing. Also I would t mind if any of you would possibly lend me some time to chat for a bit...

Low hip - 34 inches (widest part)

Chest - 34 inches  (underarm)

""underbust"" - 31 inches (rib cage area just below where my breast would grow)

waist (i have some meat there... dont know if it' fat, but no defined muscle)- 30 inches/female pants size 6/27""

I have had a few dreams that are about me just starting to transition, loving it and having super rapid changes, and they're great. Those aren't the weird ones.

Lately, though, I'm having my first dreams that are of myself post-transition. Now, my dreams are usually first-person, so I don't see myself, but it's something I always instinctually know. But every dream I have of post-transition, it's the same setup: I'm at a party with all my old friends, my ex-boyfriend is there, and I'm pursuing cuddling or romance with him. Sometimes it works, but sometimes he just leaves me hanging and I feel like it is because I'm trans and a man now.

I'm wondering, do you think this is my mind second-guessing my transition? Is this a bad sign? Am I over thinking this?"

Oileabhear,asktransgender,Telling flatmates at university?,"I start uni two weeks from today and I've met my roommates via Facebook. I'm pre-transition, so it's going to be a while before I start looking the part, so I'm wondering if it's a good idea to tell them that I'm trans and about my new name and such.

I'm essentially torn between telling them now and establishing myself as female in their heads now and leaving it until I actually begin to change."
picorro,asktransgender,Unrealistic expectations and intense jealousy,"I consider myself lucky, when I first came out to my parents and friends were all surprisingly supportive. I had a lot of things going my way, I was young and my parents were generous enough to help me out financially throughout the process. I had pretty high hopes for myself, that I would easily pass and become the girl I thought I would be.

Then reality set in, my expectations were far too unrealistic. Someone as bulky and large as me could never become the small, petite and bubbly girl I wanted to be. Sure, I'm Asian. Everyone says that Asians pass easier, but I was built like an ape, as with all of my brothers. 

The only way I could ever pass, if I'm lucky enough was to dress and act far older than I actually am. There were so many clothes I wanted to wear that I couldn't, it was either too small on me or it just looked flat out wrong. With the best of my effort, I could maybe pass half of the time as a very masculine-looking older lady.

What made this even more painful was my intense jealousy of a close friend of mine. I've met her when she was still in the closet online and she represented everything that I ever wanted to be.

It just wasn't fair that even with years of HRT, I couldn't pass as well as her in the first month. Within the first month of her coming out, she had already looked better than I ever will be. I'm not even half as pretty as her even at my best. She was blessed with almost everything that I wanted, she was small and undeniably feminine. Almost like the splitting image of what I dreamed of being.

I stick out like a sore thumb whenever we went out together with the rest of my friends. They were all attractive looking young 20-somethings while I'm this ugly hulk of a crossdresser just trailing behind them. It got to the point where I just gave up girlmode whenever I'm with them, because it made me feel so much worse.

I don't want to hate her, but there is so much resentment on my part. I was years further into the process of transitioning. It just never felt fair to me.

He's also made homophobic comments, asking why Joseph was so happy about gay marriage being legalised as it's ""not normal."" Just a few days ago, his brother referred to trans people as retards and called him a retard as well for being trans male. He can't deal with it for much longer, he's at a lower point than I've ever seen him in before and I fear a lot for his own safety. This has been going on for so long and it's damaging his mental health to the point that this is becoming so urgent and high risk but he doesn't actually have anywhere he feels comfortable going to for help. His parents won't do anything because they're the same and get angry at him for involving anyone outside like school. We live in the UK, is there anything practical that can be done safely without bad consequences from parents or anyone else? I'd rather not wait and see what happens if he can't take it anymore.

throwawaeiouy,asktransgender,Not sure if I'm trans or just obsessed with lesbian relationships?,"Ever since I hit puberty I've always loved lesbian porn and pretty much watched it exclusively. However, for the past few years I've spent time reading about what it's like being in a lesbian relationship and looking at pictures of cute girls kissing or hanging out and I want that SO BADLY.

I'm physically male so I sometimes feel like I'm being intrusive in these spaces? But the thought of being a girl in a relationship with another girl....nothing would be better.

Has anyone here gone through something similar?"
DandereMadness,asktransgender,What were your experiences before realizing you were trans?,"I'm AMAB and i've been wanting to make a post sharing my experiences and everything that happened to me while i grew up so this may be a little long.

Since always i've been pretty lonely in my life, my parents used to work a lot and we were somewhat poor, as a kid i didn't have friends and spent most of my time at home playing videogames and later tinkering with the computer. We lived in a small town, and by the time i reached around 6th grade puberty started and it made me hate myself. 
I had almost adult levels of body hair with 13yo, and in this time i unconsciously decided to grow out my hair - to this day i cannot remember what made me do this but my guess was to counter my so sudden body dysphoria. Being the only ""boy"" with long hair made things bad in school as it attracted more bullies to me, and they made sure to beat me up every now and again. I had no idea transitioning was even possible so i just suffered everything.

In highschool i cut my hair short, and depression decided to make a visit this time stronger as my dysphoria increased, but at least people stopped with the bullying. It was hard to even study and get decent grades, and during these years i thought a lot about killing myself but i didn't, because my parents were working hard for me to stay in school and i didn't want to dissapoint them. 

I started to ""crossdress"" in my room as a form of comfort but with no idea why. I also felt envious of girls in my class, i thought all guys wanted to be girls but they were just pretending to be comfortable as a guy - because like, who wouldn't want to be a girl? - In these times i didn't even know trans people existed. I shaved my face and body daily in hopes of making me feel less awful.
I even tried to be ""normal"" and live my life as a guy, but in the end i always felt uncomfortable. Normally, i preferred to stay home, learning things in the computer, playing videogames, reading and watching stuff. In rpgs i could only play with female characters, playing with male characters just felt wrong and it was difficult for me to relate to them.

In these years i never dated or wanted to get close to anyone, i just wanted to get things over. I never really had any self esteem about by my body, and avoided things that involved taking my clothes off, like swimming or beach. My parents split up after i finished highschool and i went to college. I was very depressed, and went to live with my mom. Thought about killing myself again but i didn't want to leave my mom alone to deal with the difficulties after the divorce, so i helped her a lot and didn't want to cause more problems.

In college, seeing all the people that made me feel awful during middle school in a daily basis was nauseating. This was when i cracked completely. I had a lot of difficulty concentrating, couldn't even pass my classes and i repeated the semester three times. There was a girl that i talked during these times online and it made me feel less awful. She lived far and at this time my feelings were very confused, and we started to get close.

My mom married my now stepfather and we moved away from that town. This was my lowest point as i didn't even care about my body and was severely underweight, but also my first step into recovery from emotional damage. I slowly started to explore my gender identity and figure things out, and a year later i came out to my mom and my stepfather, to my surprise they were very supportive.  My relationship with that girl also grew and we started a long distance relationship, although she didn't take well when i finally came out to her after around 2 years of knowing eachother (this relationship probably was my only big mistake looking back now). 

I got into college again, made appointments with a therapist, and my mom managed to get me an appartment so i could be more independent. My girlfriend moved in with me because she wanted to start college here, and said she wanted to be supportive if i were to transition. That however turned out not to be true, we started to have a lot of conflicts in our relationship. Also it took me a lot of time to realize that i didn't like much to have sex with the body i have. She was not the person i expected in a lot of ways (seems like i only started to know her truly when she moved in), does everything in her power to drag me down and avoids conversations on difficult topics like the transition itself. 

I want to try HRT as i have an endo appointment next month, but right now honestly things are more difficult because of this relationship. I'm trying to find a way out without making things bad for her (because she has nowhere to stay outside of my appartment). I know i may end up lonely but, i've been lonely my entire life.

But anyway, just wanted to share my experiences. What things happened in your past that were signs that you were trans?"

AnarchyFox,asktransgender,"Parents, HRT and coming out?","I'll try and keep it short and sweet.

My parents don't know, I'm still heavily in the closet. I've taken steps to where I can possibly get HRT, however I am a full time student and despite being financially independent for the most part, I don't think I could afford the initial fee and monthly expense without my parents help though.

But they have NO idea. Not saying they're going to react badly or anything badly or anything. But I am very scared on their reaction, especially my dad. I don't want them to feel betrayed or disapproving of me. They have always said the whole 'We'll love you no matter what' but its always easy to say that isn't it? If I was to tell them I think my mother would take it better than my father.

And all that isn't even mentioning my own insecurities. Whether or not it will be money wasted, whether it will work for me. I just feel like the opportunity is there and telling and asking my parents for their support is the biggest wall I'll ever face.

Any advice would be appreciated."

I have tried to make clear that im only interested in cardio but not much success and thats the reason I dont wanna go.
My mom knows im trans from a post I made and she asks me a lot if im 'normal' and I just say yes because it's really a lost battle talking with her but im sure she doesn't believe me.

So whenever I say I only want to run in the gym she wants to have a conversation and remind me horrible stuff she said about trans people and it kills a part of me every time.

I mean come on I wanna do the fuck I want and before even starting at the gym I said im only interested in running but no one seems to understand. Same goes with my dad as well he says I should other stuff as well but I really dont want to..

I thought about telling my mom I do weights even tho I dont but that Will probably not end good.

Did or has anyone else found they got an increase of UTI's on T? I'm getting worried I may need some kind of pelvic exam, which I cannot consent to, because I suffer from really bad dysphoria so that would kick it into high gear and I was also assaulted when I was a child and now the thought of anyone, no matter how clinical, touching me sends me into a panic attack. :S :S I'm drinking loads and loads of water to try and stop these, but nothing seems to be working.

jaquilynnblack,asktransgender,One year on Hormones... The road so far,"So.. been on hormones for a year so far. I wanted to write down all my gains and losses. Please keep in mind, these are just **my** experiences, other's will differ. 

**Gains**

-Breasts (34c, shaping and amazingly still growing) 
-A fem hourglass shape (hard to maintain but worth the work)
-Thick thighs, hips and (i will admit) a fat rear.
-A wonderful career in a super supportive company (even more so since i came out and started dressing at work)
-A perfect girlfriend and an amazing Girlfriend/Mistress (yes, bdsm related but i still wanted to include this because she is my number one supporter after my primary girlfriend)
-The will to live 
-New friends who see me as i see me
-A life goal
-Mental issues (sever BPD and anxiety)
-Periods (yeah once a month shit sucks for like 3-5 days)
-The ability to love (i love myself so now i can love others)
-An increase loathing for my male parts (when i first started i wanted to keep it... now I can barely look at it)

There is probably more, but right now im kinda hungry and cant think straight.. 

**Loss**

-A boyfriend and bestfriend (one and the same, we are better but me and him will never be friends like we were before)
-All my old friends (being hyper-masculine before and coming out was too much of a whiplash for them, i understand... well now i do)
-My family (yeah, they basically disowned me, still stings)
-Co-workers that talk to me
-the ability to eat meat on a regular basis (think that one is just me though... *shrug*)
-Smoking ( not completely but i only smoke a few when out dancing once a month, vaping the rest of the time)
-Drinking (quit drinking as much)
-My mind (i am quite emotionally unstable)

There could be more but like i said... still hungry..

How does this compare to anyone else after a year?

talex365,asktransgender,Gender therapy turning into traditional therapy normal?,"So I went to my second gender therapy session today and my we got talking about my childhood and how it sucked. During the course of this conversation she brings up that she feels that I've got the whole trans thing down, that I don't necessarily need a lot of counselling there, however my childhood issues have left me with a lot of emotional scarring that has caused me to learn not to deal with most of my emotions. She thinks that while she wouldn't prevent me from getting on hrt, it may not be the best choice for me right now as e could bring all of those old emotions back to the surface and if I don't know how to handle them before hand it could send me into a depression tailspin. 

Now I'm in no hurry to get on hrt, I've gone 32 years without so what's another few months, and I definitely think there is some merit to what she's saying, but it got me curious, is this something that happens frequently during gender therapy?"

I'm afraid that no matter when I do it, it's gonna break his heart and make his already large pile of stress 100X worse. I'm scared I'm gonna ruin his hopes and dreams for me.

TypingGarbage,asktransgender,Question about therapy,"Hi.

I'm going to be seeing a gender psychologist (therapist?) soon to talk about HRT and gender dysphoria and things like that. 

The thing I'm worried about is that the topic of the severity/issues it is causing will probably come up. Such as if I've ever felt suicidal. I have, and a lot of the times it is because dysphoria, but a lot of times it isn't. I have been falling lower and lower into a pit of mental health issues since I was 10 and never told anyone. I have tons of other problems in my head. 

I'm a teen, and if I say that yes I am suicidal. Yes, I have a plan. But no, I'm not going to do it anytime soon... would they still report me to my parents or send me to a hospital? I also have 'violent' thoughts and stuff and I know that gets you sent away too so I don't want to mention that either. I don't wanna go to one or confront parents because I'm not emotionally close with them. But mentioning mental health might get them to buy into how bad my dysphoria really is... :/

So I guess two main questions:

1. would mentioning this get me in trouble?
2. do gender therapists strictly only work with dysphoria or are they involved with mental health stuff too? so if they suspected something with me, can they investigate forth? 

I've never been to any type of therapist ever so I don't know how it works.

twasanotherthrowaway,asktransgender,And that's why gender neutral toilets and locker rooms should exist.,"So, month ago I wrote a post about security suggesting me to go to the female foilet: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4zdols/boymode_fail_2_security_and_bathroom_involved/

For the past two weeks it happens EVERYTIME I want to go to the toilet. I don't pass so I won't go there, yet I'm not very welcome in a male ones either, last week security wanted me to leave as soon as I went there.

Today I went to the toilet two times and two times had a problem. One time I was the only person in a toilet and I was washing my hands. Guy walks in while reading a book, sees me and runs out to check labels. Then he came back and was looking at me with face like ""O_O"".

And the second one, I pressed the randomizer button (pass/search), and it showed up ""search"". I emptied my pockets, security officer searched me with a device that detects metal, signed sheet, packed my stuff back into my pocket. I'm going to the toilet... and here we are again, he stopped me and said that women's toilet are this way. I even were talking with him and yet he didn't believed me until I showed him my ID card. His face: ""O_O"".

So, in short that's why neutral toilets should be a standard. Unfortunately I haven't seen one in the UK yet."
tinyshain,asktransgender,What if I had never cut my hair?,"I wish I had realized sooner I was trans. I wasn't a feminine girl, but I thought I was a girl, and fine with it, for 21 years. It wasn't until I cut my hair short and people started mistaking me for a guy that I started questioning my gender identity. Which sort of makes me feel like a fraud. Like, what if I had never cut my hair? Would I just have kept on living like I was, feeling ""off"" but not knowing why?

But being mistaken for a boy just felt...good. It surprised me, but it felt right. I wanted it to keep happening. And then I realized my body image issues weren't because I wasn't a typically attractive female, but they were because I wanted to be as thin as possible to look more androgynous. But no...now I've realized I don't want to look androgynous. I want to look like a guy.

But again, what if I had never cut my hair? Would these thoughts ever have come up? Would I ever have realized my dysphoria for what it was? Am I just making things up and attributing them to dysphoria?"

th3saurus,asktransgender,Should I be worried about being invalidated by gender therapy?,"Hello, I am a 26 year old mtf transgendered person from the pacific northwest.

Sorry about the long post, I just started getting introspective and my past spilled out.

I have lived the past 25 years of my life as an asexual male, but this summer, the stars aligned, and I finally got the privacy and solitude I needed to explore my gender identity.

I have been fascinated and terrified by the way I feel about my gender for pretty much my whole life. 
I have never really identified with the idea of masculinity. I never wanted to ""be a man,' but I accepted it as the inevitable outcome of being born with xy chromosomes.
I have never been able to imagine myself as an adult male, or as a father.

At the same time, I've been curious about being female from a young age. I fantasized about waking up in a different body, living for a day as the other gender to see if it fit me better. I prayed and wished at every spiritual entity I could think of. Of course nothing happened, but I was still disappointed

These feelings weren't a huge part of my life, but they didn't really go away as I got older. 

When I reached college age, I struggled with a lack of passion for what I was studying. I didn't care about succeeding in my education, I wasn't concerned with money or my future, I really only wanted some space from my parents so I could make my own decisions about my life.
Anyway, as I sat in my room alone last summer, I really felt the gravity of the situation I was in. I knew that I really really wanted to be more feminine, to get a chance to experience things I’d missed out on because of 25 years of fear. I felt a wrenching in my gut, the same feeling I got before I rode a roller coaster for the first time. The same feeling I had before I stepped out on stage for the first time.
And in that moment I knew. 
If I don’t do something about this now, I will regret it forever.
It has been about four months since then, and I’ve spent about two of them so far attempting to transition using supplements and herbs. I have been getting some results, most noticably, my hair (which is 2 feet long and was starting to shed alarmingly quickly) began to shed at a normal rate.
I’m concerned with my future though, and at some point I want to switch to a medically assisted transition, especially since, when my health insurance comes through, I can get HRT for free.
The one roadblock is the required letter I’m supposed to get from a gender therapist. I’ve looked into informed consent clinics, but information about ones in my area is scarse.
Honestly, I’m a little terrified of being invalidated by a gender therapist. My problem is that I see my desire to transition as a positive one. Besides my genitals and body hair, I don’t hate my body. I’m gradually warming up to the idea of having breasts, but what I have so far still feels a little foreign to me.
I’m also not offended easily, and I’m still not really used to having female pronouns applied to myself, nor have I asked anyone to start using them on me, although I would appreciate it.

I really do want to transition, but from a skeptical standpoint (which I imagine a typical person performing a GID evaluation would have) I just don’t know if I hold water.
“Where’s the crippling distress?” they might ask, or “why is this a medical necessity?”
I’m just not sure how I can answer those questions. I’m an honest person, and it kills me to lie. I just don’t feel like I am fully female inside. I haven’t “earned it”
Anyway, if anyone is still reading this wall of text, thank you.
I’m really want to believe that my struggles are normal, that I have nothing to worry about and should just go to a gender therapist already.
Best case scenario: I get a friend and a letter"

IncognitoGirl81,asktransgender,Trying to address woes with my insurance and electrolysis.,"I'm dealing with insurance woes. I was denied coverage for electrolosis/laser because my doctor failed to address a couple of issues. One issue was that I had previously received laser several years ago. The other thing is that they want to know why shaving won't be enough. I want to address these issues without saying something that's going to get me perma-denied. 

&gt; Fact: The laser I received was incomplete. While each session yielded good results, It was not a full treatment. Completing the treatment was not financially viable. 

 &gt; Fact: Shaving is not enough because significant hair regrowth occurs midway through the day.

&gt; Fact: my doctor agrees this is medically necessary.

I want to address the issues in my reply without screwing this up. I feel like if I was talking to a person, it'd be easy.

barnebae,asktransgender,How would you approach another trans-person?,"I'm currently a pre-HRT trans girl going to a medium-sized university. I'm at the stage where I'm coming out of my shell and trying very hard to break out of my extremely self-conscious, shy ways that I've developed after years of depression and shut-in behavior.

More recently, I have an intense interest in making contact with other nb, trans, and not-cishet people in my area. I want to connect with them and talk about their and my experience and make friends like me. I hope this is normal?

Long story short, there is a girl in my class who has certain mannerisms that suggest that she's been transitioning for awhile. If I wasn't going through this process myself, I honestly wouldn't have noticed the signs (adam's apple, etc.)

My problem is that we don't have much opportunity to talk in class, so we haven't spoken much aside from small chatter and jokes. How do I approach her? Do I approach her at all? I feel like I'd be doing something bad, just cause I'd basically be saying she's NOT PASSING by recognizing her as trans. I don't want to hurt her feelings because she's honestly adorable and totally owning her look. I also don't want her thinking I'm doing this in a creepy way?? Like, I just want to be able to express that I'm going through something similar and maybe ask her out for a coffee to chit-chat and say hello. I'm not trying to get in her pants or anything

How do I approach her without making her feel bad or coming off as a weirdo? Should I even approach her at all? How would you feel if someone approached you?


EDIT: Yeah, I uh..

Yeah. Honestly my inner feelings were only validated here. I know it's shitty to out people which is why I asked for a second opinion in the first place, so I'm not going to. I think I'll just try to make friends with her in the normal way (which I'm terrible at). I'm trying to come out of my shell anyways so it'll be good for me. I'll be dressing far more andro in the coming weeks and I think it'll be clear to her that we're similar in that way. Hopefully it's something we can both realize and silently acknowledge without any feelings getting hurt. Anyways, thanks for confirming my suspicions. "

Kannoss,asktransgender,How do I start hrt or at least blockers asap?,"So I've been sure of myself in that I would like to transition to female, but I've been really depressed lately as I feel that male puberty is really beginning now (I am 16). I have already come out to my dad and he has scheduled a meeting with a therapist. How do I bring up that I want to start estrogen and blockers asap. I feel that the estrogen would require some time before I get access to, but the blockers should be easier to get because the effects are ""safer"" and easier to ""back out of"". Do you think it's possible to get blockers within like the first week of therapy or something because I'm getting rally depressed from the prolonged effect that puberty is doing :(?"
throwawayacc4856,asktransgender,"Stories about my family, I would love some help.","So, here is a little story.

Some time in 2014-2015, I figured out I was trans.

November 11, 2015. I came out to my friend, which turned out very well! I wrote 3 paragraphs, and it turns out all i needed were 3 words: ""Hey I'm transgender""

November 16, 2015. I cam out to my mother, expecting her to be fine with it. Although I don't have proof, she said something along the lines of ""I'll always be there for you.""

When she sent that message, I got excited, I thought that she would be completely okay with it, and we would build trust, buuuut...

December 20, 2015. I came out to my dad, sister, aunt, and grandpa. They didn't take it too well. My grandpa responded with ""I love you"", and my dad responded by going up in my room and talking to me. Long story short, he said it was a phase, and I would get over it.

December 31, 2015. My dad and I were arguing over something, I can't remember what it was, but it wasn't important or relevant. While we were arguing, he said ""Well, I don't think you are a girl!"" I ran to my room, and sat in bed for the rest of the day. My dad tried to come in and pull a ""You took me wrong"", but it's pretty obvious what intent he had.

It was about this time I realized they didn't really care. I tried to push them to refer to me as a female, but they refused.

June (unknown day), 2016. My dad and I got in an argument over Twitter. It all started when he got home from work, and I was talking to a friend. I had Twitter in the background, without knowing, and he said ""Nice pic."" I was really confused, and instinctively said ""Thanks, you too!"" I looked back at him, and he looked angry. I was really confused, so I looked back at my monitor. I realized that there was hentai on my Twitter timeline. It wasn't anything super bad though, just a woman, and you could barely see her breasts.

My dad stomped downstairs, and went outside to smoke. I didn't understand what the problem was, so I waited about 5 minutes, when outside, and asked him what the fuss was. We started shouting at each other, and he said ""I always do what you want me to do, and you never do what I want you to do!"", I managed to get in ""You don't always do what I want you to do!"" He told me to give one example, and I said ""Call me a girl!"" He calmed down, and said ""Fine, I'll call you a girl from now on.""

About 3 months later, and I have yet to hear him refer to me as a girl once.

At this point, I'm kinda stumped. I don't know what to do. Even though I didn't list it, I have tried being nice and soft, I have tried being forceful, I have tried bribing, and nothing seems to work. I'm not 18 yet, so I can't transition even if I tried. If anybody can help me, I would love it.

I would just like to note, I don't *really* know if I want to post this, so this may be gone sometime soon."

transandpans,asktransgender,HRT letter questions,"Cross-posting this from /r/ftm because I didn't get many responses.

What does a HRT letter have in it/what does it say? I'm thinking of asking my therapist to write one for me, even though I have unsupportive parents. I feel that if I have that, it may force the issue a little more with my parents and make it clear to them that this isn't just a hypothetical, future decision; it's a reality, and it's happening whether or not they let me do it now. For context, I came out to them around 3.5 years ago. Mom is still largely unaccepting, while dad has made enough progress to acknowledge that I will make decisions on this, like starting testosterone, with or without their support. Do you think this would be a good way to show my mom the same thing that my dad has started to realize, or do you think it's too forward/too sudden, given that we don't discuss this a lot? I've written them letters about my gender before, specifically about my gender presentation and social transition. They've allowed me to wear a tux instead of a dress for band, and I can dress however I like in general. They don't support my social transition, though I did that at school without their permission anyways. What do you all think: good idea or bad idea to ask for an HRT letter?"

someone-someguy,asktransgender,Is it okay if I just rant a little?,"I'm trying to get to sleep but I just keep causing the anxiety to pile up. I feel like typing my feelings up will ease my nerves a bit.

Friday I see my counselor. He's a nice guy and has helped me with my depression, but as far as everything trans goes it's been a standstill. And that's all my fault. I buried my feelings for my mom and a girl who I got obsessed with. Instead of dealing with what should've been my number one priority I pushed it off and lost a whole year of my life that could've been spent figuring things out.

So anyways this Friday I have to tell him that almost all the depression I have left stems from my gender and that I am lost. 

I'm just so afraid of being wrong, and I know that's okay but it doesn't help me shake of feelings of dread. I sometimes wonder if this is just an extreme fetish, but I don't want it to be. I know in my heart what's real and who I am, but there's just been so much anti-trans things said throughout my life that I think I am trying to convince myself I am not trans when I am.

I just let what people think of me get to me too much. If I honestly didn't care I would've tried transitioning years ago. Instead I try to be the perfect son that everyone sees me as. I smile and act happy but I'm not. I'm not happy because I know if all my family saw me as who I was they'd look at me with disgust. My own mom has made it clear that she thinks me transitioning would not allow for me to be happy and that just because I transition I will never be a girl.

Her words are full of lies. I know what I'm going through is real, but it's just hard to shake that brainwashing away. I found an old post on yahoo asking how I could brainwash myself to not be trans, from when I was 17. 3 years ago I was trying to find ways to kill a side of me that deserves to exist. I'm so glad that so many wonderful trans people have been so kind and helpful all these years. It's all of you who've kept that little bit of hope in me that I'll be able to work up the courage to be who I am one day.

Sorry if this seemed like a big pointless rant. I just can't sleep and needed to get this off my chest. "

I've recently come out to my parents as trans, twice. The first time I came out to them, they were enraged but later accepted me. The second time I came out to them they said they supported me. However in the car my Dad was saying how you should just stay with what you're given and that according to him, trans people don't look convincing, that science isn't very good at transition, which honestly sounds like bullshit to me. Oh, he also said since he's 56 and I'm 17, he has more life experience and I therefore don't know what I want. 
I was visiting a psychologist before but ever since I came out to him he seemed a bit clueless. He handed us a sheet of paper, a place where LGBT people go. I assume it was another camp or something. Well anyway, he said that isn't his field of work. 
My psychologist also thinks I'm lying to him about other issues, so I've stopped seeing him because I don't think I can transition through him, and he thinks I'm lying, he's really old fashioned and I just feel that his views are wrong about life. 
My parents are very aware I want to transition and I have in fact mentioned that I want to see a gender doctor. 
I'm having an appointment with my school counselor now, I'm going to tell him I'm trans and I'm kinda panicking about it now. My goal is to somehow get referred to a gender doctor.

Im asking this because iv seen a lot of discussions regarding if progesterone helps or not with breast development, and even if its not proven, id rather not risk having my chest not really develop that much.

Now, iv been only on hrt for a month, so, this isnt something that really bothers me, its just really a thing for me to consider in the future

PS: btw, im also kinda curious since my progesterone levels were like 4x higher than what they should be for males (not complaining), so, im wondering if having a naturally higher progesterone production would be enough (i mean, it wasnt that high, but, if regular hrt increases it then one would assume that it would still be produced in higher quantities than if i was within male ranges before hrt)"

I might have found a general urologist who will do this, and if I went that route I think my current insurance should cover it entirely.

I ended up finding this [one survey in which they had various de transitioned trans men/trans masculine people answer questions relating to their transition/detransition.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-RCWYCNGM/)

One significant thing I find wrong with this is that the primary reasons for their detransition was political/ideology change which suggests to me that they were heavily influenced by a certain group of radical feminists.

My final overall opinion on this survey is that it's rubbish and doesn't prove that gender dysphoria(FTM anyways) is because of society and all of the other stuff that GC likes to try and say causes it.

I've always felt that my dad had a controlling personality.  He's easy to get upset. 

On top of my dad's rejection, I decided to take a total of four college film classes, all of them hands-on and very demanding, the only reason me taking any of them in the first place being to please my dad.  My dad wants me to graduate ""on time"", and because I live with him and am financially dependent on him I gave in and signed up for the classes, despite me failing for the first time the semester before that.

Additionally, I have no friends whatsoever.  I have no one that I can speak to who I feel actually cares about me and my situation.  They only talk to me at all when I contact them first -- none of them ever ask me how I'm doing or how I'm feeling.  I've attempted to communicate to some of them about my depression and have even come out to two of them, but they haven't seemed to care about me much at all.  I just feel like a burden and that I'm bothering them, so I've started to ignore them completely.

I also recently got out of an emotionally abusive romantic relationship with a narcissistic guy roughly a month ago.  So I've been trying to heal from that as well.

I cannot get any work done for the life of me.  There are days where important projects are due and tests are held, and I can't even summon up the energy to get out of my bed, much less leave the house, get on the bus, get my skinny, whimpy ass to class and do the work that needs to get done.  I feel alone, hopeless, like no one will ever actually care about me and that my entire life's a wreck and a joke.  My days consist of staying in bed until noon, barely eating or drinking anything, spending days on end inside the house not able to get out.  Not doing any assignments.  Not studying.  Not doing any college-related activities.  Not meeting people.  Neglecting doing any basic chores for days, such as washing the dishes and even brushing my teeth.  Not feeling joy from anything.  Feeling alone and misunderstood.  Feeling miserable. 

I haven't felt happy months.  I don't know what to do.  Nothing interests me anymore.  I cannot feel joy or excitement for anything.  

I've toyed with the idea of moving out of my dad's place, getting a job and managing for myself, thinking that maybe an entirely new enviroment far away from my dad would be a way to... I don't know, start fresh or something.  Feel less alone.  But I can barely take care of myself at this point.  I know I'm only kidding myself. 

I feel like I'll very likely never live the life I want to live.  I'll never be truly happy.  I'll never make a commendable difference to the world by helping people.  I'll never have friends who actually care about my wellbeing.  I'll never experience being married to a kind, caring, understanding and faithful person and living simply and happily with them.  I'll always feel lonely, hurt and misunderstood. 

I've already spoken to a few counselors and they've told me I should make the most of things and try my best.  When I spoke up about the emotional abuse I endured they ignored it and simply repeated how I should do my best to think positively and consider taking medication if my depression continues. 

I'm writing this all out here out of desperation.  For any advice anyone can give. 

I'm twenty-two and feel that my life is already over.  I just need to wait the long wait for it all to eventually end."
JasonsThrowaway11,asktransgender,Am I transgender or am I just like Norah Vincent?,"I've been living as a woman for a couple of years now and I'm really scared that I'm not actually a transgender woman. I'm worrying that instead of being a transgender woman I'm like Norah Vincent in the sense of I've been living as a woman and it's making me very depressed because I'm not really a woman, instead i'm a cisgender gay man as I came out as before I started living as a woman. 

I seem to be very depressed sometimes and last year I confided in one of my family members and said to them and I quote ""I don't know if I want to transition and live as a woman anymore"". Then after I said that I suddenly felt a sense of relief. Surely if I was really a transgender woman the thought of delaying my transition would of caused me anxiety, stress, depression, etc and not relief. Right?

Lilacbean,asktransgender,Dealing with the Social Security office? (Longish),"**Edit:** Thanks for all of the awesome advice and kind words! We really appreciate it! &lt;3 


Ok, so my wife had her name legally changed a week ago. We went directly to the Social Security office after that to update things there. While there, she asked about changing her gender marker with them. We were told that she needs a letter from a physician stating a bunch of stuff and then they would do it.

Her next appt with her doctor was Monday of this last week. Doctor is on a sliding scale, so she charges for these particular letters. We got two - one for the DMV, the other for the Social Security office stating everything that they required.

We went on Wednesday to the DMV and after a shit-show thanks to the new Travel approved licenses, she got her license updated with her new name and a big fat **F** ! (So much squee that day! She carried her temporary one around and kept staring at the F. Really adorable. When we lay in bed, I always rub her back and I trace the letter F on her back and arm and she grins. &lt;3 I digress...!) They punched a hole in her old license and she was able to keep it. Since we ended up shutting the DMV down, we had to go to the SS office on Thursday.

Thankfully, we didn't get the same woman that we got on Friday - she seemed a little... phobic. We got an older man, who was very iffy himself. He looked over the letter, then said he had a question about something. He needed to ask someone about it. He got up, and minutes later, returned with the woman we saw the week before. She immediately recognized us and launched into this hateful sounding, ""I told you what you needed the other day!!"" I tried explaining it to her that the paper work says that it needs to be a physician, but not specifically X or Y. She just kept yelling, ""I TOLD YOU WHAT YOU NEED! I TOLD YOU! I TOLD YOU!!""

I didn't back down. My wife didn't either. The woman walked away and the man sat back down, stating he couldn't help us because the letter wouldn't work. My wife asked if the woman was a supervisor and he said no, so she asked to speak to someone. He went and brought another lady over who actually *listened* to us. The man pointed out to her that the letter was from a *nurse* - I immediately corrected him that she wasn't a nurse, that she was an ND, not an NP. Her license # and everything was there for him to see.  

The supervisor eventually backed down saying they *could* use the document, but they may need to call the doctor and verify things with her (apparently we are liars?) and they may need other proof from her. OK, fine. She walks away and the man starts *furiously* hammering his legs, so much that his arms and hands are bouncing as he types. He hands over an application that I fill out (because my handwriting is legible) and my wife signs. While I'm doing that, he is practically vibrating. 

He asks to see my wifes ID - it got hole punched the day before, so its no longer valid, and they don't accept the temporary IDs the DMV gives you. I tell him we were there the Friday before, so it should still be in the system. He heads back to talk to someone and then comes back with a completely different attitude. Its like he just a bump of something *really* good. He was nice, polite, no longer vibrating. 

He then tells us that we need my wifes birth certificate to actually say Female, too. Now, with us being there last week, with the C-word High Commander, she never mentioned that. Part of me doesn't fully believe you need that done, they just knew we couldn't produce it and we would leave.

Has anyone had any success getting that changed with them, without the birth certificate? I mean, she was able to change her name just fine without having it changed on her birth certificate, too.

We are gonna try another SS office next week.

Any advice?"
ThrowAwaySuperStar1,asktransgender,Is a long-term commitment to weekly therapy for a psychiatric referral normal?,"Hi Everyone!

I'm currently engaged in therapy for my dysphoria and we've decided that HRT is the way to go for treatment but my doctor wants me to commit to either a weekly group therapy session or weekly one on one sessions. While I'm not going to be homeless by this, this would put a lot of financial stress on me and when I told them this, they nudged the price of group down minimally ($10/session). I'm a little unsure what to do as I have a follow up appointment coming up and while I know I need therapy, I think weekly therapy would be excessive and seems more aimed to take my money than help me.

If this is the norm, I'll definitely stick it out as hrt is my goal here but this feels kind of fishy to me.

I'm in Texas, if that helps."
Lanky-Demon,asktransgender,"Those who took the informed consent path, do you regret skipping the gender therapist?","I am losing my mind waiting to start T. I don't know how much longer I can stand to wait. In addition to the added time, I'm also worried about costs for therapy appointments, not to mention the nearest therapist I could go to is over two hours (one way) from where I live, which would obviously cause time problems with my job. 

If I can find a place that will give me a perscription without a therapist's letter, can anyone think of any reason why I shouldn't just go for that? My main concern is that people will see me as invalid because I didn't get the go ahead from a ""professional"", but I've been 100% sure that this is what I need since I was 15. I'm now 21. There's no doubt in my mind that this is right for me, but I'm afraid others won't see it that way, and other people taking me seriously is very important to me. If anyone else has experience or advice for me I'd appreciate it.  

* EDIT; The general consensus seems to be ""F*** having to go to a therapist."" 
Pretty much just confirming what I thought. Thanks everyone! "
KayleeRyan,asktransgender,Could someone describe what breast buds look and feel like?,"I'm basically just trying to figure out where I'm at. If you want to help me analyse here is some info. My nipples started being sore on like day two of hormones and have ached ever since. It's so much that it hurts a lot to bump or be hugged tightly.

Now at a week and a half the area looks different. The areola has increased in diameter by 25-50%. The nipple itself is much more noticable and probably twice the size when cold. It was almost not noticeable before. The area around the areola is paler and there are bumps around it. The whole area is raised somewhat, maybe as much as a quarter inch. Enough that you can see the shape through my shirt.

I know this is normal development but it feels like it's happening super fast."

There is this special feeling emerged over time. Before it was once or twice a week. Now I sunk into it. I have no other way to describe it as ""I feel gray""

I work because I need to. I don't want to go at my favorite bar to see my friends anymore. I have this girl who's clearly interested, she's funny and beautiful but I am just out of phase, I don't really want to put effort in this. I stare at my screen, I wait for the days to pass. I have a complete loss of libido, and my only interests are to put my hoodie, go workout, back to house, shower, eat, sleep.

Sometimes I just want to go to sleep and fade away. I am not going to kill myself of course, I don't like pain and I am so lazy that it feels like I could just wait there until something happens.

I am waiting for my hormones. I don't want to interact with people as ""this"", anymore. But it seems sooo far away, and out of reach (my insurance papers are a mess, country's administration is a pain), that I feel overwhelmed by the effort I need to give in order to finally get my pills. So much, that I feel that once I'll get them, I will be completely resigned to live and to pursue a transition.

Will it pass? I'm just...

I feel like my skin is less oily, my body hair grows a bit slower, and I might be tricking myself but I feel like I'm emotionally a little more connected than before. I think all of these could be results from spreading testosterone, in not sure though.

All that said, I'm really kind of irked that I have had zero breast growth or change to my nipples.

I'd like to come out to my parents, but every time I even think about it, I get super worried. I havn't even tried to go through with it, let alone bail out. It's not that I think my parents will react badly, its more of I'm embarrassed about it, and they will think of me as a failure.

 I'm currently 17, and going to college. I completely rely on them for financial things, so if they did react badly, it would not end well for me either way. "
aesthetac,asktransgender,I just can't seem to stop flip flopping...,"Get ready for a long post, because I feel that I would like to just get an opinion from you all and see if you could help me out. I'll start from the beginning and all. 

I can't seem to figure out whether I am actually transgender or are just wanting to belong to a group of people, or it's just some fetish. I remember when I was younger I used to want to play as female characters in games such as WoW and runescape, and would mess with guys pretending to be female. In my later teen years I even made a fake female alias online and even a fake facebook for it and used it for about 1-2 years. I remember wearing a wig once and was trying to look like a girl at a costume party when i was younger as well. And of course I would just sit and wonder what it would be like to be female. These few instances and a few other similar ones happened throughout my life but I never thought them to be a big deal, and just kind of brushed it off. I am now 22 and am actually looking into all this. I explored these feelings a little bit. Im talking to an online therapist, have bought a few female panties, and such. When I tried those I didnt feel weird about wearing them. I only wished I didnt look like shit in them, and I just had the feeling wanting to hug the shit outta something.(which usually happens when I see something cute) I also got a little ""excited"".

My issue is I feel I can't stop flip flopping. Some days i'll feel fine as my self, other times i'll yearn to be a female physically. I don't really care about being a female socially, but I love cute clothes, the idea of ""being the female"" in a sexual situation, and I love their physical forms, and i think strong females are really cool! I was set on trying to try HRT a few weeks ago, but I got depressed due to my prozac interacting with alcohol so i've just been taking it kind of easy, and have been comfortable how I am as a male. 

I hate to be mean, but take it as you will, but i've seen some timelines that haven't been so good IMO. That scares me because I feel like if i couldnt pass i wouldnt want to transition. I dont feel like im actually transgendered because I really know deep down I couldnt handle being harassed by people, losing connections with the people I know, etc. just so I can look female, and maybe not even pass. I feel that isn't fair to the actual transgender women, and That this is just some fetish or something. Its not the end of the world for me to be how I am now. I dont love or hate how i look. I love anime so i like to look at cute anime girls on twitter, and the things they wear and their physical bodies (yes I know some are unrealistic and such but i mean the general idea of the female form) really make me feel like I would rather be like that. I'm just so lost. It would be easier to live as a male, and just go on, but I also want to know what could be. If there were was a perfect world were I somehow perfectly pass, and am beautiful, i keep all my friends and family, heck yeah id go for it. I can't figure myself out, not even through talking to my therapist, so I was wondering if anyone here could relate or kinda shed some light on my thoughts. I apologize if my comments have offended anyone reading. "
Mushi_Iroh,asktransgender,Anyone have experience with SHR hair removal?,"I've just had my first session yesterday for removing facial hair. Some thoughts:

* I have very pale skin and dark blonde/red hair. My hair color is supposed to be dark enough for at least trying laser first.
* It mostly felt hot. This was slightly painful at some points but bearable.
* In some areas (mostly around jaw bone/chin) there were intense stings which were quite painful.
* I sometimes asked for a small break of a few seconds. I guess I don't have a very high pain threshold :(
* It took about 20~25 minutes in total.
* I survived :p
* My skin felt hot afterwards and was cooled by a gel (which they also used during the session for conduction) and then aloe vera cream.
* I had almost no redness afterwards ... which makes me question if it worked.
* Hairs should fall out in 8~10 days.

I've read that SHR is a certain kind of IPL heating your hair follicle to about 45°C-50°C. This explains why there is no cooling element and the heat can become a bit painful. They massage your skin with the head and it gradually heats up.

So because I had no redness afterwards and I didn't always feel that needle/stinging sensation I was wondering if it actually worked for me? It did hurt but the stinging was only in a couple of places. The treated area did feel hot but cooled down rather quickly due to the gel.

Does my experience sound familiar? Did SHR work for you?"

zauraz,asktransgender,Rant..,"Next thuesday I have a time with psychologist. The last step before I can begin my gender investigation therapy as it is called in Sweden.

This therapy is there to evaluate if I am trans or not and to help me come to terms with it. I am not that sure how helpful it will be, it will however grant me hormones in 1,5 years if I want to transition. When I got my calling I was happy, relieved. Had been waiting since June for it.

These last weeks since getting it I've had a relapse of a lot of doubts. I have not experimented much, told one person my prounouns. ""Crossdressing"" is something I have done since I was twelve and I have experiences from my younger years that support the fact that I am trans. But I have never ""felt like a girl"". In my mind my gender seems kinda null even if I seem to have a desire to be feminine. 

Before it was a serious consideration in my brain I used to ""desire"" and ""want"" to be a girl. Not due to ""sexual"" things but due to me finding a female body desireable. ""Perfect"" so to say. I loved the idea and looks of it. I have also loved to dress in female clothes as they feel good, although seeing myself in a mirror barely give me any emotional response.

Seeing myself in the mirror generally only gives me an apathetic feeling or disgust in worst cases. I do not really react to feminine prounouns or female names in any sort of special way either.

I have gone from being certain of me being trans and periods of feeling uncertain.

With the knowledge that I will get a meeting next week I am scared to oblivion. I am afraid that they will make me ""reconsider"" or propose that ""I am just depressed or something"".

I have lately started worrying that maybe this is just my depression that I used to have? Maybe I am so desperate and miserable I believe being a girl might solve these things.. I know they are unrelated but yet I think so.

I have stared for a long time at women and envied their bodies in secret which makes me feel like a creep. Lately I have however started questioning if I really want to be feminine at all.. Or be a girl.. Maybe I could like being a boy if I just ""tried"" or ""you are not feeling any severe dysphoria, transition is not worth it"".

All the hardships of transitioning is also a huge anxiety factor in my life. For my own sake I really want to pass and I know some people will hate me for doing so.. I am afraid of the people around me..

I am out to my friends, and sorta my mother. Only asked one to use pronouns. Spending time on transchats has made me feel more like trans but I am afraid I am forcing it ""to fit in"".


I don't know how to deal knowing the hardships that come with it or if its even worth attempting.. Maybe a sorta miserable life is better than the potential of ruining forever?. I feel like I would be happier, yes but I doubt that aswell.

I am so afraid and uncertain of what to do.. And for some reason I am having such a hard time to truly accept myself as transgender.. Being this uncertain about my gender has also made me feel lost about the future.. What I choose to become will affect it so much so its muddled in shadows... Before I had a plan, but not anymore....

Anyone out here dealt with the same and willing to offer some words on how to cope with this?

Thanks!"

It turns out there's an ic clinic just a short distance from my university.

Turns out I can probably afford all of this.

I think this is going to finally happen.  That is all."
Arduinan,asktransgender,I had GCS 3 days ago (Update),"Continued from:
https://m.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/54s9i6/i_just_had_gcs_3_hours_ago_ama_d/

Today I'm being discharged from LBH hospital! :D

I'm able to walk a little and there doesn't seem to be any complications.  I'm not in much pain at all, so the morphine and oxygen mask stopped yesterday. The best part is, for lunch, there will be some solid food for the first time in 6 days.

It's been 3 days since the surgery, and I can feel some sensation below, but it's mostly numb and still wrapped in a badage.  There's a phantom sensation of a phallus still being there, and I can still ""squeeze"" whatever muscle is down there.  I haven't been able to look, but I do feel an incsion up the left and right side groin edges (where the crease to the thigh is). Everyone says I ""look great"" from their perspective.

I'm starting to feel relief from the dysphoria for the first time.  It's like bliss knowing there's nothing abnormal flopping around outside me. I hope my dreams realize this too. My nightmares are always about me trying to hide it.

By the way, Lower Bucks Hospital staff are all really nice people and understanding.  It's an all-woman team  mostly.  There is good ""4G"" cell signal so Netflix worked well for me, although you get a TV at your bed too.

**EDIT: Day 4**

Last night there was a lot of new pain, but at least that means some feeling is coming back?  Sometimes there's a sharp pain but it goes away fast.  The bed at GAIA is soo cozy, I slept most of the night for the first time despite the pain.

I just started to realize the packing inside me, and it sticks out some. How does the bathroom work if I can't sit and I have to *go* before the bandages come off? TMI? The bandages put on after surgery stay for a whole week, so I'm really looking forward to Monday morning.

Draining the catheter is awkward too because it's just a tube and no bag.  It's hard to tell if my bladder is full or not so I try to drain it every hour, but if any air rushes in it's super weird/painful.

I've been having some hot flashes, but not too bad. I have a little fan that helps.

The GAIA house is sooo beautiful.  I was really surprised how well it's setup for recovery and the team who runs it are making me really happy. My mom and I got breakfast in bed. :D"
vonviddy,asktransgender,Survey results - MtF Profiles,"Thanks to everyone who participated in the survey! 314 of you noble souls responded, which isn’t a bad sample size (if I might say so myself). The pool isn’t necessarily representative of all trans women, since it’s mostly redditors. Notwithstanding, I got some pretty interesting results. Some highlights are listed below. [Click here for the raw data.](https://www.scribd.com/document/325385004/MTF-Profiles-Data-Summary)

As kids, only 4% of transgirls played exclusively with “girls’ toys.” A sizeable margin—37%—played exclusively with “boys’ toys.”

17% of trans women were born premature. This is slightly higher than the overall U.S. percentage, which has varied between 10% and 13% over the last couple decades. 

Being transfem is NOT correlated with having a smaller penis. The survey shows a very regular bell curve with the median at 5–6 inches—no different than the general population.

17% of transwomen have publicly identified as gay men in the past.

25% of trans women expressed transgender feelings to another person before reaching the age of 10.

58% of trans women have had sexual contact with a cis woman, while only 36% have had sexual contact with a cis man. 32% have never had sexual contact with anyone.

Collectively, there is more sexual interest among transwomen in *other women* than there is in men. 82% of trans women are sexually attracted to cis women. 71% are attracted to other trans women. By comparison, only 54% of trans women are attracted to cis men, and only 40% are attracted to trans men. Bear in mind, though, these percentages overlap; the survey doesn’t reflect, for example, being *mostly* interested in men but also a *little bit* interested in other women.

40% of you are still presenting male. Of those presenting female, “mainstream femme” is the most popular aesthetic. The second most popular aesthetic is “nerdy” (not unexpected for Reddit), and the third is “punk.”

For 50% of trans women, their primary hobby is traditionally considered to be masculine.

36% of trans women are comfortable having a penis.

BabylonAndOn,asktransgender,Coming Out To Friends and Work Easier Than Family? (FtM Pre Everything),"I was wondering if anyone here had found it easier to come out to friends and work colleagues than family? I've only come out to one work colleague as she's also kind of a friend of mine, but I've given her my blessing to tell another colleague as 1) I wouldn't know how to broach the subject and 2) I know he'll be discreet. I've also told a few friends who I've sworn to secrecy until I've told my parents.

I'd love to go full time at work but if I did it would get out to my family. I don't want them hearing second hand info. I know my work colleagues would be accepting as I'm just myself I don't act like a man or a woman, I just do my job and have a banter with the guys. I see my work colleagues much more than my family (who I don't talk to that much due to distance and style of family).

I know I have to man up and tell my parents at some point but just can't bring myself to at the moment. I'm 95% sure they'd be okay with it but it's the other 5% that's stopping me.

Has anyone else has experiences such as this? (Comfortable with work knowing but not family?)"

I have not come out to a single person there because they all treat me so well and I dont want to change that/lose my ability to train.

Lately my coach and I have been talking a lot and I decided to tell her yesterday that I was trans (which is why I can't compete at meets).  I was on pins and needles all day until I got a message from her saying

OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,"Given my current circumstances, what would be the best time to come out?","Okay, so I'm ready to make the jump, and to finally end the self doubt and become what I have always wanted to be. But I'm 17, and before doing a single thing I gotta come out to my parent(in this case, my dad).


Regardless Of his stance on trans people(which is kinda negative, but negative in the way any 50/60 year old man would feel if he had no knowledge of the subject), He and I are in a shitty financial situation that will be fixed in a matter of months.


My first thought was to come out AFTER things were better(and I would have access to Therapy and HRT too), but given how I've been feeling as of late, I don't know if I can wait.

I feel terrible and always will until I come out. I try doing things to cope and have tried shaving my arms(and that left me with unevenly shaved arms and a few cuts. I don't shave very often,lol) and am going to start doing things to cope, but I dont know how long that'll last me.


The days keep getting harder and harder. And I need to stop holding this all in. I just don't know If now is the right time. My dad loves me so much and is proud of me and I'm afraid I'll dissapoint him and ruin our relationship. But I need help and don't know what to do."
Mistress_Impervious,asktransgender,How dysphoric am I?,"So about a year and a half ago I came out to my parents as trans. Although they aren't supportive, I've gone along quite fine. Going my first freshman semester at uni just great, and flunked my online classes in the spring due to depression. 

But in that time I didn't feel all too dysphoric that much. Just the simple ""my body looks like a man, but needs to change"" or ""wish I was more curvy and a little shorter"" kinda stuff I think evey trans girl thinks early in dysphoria. 

But the past two months have been a somewhat hell on earth for me from dysphoria. I've been to the point where I want my genitals just lopped right off. Like before this, I was okay with them, and even considered not doing full SRS. But now I just want to cry every time I look at myself in the mirror to long. I'm jealous of not being able to dress cutely like other girls, and want to be like them so badly. It pains me, and I am not understanding why I feel this way. 

I'm 19 and haven't started hrt, and I'm feeling like I'm going to have the hardest time passing when I do. Even though I look kinda androgynous right now. I know ""passing doesn't make you trans"" but I just want to be stealth. I want to transition and never look like I was ever a man. I just want to be a normal female. 

Sorry for this turning into a rant, but I'm just really frustrated with my body not matching my personality right now. "
9382713,asktransgender,Ever feel like you're 'wrong' for wanting surgery?,"This is a bit of a weird one I guess. I feel like I spend a lot of time thinking that it's ok to not have surgery and it doesn't make you any less trans but I also feel like people will think I'm 'less' non binary for wanting phalloplasty, or just in general think I'm inferior for it. This isn't because I feel like I should be satisfied with my current body though. 

I know how irrational this sounds when I'm typing it and it's more of a bad thought in the back of my head rather than any kind of truth, but I'm wondering if this is something anyone else deals with. 

It's ok to be trans and want surgery. I need to remind myself of that.

multicolor321,asktransgender,I'm considering starting HRT soon. How hard do you think it will be to make my face passable? (pre-everything mtf),"Sorry if this type of content isn't meant for this sub.

So I've started going to a therapist and I hope that within the next month or two I can start HRT.

However, I've become more self conscious regarding how hard it will be to try and pass. I'm pretty lucky when it comes to below the neck. I'm really small and most of my fat is distributed in my thighs. But my face is worrying me. I really can't put my finger on what I don't like about it but I try to imagine it w/o hair and some makeup and it sill seems really manish.

How hard do you think it will be for me to pass and what specific things do I need to be doing to make it happen?

Irishskeyes20,asktransgender,Relationship/family advice? Warning: long rant style question,"Sorry in advance for my poorly organized, lengthy post... 

Tl;Dr I have a kid, contemplating divorce (or at least separation), experiencing sexual preference change, two months on estrogen, and need advice free of judgment, which is why I posted here.

Briefly: been married for less than a year. Had our only daughter almost four years ago now. I love my daughter (always) and my wife (sometimes). My wife owns the house we stay in, my name isn't on the title and we share a car.

History: we dated briefly in high school, and it ended in disaster a month later. Jump four years later, and out of nowhere she shows up at my door, while I'm drunk, saying she got kicked out and needed a place to stay. Knowing the struggle of being homeless, having lived in my car with my dog for three months in winter, I let her stay a night. Well... She got pregnant that night and we've been together ever since (about 5 years.. ive been out to her for 1 year).

Personally: I prefer to be alone. I'm more comfortable that way, but I feel selfish for feeling this way now that I have a child to care for and keep in mind. I've toyed with the thought of separation (and been threatened with it by her), but it breaks my heart thinking about being away from our child.

Together: We bicker often, but make up quickly. I am typically irritable even in small talk with my wife, keep our conversations short, and find myself out with friends more than I am at home. Usually, I dont feel free, rather somewhat smothered. our sex life is pretty much non existent but enjoyable when its engaged. Typically I sleep on the couch or floor by preference.

To top it off: I'm trans, of which shes incredibly support of but I'm so lost...

Should I try to make this work and be ""content"" or cut my losses and be happy and separate? Any advice is appreciated. Sorry if this seems illogical..."

Mellowbelle,asktransgender,I think I'm going to become a supervillain (no joke),This is all too much. I keep getting angrier and angrier. I think I'm going to skip suicide and just go crazy until I get caught and get taken down.
TransGirlConfession,asktransgender,I think I'm experiencing loss of virginity bonding and obsession,"Me (mtf) had sex last weekend with a cis girl. We were on ecstasy, so all the walls people normally had were absent and we bonded and had this crazy night of emotion and bonding. I didn't know her before that night. After the sex we spent all night cuddling and talking and she told me such nice things that made me feel so safe, so liked, and so validated.

Problem is she's made plans with me twice since then and then just disappeared, which is fine because I know she just got out of an abusive relationship and is struggling emotionally.

That was the first time I've had sex in years, and first time I've had sex after transition. So I think I'm experiencing an irrational amount of feelings for her. Maybe the bonding and obsession society has told me females experience after losing their virginity.

I'm just losing it, I'm too distracted to do anything else, and even though I know she's got shit going on and I'm not the reason she's not communicating with me, I'm irrationally hurt and freaking out because of this. I can't work, or do anything without thinking about her and the way she made me feel.

What the fuck is wrong with me? There is this huge powerful force inside my brain that is totally obsessed with this girl and I'd give anything to have her holding me right now.

Seriously WTF? I'm such an idiot for losing my girl virginity to someone right after meeting them and not knowing them, I know that, but it just felt right at the time.

I wish I could turn off all this emotion right now, what do I do?"
MechaMaya,asktransgender,Advice on Medical Providers?,"As I get closer to seeking professional help to start my transition, I've been collecting lists of doctors and other providers that are nearby.  One thing that seems clear to me is that I need to find a new GP. I've found a few that came recommended for being very helpful with HRT and are LGBT friendly, but my insurance plan covers none of them.  **Is this something I should be worried about, or should I just go with the best GP that will suit my needs, regardless of insurance?**

I'm hoping that with the right GP, he can refer me to proper therapists, urologists, endos, and whatever else I may need. Since I'm not quite sure how that works if my insurance does not include him, can he still give me referrals to someone covered by my insurance? I know that my insurance should partially cover some of this even out of network, but I don't want to be screwing myself over just because I'm picky about what doctors I want.

--------------

Oh, and for anyone looking for specifics, I've heard good things about Dr. Stoermer in the Las Vegas area being a good GP for starting HRT, and haven't really been able to find others that have come recommended. The only problem is my insurance does not include him.

My current GP, which my family has been going to for years, I have had bad experiences with. He misdiagnosed me on multiple occasions and didn't seem to care that he prescribed me for things outside his expertise. This is why I'm so adamant about finding a new one."
The_Running_Sloth,asktransgender,Feeling really shitty the past 24 hours over Twitch stuff. Anything I can do?,"So, I'm in a fairly large Twitch chat, with like 500 people watching, 60K followers in the group and we're playing an interactive game, which sounds fun/innocent enough.

I've banned this streamer from my web forum some time ago because of something silly like four/five years ago and was willing to let bygones be bygones, to the point where I view this streamer in a positive light. Well, obviously, given this topic, no longer the case. First, it begins with revisionist history as to why he was banned, which is irrelevant. 

The real crux of it was ranting on about using the term he/she about me, plus spreading around a rumor that I had my sex changed four times (""Who does that!?"") as to defame and sully my character, making me look insane, without logic, and certainly less of a person. Normally I wouldn't mind this, but I do mind it with that big of an audience and the way it undermines my intelligence, one of the few things I remotely tolerate about myself.

Of course, it was done all while assuming I wasn't there (I was, FYI), but if you want to watch, it's from roughly 1h25m in, to 1h27m45s in at this clip: https://www.twitch.tv/gamej06/v/86786010

Reported it to Twitch last night for hate speech. Nada, just back at his stuff again the next day, today.

So I asked my endo about cycling, and she said there's no evidence for it, she can't explain my mental states, etc.  The first time I read her response I thought she was basically calling me crazy.

WhereTheCrutons,asktransgender,"When did you really ""know""?","I feel like this has been asked a million times so sorry in advance but I just feel like everything has hit me all at once, but then again not. This week was the week last year that i explicitly remember saying to myself ""man i wish i could be a girl for halloween coming up"" and ever since then I have, at some point everyday at least once a day since then, thought 'i really wish i was a girl' but then remembered how permanent that would be and how I wouldn't enjoy it. 

When I sit down and weigh out the pros and cons I really come up with 'why would I throw away this for the illusion of what is better, but could very possibly be so much worse? and go on with my day. I don't hate myself. I don't wake up feeling like I'm in the wrong body. I'm just me. And more or less, I'm ok with that. But reading a bunch of subs and other forums, I know something that bugs me as much as this (even if it may just a curiosity) can't possibly be what every cis person does, which is why I can't help but think I might be trans. I'm just worried that I've tied experiencing a night looking and feeling like a girl, into a LIFETIME of doing that. A night or a week would be bliss. But I don't love the idea of a lifetime anywhere near as much. 

I also know the ""be strong and do whatever makes you most happy because that's what you'll end up doing in the end when you're most happy anyways eventually"" speech and while that's wonderful, coming out and feeling abandoned and alienated by my family and few friends is a very real possibility that I don't feel like I could handle. I often ask myself would I be happier and more comfortable with the commodities and privileges that staying my current gender offer? Or trying out what could be an utter failure and throwing away everything I've spent the 19 years of my life earning towards just because I was 'curious' and tried too hard. This week has just really hit me hard and I feel like I'm at a fork in the road in my life and don't feel like I qualify enough to take either path that's up ahead. 

All I know is I'm tired of being in this 'okayish but not grand' state of my life that everyone assumes because it's not awful, it must always be great. The way I describe it in my head is from 0-10, I'm at a constant 6. And I feel guilty for complaining to anyone about a 6 because I know many people have it so much worse. But I don't want to make a terrible decision and go from a 6 to a 1 and end up in a state where I feel regret forever. But I know it's not a 10 and that hope that it could be if I transitioned sticks in the back of my mind and I know it will never go away unless I do something about it.

I apologize for the length and any advise or personal experiences would be very appreciated! Thanks!"

SomeKindOfAGhost,asktransgender,"New Reddit account, to celebrate a new beginning, and so many questions!","So I never thought this day would come, but tomorrow is my first endocrinologist appointment so I can officially start HRT!  I'm so, so excited to finally get started.  Things feel a bit surreal at the moment, like I still can't believe this is happening. 

So, let's start with the questions:

I came out to my dad last night (I wanted to tell both my parents at the same time, but my dad was out of town and I figured he be the harder sell) which went about as expected (""I love you, but Jesus""). I also told my son, who is 9.   He got EXTREMELY upset, threatening to run away several times, screaming, crying, etc. Then he started saying that he wanted to be a girl as well, which I don't want to discount, but I also sort of suspect its just a coping mechanism.  My wife is at a family support group with him right now, and he did seems much better this morning, but I'm curious if anyone has had a similar situation that might be able to provide some insight. If your young kids had a negative reaction, how did you handle it? How are they doing now? 

Switching gears, my hair is thinning somewhat on top, and my hairline is receding as well. It's not awful at the moment, but I've been told by trans friends that Finasteride can work wonders in cases like mine, so I plan on asking about it tomorrow at my appointment.  My concern is that I'm already 30, and I'm not sure how effective it will be at restoring any hair loss.  Does anyone have any experience and or knowledge about how effective it might be for me?

Switching gears again, I'm wondering how to handle coming out at my job.  My company is rated a perfect 100 by the HRC, so I don't expect much negativity/harassment if any, just awkwardness.  That said, I'm not sure what the best time to tell my HR department.  Should I tell them now, or maybe it would be better to wait for a couple months when it's closer to time for me to go full-time?  

Lastly, I just want to say a gigantic ""THANK YOU!"" I've gotten a lot of inspiration from seeing the stories and responses posted on this subreddit.  More than once have I found some hope in the middle of a deep depression from seeing someone post.  Knowing that I'm not alone in my struggle is such a gigantic help. 

Thank you /r/asktransgender!

OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,I've gotta do a more-serious coming out to my Dad this time. Any tips or advice?,"So, when I came out, while I did say ""I'm transgender"" and I'm not comfortable with my body, I didn't do a good job explaining how serious I felt.

While he's open and accepting of any decision I make, he thinks that I'm a confused Teenager. I kinda went along with that, because I did need to get on the road to getting someone to talk to and I was already super scared so I didn't have the guts to say EXACTLY how I felt.

But, i've got a Doctors appointment coming up in which I'm gonna get a recommendation for a therapist. And while talking to someone is important, I also dont need someone to tell me what I already know, IM TRANS. So I want to get things started and look into the medical aspects of transition.

My dad has no idea that it's that serious and a ""Bruce Jenner"" kind of thing. But, I need to get started. So before the appointment I need to talk with him again and do a better job of explaining how real and important this is to me.

wtfwhyamihard,asktransgender,I just found out my gf is trans. help please.,"I'm copying and pasting the op from r/sex off of a suggestion from another user. They thought you would be able to help me out.

""She told me about a week ago after about 2 months of dating. I really, really like her and I don't mind that she's trans, my dick was already dressed for the game and ready to go in the game.

This is the problem:

There we were, in the still moonlight and all roads were leading to pound city and she stops me...she sets herself across the room and tells me how she's trans her original name etc.

This sort of shocked me. Not because I was angry, just because boner plus information overload caught me off guard. Now, I did need a bit of time to process it. Was I gay? Bi? Some other thing I've never heard of? I needed a minute ti breathe and she understood. 

So here I am, desperately wanting to see her again because I miss her and I still want to have sex. 

But this is the big problem: after a week of soul searching I'm straight. Watched like 3 hours of gay porn and found myself shopping for motorcycles with 0 boner. I don't like men and I don't like penises. The latter is the thing I need help with. I see her as a woman, but I want nothing to do with her penis. I don't want to touch it, and I don't want her to cum on me.

(Does that make me a shit person?)

I just am repulsed by penises. I don't know how she will feel about that and I don't want to hurt her....but I still REALLY want to have sex with her.

Wtf is wrong with me? 

I'm also kind of sad about the prospect of missing out on vaginas. I love them. I also looked into SRS results and, since I can be honest here, that just didn't do it for me. Maybe I'm thinking about this too much. Please advise. 

(We're both 20 yrs old, if that matters. I've been a lurker for a while and people always ask how old the OP is.)""

Childhood was filled with neglect, crazy parents, and transition has left me homeless for 6 months trying to find an apartment without luck, even with a steady job at Starbucks. I'm no longer depressed because yay counseling. I have a budget of around 500 a month and will be coming up to Seattle in a couple weeks to work, eventually go to school, and start fresh. Is there anywhere I can crash or any of you know someone who needs a roommate? I really need this.

chaucer345,asktransgender,[NSFW] I'm really screwed up about my genital status and it's leading me to question my decision to transition in the first place.,"Hey all...

I'm so lost right now. I feel like sometimes I'm just fine with what I have between my legs and am worried about losing the ability to penetrate, but am super freaked out and frustrated by my inability to be penetrated (anal super doesn't count, it sucks).

I feel like there are only a couple of times I've enjoyed penetrating others  and really like it  (though am frustrated that they can't get in) when people touch my perineum, but I still feel lost.

It feels like I'm making excuses and trying to push myself to be more feminine than I am just so I can feel stable. I feel trapped in the middle. Like there's no form of genitalia or hormones that will ever make me happy...

I don't want to be non binary, I feel more... hope, when I think about myself as female, but I'm super scared and confused and I don't have any idea what I'm doing any more.

So... Any thoughts to help a poor probably trans girl out?"

Blairnatalie,asktransgender,update to my question a few weeks back about good ol mom.,"Hey so a few weeks back I posted a huge question in how I should deal with my mom. Well she's put Me in a really hard spot now, and I seek advice yet again. 

I feel this is important and you'll see why later, my dad has no clue I'm trans, tends to have a coservative way of thinking. Not to insane tho. My mom has been very nasty and knows full well that I'm trans. She does not support me what so ever, and since my last post I've cut all ties.

So yesterday I received a message from her  saying  ""if you don't come out to your father, then I'm going to tell him by weeks end"" and went on to insult me too. I simply told her if she has nothing nice to say then to leave me alone, she got offended and started going off again. So I blocked her on every social platform, I don't live with my mom so it's easy to cut her out of my life.  I didn't even say good bye  or nothing, just blocked. I have no time for her negativity. 

However she did tell my dad that I have somthing I wanted to tell him, also went on to tell him that his lesbian sister also knows, you should ask her too! So now My dad probably thinks I have some kind of crazy disease, I told him to ignore my mom , and that my mother and I have no relationship. So long story short, my dad knows somthing is up, he's not stupid  and can probably piece together that I'm not a straight Cis white boy (like the farthest from lol... ) I just have no clue how to proceed, my aunt has been fantastic and has offered to be a part of the conversation... but I just don't know how to approach him about it. 

My relationship with both my parents are shakey at best.. and while my mother has proven that she's very ignorant, I still would like to have a relationship with my dad. (They ain't together either). 

I know this isn't the whole story, tried to make it as short as possible, but how would you proceed with talking to the dad about my transness.

Last we spoke (yesterday) he mentioned when I get a free day from work that we should see each other. I've yet to reply to that I've no clue what to say."

[In the morning](https://clyp.it/hyaddof4) and [in the evening](https://clyp.it/pip1iwyy).

I'm not sure if it's dysphoria talking or what, but both of them sound absolutely terrible to me, like the kind of voice a guy would use for a bad fake female voice. I've gotten positive feedback for both but I'm not sure if that was just people being supportive or honest feedback on my progress (assuming the former given the small sample size and audience).

I'm personally not satisfied with the voice I'm using in those clips, so I'm wondering, is there anything I can improve? If there is something to fix, please be as scathing and detailed as possible about which quality/ies is/are wrong.

darksector41,asktransgender,Questioning- in need of some guidance,"Hi everyone :)

To give you all some perspective until probably a year or two ago I very much identified as a gay cis male (20yo). But lately I've been having lots of thoughts and I just need a place where I can chat with some understanding people.

I reckon to a point through my teens I always used to go through ebbs and sways in terms of feeling like I'd be better off in a woman's body. The idea's always appealed to me quite a bit, but I always repressed it for fear of being rejected by my religious parents and bullied at my christian school (parents are totally fine with me being gay- just thought I'd point that out here). 

Fast forward to about a year or two ago and I started having these ebbs and sways again. I felt like I was going through phases of really identifying more as a woman than a man. Currently I feel like I'm in an extended phase so to speak of this- for a couple months now I've been thinking about this constantly. Every day I go through this sub as well as transtimelines- and tbh I get envious at some of you ladies. I wish I was as beautiful as a lot of the girls on transtimelines especially.

I think now's the time for me to start really asking questions and getting help. I'm just constantly stressing about my job future especially- I want to study vet science but currently my weighted average mark isn't at the distinction average I need it to be. I'm just... scared at being a disappointment I guess. Probs not totally relevant, but needed to vent that last point.

Sorry for the long post- hopefully I can chat to a few of you in the comments :) just don't wanna go through this alone"

It wont be until mid October as I am in the middle of a work audit and then traveling for a week at the beginning of October.

I was hoping to locate a female doctor for this as I feel that I would probably feel more comfortable even with her examining what's left of my bits from shrinkage but unfortunately I had to chose who would take my insurance $100 a pop to go get a blood test is not worth seeing a female instead.  My Therapist is also a female.

I had to call out of work (cashier at McDonald's) because I've just been feeling sick and I don't think I could do a whole shift feeling like this. When I woke up 2 hours ago though, I thought I was going to be there. I didn't know I would feel this shitty.

So about half an hour ago I called my boss to let her know. She was a little pissed off (understandably) that I called to break the news only half an hour before my shift, but I honestly thought I could make it before then.

I don't know what *it* is that caused me to call out, if it's work that's making me feel such resistance at the idea of going in for a shift and it actually is that bad, or if it's me just creating my own problems and feeling sorry for myself. Maybe it's a combination of both. I just had two days off, I should be feeling refreshed. But I don't. I feel drained, used up. I don't want to work at McDonald's anymore. 


I feel like such a useless fucking idiot that if a job like McDonald's is making me feel this way, how am I ever gonna hold down a ""real"" job? I just wanted to make some extra cash and be able to help my parents out with expenses but I feel like all the trouble I'm going through working at McDonald's isn't worth it. Maybe I'm just not cut out for the fast food business. Maybe I'm not cut out for a job at all. I don't know. I wish I did. I don't know what to do with all this free time either, now that I'm off today. It's the same problem I had with school, I just keep thinking about it over and over...


So yeah. Does anyone have any advice on what to do about feeling terrible? I feel like I made the wrong decision, but I don't know if there even was a *right* decision for me to make. I'm so confused and honestly scared because I don't know what to do. Usually what's in my best interest seems pretty apparent, but this time it just seems like I have two options and either of them could go either good or bad. "
throwaway90909090999,asktransgender,Can gender dysphoria manifest itself as jealousy in a relationship?,"Before my question, an aside: /r/Asktransgender was a tremendous help to a friend of mine when she went through questioning and then transitioning, so lots of love for what this subreddit is for people who need help.  

I'm a cisgender man. Several years ago I was in a long-term relationship and lived with someone who at the time presented as a woman, and is now openly living as a transgender man. During our relationship, he had some problems with depression. As an effort to work through some issues and find himself, he went on a backpacking trip. On the trip he met someone else, cheated on me, and ended our relationship via messenger. We haven't seen each other since and have only exchanged a few emails.  

A year after cheating on me, he started questioning his gender, and a bit later came out. He's since written me a post-mortem of our relationship, blaming what happened on his gender dysphoria. Specifically: He didn't love me, he wanted to be me. He wasn't attracted to me, he was interested in the stereotypical male things I wore, like suits, ties, and a beard. I'm not bothered by him coming out; I would have been supportive had we still been together. Instead, I'm bothered by the cheating and what seems to have been a significant rewriting of the relationship such that what I thought was mutual love was not.  

My question to the community is, is this a common experience, discovering that you aren't in love with your partner, just jealous of them (i.e., wanting to be them/wanting what they have)? I ask because I want to see if I can eventually forgive this person for what he did in our relationship."
Live51,asktransgender,Look on their face during Sex?,"Well early this morning my wife and I had sex for the first time in months after coming out as transgender to her (only 2 other times this year), first of all I was surprised that I could  get it up.  As she was rubbing her hands over me as I was doing what I really did not want to (looking down and seeing my undersized breasts is what kept me going); I could see the look of disgust on her face feeling my shaved body and it totally lost it for me.  I asked her about it and at first she denied and when pressured admitted to it.  I made it very clear that I was not changing and this was NOT a choice but an internal issue that has grown larger than the box that it was stuffed into all these years that she fantasized that my cross dressing was a fetish and not something more.
To make it worse her “Uncle” who came out Gay over 5 years ago and in the last 2 started to transition is all she can see when thinking about me.  She (her aunt) is retired and in her 70’s when it happened.  Unfortunately my wife has that religious attitude of (we have all heard it) “God doesn’t make mistakes”.  She refuses to accept that it is an internal need and not a want/desire.
No don’t say you have to leave her that is the worst suggestion anyone can make as no one really knows each other’s situations.  So how do I keep myself healthy, mental and otherwise through this process?

Geekydrummer,asktransgender,Somedays i hate it.,Hey.  So i feel im not the only one here but im pre hrt atm and i just look down and just get so depressed about having the wrong body.  I just wish i could die and be reborn correctly. I guess i have to keep pushing on until i start hrt.  Has anyone else felt this way?
EnbyKitten,asktransgender,I'm not sure how I should be feeling about my mother right now and need advice.,"Context; I've been transitioning for about 8 months. I occasionally use my name, but do use the dead name to just not rock the boat where I'm not quite ready to do so.

So, I've not been particularly secretive about my transition. I wear femme-y stuff sometimes. I have dresses and otherwise feminine coded clothes in my closet which I'm more than sure my mother has seen. I'm fairly sure she's examined my HRT script receipts (not that they were hidden, in her defense).

But she hasn't said anything to my directly yet. Okay, that's fine, I'm okay with letting it be the elephant in the room for the time I'm living with her.

But here's where stuff gets kind of iffy. Me and my partner are both trans. She totally knows about my partner also being transfeminine because I've explictly told her, which she was like ""oh, uh, okay."". Up until recently, I was unsure about where she was with decerning if I was transitioning or not, and while I was using her computer to print some stuff, I snooped through some messages of hers. Moral implications of that aside, she was basically gossiping about me transitioning to her friend. Her friend was asking if I started gaining weight yet (I lost hella weight a few years ago) and she made a comment about me having boobs now and how I was on HRT. In addition, she expressed sentiments hoping the effects were reversible in case I wasn't sure, and said that she can't believe that someone my age would be allowed to make 'such a decision'.  In a future message, she made a joke about hoping I wouldn't use any potential school money I might get from relatives on a sex change. In addition, she was picking me up from work one morning, and before we left, she was chatting with a regular who goes there, talking about a story about a table of ""tr***es"". And I was standing right in front of her when she said this. Even assuming she doesn't know about be, she knows about my partner.

So like. I dunno. She hasn't kicked me out or even directly talked to me about this. I didn't want to talk about me being trans to her because she has a history of being emotionally abusive and just generally unworthy of showing emotional vulnerability. But she knows anyway, which is something that I don't feel one way or another about. But the fact she'd rather gossip about it than address this to me. The fact she seems so disrespectful about transfolk in general is just really discerning and I don't really know what to do about it. Any input is appreciated."
nafssertam,asktransgender,"Does anyone ever ask, why me?","I've been posting on this subreddit recently and I've come to realise that I'm likely transsexual. When I initially thought about this I felt really excited, like all my problems could be solved instantly. However now the gravity of the situation has hit me. 

The way I see it I have two choices. I can either stay closeted, never transition and never be happy with my body. Or I can come out and transition, creating a massive upheavel in mine and my loved ones lives. 

When I look at my two options all I can think is, why me? Why do I have such a burden to carry? 

Are there any upsides that I'm missing or is being trans just a difficult part of being me?"
hang_in_there_kitty,asktransgender,"Am I actually trans, and is it worth transitioning?","Hi [r/asktransgender](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/), I lurk this sub occasionally but a recent post I read on this sub ([this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/54j3ws/am_i_trans_or_is_this_a_phase/)) sparked my own questions.

I'm currently a 24 year old male, and have grown up as male. However, since I was about 14 I've know I wasn't a ""normal"" male, when I started to become interested in women's clothes and began dressing up in my mother's clothes when I was left alone in the house. It didn't progress much more than that until I was about 17 and started becoming interested in guys (I accepted that I was bisexual slightly over 2 years ago and have slowly started coming out). 

This attraction to guys was brought about through discovering crossdressing/sissy/transgender porn (which I still watch regularly). Throughout the years this has progressed to buying women's clothes and makeup, hooking up with guys as a ""female"", fantasizing about being the girl in regular boy-girl porn, and become sexually envious of women. I have often thought about whether or not I am actually trans, but I usually just put these thoughts and feelings down as a fetish.

However, in the past 2 years or so, I've become envious and jealous of women in general (not just sexually). I don't know how to explain it but I just feel like I'd be happier being a woman, and when I see an attractive woman I have stopped thinking ""I'd like to be with her"" and instead ""I'd like to be her"". These intensity of these feelings fluctuates, however they are always there.

Because of these feelings, I have begun to question whether I am in fact trans and if I should start transitioning. The more I think about it, the more I think it is not normal for a cis-male to have these thoughts and feelings, and do feel that I am trans. However, I'm not unhappy being a male, and I don't typically have gender, and I'm a typical guy who likes sports and video games, uses vulgar language, and takes the piss out of his (male) friends. However most of my friends though are female, and I generally get along better with females.

From the comments in the post I linked above (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/54j3ws/am_i_trans_or_is_this_a_phase/)) I seem pretty certain that I am (by definition, at least) trans, although not 100% sure. The issue that obviously follows is regarding transitioning, and whether I should transition. Being 23 years old, I see myself past the point where I can transition ""easily"" (I'm not saying any transition is easy) and doubt whether I can actually get to a point where I am a passable female. I am morbidly obese at 130 kg/286 lbs, 169cm / 5'7 (I was always big, but depression, in part because of these feelings I have, is a factor), quite hairy, and I have a receding hairline, and although the physical appearance is only one aspect of being a female, I have actually persuaded myself against seeing a psychiatrist in the past because ""screw it, I'll never be able to become a passable female anyway"". Because I'm not necessarily unhappy being a male, I'm afraid of transitioning in case I'm unable to get to a point where I am passable and I won't be able to pass for a long time.

Any comments, advice, or suggestions as to what I should do would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR I'm male who is not unhappy being male but would prefer to be a woman. I've put off the idea of transitioning because I'm afraid of transitioning."
Apollyphelion,asktransgender,"American MtF in Germany, hormone question","Hi everyone,
this is Allison, I read this community's posts
religiously and I love the advice here
and so that being I'd like to ask for some advice!

I love Germany, and even though they are behind
on trans issues compared to USA, I don't want to leave.
I am also fearing what might be:

A: A long wait to see a therapist that can give you the hormone letter
B: A Mandatory 1 year wait due to either the therapist 
following Father State's rules to a T, or not being able to convince him I'm trans (which I doubt)

I'm 32 and I feel each month that goes by
will be a bigger blow to my final form so to speak.

So, I am pretty certain prescriptions for meds carry over
to Germany, so would it be perhaps better to go back to the states and find a therapist that could do it in 3 months
(or less)

In fact, I usually feel no desire to post here or comment
as my questions are usually answered and I find it hard to
find something original outside of my own experiences. I am suffering with crippling dysphoria atm, so I am also kind of writing this as a release.

Anyway, thank you for ya'lls time!"
BegorrahAnuddaFamine,asktransgender,Question about befriending a trans person.,"So, genuine question from a cis person who befriends a trans person. The trans person in question has had a pretty hard social life of isolation and rejection.

Now, I came along and I befriended them, and I do cherish them as a friend. A lot actually. They are extremely dear to me. And they have said that I'm also kind of important to them. However, I seem to be one of the first people they've met that genuinely does not care about them being trans. 

As said, their friends turned, pretty much all of them. And I seem to be the first one that didn't after finding out.

So, there's a sinking feeling in my chest that we might only be friends because I don't care that they are trans. As in, they are only friends with me, or consider me important because of my disregard of them being trans. This scares me because I fear that once they find other people we might alienate and distance ourselves.

That said, does anyone have thoughts? Am I being paranoid? Should I not regard this feeling at all and just go about our relationship normally? Has anyone (trans or not,) ever been friends with somebody just because they were ""safe"" with someone? Am I over thinking this? Is my feeling right and do you have advice?"

Lilstephanie,asktransgender,Getting Outed as Trans At Work,"My business partner knows I am trans.  Today he told me a girl who works at the same place asked him if I was ""having a sex change"".  Only he and a cis girl know I am trans at work.  So obviously the cis girl told this other girl.  I think.  I told her I was trans during my Leukemia scare at the beginning of the year.  She was supportive and gave me a hug.  She's friends(my partner indicated more than just friends) with the girl who asked my partner if I was having a sex change.  I am just starting transition(4 months blockers 3 months of estrogen) and I am not sure I want everyone to know.  But part of me doesn't give a shit and if rumors fly maybe it's no big deal?  I'll be out and can look more feminine and stuff like that and everyone will know what's up.  Or, I could go to this girl and ask her to keep it to herself.  I am not sure I ever told the first girl that I didn't want it kept a secret.  So I am not sure if I should be pissed off at her.  Maybe my feminine appearance prompted her to ask my partner?  I'm not sure I can lay blame on the first girl for sure.  What do you think I should do?

Edit:  I should mention I don't work in an office environment(thank God lol).  I work as a driver.  My van is my office.  So I interact with my customers and not a regular group of the same people.  But I'm friends with many of the other drivers.  And I do visit our main office every Monday to turn in the previous weeks paper work and enter it in our computer.  I'm there like 15 minutes.  I'll just have to tell the manager.  She's LGBT friendly because she had a remember Orlando type thing on her Facebook.  Thanks for everyone's input.  I appreciate it!

I don't know if my old doctor will know this even exists, never mind knowing anything about differences, so...

Is there much difference between EV and EC? Is cypionate better, worse, weird side effects, better or worse feminization, anything?

What's the equivalent dose to 20mg estradiol valerate? I read somebody saying that 1ml of 5mg/ml estradiol cypionate is equivalent to 40mg/ml estradiol valerate, but that seems kinda....idk.

Is cypionate much more expensive than valerate? I don't have insurance, so...kinda worried.

Is cypionate affected by the shortage too, or pretty easy to get from a pharmacy?

Kindlemoose,asktransgender,Anyone else think finding out transition is possible was the worst thing they could have done?,"I do. I wasn't happy. I was wasting my life away. I was constantly trying to put this feeling back in its box and believe in a future.

But I didn't have the what if.

Realising that my dream could have come true if I'd realised it sooner is unbearable (albeit it would've had to have been about 10 because I went through puberty early and had the big bones I've got now by 14) Realising I could have had a chance of a life living there in the world instead of battling with these demons in my head taking up all of my energy is unbearable. Realising that there's plenty people out there who felt this way too and were able to fix it, because they don't have bodies like mine, is unbearable.

2. Any no no words? I haven't said many, without profusely appolozing afterwards. 

3. When's the right time to go bra/underwear shopping?

4. How do we come out to my parents? They have no idea I'm bi, and we've been together for 3 years.

LesbihonestSeiko,asktransgender,Will she leave?,"This might be more of a question to ask in /r/polyamory, but I am going ask it there AND here because my partner is trans and I want to know if that will change her reaction to this in any way.

Basically, I want to know that if I ask my poly partner (mtf trans woman) to just be in a relationship with me, does it raise the risk of her leaving me? I am not trying to control her or force her to do anything she doesn't want to, but I am just not comfortable with her dating other people. I am too insecure and would most likely be curled up and bawling my eyes out every time she went out with other people (already did, it wasnt pleasant). 

Again, asking here because I am curious if being trans will effect my gfs perspective on this, because she might see it as me forcing her into something she doesnt want and that might be worse because she's been forced to do things she doesnt want to all her life (I.e. forced to be a guy).

myaltaccount86,asktransgender,Question of curiosity regarding handedness.,"I'm just curious of the handedness of transgender people. I guess these questions just pop up in your head when your not right handed.

So, are people here right handed, left handed, mixed handed (aka cross dominant), or ambidextrous?

Just to clarify, because many people don't know the difference between mixed handed and ambidextrous, mixed handed is when you do somethings left handed and somethings right handed, but you generally have one hand that is more dominant than the other, and ambidextrous is when you do things equally proficient with both hands.

I myself am mixed handed with a left hand dominance. 

edit: results from the comments as of about 8 hours after posting: 4 left handers, 3 right handers, 8 mixed handers (5 left hand dominant and 3 right hand dominant), and 1 ambidextrous.

Just looking at dominance it's 9 left, 6 right, and 1 ambidextrous.

World population is generally 88-92% right handed 9-11% left handed and 1% mixed handed (all I could find for ambidextrous is ""extremely rare"") out of the people who decided to answer here 25% were left handed, 18.75% right handed, 50% mixed handed, and 6.25% ambidextrous. Minuscule study group, but interesting results. "

ILikeSchecters,asktransgender,How the hell am I supposed to deal with waiting and worrying,"I hate bringing negativity to this sub, but Im losing my mind. I set up an appointment with a doctor that can prescribe hormones back in early August for October 14th. I was making great progress with how I viewed myself and doing little things to lessen dysphoria; however, now I've completely hit a wall. I've started doing all the little things that are possible to hide: Ive told most of who I need to in the short term, got gud with makeup, have a very passable girl voice, and have at least a small wardrobe. Now I just am sitting and waiting for October. Even then, I imagine Im going to need to get blood work done before Im prescribed, so there goes another long while. Then, I have to wait and work to get results from hormones so my deltoids dont look like the size of a 16 wheeler semi. This waiting also goes hand in hand with worrying about hormones and transition not going well. I dont want to deal with discrimination or feigned positivity rooted in pity. 

The straw that broke the camels back was going to my univerities foot ball game last thursday. Seeing all so many girls in a concentrated area just sent me through the roof with envy. Ive already snapped in front of my brothers three times in the past two days for what seem like unrelated incidents to them (they know and support of me being trans 110%, but I have never told them the depths to which dysphoria can make feel). I dont want to be this bitter. I want to go back to how good I was feeling the first time I shaved my legs, and getting the excitement I got when I had a few people call me by the correct stuff. Back when those things were new. How the fuck do I keep my sanity? I imagine many of you here had to wait for things to start rolling much longer than me. "

I raises a question to me and suggests to me that I dont understand this as well as I thought.

The question: How does a masculine lesbian fit into the gender spectrum? 

To me, lesbian implies someone who is biologically female, identifies as female, and is sexually attracted to biological females. If a person were bio female, identified as male, and was attracted to bio females, he would be a straight trans man, no? So the term ""masculine lesbian"" seems confusing to me."

Anyway something really, really strange grabbed my attention about my eyes and I couldn't believe what I was seeing so that I had to grab a flashlight and light them up for a better look. I've always had solid brown eyes my entire life as long as I can remember. My irises are now mostly greenish hazel, with only a ragged inner ring (about 1/3 the inner area) of brown around the pupil. This has happened in the last two weeks.

Should I be worried about this? Is something bad happening to my eyes? Should I see an eye doctor about this? 

If this is normal and expected, and nothing to be worried about, then **Holy Sheepshit** this could be more awesome that growing boobs!

So, I'm currently reading Nevada, and there's a curious line about the protagonist's SO getting organic wine because of ""wine and estradiol.""

So, I already perused our search history without much luck, but before I start reading up on some pubmed articles, (read:  nerd.) I figured I'd see if anyone here has gotten any feedback from medical providers or if they know anything anecdotally about this (the only reason to even potentially care would be because of the theoretical with thromboembolic events and increased risk of estrogen sensitive cancers).

However, we got to the store and it was the place I got my hair cut as a young child. My mom used to take my brother and I there as young kids before going for ice cream (it was a bribe - I used to hate getting my hair cut as a kid as it was always super short). I thought maybe just maybe they do feminine styles. They don't. I took my mom aside and told her flat out that I didn't want my hair cut at this place - that I wanted a feminine cut.

""Honey, but this is what we used to do - you used to love going with me to get your hair cut...Please just get it cut like we used to...you love me don't you...""

Jake1055,asktransgender,Question About Labels for Sexual Orientation,"Hi!  I'm a cisgendered male.  When talking about cisgendered people, it's fairly simple to discuss issues of sexual orientation: what homosexuality is, what heterosexuality is, and the like.

However, when discussing transgender or even trans-sex people, I feel the definitions get murky.

My question is this: does homosexuality mean attraction to the same **sex** or the same **gender**?

For example: I have a friend that is a trans-woman, meaning that she(the person in question isn't too picky about pronouns, but I'm using it out of respect) was born a male, but later came to identify as a woman.  She is attracted primarily to men.

Now, would my friend be heterosexual, homosexual, or is there really no useful meaning to these terms in these situations?  Is there a better scheme for describing sexual orientation?  Because it is **sexual** orientation, I would imagine it is defined as what sex a person is attracted to.  However, I know attraction isn't such a simple thing.  Cultural aspects of gender can also play into attraction.

It's not terribly important, but it has been a question I've had for a long time.  If my trans friend were exclusively attracted to people of the male sex and female gender, what would her sexual orientation be?

Perhaps these words just aren't useful in these cases.  I would just like to get some of your feedback.

Thanks :)"

If the paper turns blue its alkaline, if red its acid. Except in edge cases, theres no ambiguity, the paper is either red or blue. 

As experienced transgender people ourselves, why are we not working on designing a litmus paper test for the popular ""am I transgender"" question? It could be in the form of a questionnaire with a lot of very carefully designed questions. And it would have a 99% accuracy on detecting true dysphoria. If we could devise such a test, it would benefit millions of transgender people after us. Those in doubt would have their feelings quickly confirmed and can start transitioning sooner, and those that are actually just in a phase would realise that and grow out of it faster. I believe the transgender community should work together to devise a transgender test. "

She was kind of depressed the other day about having to write that she was a trans woman directly into any potential self-intro, ""like it was an anomaly worth mentioning"" in her own words. She's very worried to hit it off with a guy who would turned her down later once the subject would come up. 

I was wondering if anyone has used a dating site/app they could recommend that is trans-friendly. She'd like to find matches that would not only ""be ok"" with who she is but who would ""want"" her as she is. Are the most popular sites like OKcupid the best ?

I'm a very cynical and mistrusting person (and overly protective :/ ) and I can't help thinking that if there's such a website, there must be many perverts on there just looking for ""easy, too-trusting"" preys with low-self-esteem which is too often the case with transitioning people in this stupid society of ours.

And it gets worse when I think about how I might ""fill out"" or that these things are probably only going to increase in this direction I don't like from here on out.

It's definitely a feeling of ""that's wrong"", but I can't help but feel a little like it's not quite that serious or something, or I'm just making it up in my head. I'd like for my voice to be higher, too, though I don't mind that as much. But I don't want to become the opposite sex by any means.

Not only that, but I've seen a few mentions of complaints having gone in to the NHS about his work and about needing referrals to Mr Fenton in Wakefield for revisions. As much as I want SRS like yesterday I'm not massively enthused about having it done by someone without having much of an idea of what his results are like, with having not been at all impressed with what I *have* seen, and with having heard some pretty negative things about him.

Shockingpink13,asktransgender,I'm Worried this is a Fetish,"Sometimes, when I think about myself in the future as a woman, I get an errection.  I am comol asexual and this is honestly the only time I feel anything close to what can be called a sexual urge.  I hate it.  I wish it would go away because I like the idea of living in the future as a woman.  Honestly, I dreaded living a female life at first, but I think that was just because it was something that I was so unused to thinking about and out of my comfort zone that I obviously dreaded it.  I've embraced the idea now, but I just read a reddit post from a couple of years ago where someone used nearly everything I have said and told him that he merely had a fetish, and someone else told hI'm that he had intrusive thoughts.

No!  No!  No!  I don't want to just ""have a fetish"" or ""have intrusive thoughts"" I want to be a girl!  My therapist considers me trans, my friends (who I am buying girly clothes with in two days) think of me as trans and I love it.  I would have hated this after first coming out to myself, but like I said, as time passed I would love and except and cherish the idea.  But the fact that this gives me an errection bothers me.

aquestioningperson,asktransgender,Does testosterone make you irritable/angry?,"Hi. I'm mtf pre everything. 

I find myself easily frustrated, by pretty stupid things. If I reach a bump in the road I'll suddenly get angry, exasperated, impatient. If someone says something about me in a negative light I'll get defensive instead of thinking and feeling it through....

Is this because I'm an asshole or could this be testosterone controlling me? (Not mutually exclusive I guess)

Fayedrus,asktransgender,Worsening dysphoria during sex (NSFW),"25 MtF 6 weeks 50mg Spiro / 4mg Estradiol

So I've never had too much dysphoria over my penis. I mean, I don't like it, I'd much rather have a vulva, but when I have dysphoria over it during sex I can usually close my eyes, imagine something else, and power through.

But yesterday my bf and I started fooling around, and he asked if I wanted him to suck my dick. I don't usually have a problem with that word, since that's the equipment I have, and calling it a clit or pussy can just make me feel worse for not having those parts. I did feel some discomfort this time, but I wanted to have sex so I said yes.

As he started working his way down I got more and more anxious and uncomfortable over the thought of him sucking my dick. I imagined having a vulva and him fucking me instead and felt better; but when he started pulling my panties down I just got a wave of dysphoria and jerked away.

He was really great and supportive and didn't pressure me at all. We cuddled for a while, then a couple hours later (after a shower and some weed) we tried again, borrowing our roommate's Hitachi wand to make things more affirming, and it was good. But I'm still worried.

Has anyone else experienced increased genital/sexual dysphoria as they progress on HRT / trans things in general? I thought that I could be non-op, but if these feelings keep getting stronger I might not have a real choice."

GabiCap,asktransgender,Seeing a counselor on Monday...,"Happy Saturday everyone! Hope you're all doing well.

Well... a little bit about me: I'm not sure what to consider myself (I'm AMAB).  For a really long time I've always been jealous of women and girls in my classes, wished I could be them (though I don't mind being a guy as well). I'm pretty masculine (deep voice, hairy) and overweight. Really my biggest body issues come with my weight because it's not feminine like I'd want it to be.

A year ago I started exploring gender and LOVED being ""Gabi"" at home even if it was just a little bit at a time and I was convinced that I am not cis. Then I ended up moving back home and stopped being Gabi.

Now, I've moved to a different state (and a conservative state) for a new job five months ago.

Just recently (last week) I bought a wig. what I felt was missing a year ago when I was Gabi (it never felt complete), is. It's amazing what a wig can do.. and now I'm living as Gabi whenever I'm home and it's just so beautiful and freeing.

So because of different things I decided to see a therapist. I found one here in a small town that has experience with LGBT patients and especially with trans individuals.

Our first meeting is this Monday and I'm nervous. There's so much to talk about and I won't know where to begin (With this or family issues)...

Thing is, I want to be more feminine and have more feminine features, but not fully transition (if that's possible)...

Here's one question... she's a ""Provisional Licensed Mental Health Practitioner"" in the state and has a masters in social work... is that OK? Are there any drawbacks or negatives for MWS?

And what should I expect? I'm nervous and excited and really want to be Gabi and fully immerse myself as a woman, even if it's in private.

Thanks, and sorry for the rambling!

ADDITION: Would it be worth it to send her an email saying I'd like to discuss gender issues since I didn't mention it when I originally set up the appointment?

And I guess my body dysphoria is over the fact that it's not feminine. I don't have genital dysphoria, I just wish I were a woman but wouldn't mind being androgynous if it means being able to pass as a woman too.... so not sure what you'd consider that (would that even be cis?)?"
achanceatlove,asktransgender,Couple of questions about MTF HRT prescription and moving,"Hey. I recently got my prescription for MTF HRT through an informed consent clinic; 50mg spiro x2 and 2mg estrace x4 a day. I haven't started taking it yet, and with the next refill, I'd have enough to last me 2 months if I take them as prescribed.

In 1 month I'll be moving to another state, and I'm wondering what the best way to continue my MTF HRT would be. Would I just restart the entire process at another informed consent clinic, or would I have my old doctor transfer documents and stuff?

I would really appreciate help from anyone with insight or experience on a topic like this, thanks!

PS: Also, is spiro supposed to be expensive? I ended up paying $13 for 120 tablets of 2mg estrace, but $31 for 60 tablets of 50mg spiro. I got my prescriptions at wal-mart, but I forgot to give them the discount RX cards I had (aarx, goodrx) if that matters."
HRTVerySoonMTF,asktransgender,I'm going to be starting HRT soon (MTF) and I'm having doubts!,"As the title says I'm going  to be starting HRT very soon and I'm terrified.

Maybe that's it?

I think when I take my first dose of hormones I'm going to be hysterically upset because I'll be so worried about what the future is going to hold. I keep thinking, 'i'm only 18, I will have to take these for the rest of my life. I can NEVER come off these. Am I sure'. 

Having these doubts are horrible. They scare me. I keep going over things in my head such as I was never concerned or bothered about my male puberty and since I'm terrified about this new female puberty I'm terrified!

I keep thinking 'everything I know and everything I am used to is going to change. My body, my mind, EVERYTHING'. Change scares me because I don't know what will happen in the future, I don't know how I'll feel in the future. WHAT IF I REGRET IT LATER?

Im Hana, I came out as MtF a year ago after a very long fight with self image. I have been in therapy and its mostly agreed that im good to go see the gate keepers. The issue is that i am married and have a daughter. Its been a long fight, she is Cis and not homosexual. So that pushed us to separate two months ago. I feel vastly free because of this instead of sad.

Now the question. Im a lady that is very used to getting what she wants when she wants it. I am pretty agressive when it comes to life. ""Grab the bull by the horns"" so to speak. So my options are simple. 

#1. slowly go through the gate keeper path, im looking at 2.5 years on the waiting list to see the man in Edmonton, which is a 9 hour drive from me. 

#2. Informed consent. this one involves a long trip to the nearest clinic that does things this path. Not a day trip, so i would have to frequently take days off work, which would be bad. 

#3. Self medicate. NOT my first choice. im not big into endangering my own life, but this seems the most immediate choice, and after 25 years, 2 or more seems like way to long. 

Its not easy, but i would like an objective view from you all."

I'm about 5 months into HRT and am having a hell of a time getting my estradiol levels to where my doctor wants them. The protocol at the IC clinic I go to is to maintain levels at or above 300pg/ml. After 5 months of sublingual estradiol (2mg -&gt; 4mg now to 6mg) I can't seem to get my resting levels (8 hours after last dose) above ~120pg/ml. Because of this I'm going to switch to injections.

But all this got me thinking - what are the ideal levels? We know that more estradiol does not necessarily mean better feminization. So far, I've had some breast growth and mood changes, but no other feminizing effects. I'm curious, r/asktg - what kind of estradiol levels have you had over your transitions, and how has that paired with feminization? I know, I know - YMMV.

kanad3,asktransgender,Hair removal prior to SRS (mtf),"Considering having hair removal prior to SRS just to be on the safe side. My surgeon didn't have a preference when it comes to pre or post op. I'm doing the penile inversion technique and what worries me the most is that  have some hair along the bottom third of the shaft. This is what would become the entrance of the vagina, so wouldn't be very easy to remove post-op I'm guessing, even though the surgeon said either was fine. This is just to be more on the safe side really. Anyway, if I first start getting hair removal there I'd probably get the whole SRS area at once.  

So finally getting to it.. What I'm wondering is how I should go about it. I get facial electrolysis, but I'm not too fond of the idea of having that fucking torture device in my genital area, and although the lady doing it is very trans-friendly, I've built a relationship with her and I don't fancy her seeing me naked. Therefore I was considering looking at having laser. I have extremely pale skin and dark brown hair with a golden tint. Would getting laser be sufficient? If there are some stray hair I guess I could look into getting them removed with electrolysis. "

This is something I've always heard from Cis Women. Especially women in relationships. Recently I've been fine with light foundation and not much else for quick errands. I've always had a fair amount of attention from men but this is different.

 I had a guy the other day walk right past me and stare. Then I hear ""you are fucking beautiful"" quite loud behind me. I laughed out loud and didn't turn back.
Couple of weeks ago I walked past a gardener and he looked stunned. He stood and watched me walk for the entire length of the street. I look left then right to cross the street, there he is still watching, now waving to me. I may have put moisturizer on those 2 times. Another night I was on a leisurely night stroll and probably got 3-4 honks from cars passing. Not that this or any kind of attention should be definitive but I wasn't wearing any make up, my hair was pulled back and I was UNTUCKED! 

It trips me out.

Plus all the things I worried about are starting to seem less major or bothersome on HRT. I never would have left the house girl mode without several layers of cover-up and foundation. (I do personally prefer a full beat)

RembrandtsHat,asktransgender,Fashion advice!,"Bear with me, this is a first since I always avoided fashion discussions like the devil.  I'm mtf, btw.

So, a few friends and I (we're all in our early-mid thirties) were passing around a website on facebook that is all about having a gas at the different types of fashion you encounter in the punk rock scene.  What's funny is one of the jokes hit our ""look"" almost perfectly, and even tied in with the bands we still listen to.

Anyway, the basic look is a band t-shirt partially hidden behind a flannel shirt, comfortable ""lived in"" jeans, and either a pair of brown Docs or a pair of Vans.  Our version, anyway.

The conversation eventually dove tailed into whether or not I was going to change it up when I begin presenting female, and the truth is that I really don't want to.  Obviously, I'll have to make large changes for a professional working environment, and given I'm rapidly dropping all the weight I put on depress eating I'm in for a major wardrobe overhaul anyway, but I like how I dress.

I'm just afraid of looking butch, and for no other reason than I still want to be cute and feminine (my height and small hands and feet should help here).  Two of the people in the discussion are cis women, and I never saw anything particularly butch about how they look.  T-shirts, flannel tops, the occasional thermal top, and jeans are all of a feminine cut, and they do come at it front different angles.  One is pudgy and goes for a more bold make up look, and the other is rail thin and has a more natural look.

I even flat out asked them if they had ever been asked if they were lesbians (neither is) and they both said they hadn't.

One of them sent me this link because she just ordered the dark red top the other day.  Probably a good example of the kind of tops I'm talking about.

Or when grocery shopping I'd see if there were any feminizing foods. I just chalked it up to crossdressing or a fetish (maybe that's all this is).

But today.... today it was so sad. I felt like crying on the drive to work over thinking about my ideal body I'd want as a woman and how I will never have it. All throughout the day I would keep on thinking, ""I'm not a girl."" And it just sucked. Honestly, I just wanted to go home so I could feel a little more girly (Even when I'm not dressed up). Didn't help I spent my lunch break looking at wedding dresses online with a coworker who is getting married.

I think the dysphoria is here... though I refuse to acknowledge it as dysphoria and will continue to say I don't have it... because I'm faking it like a hypochondriac. At least I'm at the point where I've thought of it so much, I wouldn't put it past my brain to fake it.

UGH... Hate thinking I'm faking it because it's just hitting after I'm spending so much time thinking about gender."
Lynter,asktransgender,Not a common ''I might be Trans'' post.,"Sorry redditors, but theres a possibility im a special case. **THIS IS NOT A TROLL POST, ALL INFO HERE IS TRUE.**

I am a 15 year old male, believe it or not, this is just boggling my mind down since im incredibly Inquisitive and completely different from most teenagers; not liking what they are involved, trying to constantly find a meaning in everything, and most don't even have basic social principles. I am very open-minded, even after finding my divorced dad's fetishes (nothing to do with feminization/pegging/etc) I managed t talk it out with him and everything went fine.

Now moving to the significant part: First and foremost, I'd like to say that Porn was **NEVER** an influence, and is one of the constant things that I debate with myself of how pepole (mostly -18) act arround it. Ever since Middle School started, Ive been quiet, and with only the friends that meant alot for me (still like this nowdays). Its been 4 years since I went outside my home to do something. Crossdressing has always made me aroused, and I always did it since I was (found it way earlier tbh) 12 in secret, with this year having the chance to perform as Snow White during a school play.

Ive always looked quite feminine, and often (still) confused as one online due to my voice. My hair has always been large and now im letting it grow (almost on shoulders). Im usually very interested in feminine stuff, and never found myself interested in overall male subjects, except the fact that most of my fun comes from Anime/Games/Learning/Discussing social topics on the Internet; and im extremely clever, getting 9/10 marks without even studying. Im a reserved person, but IDK if that has somemthing to do with me not being able to show a more feminine side due to living on a narrow-minded society; and school and bla bla bla.

This year I've questioned myself more than before at wanting to be a woman. In the past 2 years, always when I masturbated (thats not a secret, and had no envolvement with Porn since I hate it.) I would think about the girls, and still place me at their position. During my Philosophy classes (wich I love), some guys where bringing the Homosexual scene as a topic just to troll the classes, and it all ended with me and the teacher having a nice 40 min discussion about the subject. After that, he started to bring more touching subjects to classes, and thats when I questioned myself and went on to learn more about transgender individuals and how they turned out that way.

After reading some of the stories, I instantly identified myself with some (excluding the Porn aspect in some). Time went on, and after 6 months, here i am, in reddit.

Recently my dad wanted to take me to a psychiatrist due to me acting very lazy, and not wanting to discuss ''male'' topics with him. After thinking more and more, and quite assured that I wanted to be a girl, I came out with 3 options:

- Come out to my parents outta nowhere that I want to be a girl (weird for them, since they basically know nothing about myself and see me as someone settled down and confident, and coming out to your parents at 15 is a REALLY weird thing)

- Persuade the psychiatrist to get me an appointment with a gender therapist by playing the dumb and sad guy (requires some thinking and advice, but looks pretty solid since I can act well)

- Do nothing and maybe wait until im more settled in life (Doubt will work since I feel this way at such a young age)

Personally, what do you fellow redditors feel about this? Did you go through simmilar feelings during this age? Is this just a fetish? I think that being transgender might impact my future since studying and learning is one of my favourite things to do.

This subject has been bugging me out for long. Sorry for the large text and some grammar issues.

EDIT: Tomorrow I might have a chance to come out, and I might do it. Will update post, thanks for all the support!"
Latra_Decume,asktransgender,"Feeling lost, some help? (long post)","Hello everyone, I've been lurking in this sub for a while now, but I've never had the courage to post until now. I'm afraid I'll have to ask for your patience and understanding for I am not sure I can put my current feelings cleanly into words. As you might imagine, I'm not feeling
very well. Up until a few weeks ago everything was going great, I was on my way to begin the process to start transitioning (MtF) and life was great, however, suddenly and without warning old doubts and sorrows have started clouding my mind and have made me question everything and right now, I even think that I've actually lost sight of myself, I feel lost, I don't know what to do anymore, but to explain why I'll need to give you some background:



Growing up, I never had feelings or ""clues"" that could point to me being transgender, but that is because my most of my childhood experience was marked by one thing: being weak. I was quite an early birth, due to that I was quite a frail boy who, as you might imagine, was not very good at sports and due to living in a neighborhood full of sports-loving kids this meant that the words I would hear most from my friends referring to me would be ""weak"",""useless"" and ""a joke"" (you know, things kids say). Eventually I just stopped going outside but unfortunately, this would be something that would follow me to school.



Things kind of got worse though, due to my teeth misaligning and my less than stellar looks, ""ugly"" was also added to the mix (I remember that kids would ask to see my teeth just so they could laugh). All of this completely obliterated my self-esteem, I avoided talking and if I did I did it very fast so they'll could not make fun of my teeth, I avoided standing out, so they would not make fun of my looks, I avoided sports so they could not make fun of my ""weakness"". All of this things I'm afraid ended up burned in my mind.



(I'm aware I make sound quite bad, but please, during these years I also was able to make some good friends that, while not perfect, were able to add quite a bit of colors and cheerful experiences to my life :) so don't fret, my childhood was thankfully more than just bullying)



Things however got better during my later teen years. I decided I wanted to better myself, I started doing quite a bit of excersize, I got bracers and I tried to pour more of myself in everything I did, and it worked! I gained some confidence and I was able free myself from the shackles of my self-esteem. However there was a little detail, something still hadn't changed, and that is that every time I would look into a mirror...I would feel embarrassed, I would feel ashamed of who I was, all those those words that were used to describe me would pop again in my mind...something was off, something was missing and so I started searching for it, something that would shut those voices, something that would me feel good about myself again.



I started going to the gym, and something funny happened: I remember I started to lift and do muscle building exercises and I...didn't like it? I remember I would watch other men in the gym doing their routines and seeing their physiques and realising that I didn't want to be like them, I absolutely dreaded the idea of bulking up (Brodin forgive me) so I sticked to stamina training, and more gymnastics-oriented routines. I liked my body form, what can I say? was this a sign? maybe? I'm not sure, but it seemed worth it to mention it.



The big moment when I realised what was happening to me was when...I let my hair grow...silly isn't it? I always hated having short hair, I absolutely HATED it, so when I got out of school and I was no longer required to have my hair short, I let it grow and many months later, one fateful day something amazing happened. I remember it quite clearly, I was done showering (sidenote, washing long hair is a b****) and as I was stepping out of the shower I looked at the mirror...and I felt like time stopped...for a second that felt like an eternity I didn't saw the same image of shame, what I actually saw was...a girl...and it me feel happy, it made me smile! I don't remember the last time before that that I actually smiled at my goddamned reflection! and suddenly I felt it all click.



That was my answer. Due to my ""past"" I've always hated the ""macho culture"", all the bravado and ego that comes with it have brought nothing but pain to me so I've always rejected it, but until that episode I've never EVER even considered that I might be transgendered, although I realise that you don't need to be transgendered to realize how bullshit ""masculinity"" really is, but I digress.



From that point forward I started seeking help, I saw a therapist so I could work on these new feelings and my self-image issues and later sought out the help group for transgendered people in my region, everything was going great, I was about to begin the process to enter the trans health program in my city (for HRT)...but i didn't do anything.



I guess the ghosts from the past didn't disappear, you see, even after all this progress I feel...torn? In my head I can see the kind of person I want to be: I can see myself as a girl who can smile earnestly, who can wear all the colors of the rainbow and all her feelings on the outside, someone cheerful and full of confidence in herself and the future. In the bottom of my heart I can feel her, I can really feel her, however I also feel another thing...I can feel all the scars of my childhood, all those tears, all those hurtful moments...I can feel that scared little boy who growed up to be a somewhat jaded and quite cynical man... and I'm no longer sure who the real me is, or what really is my problem or if I can truly ever become “her”...as I said earlier I feel lost, and afraid.



So here I am, a 24 year-old coward that haven't even be able to anything about this for months, I don't even know why is it so hard for me to share this with my family or friends
(some even know I'm questioning my gender) I just find myself unable to speak to them about this. I feel helpless, I terrified of either option, I'm scared I finding out that “her”
is just an attempt to erase that boy and I'm scared of the possibility of transitioning and finding out that I still won't be able to look at myself in the mirror without feeling ashamed...



I know I probably said more than was necessary here, but as i said, I just haven't been able to share this with anyone else and just writing this has felt kind of cathartic. Honestly
I don't even know what I'm expecting to hear from here, but I would appreciate any advice you can give me, or story you can share or if you can, i would be really thankful for the chance to talk to some of you if that is not too much to ask.



That is all, if you read all of this thank you, it means a lot for me. It may not seem like much, but the friendly atmosphere around here and the help you provide in this sub has a done a lot for lightening up my days, and for that I'm eternally thankful to you :)

Antsinhiseyesjohnson,asktransgender,"A rant, and a request (What do you want from your Lingerie?)","** **feel free to skip this rant** ** 

Firstly I would just like to say thank you, I joined this subreddit a year ago to try help me understand my thoughts and feelings about my own gender. 
I spent countless hours reading over all of your stories and they all really meant a lot to me. I went from thinking I was 100% trans (FtM) to intergender and now coming to the conclusion that I am likely just a cis female but I wasn't comfortable in my gender because of misogyny ingrained in me by my abusive, misogynist Dad. I'm working on it, and i'm in a much better place now.
I would like to say thank you because without this sub i'm not sure I ever would have been able to understand and feel comfortable in who I was, and in reading all of your stories I feel I've learned so much about trans issues and perspectives and so I have become a better and more informed ally to my trans friends.

**And now the request**,

I design and create lingerie, and in this process of understanding my own gender I had a really hard time specifically with my undergarments. They made me feel really uncomfortable. So I thought hey, why don't I start designing Lingerie for Trans people. And here I am.

I wanted to get input from what you would want from your lingerie, parts to accentuate, parts to hide. Things traditional lingerie doesn't have that you need/want.

I understand everybody here will have different opinions on what they need/want from lingerie. The more information I have the better I can design them to hopefully help people feel better (and sexy!) in their bodies.

Especially looking for input from people who are MtF but are comfortable with their penis and want lingerie that accentuates or fits comfortably (doesn't hide it).

But of course everyone's opinion on this would be really helpful! I'm hoping to design a range of lingerie that fits as many peoples needs as I can, so if you have a second &amp; are comfortable I would love to hear from you.

Also would love some input from anyone who is FtM about ideas for male lingerie that is gender affirming. 


Basically the idea is lingerie for everyone that makes them feel good in their bodies.



Thanks for your time, and for reading this hideously long post!"

emveesprelude,asktransgender,How do I deal with knowing that my current friends &amp; family will never accept me?,"Writing this in hopes that someone will be able to give me some mental gymnastics I can do to cope with my situation for the time being. 

Due to growing up in an extremely religious and conservative bubble, all my friends are... religious and conservative. And needless to say not very accepting of trans-folk. 

Since coming out to myself as trans, and becoming more aware of how the people around me act, I've realized that coming out and transitioning in my current situation is just simply not an option. 

While my friends are very supportive and helped me whilst I was struggling with depression and anxiety, hearing the way they talk about trans people absolutely makes me sick to my stomach. I won't repeat the phrases, but it's very typical ""genitals = gender"" nonsense. Whenever they see news stories about trans people they cringe in disgust... 

As for my family, while they're a bit more laid back than most, and have mentioned that they think people can do whatever they want as long as they're not hurting anyone, they practically crucified my brother for being gay, and have mostly exiled him from our family completely. 

Due to all this, the only way I see that I could conceivably transition completely is to move towns, start a new social circle, and cut ties with what's left of my family and friends. Which honestly doesn't sound appealing in reality, but I fantasize about doing this all the time. I just want to be me.

I have at the very least 1 year, if not more before I can even consider leaving, due to finances and such. And from there I still have to worry about actually transitioning, making friends, getting situated in a new place etc.

I guess what I'm asking is can anyone give me some coping mechanisms? Thank you! :D"
actually_crazy_irl,asktransgender,How did your culture/nationality shape your identity and gender?,"My first language doesn't have gendered pronouns, and children - at least me and my sister - were raised in a fairly gender-neutral way. The finnish society isn't that strictly gender-roled (I was genuinely shocked of how seriously people take being Men or being Women in the US), and it took me *way* longer than it should have to realise that I was trans at all.

Felixconnie,asktransgender,what's a new woman to do?,"Hi! 

I'm 28 years old, married (to a woman), and we have two amazing little girls. I came out as a trans woman about a year ago and it's been mostly amazing. My friends are very supportive and loving, always offering to take me shopping, and help with hair and makeup. 

My wife is another case... we've had our ups and downs. She tells me she married a man, not a woman. And that she isn't a lesbian, and has flat out told me she doesn't find me attractive as a woman. But then she will turn around and buy me new skirts and stuff, or take me makeup shopping to help get the best shades. I know in my heart she loves me a lot, but I feel like she's holding me back. She wants me to wait 4 years before I begin HRT, but I don't think I can wait that long, my insurance is coming in from work soon, and I really want to start! I've decided not to have lower surgery for a long while, and I thought that would be enough for her... I wish she could understand what I'm going through. (Also, I'm encouraging her to let her masculine side out more, hoping something will click) 

Some other problems I've come across:

-shaving: my legs get the worst razor burn, I've tried a huge variety of tips and tricks, but none of them help, I've resorted to using an electric razor to shorten the hairs, then using leggings to cover my shame, lol.

-stubble: I have thick, dark facial hair that grows way too quickly, I've started covering it up with makeup, but it is still noticeable. 

-pronouns: I'm still going by he/him pronouns, and I haven't really enforced female ones yet, I'm planning on starting when I start hrt, it makes my heart flutter when someone calls me a woman.

There's more, but just too much to write... any advice?

risingbeans,asktransgender,"(Long and triggering) My dad physically hurt me, and I need advice.","Hi. I'm 18 and trans. My parents are very good people and care about me a lot, but they have never accepted my transness. (Although they are getting better.) Over the years, they've said many, many hurtful things to me, but that's not what I need advice about today.

A few days ago, my grandma kept telling me that I was selfish and a ""spoiled brat"" for having ""gender confusion"", and that my parents do ""such much for me and this is how I reward them."" I already feel that way 24/7. I feel like the worst kid a parent could possibly have because of my mental problems, including my transness. So hearing her say all of that really triggered me. I went up to a guest room and cut my leg over and over again until my dad found me. He called my grandma up and she yelled at me for ""doing this to my poor father.""

I couldn't stop crying, I had so much guilt, when suddenly he lunged at me because I couldn't shut up and started slapping me in the face. My cheek was bleeding. He then left, a few minutes passed, and I was on my phone texting my friend to calm down. Suddenly, he came back, ripped the phone out of my hand, and dragged me down the stairs with him. He threw me to the floor and started slapping me more, yelling ""GIVE ME THE PASSCODE OR I BREAK THE PHONE."" I was screaming, and my grandma was staring at me, shaking her head in disappointment and telling me to listen to my father. I gave him the passcode, and he promptly started reading all my texts and looking at all my photos.

I don't need to continue. I think you get the idea. Anyways, I'm at the hospital now because I wanted to kill myself. 

I've been lying to all of the doctors so far about what happened.

He hasn't physically hurt me in probably a year, so I just... I don't know. He's just not usually like that. My friend wants me to tell the doctors what happened, but I honestly don't know what's right. He was tired and stressed out when he did that. And I'm afraid my life will be ruined if I talk about this.

TransMaybeAlt,asktransgender,Could I just be thinking I'm trans because I'm a virgin?,"Around 4 months ago I accepted the fact that I wanted to be a girl after years of fantasizing about it. ~3 weeks ago I moved into my college dorm and found a doctor who I could get hrt from relatively easily, but I've been too scared to actually call and set up an appointment, one of my biggest fears being that this entire thing is just me subconsciously thinking this will be easier than actually becoming intimate with a girl.

Just some background info: I turned 18 in May and over the years I've cross dressed a bit, but for the most part it has been a sexual thing with me getting aroused and masturbating. However I still enjoy doing it even when I'm not aroused, in fact my earliest memory of it (back before 2nd grade) I tried some sort of bra on and remember loving it which I think mightve been the start of all of this.

Aside from that I have memories when I was young of getting this warm fuzzy feeling throughout my body and somehow linking it to being a girl. I've also begun acting more feminine/doing more feminine things like shaving my upper body/arms, wearing hair bands, curling my eyebrows, skincareaddiction, etc. and I've loved all of it. And I do really wish I was a girl when I look in the mirror, but what if that's just in the same boat with cross dressing as a sexual thrill?

So my fear is basically that since a lot of my reasoning for thinking I'm transgender is sexual in nature, it might just be me subconsciously wanting to be able to see/feel a women's body rather than having gender dysphoria. Honestly I've started to really try to meet a girl because I feel like I'd be able to know how I actually feel if I could be with someone, but Im short, skinny, not overly attractive as it is so I don't think it will happen any time soon... and in the meantime my body is just developing more and more while I wait. Has anyone else been in the same situation? Is this like normal to be feeling?

sarahfrench,asktransgender,"How common is it to cycle through waves of wanting to transition, broken by periods of being content as assigned gender?","I've been living with the urge to become female all my life; but only periodically. This has been a constant in my life, but there is great variation in the length of time between feeling these urges. In between, I have been happy being male, attracted to women, happy with my body and looks, and comfortable in who i am. During the periods when I feel the urge to be female, which typically last a few months per year, perhaps twice a year, i seriously consider medically transitioning, and regret the fact I didn't do it when i was younger and could have passed/blended with ease.

When i was in my late teens i had long hair and was often gendered female. Looking back to that period, which was marked with almost daily private crossdressing, in public i was ashamed of my body, and would wear large overcoats, baggy clothes etc to cover it; at the time i thought it was because i wasn't masculine enough, but looking back now it seems like classic dysphoria which i didn't recognize. This was in the pre-internet era when transgender information was not readily available. 

In my twenties and thirties the urge to transition become less frequent, and less intense, and i was comfortable being a man. It has come back with a vengeance now in the latter part of my thirties, probably too late to act on perhaps...

Anyway (sorry to ramble)... i suppose what I'm asking is, how many others went/are going through this cycling of feelings, and does anyone have any idea why this should occur? I've been wondering about correlations between life-contentment and urges to transition, wondering if it's more likely to occur at periods when I'm unhappy for other reasons, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Maybe I'm wrong, i don't know. Could it be hormonal or something? controlled by the moon? El nino? 

Also, during the periods when I become convinced that I should begin to transition, I still don't really feel dysphoria in the way that I see it described by may others here. I don't particularly dislike my body, but would prefer it if it looked feminine. 

If this is a fairly common story, i'd like to know if anyone who has experienced the same waxing and waning of the urge to transition, has transitioned, and how that has worked out..."

My mother just found it and walked into my room trying to talk about it. I panicked and basically told her to fuck off. Currently in my room by myself blasting music and panicking. I know my mother will support me, but I myself while very sure I am mtf have been going back and forth recently.

I'm sorry if this makes no sense really freaking out right now not sure why either. 

I'm guessing that I'll eventually talk to her and say I'm pretty sure I'm mtf, would like to talk to someone about it, but I am not certain and it could very well turn out I was wrong the entire time. 

Sorry for how terribly written and maybe unclear this is, really panicked at the moment.

Any advice really appreciated!"
ImElissa_WasGQTrans,asktransgender,Anyone else who hates the attention around being trans?,"I hate the fact that trans women are more '' wanted '' than cis women by straight men who want to explore something new. I wish we were just exactly seen like them. It makes me sick when I look on encounter sites and see tons of adds asking for '' shemales '' . I wish we were just unnoticable. Just ordinary and not special. 
I have so much difficulties with this attention centred around trans people. Would be so much better if we were just main stream like gay , bisexual, lesbian people and not seen as exotic each time. 

Now I understand why people go stealth. To not have to deal with all that attention crap.
What I would give to just be a boring cis girl instead of this fair attraction that we are seen as. 

I hope that this is just a short rage and that eventually trans people will not be interesting to the outside world anymore. "

tgpineapple,asktransgender,I've put myself in an uncomfortable situation with my parents,"I'm going to see my psychiatrist in about 7 hours with my parents and younger sibling in tow. I've come to this agreement with my psychiatrist at an earlier appointment but between the two I conveniently forgot when I made the appointment. I have terrible anxiety making phone calls so I didn't check. Until 2 days ago when I got the spontaneously text message reminding me that I have an appointment - yay. So I told my parents that they should come along and they have time (great!).

I was going to come out to them (again) between the two appointments but the sudden shock and a general fear of coming out to my parents (again) has left me wordless. They're asleep now so I won't get the chance until tomorrow morning when we meet with the doc, but I feel really bad. Last time I came out, they tried to ignore it happened and it was almost a year ago. I've been stealth taking meds telling them its for my terrible acne and that its working (spiro totally kills acne). 

So now I'm going to have to tell them face up and my psych will be there to back me up hopefully. I know my parents are going to be stubborn and arrogant but my best hopes are on the line and I just feel like its going to go badly. There's going to be like three outcomes:

1. They are fully accepting and understanding and they might pay for my surgeries (wow yay)
2. They pretend that this didn't exist again (not yay) and they get to live in blissful ignorance
3. They kick me out of the house and disown me from the family

As far as I see it, there's a 2/3 chance of a good outcome so I'm set, right? I'm stressing out, tired as all hell, wanting this to be over and hoping they'll be okay with everything but I'm cynical about it. I can't sleep and I'm so desperately hoping that I can be happy with my family. What do I do reddit?"

PavementBlues,asktransgender,I was planning on resolving things with my mom this weekend. She beat me to it.,"As you can tell from my flair, I've been on HRT for two months now. Last time I talked with my mother about it was the day before I started, when I first came out to her.

Things went...okay. She was really worried that I was going to ruin my life and make myself an outcast, at one point argued that I just had a tendency to put myself on the fringe of society (I was a really weird teenager back in the day), and said that I should get therapy for years before making any decisions. She clearly did *not* like the idea of me transitioning, but by the end of the conversation, she said that if this was what I needed to do, then she was still going to love me.

All in all, it went about as well as I was expecting, and I chalked it up as a tentative victory. I didn't talk with her much after that, though, as life got a little crazy preparing for/going to/cleaning up from Burning Man. The idea of telling her that I had started HRT still scared me, but I knew that it was time and had decided to talk to her about it when I called her last weekend.

So I called her. We chatted about various things. Finally, as I was looking for a break in the conversation to jump in and bring up my transition, she said, ""By the way, I've been thinking a lot lately about what you're going through with your gender. God knows I've lived an unconventional life myself, so I want you to know that whatever you decide is right for you, I totally support it. It's your life to live, and I just want you to be happy.""

I was floored. We ended up talking about it for over an hour, and she's curious and excited for me. I tried telling my friend about it afterwards and started crying.

Things are getting better. Step by step."

ChanelNumberOne,asktransgender,Anyone else incredibly observant of woman for as long as you can remember?,"So as a mtf trans woman who is attracted to women.

I also know how woman walk and the subtle differences in how they sit and stand idle. These things I know because I have spent my entire life watching and admiring it.

My question is since I know that HRT effects a plethora of things, and I've been on HRT for almost 3 years now, would doing any weight / resistance training be a bad idea? 

I'm not wanting to be super bulky by any means, but I do feel as though I've gotton a LOT weaker and it's becoming a concern of mine. As of late I bike everyday as transportation, so it helps a little but not as much as I'd like.

What kind of exercises help give more feminine legs? What kind of diet changes do I need to account for since starting HRT? Again this is more for the person that has already had surgery and been on HRT for some time, not really a pre-HRT workout guide.

Thank you for your time!"

They are all feminist cis-women and everything was fine until a while ago. I suppose it is going to be better but what happened is that one of the girls suddenly said some things that really offended me. I decided to talk to her about it and then it just got bigger, until I finally just asked her to keep silent and listen to me and the after a monologue of mine she seemed to understand. Of Course hole thing ruined the night. The rest of the girls were trying to explain  to me how and why she said those things but that really didn't help. I said that what would be helpful would be that they showed me they understood that what she said was just not ok. 
It started with her saying that it was hard for her to remember my pronoun like , common do I reealy have to do that . So I confronted her about that. And then she started being all theoretical about me choosing he as a pronoun. Like that was something to discuss about. She managed to say more things as well she like started to talk really fast and try to analyse what she thought was important instead of realising I had been offended and directly say sorry. It's one of the girls I like the most in this relatively new company and I think that that even made it harder for me. I guess I felt she saw me or something and suddenly that collapsed... "

distantradiance,asktransgender,"Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but... anybody had experience in dealing with narcissists, TERFs?","Hi all, I wasn't sure where to post this exactly as it's a bit all over the place but in a nutshell: my now ex crush/close friend who has Narcissistic BPD has cut me off without explanation and turned into a TERF quite literally overnight and it's destroying me.

It goes some way back. We met on tumblr about 3 years ago and she was always pro trans. I've had the silent treatment from her a few times, I've always gone back to her months later and she seemed happy to talk to me. Stupid of me, I know, but I thought I could help her.

We started talking again about 4 months ago and we really hit it off. We have an insane amount in common and just had a really deep connection. Some of the best conversations I've had in my life.

I wanted to help her because of her BPD, which she doesn't realize she has, or at least some of the traits. She's also struggled with anorexia + trust issues since she was young.

I did nothing but encourage her, support her and listen to her problems. I was compassionate and I thoroughly educated myself about her issues so that I could just be there for her. Putting her needs head of mine was a big mistake, though.

So the past two weeks or so things start getting flirty between us and something is *definitely* there. Like, almost love. It was like the brick wall that she built up around her for so long was finally down and she could trust me. I feel on top of the world.

Well, a few nights ago she just... changed. Like a switch went off. She ended the conversation on a very ""off"" kind of feeling.

The next day I'm looking on tumblr and she reblogs the MOST transphobic post (it was about Julianna Fialkowski), this triggers me like crazy and of course I confront her about it. I'm utterly shocked. She doesn't reply and blocks me. 

Now, I'm just a total mess. I have a history of emotional abuse from my parents and a couple of other people so it's especially triggering. Her tumblr is now FULL of hateful, hateful stuff which I know is about me, calling me ""abusive"" and ""toxic"" and she's started following TERF blogs. She seems to have moved on just like that. How can someone go from ""liking"" someone trans to totally transphobic at the drop of a hat?

I am 100% I didn't say or do anything wrong. Even if I did, I don't deserve to be made to feel voiceless and invisible. Silent treatment is so fucking brutal. I feel so betrayed, traumatized almost. I've been having panic attacks. I cared so much for this girl and now I hate her, who she's become? 

We didn't even get to argue, and though I don't even WANT to talk to her now, I still can't let go and I don't know why."

GabiCap,asktransgender,Could this be dysphoria? And I don't want to make the decision myself,"Another day filled with thinking, another question. 

I like to say I don't have dysphoria and that the feelings of ""I'd like to be a girl"" come and go and are gone more than they're here... but then I thought...

I walk through the women's section of Target, and I look for clothes for myself (ok, possibly a crossdresser) and then lament never being able to look good in them or be able to wear them out like I (partially) feel like I'm supposed to. Like, part of me really thinks I should be able to rock women's clothing with the right shape of a woman.

And let's say the thought is ""gone"".. and I'm in my ""let's stop dressing and I'm totally cis"" phase.. the thought is still there when I look at the clothing, when I see women jog, and when I see the occasional woman I'd want to be like.

Other than that, my only problem with my body is my weight. I don't look in the mirror and say ""I'm a woman."" But the above scenario made me think..

(Honestly, I just want to be told ""Yep, you're definitely trans without a doubt"" or ""You're an imposter and a fake that just wants to feel special get outta here you cis-male."" Though even if told the latter, I'd still occasionally think of what it must be like to be a woman. All these realizations are scary and I just want the decision to be on someone that isn't me.)"

GabiCap,asktransgender,Crossdresser or trans... thin line?,"I really need to get off this subreddit. So many questions rolling around in my mind.

Anyways, I know the basic definitions of each.. a crossdresser dresses as the opposite sex, but has no desire to be the opposite gender. A transgender is/wants to be the opposite gender they were born in (or assigned at birth).

Basic definitions. But in my own experience, I would have considered myself a crossdresser. I enjoy women's clothes and being in girl mode. It's relaxing and just an overall amazing feeling to think of myself as a girl. And while I somewhat like being a guy and don't mind it, I also wish I could have been a girl because that side of me is nice too and I'm loving exploring it.

So, idk, it seems like that's something crossdressers would think and feel, but then I read that crossdressers don't have these thoughts. Or maybe they do. 

Sometimes, at least to me and for me, it seems like that line can be pretty thin and not all that clear cut. Or am I missing something? "

It gets complicated when I take the fantasy into reality though. I'm short and have really feminine features and a high pitched voice. I feel like no matter what I would be a ridiculous looking man.

I've been with her for six months now and every time I see her dressed I get really jealous that she gets to dress that way.  I'll admit that this pair of shoes she bought got me so jealous that I went and bought a pair for myself.  

Today she texts me a picture of herself at work all dressed up with these black heels on and that's all I noticed was her clothes.  She told me a story about how her manager saw her shoes under her desk and picked them up and complimented her, telling her not to ever wear ""boring"" shoes again.  I was getting so jealous I didn't bother asking my gf what brand or kind they were and she seemed to be hinting to me that they were expensive and a brand name and she was really happy with her purchase.

I hate labels too, but I always considered myself a ""straight"" crossdresser but I can't help but think something is wrong with me because the jealousy just kills me and it makes me want to have a weekend to myself where I can get all dolled up and feel the way she feels about herself.  

If you got this far, thanks for listening to me.  I feel stressed out and depressed about this story, is there something wrong with me?  "
0_0_0_0_0_0_0,asktransgender,"Been on hormones for 7 months, might not get more hormones for a three or four weeks. How much could I backslide during that time?","I'm MTF, pre-op and have been on hormones for 7 months. Due to some annoying mix ups with the scheduling of appointments (my fault, really), I have run out of hormones as of four days ago and might not get any more until the 27th. Looks like similar questions have been asked before, but the answers are a bit inconsistent. Seems like some have experienced losing months of progress (or even almost all of their progress) and others have only experienced a little bit of mood swings under similar circumstances. At just four days I could swear my breasts are a little shallower, but maybe it's all in my head. What I'm wondering is--how bad could it get in three more weeks? Should I just wait it out? Should I try to order hormones online or talk to another doctor? I haven't even been able to reach my current doc--her staff tells me to send her a message on their site when I call, but my messages meet with no response. The thought of masculinizing again, even a little bit, terrifies me more than I thought it would."
LvaKq,asktransgender,Sexism: a severe reality check,"MtF, as will be obvious from what I am about to say.

I was fortunate to grow up in a well-rounded household, with morally sound parents, and a reasonable level of education. As a male, I was aware of the inherent sexism that is still, unfortunately, well diffused in today's society. I was aware of how, when, and where it would often come up - I could see it, observe it. I was aware what was being done to combat it. I considered myself a feminist, a supporter. But the key word here is aware.

Well, excuse the language, but holy shit and WTF. Transitioning has kicked me out of the passenger seat. The difference between being aware and being able to feel it is massive, and indeed crucial. I've come to realise - or at least I believe - that cis men cannot fully understand or appreciate the problem, or in some cases even believe it, deep down. That is not a criticism - the effort required to truly get into a women's shoes is too great for any cis male to bother trying, or even consider trying. Why should they? They *get* it. Well no, you *don't*, cis straight male. They have no idea - *I* had no idea - of how bloody real and scary it is. This is a major case of not knowing it till you're in it. Yeah fire burns - but you can only appreciate how painful a burn is till you actually get burnt. I was utterly blind. The word privilege has taken a whole new weight, one that I can now feel because I am no longer standing upon it. I cannot believe how screwed up this whole situation is, and how ignorant I was. It makes me want to shout and fight for it. It makes me want to travel into the past and vigorously shake my passed self.

I just want to apologise to all women. I am not even sure why I am saying it here, since most of you know exactly what I mean, having witnessed two sides of the coin, in some way or another. I just wanted to rant, and express that.

**Edit:** Just to be clear, I am not complaining about transitioning into a woman in the slightest. My journey so far has been beautiful, and I am happier than I have every been. Instead, I am expressing how it has helped me realise how big of a problem sexism actually is."
aria22,asktransgender,"Hormone levels seem weird, feminization seems to be reversing.. help?","Hi people,

My hormone levels have been measured as being this last month:  
prolactine 0.17 u/l  
estradiol 252 p/mol  
testosterone 0.8 n/mol  

I've been on Estradiol and Androcur for about a year now, and I think there have been _some_ subtle changes, but nothing really major. Most of the changes happened when I was on _only_ androcur for 6 months, before Estradiol was introduced. In the time where I have also been on E, I haven't really noticed that many changes.

6 months ago, my E was at around 450p/moL, and my prolactine was sky-high (0.61), due to a psychotropic medication that raises prolactine beyond normal. I also think this particular psychotropic medication caused drug interactions, because it made me quite sick. Since I got off it, I feel a lot better, and can live life again. 

Also, I am not quite sure of this, but it seems some of the feminization is reversing since I went off that psychotropic med and my E went down to 252p/moL..

Are my hormone levels in the wrong ranges? What ranges should I target?

EDIT: Please pay special attention to the units this uses. I've discussed this before, on a chatroom, and they told me that the target should be between 200 and 400pg/ml, and at first glance you would think an E level of 252p/moL is fine, but, 252p/moL is 68.6pg/ml when converted, according to http://www.endmemo.com/medical/unitconvert/Estradiol.php ...

eevee-lyn,asktransgender,"I want children, but...","I want children. I went to a sperm bank before I started HRT. But, pretty much the only chance for me to have children is to find a trans guy who wants to get pregnant. And as far as I know, trans guys are required to get a hysterectomy to change their legal sex in my country. So I'd have to find 1) a foreign trans guy 2) who I get along with well 3) and who wants to get pregnant. What are the chances of that, honestly?

I'm straight, so being with a cis girl is not really an option... but I've been thinking. I do enjoy kissing and cuddling with girls, it's just the sex that is a complete and utter turn off and I never want to see another woman naked, ever again. It just makes me feel completely inadequate and unattractive and manly and frankly, fat. (I'm not fat, but around cis girls, I feel like it since I'm 6'1 and slightly pudgy.)

But I guess I could be in a sexless relationship with a cis girl. It would have the advantage of us looking like a straight couple (because I don't pass and likely never will, as far as other people are concerned, I'm a tall guy with long hair) so we'd be less likely to be harassed.

Other than adoption (which is too costly and takes too much time for an uncertain result), I don't really have other choices, do I?"

robynpan,asktransgender,Post-Op Dilating question. MtF (trigger warning: complications),"So I had surgery just over a month ago, and when told to dilate just after surgery I used the smallest they gave me to dilate, but then started bleeding heavily. After emergency surgery I was given a significantly smaller dilator to start with. Since then, I have only been able to get that size in without (slight) bleeding. This means when I try to make myself wider it triggers me to a point that I can't continue.

I fear that if I wait for me to not bleed anymore, I will have healed too small, but I'm scared of dilating wider despite bleeding.

My question: If I stay with the size I'm at now, can I widen it further later when it's healed enough to not bleed?

Note, depth is not the issue. It's a question of width. thanks"

What is it like for transgender men and women travelling to Muslim countries? Many laws and cultural practices are based around gender, so how does one navigate these? (I'm aware that there are different degrees of strictness from country to country, so I guess I'm asking more generally.) How does being passing or not impact these, and are there taboos that one should be especially aware of? More generally, what are cultural attitudes like towards trans folk?

Edit for clarity: I'm a transman. How does this change the situation (since I think a lot of you were commenting with the impression I was MtF)? Also, when I said Muslim countries, I meant countries that have predominantly Muslim populations where the religion does have influence on the laws.

AndroAidan,asktransgender,Transitioning from Female to Androgynous," Ever since I was a little kid I always felt out of place with the other girls, and while I felt a little better fitting in with the boys, I still knew something wasn't quite right. I remember when I was in 3rd grade, I started wearing boy clothes, cutting my hair short and telling people I was a boy, but that phase quickly faded because even though it felt better than being a girl, it still wasn't who I wanted to be.

 In the past 5 years or so, I've been see-sawing between dressing like a typical girl and dressing like a typical boy, using a male name and using a female name, and occasionally trying to find a healthy balance between the two genders. But no matter how hard I tried, nothing seemed to fit what I wanted to be.
 Recently (as in about 4 months ago) I came across a term called 'Androgyny' which in a psychological sense, refers to having both a masculine and feminine gender identity. At first, I thought it didn't really fit. But the more research I did, the more I fell in love with the term. For the first time in pretty much forever, I feel like I finally know who I am.

 Even though I hate the idea of being a typical ""girl"", I still love to wear makeup and high-heels and having long hair, and just feminine things in general. But when it comes to my body, I couldn't be more disgusted by the fact that I have ovaries and a uterus and all those icky lady parts. I hate being short (5'6) and having curves and big hips and just flat out looking like a girl. I don't want to look like a girl.
  I want to be tall, like, really tall. If I ended up being 6'2 by the time I stop growing, I wouldn't mind a single bit. I want to have stronger arms and thinner thighs. I want to have a deep voice, like a man's voice. I want to have more masculine facial features, like a sharper jaw and a more prominent forehead. I want bigger feet and bigger hands instead of dainty, ladylike hands. I want to look like a man, I just don't want to be one.

  About a month ago, I started taking estrogen blockers, which so far has only worked in stopping me from having my period. Don't get me wrong, I couldn't be more happy that I no longer have to surf the crimson wave, I just wish it would do more. Unfortunately, I don't have access to HRT at the moment so estrogen blockers are all I can do right now. And testostrone supplements which I plan on taking pretty soon, but they still don't compare to injections.

Eventually, I'd love to start HRT but because I still live with my parents, and the fact that I'm broke as hell, it's not really an option for me. Anyways, this has been my long, complicated story of self-discovery and self-loathing."

After that, I got it and had a short time-frame to find a doctor. I didn't find one in time and so I had presumably lost this insurance, I thought.


Sometime later I started going to an Informed Consent clinic (Howard Brown in Chicago). I still go there and my next appointment is in December. I get my HRT from them.


I just got a letter today that apparently it's been re-newed and so I have health insurance again! Which would be great and amazing, but it doesn't cover HRT or other trans-related surgeries (from the one file I read online).


So I'm kinda stuck at what to do now. I'm thinking I'll need to call Howard Brown about this and then if I stop getting care from there/being able to go there then I'll have to get generics using GoodRX (which has pretty affordable prices, although with my dosage it may get a bit pricey).

So now with the shortage of injectable delestrogen, I have taken up pills for the first time.

With injections I was taking 1.5 mil every 2 weeks. 
(So 20 mg/1ml so = 30 mg/1.5 ml right?)

Now the GP sent me a script of 2mg estrodiol 2x a day
(So 4mg daily over 14 days = 56 mg?)

Since I've had the script I've just taken the 2mg 1 time per day which seems like 28mg over the 2 weeks = close enough to 30 mg. I actually feel a lot less moody, which I like, but my concern is whether or not I'm absorbing less or more in the long-run with the pills switch over (I'm not getting into the effectiveness debate - just speaking technically regarding what my body is processing).

I started transitioning this year, came out last year to a shitstorm from my wife (a story for another day) and friends who ranged from accepting to no longer here, I have been on hrt 6 months. I just, have a few questions and didn't know where else to turn. 

First - my dsyphoria is running rampant, way more than it used to, is this normal? I just look in the mirror now and flinch at what I see because all I can see is the gross 5 oclock shadow that wont go away no matter how much I shave and a face that everyone says sir to. Just does it get better?

second - My best fried is getting married and I am supposed to be there, but I don't want to wear the tux. I don't want to be apart of the bridal party I don't want to be a 'groomsman'. I don't want to deal with the questions from his family, yes he outed me to them, but most of all I don't want to feel jealous of his wife to be. I have come to realize I love him and this information is killing me. Sidenote in order to make it I would need to work my 8 hour shift rent a car drive 8 hours down to see him wedding the next day and drive back the day after.... I feel I need to be there I owe it to him, hes my best friend. what do I do? please help

Sorry for bothering everyone."
hanazon0,asktransgender,PSA: check your dilators in,"On transit to Asia through Beijing and their TSA got the jelly upon scanning my carry on luggage. 

So they took the dilators out. They held it up. They marvelled at it and wondered what it was. And they asked me what it was. I shyly mumbled something then blurted out in Mandarin : ""I had surgery on my vagina and have to shove that in there. It's for wedging my vagina open . Now excuse me, I have a plane to catch. ""

It was pretty humiliating but to their credit they didn't flinch eww but put it back saying it's ""fascinating' (lady TSA staff)"
helpneededndplenty,asktransgender,OH F**K OH F**K I THINK MY BOYFRIEND FIGURED IT OUT,"Update to: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/53wo4n/help_how_do_i_have_the_talk_with_my_boyfriend/

So I've been trying to disclose being trans/intersex to my boyfriend for the last couple of days and I've failed every time. Finally my boyfriend figures out something is up and today I tell him that there's something I really want to tell him but I'm just not ready. Then we joke around for a bit and he says ""what are you secretly a guy or something"" and I'm thinking ""oh boy, oh wow, oh no"". Then we switch topics for a little bit but later on he comes back to it and he said that he meant what he said earlier and that he wouldn't be shocked or horrified. 

I'm 95% sure that means he's figured it out. I know, I know it sounds like he's ok with it and I'm thankful. I really am, but I'm still kind of nervous and hesitant to officially say the words. Is that stupid or what? I have no clue what to do. I really, really, really, really, REALLY like this guy and I just don't want him to suddenly see me as the trans girl or the intersex girl. 

One last update if anyone was wondering: Well everything was finally said last night. He point blank asked me about my genitals (respectfully) and said he didn't care. Which is unbelievable. I can't believe this is happening. But I'm really, really glad. Lastly, we talked and he said the reason he figured it out was because he just couldn't believe that a girl like me didn't already have a boyfriend when we met and why no one had ever had sex with me before and so he figured there must have been a profound reason. Thanks everyone for all the support and advice!"
stardropTabletop,asktransgender,"Should I get the rad haircut I've been dreaming of, or just a trim?","For as long as I can remember, my hair has been one of the only things that I've consistently liked about myself. Like, even when I was little, I remember loving how thick it was, wondering what it would look like if I were allowed to grow it past the standard boy's cut I was supposed to maintain.

At the age of 22, after a bunch of false starts and small trims, almost all of my hair has grown down past my chin, and I've never been happier about how it looked. Now, I *was* just gonna go to my stylist in a week or two to trim the back of my hair a bit (it's gotten super scraggly and kinda mullet-ish in the past several months)...but it has recently dawned on me that I have enough hair on my head to get this one particular haircut that I've been dreaming of ever since I made up my mind to transition.

I still remember seeing Lapis Lazuli from SU and Ramona Flowers (at least, graphic novel Ramona Flowers) and thinking ""oh my god...I want their hair."" 

Longer in front. A bit shorter in the back. Kinda side-swept bangs. Shaggy and cool, but still really cute. *That was what I wanted. That was me.*

I forgot about that desire, let it fall somewhere underneath layers upon layers of parent-related struggles and a crushing desire to ""fit in""...until I played Life is Strange and saw Chloe and realized all over again that *that was my hair.*

However, as rad as I want my hair to be, I have no idea if a haircut like that would actually look good on me. I've asked a few of my friends, and they've all said to go for it. I'm out to my stylist and she's amazing, so I'm sure the fact that all of my references are fictional characters wouldn't necessarily make things impossible. But...I'm still kinda unsure; I really, really, really don't want to ruin my hair of all things, after everything I've gone through. What do you all think? I've posted a few pics of me below, along with some links to reference images of the characters I'm talking about.

TLDR; I've always wanted to get a rad punk-ish haircut like something that Chloe from Life is Strange/Ramona Flowers/Lapis Lazuli from SU all have, but I don't know if I should (pics of me and the three characters I referenced are linked below).

what i mean is i just want to have a ""trap"" body.

i love dressing a woman and i wanna try to cosplay my favorite anime characters (which are girls ofc) and doing these makes me feel good. 

don't worry about gf, we talked about this if ever i be woman looking, she'll still accept me. now the question is how am i gonna do it without being barren bec i ve heard and read that taking too much estogren whether on food or pills will make me barren and sterile and being a complete transgender didnt ever cross my mind.

so, how will i put it? it s hard for me to put in words bec i cannot speak english very good but i m trying to say that i want just to be androgynous or something.

 (and iono if im in the right reddit coz there s a r/crossdressing, right? but i wanna ask our beautiful transgenders here for some thoughts) 

what would you recommend me doing? take pills? drink jizz and soy or start dieting/exercise or something? what do you think? :)

RxsJov1T,asktransgender,"Had a nervous breakdown, Do I need to quit my Job/school ?","I had a rough day yesterday in school. It's one of those typical two-part apprenticeships with work and school. I am 23 years old and sitting next to 15-18 years old. Sitting in a classroom is one of my situations where fear is omnipresent. In addition to that, knowing no one, and probably having nearly nothing in common with those ""kids"" is making me the forever alone guy. I would really need someone. I started dressing more feminine. Skinny jeans, cardigan and to kill it all ankle boots with 2"" (5,2cm) heel. I felt great on my way to school, but in school i felt fear. I managed to don't panic and present myself as a feminine guy. It cost me all my strength to don't panic anytime someone looked at me. This is only so bad for me, because i am afraid of large groups because i was bullied many years ago and that never really healed. After school I drove my motorcycle on my way home. I tried to impress some of the guys in my class, and needed to break to strong and fell. Just a minor accident but this was more than i could handle now. At home i slowly cried and thought about, if i could survive another day like this. And then i cried more. So much, that i couldn't stop. I felt physical pain, nearly vomited. I was shaking so hard that i wanted to call an ambulance for if i would collapse. My parents came from downstairs and tried to calm me. I then told them everything, i outed myself. Seeing their child cry and shaking was making me sob even more.

Now what ? I would like to quit my job and try to therapy my anxiety(rehab). Only this anxiety is killing me and making my life worse. Should i try to just go on and try to deal with this everyday(while keeping job/school) or will breakdown happen more often this way ?
I will go to my Doctor for a sick note, to miss school today, or even next week of work.
And hopefully my Therapist has time today for me."

FILE13reddit,asktransgender,"Questioning myself, advice appreciated plz.","Hi, I'm going to apologize in advance for what I am sure is going to be a long post, with a lot of questions. Ill try to make it as short as possible  Um, I'm 27, born male pre everything. 
Recently I've been questioning myself and whether or not I might be transgender(Mtf) or if I am just thinking to much into everything. When I was younger than 10 I remember being interested in and trying on my mothers clothing, everything from underwear to some tops and things. Fast forward a few years my step mother and sisters tell me that I have some very feminine mannerisms, ie walking on my toes, or sitting with my legs crossed. Which I was slowly nagged and embarrassed out of doing. On to teenage years and early 20s, I left home and got more experimental, I found relationships that quietly accepted me shopping for clothes or painting my nails. I had a small wardrobe of very feminine clothing, dresses, tops, tight clothes and some lingerie, as well as a small amount of make up. At this point I was still in the closet for the mpart, very few people knew anything, least of all my family.  For one reason or another I always stopped, gave away or got rid all feminine articles and tried to forget about it. Now recently all of this has come to mind again, even to the point of looking at women and thinking about how I wish I could look like them physically, mainly breasts, hips, face, hair and how much I would like to be able to wear the same things and I am wondering why this is a reoccurring theme for me... Am I actually transgender? Should I consider seeing a therapist and transitioning? Do other trans women have similar experiences or feelings? When I look at women and wish I could look like them or wear the same things and be accepted is it just wishful thinking, envy or dysphoria? Again I apologize for the long post and questions. I just want to understand."

PolybiusTestUnit,asktransgender,Breakfast on Pluto?,"I have to say that I'm usually not a big fan of cis-people playing trans roles in general.

Jared Leto for example, was way too over the top for my taste in Dallas Buyer's Club, and came off more as a caricature of a trans woman, than a legitimate one.  If they were playing a drag queen, it would have been fine - but that's not the role they were playing.

Anyway....

____

I have to say, as a trans person, I kind of have a soft spot for Breakfast on Pluto.

It definitely helped me feel much less alone when I came out, but I'm not sure how well its going to age.

I don't think a cis-guy could have done any better job at playing that role than Cillian Murphy.  I really did think they did an amazing job.

However, I still think it would have been better if a trans woman played that role.

PaganInVegas,asktransgender,"Came out to GP, received lacking support","So I spoke to a GP today and got shut down pretty thoroughly. As some background I’m 21, mtf pre-everything, unemployed and living with my family in the UK.

I told the GP that I was transgender, she asked me a bunch of questions about it, I tried to answer them the best I could without really knowing what she wanted from me. Doesn’t help that I’m not great at talking to people, but I imagine this stuff isn’t easy to talk about for anyone early in their transition.

The GP’s basic response was that I needed to think about funding. “The NHS is in crisis” (she said this at least twice). Getting help with gender issues is not covered on the NHS and that I’m not “entitled” to help (said as if healthcare was some privilege that I can’t just expect to have). That I need to “consider all the angles” before they can help me.

I’d mentioned that I haven’t come out to my family yet, so the GP told me that I should talk to them next so I can have their help in funding. I tried to explain that I wasn’t ready to do that yet, but she insisted that talking to them should be my next step. As if this wasn’t my healthcare, and my problem, and frankly no one else’s business right now.

She said that I hadn’t really given her much to work with, and that getting a referral requires lots of time and psychiatric evaluations (in a tone that implied it was more hassle than was worth). She left it saying that she would look at the pathway needed to get a referral, but presumably they won’t do much if they say they haven’t got the money for it.

So all in all it was pretty frustrating but not entirely unexpected. I’m not sure whether they can’t help and the GP just failed to show even a shred of sympathy for my plight, or whether she was genuinely trying to brush me off with a ‘doctor knows best’ sort of approach.

Sorry that this has gotten rather long and ranty. I don’t feel too bad right now, I’m pretty pleased that I managed to make the appointment and come out to my GP. I just need to think about what I’m going to do next. I’m wondering if I privately saw a therapist and had their backup if it would help in getting the NHS to take me seriously. Thoughts on that idea or anything else I’ve written here are very welcome!"

I figured out I was trans roughly around my freshman year of HS, and when I came out to my mom I couldn't handle her reaction. It was somewhere between shock and poorly muffled hostility. ""What makes you think that?!"" ""Are you gay too?!"" ""You're confused or something?!"" ""You've never been feminine in your life?!"" That last one still gets to me. As long as I can remember she's been telling me to stop being such a girl/wussy boy/etc. I'm like ten times more feminine than her and she's just totally blind to it, even though she's been pointing it out and trying to toughen me up (totally didn't work lol) since forever. 

In any case, I couldn't handle her accusatory shock and 15 year old me took the worst possible approach. I told her I had just been confused and I locked the closet door so hard that I eventually went into denial. I was young and scared and I didn't know how to deal with it. Not sticking to my guns back then is my biggest regret now.

20 now, coming to terms with these feelings again, and this time there's no going back. I'm a transwoman and I'm going to transition, whatever it takes. These feelings only get stronger every day and I don't know how much longer I can go without just blurting it out to my family. My mom has been more progressive in recent years, saying timidly that she would accept me if  I was ""gay or something"" (by now she must know something's up), but she still calls Caitlyn Jenner a shim (she/him, my mom can be a disgusting human sometimes). Telling my parents is especially difficult because they are my sole financial support right now (I just started college and don't have time or energy to work right now). I have to tell them because I have to transition, but I'm too afraid of the potential backlash. I don't think they would kick me out of the house, but I really can't be sure. My dad is a wildcard. I know he's not religious, but other than that he's never uttered a word for or against LGBT people. 

There's also the issue of my little brothers. They're 12, and I have this bad feeling that seeing their big brother become a sister would mess them up for life. I know my mom would see it the same. How do I even approach this with them? I don't even know where to begin, but I have to deal with this because my masculine life is an anchor tied to my foot. I'm drowning.

I guess I'm just looking for advice or reassurance, how would you handle such a situation? Maybe some of you have, and I'd love to hear your story. All this feels like a time bomb. I need to defuse it before I go off."

I had to let him know because my whole family there knows and have been great, but he's the only one left. He basically said that if I had stayed in Hungary, this wouldn't have happened because in a liberal country such as this, one sneezes and they can get SRS immediately. :):). I couldn't help but laugh out loud at that comment. He then proceeded to ask why I even married my wife and I said I'm not sure I understand what that has to do with anything so I asked why lesbians marry women??? According to him it's because they are just bored and crave attention because being gay is a choice. We didn't really leave it on a bad note but I wanted to get as deep as possible before all of it becoming to comical as I have to visit in November. (I go every year) He's known about it for a long time, but of course treated it like it doesn't exist because that will make it go away. At first he claimed that such a thing doesn't really exist, than changed his view to just simply never having heard of it and I should just man up get through this. I'm not even upset because of his not accepting, I'm rather sad that someone I used to consider intelligent can be so narrow minded .

nmi987,asktransgender,Trying hormones helped me figure out that I don't want to be a full time woman,"DONT BE AFRAID TO TRY HRT

For anyone contemplating transitioning, I highly recommend trying hormones. It really helps clear things up. For the longest time, I was deftly afraid of them, because I thought I would get immediately addicted.

But I didn't get addicted. Instead, it made me doubt living as a woman. However, I am very happy trying them as they help me deal with things. 

One thing that DIDNT HAPPEN is that it didn't make me MORE sure. Instead, I would say I am at the same place, not being sure, or even being less sure.

For me, it did not make me sure that I wanted to live as a woman. I love dressing and the transformation of male to female, it's the ""living full time as a woman"" thing that I am not sure is for me.

 Although I might continue taking a low dose just to be a little more feminine. "

misskb82,asktransgender,Virtually no hormone response.,"So after 2.5 years of HRT I've had almost no development, breast or otherwise and not sure what to do. I pass due to having had ffs but my body is not feminine / womanly at all. 

I have had significant muscle loss which I'm guessing is due to anti androgens. But fat redistribution and breast growth is nil. Judging by my mother is expect at least a B or C, but I'm not even an A. I only wear a bra to make me feel better and to simulate some shape, otherwise I'm completely flat chested.  I know people who are decades older than me who've had much more response, and they started later. 

I've seemingly had no hip, ass or thigh redistribution either.

Kinda feels like a huge waste of time taking hormones. I know I can get a breast augmentation if I manage to raise the money but I've heard that for them to look natural it's best to have some shape to begin with. Plus it doesn't solve any other areas.

Opal-,asktransgender,"Anybody with a Medical or Nursing background, I have a few questions and would love some help.","Okay, I have a few questions when it comes to name changes. As a quick background, I'm amab, I've worked in CNA for about 2 years now, and will be moving in a few months, and planning on trying to present as female or gender neutral. My questions are how would I go about updating my CNA license or any future licenses (like HHA EKG cert) with the correct name, once I'm confident enough to go through with a name change. What were the steps you took; did you have to change your Drivers License, Social, or birth certificate first, before going through the process?  What resources could you recommend? (This is in California if that helps)

Also, not relating to name changes, what was it like coming out in the medical field? I've read bad things about it maybe sometime last year, but would like a fresh perspective, and lastly how do you go about talking to new employers in the medical field that you're trans, especially due to ""list previous names"" portion in applications.

TL;DR: I need a lot of help when it comes to looking for work in the medical field."
jacknettle,asktransgender,Came out to my grandma,"(And subsequently my grandpa and aunt)

I tend to slowly introduce a concept before dropping anything on people.. in this case I said: ""I'm going to be changing my name ... ... ... because I'm transitioning.""

She teared up a bit, had a few questions. I think she's dealing the loss of a grandson, but hey I'm a kick ass granddaughter!

My favorite lines of hers being: ""The whole family knew"" (I guess the whole boobs thing gave me away), ""I won't cut you out in any way"", ""There was so many times I thought you looked like a girl"", and ""I accept you"". :')

So yay, only my dad to come out to... I changed my name on facebook over the weekend, I'm waiting for him to notice lol"
FavoriteColourGreen,asktransgender,Ftm- in love(or something),"So there is this girl that I suddenly feel things for but she's part of a company that I really enjoy and I don't wanna screw things up.

She seems to be into open relationships but she says she is strait (and I don't pass) and I always fall in love pretty hard and have difficulty with being in open relationships... But yeah, I guess what I am asking is , to act upon my crush or not? Any suggestions? "
Nataliesu,asktransgender,Did anyone else obsess over their perceived masculinity (or femininity) before accepting they were trans?,"For the longest time before I came out to myself, I obsessed over my own perceived masculinity. I lifted weights because I felt ashamed of being skinny, tried (and failed) to grow facial hair, read PUA blogs (yeah, I know...) to learn how to be ""alpha,"" and was an all-around shitbird. It got so bad that I developed a serious inferiority complex and felt worthless around men and constantly tormented myself for not living up to traditional standards of masculinity. Of course, it all came crashing down, thank god. Did anyone else have a similar experience? "
AWhiteKnight123,asktransgender,What's the point?,"I don't know what to do right now. Just a couple of days ago I got to get all dressed up and wear makeup for the first time and it felt amazing. I broke up with my cheating ass boyfriend last week and I felt great after that too. But right now I want to die. I just want to be gone. I don't deserve life. I can't transition for a long time. I found out last night the person I really, really wanted to be with doesn't want to be in a relationship right now. I fuck up everything. I drive everyone away from me. I just don't know what the point is anymore. I am a shitty writer, when thats what I want to do with my life. I don't deserve the people who I do have. I am terrified."
theamazinhazen,asktransgender,Coming Out at Work,"Hey everyone, 
        So, it my current job, I'm totally out, using my name and pronouns. A friend of mine offered me a place to stay for $500 a month, but I'd have to move in November 1 and my name will not legally be changed until November 15. Her place is an hour and a half away from where I live, so I need to find a job down there. Is there a way to prepare a potential employer that I'm trans while still having my deadname be my legal name and not hurting my employment chances. 

Also, I know there are anti-discrimination laws in New Jersey, but I can't help but worry that being trans would still hurt my chances. "
MechaMaya,asktransgender,Addicted to dysphoria and the depression caused by it?,"So a few weeks ago when I first created this account I was at the lowest point in my depression yet. I finally grew desperate enough to call out for advice and try to accept who I was. The dysphoria had reached its point where I couldn't suppress it any further.

However, since then, I've been climbing out of that slump, and the depression has more or less cleared. I still feel the dysphoria but it's back down to the levels it was at years ago.

And yet... for some fucked up reason a part of me misses the way I felt in my depression. I miss the emotions I felt during my anxiety attacks, as though it was the first time in years that I've felt alive. I know I don't want another anxiety attack, because it's a horrible experience, but I feel so emotionally vacant right now, as I have for most of my life.

What the fuck is this? Why would I long for such a horrible experience again? Does this say anything about my dysphoria?"
GarbageKnapp,asktransgender,"hs student, thinking abt transition but wanna try estrogen, antiandrogen, or puberty blockers,or other suggestions","hello all, im a nb (amab) 17 year old, i cant do hrt, dont have the $ or parents approval for it, looking to make my body more ""feminine"" (smoother skin, faster hair growth, fuller hips/legs, more sensitive u know what, etc)

currently im working on a good diet/exercise but i wanna try something to kinda help me out in terms of estrogen

throwaway160619,asktransgender,started dating..... does it get easier?? need advice =(,"so, just out of a long term relationship with a girl who was with me for the beginning of my transition (I'm MtF)... my ex actually cheated on me and kinda left me feeling dejected and unwanted... so i've been trying to get on dating apps and see whats out there...

i've self identified as pansexual since before transitioning.. but i'd only dated women (including 2 trans girls) but was interested to see what being with a guy is like...

anyway, so, i found a guy who was cool with me being trans, and we fooled around a bit, but i didn't feel the same.. (it didn't help that i was still thinking about my ex while we were fooling around, but i digress)

i loved being with this guy, and making out with him. i like how he makes me feel, but the sexual stuff just didn't ""lite me up"", ya know?

so, continuing my pursuits, i've been met with quite a range of reactions when the person i'm talking to finds out i'm trans (because i guess they skipped that part of my profile where i make it very clear so as to avoid this baloney) 

so fast forward to today, and i'm feeling like shit.. wishing i could find a nice gay woman who doesn't mind her woman having a penis... or figuring out what kind of many does/would turn me on w/o subjecting myself to harsh bigotry or sex crazed chasers.. i want to find something more meaningful and build a connection..... like i had.... 

does it get easier?

i know i'm still early in my transition (started hrt in april 2016) so i've got a lot more ""growing"" to do.. 

am i supposed to wait until hrt has had more effect before ""getting back out there""? 

any dating advice for a (mostly) gay, (questioning pan) mtf trans woman early in their transition?"
crossdresserJ,asktransgender,How did y'all know for sure that you are transgender?,"Hello, I've been questioning my sexuality a lot more recently, and what was it that definitively made you know that you wanted to transition? 
I've always been the typical straight guy on the outside, but since I was little I've always been jealous of my sisters and their femininity. I love wearing women's clothes whenever I have the chance, and expressing my feminine self, but it's always been in private and I've never even considered telling anyone. 
I just don't really have anyone to open up to about this, and it's something that I thought I would grow out of, but I find myself wanting it to be a bigger part of my life sometimes."
ShhhhhSecretSquirrel,asktransgender,Sublingual/Progesterone/Patches?,"So, I just got back from reviewing my labs with my endo, and some things were discussed about medications. I've been taking 4mg orally of estradiol daily (upped to 6 today) and have hit somewhat of a developmental roadblock, so I brought up today taking micronized estradiol (think I'm taking this already, small oval blue pills with a b and 887-2 on the other side?) sublingually and whether or not doing so might have more of an effect. 
She contacted a colleague about this and another matter which I'll bring up soon, and basically said that based on the guidelines she's going by and what her colleague said, it's not really touched on and there's not much evidence supporting either side, so if I can provide some supporting documentation to convince her she said she's very open to the idea. I recently read this article 
http://transascity.org/sublingual-versus-oral-estrogen/
which I did bring up with her and she seemed very interested in it.

I also brought up wanting to add progesterone to my regimen, but she wasn't too familiar with this either and again said that since there wasn't much evidence supporting either side, if we can find some information that would make her believe it would benefit me she would be open to it too.
Since I'm getting most of my information from other trans women in subreddits and what articles I can find, I was wondering if anyone might be able to throw me some info or links to articles with some sources that I could send her to back up my case?
She also suggested putting me on trans dermal patches in a few months should I still be having trouble. I was wondering if anyone whose used this delivery method could shed some light on how they felt it affected them as opposed to taking tablets, and if they would recommend?

TL/DR
Trying to find information/links supporting taking estradiol sublingually and progesterone, and how are trans dermal patches?"
Boob-a-saurus-Rex,asktransgender,How do I know If laser hair removal is working?,"So I've only had one session like 2 or 3 weeks ago. But I feel like it's working. There's little bald spots all over. When ever I scratch my beard hairs fall out. When I lightly pull on them the come out very easily. 

I also have Alopecia of the beard though so I dunno which is which. Lol. It's probably the LHR. B/c it didn't happen at this rate before. But I just want to double check so I am not deluding myself."
Rayne2016,asktransgender,"Please help me come out, especially to my adult children!","So, I'm really needing help with coming out..... 

I'm out (MTF) only to my wife, (she's known for 19 or so years) who has always been both accepting and supportive, and was somewhat out to my late mother.
 
(who was far less than supportive of my gender identity, to say the least; she made sure to ""fix"" me when I was a small boy- I was very effeminate as a child and would dress myself as a girl from somewhere around preschool age.... So, I've Been ""this way"" as far back as I can remember- and hiding it for decades too.)

My wife and I have discussed my likely need to transition, and will be remaining a married couple should I chose to go forward.  I Have been on full dose HRT in the past, more than once, for a year at a time or so, without a hiccup in our marriage, so I'm pretty sure we'd be fine there.

I'm in my early 40's now, and have very little family left on this earth to come out to - sadly, many have passed on in the last few years. 

Really,  all that's left is a brother who is mostly estranged from the family, (we probably won't talk for a year or so from now) and my own adult children; and my wife's family, that is fairly large and also pretty religious, and although there is a cousin that is FTM and out on her side, I don't think they would approve, especially of our marriage continuing. 

They have never obliged him with correct pronouns, and have generally been disrespectful of his gender identity...

(As an aside, I'm not even out to him, although we are ""friends"", he's forward and boisterous, and I think he would likely out me to everyone we know....""just helping you out because you're too chicken shit"" kind of a thing.

The biggest roadblock to my transition though, is that I've never been able to come out to the outside world, or to my children; although I've tried before, I just cannot get enough nerve to talk to the kids about it. 

And - they are now 24 M, and  23, and 21 F. 

My son would be the toughest since he's kind of a ""tough guy, mans man, quasi-homophobic type"" I don't know how he'd react.. (We do have gay friends and wifes cousin that we are pretty close too, and he's friendly to and accepting of all of them.... Just not sure he could rationalize his dad as a transgender person, mostly I think. 

My daughters, would be mostly accepting, we think, but they both have fiancées that certainly would not.

We also still don't have an empty nest- both my son, and my youngest daughter and her SO live with us, so that might be really uncomfortable all around.

I'm really feeling like I can no longer repress my identity, but am honestly so afraid of losing my kids.... I don't want to alienate them... I know this should have been dealt with years ago.... But alas, here we are.

I have a Drs appointment tomorrow morning, (with Kaiser, northern California) and am trying hard to get the courage together to discuss my transgender issues with him... And ask for a referral to the Kaiser gender program.... Never seen this doc before, either.... 

Also, should mention that I failed miserably to come out to a therapist already....so that's another story altogether 

Thanks for your input

thegreatviceroy,asktransgender,Dating pre-op: is there any point in even trying?,"In advance: I'm sorry if any of this comes out wrong, I'm just feeling helpless and so this is a semi-rant. If it matters: I'm MtF, attracted to women - I'll soon be starting HRT, and I hope to get SRS as soon as I can, but that will probably be in approx. 2 years, considering the health care system here.

Till SRS happens, I don't know what to do about my sex/love life. I'm slowly coming out to people and beginning my transition. I am not going to be attractive to straight women because, well, I'm transitioning. Equally I will probably not be attractive to the vast majority of lesbian women because I've got the wrong stuff down there. Bisexual women - well, I don't know. Again there's this odd feeling that because I'm in this in between stage, I won't really be desirable.

I'm not claiming that everyone falls into those three categories - of course there are some, if not many, people who like people regardless of what combination of genitalia &amp; gender identity they may have. I'm not claiming either that those three categories are tied to genitalia alone. I am also not claiming that transitioning people are unattractive, but rather that, as I see it, we have it pretty bad when it comes to getting successful dates. 

So yes, it seems the proportion of people who would date a transitioning person feels very small. Could be wrong, that's just my inexperienced viewpoint. And heck, I don't even know what I'm supposed to present myself as on dating sites. Can I say I'm a woman? Can I say I'm a lesbian? Should I have ""MtF"" plastered on every one of my dating profiles?

I'm torn between wanting to get out there, or keeping to myself till I get SRS, to avoid getting rejecting by almost everyone and feeling even more shit. I am sure there are lots of success stories out there, but I'm more interested in  realistic idea of what I can expect, if anyone can offer that."

Now I'm older I realize this could be gender dysphoria and a sign that I might be transgender, but I don't have this definite feeling of ""I am transgender"" I often hear many people talk about. How could I help myself discover and explore this?

The one big thing I'm afraid of is boobs. That probably sounds odd/silly. I *am* looking forward to my face being more feminine, reducing hair growth, and in the long run I really want to get SRS too. But the idea of having boobs terrifies me.

It's making me very uncomfortable to hear people say nice things, and that just seems really dumb. I just don't believe what people are saying...

yuuzhanvonged,asktransgender,How do I come out to others correctly and efficiently?,"   Okay, so a lot of you have come out in some form or another. I would really, really appreciate an analysis of my situation. I’m trying to come out to people in an expansionary model to my parents. 

What that means is I first go to someone I know will accept me and has no influence over my life, then someone slightly more (statistically) to have adverse opinions or more influence and so on. I feel this model works because it helps reinforce that this ""thing"" is really happening and helps secure natural allies. This ends with my sister and finally, my dad and mom. I doubt they will initially accept me (Roman-Catholic, conservative, quick to anger, my dad is voting for trump etc), but I figured that given my initial plan was to move to a European country and never inform anyone, any modicum of support would be better. To give more clarity to what up to this point has been caricature, my father does see reason after getting angry and I still love him. 

* Should I change my approach, my goal of telling my parents ? 

I am very paranoid atm and would appreciate a fresh perspective (other pertinent details 23, in college, mtf).
 
Also I have another problem around the topic of coming out. I tried coming out to a friend from school that I really respect. I chickened out and we talked about books we were reading instead. I have found (only one test case so far so….) it is a lot easier to tell someone that is active in LGBTQ and that you don’t look to as a role model. I admire a lot of women and I feel irrationally guilty about telling them about my desire to be a woman/transition etc. (damn! I’m using etc wayyy too much).

* How do I cope with this irrationality? 

Also I’m toying with the idea of a paper copy of what I’m going to say so that if I am not for some reason loquacious, I can use it as a guide or give it to them to read. 

* Is giving alternative media for the discussion a good idea? 

Potentially losing family members and friends makes me scared and when I get scared I over-analyze.

https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4vx9ab/new_t_levels_after_1_month_hrt/
Anyways, I saw my doctor today to get my blood test results back.
When I started HRT my Testosterone levels were 37.6 nmol/L
1 month mark 27.4 nmol/L
2 month mark 11.0 nmol/L
Do any of you know if this is a good result for the 2 month mark?
My doctor upped my dosage to 6mg progynova instead of 4 but I'm still taking 100mg spiractin
I havnt had any breast growth yet so hopefully something happens soon. "
MadeOfMesses,asktransgender,Running out of time?,"I've been a lurker here for a minute now. Posting feels a bit awkward. I realized I was trans several days ago. At first it felt like a heavy weight was lifted, but a host of new problems hit me like a ton of bricks. Three come to mind right now: I have no one to confide in, I'd bet a spot in heaven that my family is gonna disown me swiftly and surely (which would be manageable if I was stable on my own- but I'm not.), but most of all I feel like I'm running out of time. I'm 21 and I've gathered that bones usually set by the time your 23. I want to start HRT as soon as I can. I would gladly pay monthly whatever I would need to to make it happen. But that's the other thing. I literally have no idea what I'm doing.

None.

I feel like a kid who lost their mom in Costco.

I didn't even know what SRS stood for until yesterday- like I literally know jack shit about any of this. I would like to learn, but I feel like I have no time. I feel like I need to start HRT immediately, but I don't know where I'd find/get some. I'm scared my family will find out before I'm stable and kick me out before I'm ready. I'm scared I'll miss my window of opportunity. I'm angry at myself and the situation. I'm jealous of the people who've already started.

So that's kind of where I'm at. I guess I'd like to know how can I start HRT in the south, in Georgia. I'd also like some tips on how to hide it from my family. "

heartshapedgrave,asktransgender,pilonidal cyst,"So ye, I have had that for some time now but my genius self decided I should just wait and not tell anyone hoping it would go away. So here we are two and a half years later and im gonna get that shit surgically removed.
Doctor said it's nothing big but it is about 5 cm and im afraid it will leave an ugly scar..

Im not gonna lie,im afraid when I have sex the guy is gonna notice that and be disgusted. Has anyone had that surgery? Did it leave a scar? It will be so hard to afford but we were thinking that we should let the doctor who examined me to do the operation but he works at a private hospital and thats why it would cost. I guess I kinda expect him to do a better job than regular doctors but maybe im wrong..

Newbie0482,asktransgender,"[NSFW] My masculine body shape is really getting to me (Shoulders, Hips, Belly, Thighs, Buttetc) Any advice?","I'm 19 and I started HRT a few weeks after I turned 18, been on it for around 1 year 8 months now. My face passes very well but my body does not. 

I'm 5'9 140lbs and I don't have much fat on my body other than my belly. HRT has made me gain some weight and it's all gone to it. I notice that the whole shape of the area looks masculine, like where the belly connects to pubic area etc. I'm not fat and it's not very big, but it just looks masculine. I don't mind fat, I care that it looks masculine.

Next is my butt, hips and thighs, they all look super masculine. I took some pictures of myself naked etc just so I could get a better look at myself. Everything basically below my shoulders just looks male. My hips aren't very wide and my butt just looks like a guys. All this is making me super super uncomfortable with my body, especially after this long on HRT.

So I don't know what I'm looking for advice on really... I would love to fix these things and I realise people will say exercise, squats etc. But the thing is, I feel like that will only do so much. I feel like my bone structure is what is at fault here and that can't be changed. So maybe I'm looking more for advice on just accepting it rather than fixing it?

Reason this is worrying me so much right now is I've been seeing a guy for a few weeks now. We really like each other and we both want to be able to get more intimate but I simply can't. I'm too uncomfortable with my body to be seen naked or in revealing clothing. I rely on clothes to make these things invisible but they are still there underneath. I'm worried we will break up because I'm too uncomfortable with myself.  "

[deleted],asktransgender,Clarity,"I hope this is a good place for this. 

I'm 28. I've been watching sissy hypno off and on, and sometimes obsessively for about 4 years.


It feels good to fantasize about being girly/ a girl and having such validation and attention from strong males. I also, oddly, like the humiliation aspect, although I try not to indulge it much out of fear that I'll get sucked in.


I'm not overtly masculine, but more masculine than feminine. I do hav a small chin and soft skin. I'm 6'2, 175 lbs and I weight train.


I've always been self conscious about my 6"", slightly slimmer than average penis, especially having watched porn my whole life. I also have a slight lisp that sounds geeky. I try to mask it sometimes.


The prospect of being girly is enticing. The thought of moving away and restarting as a girl is a thought that I don't like to indulge out of worry that I would get lost in it.


I was bullied as a child and probably emasculated at times. Sometimes I worry that my masculinity is too fragile. My masculine ex-boss once said to another employee ""Name just can't keep his tongue in his mouth."" I have no idea where it came from. It was random.mit was awkward. He said this in front of female coworkers. I kind of like it in weird ways when I think about it. But I feel that that may be indulging something unhealthy.


When I stop porn and stop indulging the sissy thoughts,mind I feel awesome. I got a gf about 3 months at after giving up porn... But I got back into it and back into the sissy thoughts. I can tell the insecurity has effected my relationships subtly.


I think, deep down, I want to let all of this go and focus on my goals. But there is a small part of me that wants to indulge this darkness. Right now I'm sick with a fever and around 5 am,mi was just rubbing myself and squirming thinking about a big, manly cock..... Even though I've never been with a guy.


I feel like people can see this in me when I look them in the eyes. I think I'm stopping today. Does anyone have any advice for me?
Thank you."
transwife,asktransgender,Struggling with Belly Weight Gain - How do you handle?,"Me - HRT for 12 years, SRS 4 years ago. 
Ever since a bout with a mild eating disorder in my teens I've been pretty active and have remained slim-ish. My weight is on the higher end of normal BMI but because I lack big hips everyone thinks of me as a thin person. Unfortunately when I gain weight , even after so many years on HRT and SRS it goes to my belly first of all (then thighs, arms and legs, and at the tail end my butt and Boobs) . This leads to me being asked if I'm pregnant constantly - like at least a few times a month. And it Severly limits my wardrobe to items with very defined waists.  

It wasn't so bad until my metabolism took a nose dive at 30 and I got into my first serious relationship with my now husband and I gained 10 pounds. Currently I'm 5'8.5 and weigh 158, though recently he average has been more 162.

I wonder do others struggle with this? Anyone have success managing it? "

GabiCap,asktransgender,"Having to ""remind"" myself after accepting I'm trans because I don't feel like a girl","As of right now, I am accepting (or thinking of accepting) that I am a transgender girl. Typing that was a little emotional.

Anyways, after some thinking and realizing while I don't have dysphoria, is it really normal for cis-men to want to be a woman? Is it normal for a cis-man to think ""After I lose all the weight I've been dying to lose, I still won't have *that* body and curves.""

So I decided to accept I'm trans. But the problem is I don't feel like a woman. While I'm not masculine, I am also not feminine (though I'd like to be). I'm messy, and hairy, and have a deep voice. My fashion isn't the best and my place looks like a sloppy guy lives there.

Not to mention, I feel like I have to remind myself I'm not a cis-man because that's what I've seen in the mirror and that's what I've been conditioned to be. And my attitudes are that of a cis-man.

So I keep on reminding myself until the thought sticks... and hopefully it'll make me change because I'm not perfect and **IF** I transition, I don't want to mess it up and want to do all I can to be the girl I know is possible.

Does any of this make sense? Am I overthinking it? 

I just still have doubts and don't think I can do this and just delaying the realization. It's gonna be hard changing my flare."

dsm-vi,asktransgender,thermolysis vs laser vs a combination?,"hey all! 

i have been getting electrolysis since beginning my transition almost weekly for two hours a session (so i've had between 40 and 50 hours of work so far) which has made an obvious dent, but has cost me quite a bit of money and i am on a limited income. the last session i went to hurt so much i almost asked her to stop. i am not sure if my skin was just sensitive or what, but i've scheduled a consult with a laser clinic. this means a total of six weeks without any electro (we're at two weeks today so one more month from now).

i already understand that laser doesn't count as permanent hair removal, but rather reduction. the thing is that with a groupon price i would get six sessions for $400 whereas each session of electro costs me $100. It seems as though the six sessions of laser would make more of a dent than six sessions of electro. for reference, this clinic uses the candela laser system.

does anybody else have experience with undergoing some laser and then resuming electrolysis to finish up the work? it seems like it will save me money and make things move much more quickly. there is a lot of conflicting information online.

thanks so much in advance!!"
ladyinwaitington,asktransgender,So my dad thinks I am trans because I was raped.,"Hi all. So I have been out to my family for about two years at this point now. And while tentatively supportive they say alot of fucked up shit. Getting mad at me in return when I have to correct them on names and pronouns (almost every time they fuck it up, they say they are ""trying"" but I'm not quite sure how real their efforts are). Talking about how all the ways I am different from a ""real"" girl. Problably one of the most infuriating things they do is get all sad about my infertility. Then take their anger about that on me, telling me it was my choice to do that and destroy my body. Telling me about how my futurative adopted kids are going to be held on a lesser status to whatever fuckballs that drop out of their vaj's (apologies to my future niblings), talking about how it's not going to be the same as being a real parent.  

None of that shit though compares the the sincerely held belief of my father that the reason I am transgender is because I was raped as a child. Both my brother and a close family friend raped me as a child. Neither knew about each other. My brother raped me from ages 5-14 and the former family friend from ages 12-14.  I have resolved many of the issues that i can with this. I had been in therapy over this for years and years, and consider myself mostly (as much as I can be) past it.I cannot comprehend the link that exists in his brain to make this connection. It hurts me most because I know that he ultimately sees me as damaged goods. How can I breech this topic with him and change his thinking?

Since I was fairly ""masculine"" growing up (whatever the fuck that means) I played with trucks (because trucks are dope obvi) played sports (because I was forced to be the good little hetero boy after they found out my brother is gay) they are fully convinced that someone or something came along to corrupt my ""fragile"" little mind to make me think I was a girl. When I first came out they asked if my then girlfriend wanted to be a man and if that was the reason I was doing this. Then it was because I had known some trans people had caused me to be trans. Then it was you. Well not you the person reading this, but the people on the internet had gotten to me and told my naive little mind that I was a girl and I had foolishly believed y'all. 

The fact that my family firmly believes that whether it was some doctor who didn't know what he was doing or it was some pedophile or it was the internet that ""turned"" me, is incredibly hurtful. It completely eliminates my own agency as a grown human being to know what is best for myself, while completely erasing all and any signs of my femininity that I wasn't able to manage. This line of thinking is killing me. I know they look at me with pity. I know they would give ANYTHING to make me detransition. I just don't know how to speak to them about this.

yellowlamponadesk,asktransgender,Getting T under 18 with only one parent approval planned parent hood california,"I have been wanting to start T for a very long time and the idea of waiting yet another year is insanely hard. The doctors at kaiser are extremely open and have wanted to get me on T but they simply cant because only one parent will not consent and have joint custody.
I am not seeing my dad at all even though he has custody of me and the court refused to change the custody order even when I, the child, showed up to court.

I have become super desperate and finally found hope. Planned ParentHood in Santa Cruz will do hormone treatment for minors even if one parent does not agree and you have joint custody. It sounds to good to be true. I have not gone yet but I have called them multiple times to ask if I can really start with my dad not wanting me too and still having joint legal custody over me, they said yes but my mom must be there. I cant wait to start.

AriadnesString,asktransgender,FFS: Facial Team or Dr. Spiegel?,"Hey everyone!  After a few months of doing research I've finally decided to do FFS with either Spiegel or the Facial Team but I'm having trouble deciding which one to go with.  I've consulted with both and am really impressed with their results but can't for the life of me decide who to book with.  I'm getting my nose, chin/jaw, and forehead done with either a hair transplant (Facial team) or a scalp advancement (Spiegel).  Facial Team is around 10k USD cheaper not including airfare or lodging (which would be more expensive since I could drive to Spiegel and stay with relatives in Boston) but I'm a little bit worried that the surgery wouldn't be as dramatic as I would like, and the idea of having a bald spot on the back of my head from the hair transplant freaks me out a little bit, but over all I think that their results are just as good.

curbpainter,asktransgender,So what do you do when your dysphoria doesn't justify transition?,"I'm sure this is not the first time this has come across in this sub, however my insecurities and self doubt are intense enough that I spend quite a lot of time reading this and other trans related subs. 

I can safely say I'm somewhere in the transgender spectrum (22 y.o. male), and that I'd rather be a woman. For a long time, I discarded this as simply autogynephilia -which apparently holds little to no scientific value- so I'm left with no choice but to embrace the dissonance between my biological body and my gender identity, as mild as it might be. That said, I feel like this isn't causing nowhere near enough distress in my life to overcome the negative effects that transitioning would carry with it, such as losing cis privilege, health concerns and uncertain results. I can see myself being happy as a man too. Sure, in a perfect world where you can just become a cis woman with no side effects I'd certainly transition, but such a perfect world doesn't in fact exist and this is merely a mental exercise that omits the real struggle one has to go through. After thinking about it thoroughly for the past few months I concluded that transitioning would make my life worse and the cons would have a clear edge over the pro(s). 

So I'm deciding to live as cis, but I still have doubts. I can see how someone could begin with a similar view and then eventually lean towards transition (?). What are some tips I can follow to further explore my identity? What made you decide you wanted hormones, for example? To be honest, I don't see my dysphoria really growing out of control in the future but I'd like to sort my feelings out anyway. Thank you. "

twasanotherthrowaway,asktransgender,I feel trapped between masculinity and femininity.,"I don't know where to start, but maybe you'll have some advice for me. You never know unless you ask.

The thing is that I feel trapped. I'm woking up at the morning, taking a shower, drying my hair (which takes me about a 30 minutes to do so, lol) and looking in the mirror. What I see there is an extremely masculine face (but it actually depends on the day), very feminine body, but with a breasts like a mosquito bites and an Adam apple.

My hair is blonde, bra-strap length and it's very well preserved. My friends (cis female) were jealous. And my voice is kinda... okay I think. It still cracks, but I'm using it on a daily basis, and I sing too because it makes progress much much faster.

And as you may guess, my typical outfit are either my work uniform that's the same for everyone, or a simple T-shirt, jeans (black or crimson), and converse shoes. Very androgynous and simple.

Everyone's saying I'm doing great for a 3,5 months HRT (and a month without estrogen, only cypro). But I'm still being seen as male (and no, manners aren't a problem, I always used feminine ones, like a walking with a hips and stuff like that). It's just my face I think, and I don't know if I won't need FFS to pass. We'll see, but it's so expensive that I hope to avoid.

So I'm sick of being seen as a boy/guy or whatever, but not yet ready and passing to be seen as a girl/woman. In fact, most of time people see me as a boy, but sometimes they see me as a girl for some reason, and I'm getting really nervous because i don't know how to react. I even had weird situation today, there was an LGBT event in my town and when I was going to shop, I saw a drag queen (for the first time in my life) next to the bar where it was hosted. I walked really close to this person (wearing a heels, was about a head taller than me and I'm 5'8), talking with a friend on the phone and looked at their makeup (it was terrible btw). But they looked at me until I disappeared from the street so obliviously I got clocked. It was very weird experience and I would probably freak out if they talked to me then.

I don't know how to precisely describe it, but I wrote everything I know and feel right now. I'm sure that a lot of people here was in a place where I'm right now, so I'm asking for advice how to overcome it. Thanks in an advance! :)"
UnsilentPartner,asktransgender,To pluck or not to pluck?,"Hey! I'm in a situation where it's very difficult for me to save up money, so laser and electrolysis are kind of out of the picture for the foreseeable future. 

I'm currently taking spiro (almost 1.5 months) and finasteride (almost 3 months), and I'm noticing that a lot of my beard has turned blonde and parts appear to be thinning out/just vellus hair. I did pluck some of the thicker blonde hair when I first noticed it changing color, but I'm not sure if the plucking itself caused the hair to convert to vellus hair or not.

Does anyone know if the thicker blonde hairs will come back as vellus hairs from plucking? I had read about plucking being bad for future electrolysis (altering the root and making it less effective) so I haven't been keeping up with it. Plus it hurts like hell. But if I can get enough terminal hairs out of the picture, it'd make shaving easier and I'd have less that would need to be zapped in the future.

Goldilocks420,asktransgender,Question about circumcision and SRS with Suporn.,"Hey all. I'm going to schedule srs with Dr Suporn relatively soon and I'm unsure if in my circumstances a circumcision is good or bad or irrelevant. I'm 21 and have had a tight foreskin all my life, I didn't find out this wasn't normal til only like two years ago. I've tried all other possibilities but the problem persists and circumcision is the only way to solve it. I'm just unsure if solving it Is a good idea. On his site I think he says best results are when the patient is uncurcumcised. The head of my junk (under the foreskin) is very sensitive to the point if discomfort  and im wondering if that's going to cause issues post-op if i don't fix it now, that's probably a dumb worry but I'm a lil paranoid regardless. thanks :)"
lyaa55,asktransgender,ridiculous brainstorming: baby before we both start hrt,"So a few months ago I went on a few dates with a transmasculine person when I was thinking of myself as queer but not really on the right track re: thinking about my gender.  He moved to another city after suffering a transphobic attack shortly thereafter.

I recently started HRT and was trying to decide if I wanted to pause and pay to bank sperm.  I kind of lean towards ""my life is too chaotic right now and for the foreseeable future.  I don't know if I was fertile to begin with; I wouldn't be surprised if I were a lil intersex.  I would probably be happier to just adopt if/when I want kids, which could easily be &gt;10 yrs from now (after stored sperm goes bad).""

But anyway, a couple weeks after I started HRT, this person I had been dating posts on FB, saying they want to have a baby using a cryobank soon.  So I actually messaged him, like ""hey we can kill 2 birds with one stone.""  And he actually says he's totally interested.

Because he was initially just seeking a donor, and i'm not looking to raise a kid right now, I would like to be much closer to being a donor than a parent.  So I would be careful to establish expectations, navigate legal obligations, etc.  At the same time, what a ridiculous prospect to raise!  We'll see!  If nothing else, raising the idea initiated some thought experiments that make me think I really would feel good adopting if I decide to raise a kiddie myself when i'm ready. "

Imumybuddy,asktransgender,Really torn about going full time.,"So, I've been on HRT for just over a year, and I fail boy-mode occasionally despite dressing very metro and having a flat chest (think chapstick lesbian with no makeup).

I'm scared of going out and being clocked for my voice, or for poor makeup, or just for not passing and being harassed or called out for it, which is funny, because I live in one of the most accepting cities in the world.

someguynamedcole,asktransgender,[NSFW] Last night I had my first sexual encounter since starting HRT and now I'm confused.,"So for background I've been on T for 2 months and have been interested in exploring sex as a guy. My friend N (who is a queer woman) invited me to come to a kink/play party for LGBT PoC with her and her friend D. (We're all black). But before we left for the party D offered us some molly, of which I partook. 

I've been to two other play parties with N while I was pre-T and pre-coming out, just to try different things. At the first one I just had sex with a girl I met there, no kink involved. At the second one it just felt like a weird vibe since it was in a really cramped basement and was predominantly attended by middle-aged men, so I just drank and talked to some other attendees. Since I was raised super Christian, I only started having sex when I left home 2 years ago and am still trying to pin down exactly what I like. Obviously throwing T and transition into the mix makes it all the more complicated. 

So, by the time we get to the party me and D are approaching the peak of our rolls. We check out a demo of wax play done by a trans guy Dom/sub couple. At the end a few of us volunteered to have him drip wax on us. But the thing is, it actually felt nice, like I could understand why someone would want to incorporate that into their sex life. So I asked him to drip it on my back and I felt rather turned on by it. 

Later on in the night, D found a rope and offered to do rope bondage on me while N stood really close to me and rubbed my arms a bit. And again, it was weirdly satisfying physically and it turned me on a bit. Then I let a trans girl tie me up on the bed, face down. And there was something about it that felt really good, and it was unlike any other time I did something sexual with another person.

This is the first time I've been in a sexual situation while presenting as male. I'm out to N and D and introduced myself to people at the party using my new name and male pronouns. Also, every other time I've had sex it was always accompanied by dysphoria and I never actually experienced physical arousal. But I didn't feel dysphoric at all last night and it was the first time I've ever been aroused while being touched by another person. On the way home, N said she always knew I was a sub.

The thing is, I've never been interested in kink/s&amp;m stuff before. So, did I only enjoy those things because I was rolling on molly? Or was it because I was able to do it as a guy?

koopatroopa12,asktransgender,What tips do you have for a successful transition?,"Hi /r/asktransgender! It's my first post here, so what's up. I'm a 17 year old trans girl from Seattle about to start my senior year in HS, and I just took my first dose of estradiol yesterday! My school is amazing (all bathrooms are gender neutral, and there's a very supportive attitude in general), and my whole family has been very supportive. I'm out to most of my friends and some faculty, but I'm anxious to come out to the whole school. That's another problem though. 

I know I don't have to worry about getting badly harassed or abused at school or at home, or about getting kicked out of my house. But I'm actually worried that things have gone so smoothly so far that i won't be prepared for when things don't go so well. That my expectations are too high and I'll be very disappointed when changes are slow or I don't pass at first.

raphmer,asktransgender,"[MTF] transitioning teacher, stealth mode?","Hi there

So, I could be starting HRT very soon, if I want to.
What bothers me the most right now is the fact that I'll be a teacher in about a year, after I finish university this year, which means that I'll have to pass a 3 year trial in my country, where other teachers come to see me and I have to pass some tests, while teaching my own class.

Has anybody some experience about transgender teachers? I'll work in a public school, which means that my boss will be the national ministry. In other words, I can't imagine that they'll discriminate me, which doesn't mean that other teachers could cause me troubles.

My biggest problem is the trial period. I'm so afraid that somebody will try to kick me out, just for being trans. I'm so afraid that I'm really thinking about giving up and trying to live on as a man. Being a teacher has always been a dream and a real passion for me.

There are some days where I think that I should simply try it and see how it goes, on other days, like today, I'm depressed as can be. 

Would it even be possible to be on hormones for 3-4 years, until my trial period is over? Is it possible to hide it over such a long period?"

worldfallingdown,asktransgender,Advice for a cis lesbian going on first date with transwoman?,"I'm a cis lesbian woman going on a first date with a transwoman. I apologize if I'm infringing on a trans space, but I don't know any other trans people IRL that well.

I matched with a gorgeous woman on OkCupid, and in her profile she stated she was a recently divorced lesbian transwoman. Not that the superficial matters, but I would have never known she was trans without her specifically stating so.

I messaged her first, and right away we had a playful easygoing repertoire, and had been messaging frequently throughout the week keeping each other updated on little things throughout day, and the usual investigation into each other's food/music/movies/shows taste. I'm accustomed to making the first move, so I was pleasantly surprised that she asked me out first. To dinner at a local sushi joint; we both agreed to skip a movie because the cinema doesn't allow for much getting-to-know-you time.

I know I should approach this like any other date, but I'm more jittery than usual. It's okay she is recently divorced, she explained the situation to me, and while her sexuality hadn't changed after transition, her wife was straight and couldn't be in a relationship with someone who identified as a woman.

I think I am mostly intimidated because while she has experience in heterosexual dating when she presented male, I'm technically her first 'lesbian' date as well. I am also nervous because I'm Butch, used to dating more androgynous/genderqueers, but she is a high femme/lipstick type. I am honestly shocked she wanted to go out with me, she is so gorgeous!

I have a chivalrous nature when it comes to dating. I like to drive to pick women up, open doors, pay for meals, I know it may be old fashioned and gendered because I'm on the masculine side in appearance/dress. Do you think if I am my usual 'knight in shining armor' self it would be inappropriate during my date tonight, like she'll think I'm overcompensating?

And how much/how little should I compliment a femme woman's appearance? I want to appreciate her beauty, and effort she puts into her appearance, but without objectifying her like a horny frat boy (even though I am kind of one, on the inside, hehe). 

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this awkward rambling mess, and possibly soothe my woes. I think I am more nervous about her being so femme, than trans. :P"

I have been with the NHS for two years now, and nothing happened during those two years at all. I went to an appointment every few months and had a doctor write down notes as I spoke about how I was feeling and the like. At every single one of these appointments he usually asked me a few awkward questions and complained about me not presenting as a woman. I explained to him that I wanted to be on HRT before I started presenting as female. This was usually met with him saying that I wouldn't be treated, taken seriously yadda yadda yadda etc. So I made a choice and started wearing neutral stuff that most women I know wear (jeans and sweat shirts) and he still came out with the same shit, ""you look like a guy"", ""Hello [Deadname]"" and the like...

Zoequest,asktransgender,What the hell just happened to me after my first laser treatment?,"On my lunchbreak, today, I had my first experience with laser hair removal. I was an absolute wreck. 

Right before I went inside, I remember that my heart was beating a mile a minute from the mixture of anxiety and excitement of what was in store for me. I texted my therapist and took the plunge, for danger surely was just around the corner.

Nope, no danger really. James Bond wasn’t strapped to a table awaiting certain doom from a maniacal Goldfinger… there was just a nice girl named Amy. She noticed how nervous I was and guided me through the process of what was going to happen (certain death, shame, possibly both). I believe she also gave me a small education on the laser she was using and how the equipment worked, but I just kept hearing in my head, “Holy shit, she knows your trans. Don’t speak a word! Just nod politely and agree.”
   
So as the death shroud (goggles) were placed on me, I awaited the fiery kiss of the apocalypse beam...

It wasn’t that bad. It felt like I was being slapped repeatedly with rubber bands.

I hate my shame, guilt and anxiety. :-(

Yes, I used colorful language there, but I’ll be honest when I say that my heart was beating like crazy from both fear and happy possibility.

Anyway, the weird part of all this, (Yes, I swear I’m getting somewhere) was when I got back to work.
My office is nearly every day, a very high stress and chaotic atmosphere. Today was no exception.

However, unlike my environment, I was serene. Clear headed. I felt like my brain’s synapses were firing on all cylinders. Yeah, Neo didn’t have shit on me. It was almost intoxicating. I was like this until the end of the workday. 
Doing my best vampire impression, I dodged the sun as best I could and left work. As the fatigue set in when I got home, the feeling vanished.
   
As the title implies, what the hell happened to me? I’m curious if anyone else had an experience like this."

someone-someguy,asktransgender,Best friend made some comments I'm not sure how to respond to?,"My best friend, who has been very supportive of all my trans issues, said some stuff today and I really didn't know how to respond. He asserts it's wrong to marry someone if you know that you're trans. 

Like say George married Sally, and George had some dysphoria but thought marrying Sally would help to resolve his issues. But after being married for years George feels he needs to become Carol so Carol and Sally split since Sally isn't a lesbian. 

My friend would assert Carol was in the wrong for getting married when she knew that transitioning was a possibility. While I think Sally is fine for not wanting to be with a woman, I don't think what Carol did is wrong. How was she supposed to know that her dysphoria would worsen and not improve? I might agree with him that Carol should make it known that she feels that way, but he seems to think that you shouldn't get married at all if there's a possibility of transitions. I'm not sure about that and really I don't know how I feel about it.

He also feels that if you aren't open right off the bat in a relationship then you are lying. Say Carol after her divorce met Dave. He thinks Carol should be upfront with Dave about being trans. While I think that Carol should let Dave know, I don't think it should have to be on the first date or anything. Maybe I'm in the wrong, but I know how hard people work in order to go stealth, and I feel that coming out to every guy you date could lower your chances of new dates. 

Maybe I'm wrong though? What do you fine guys and gals think? 

By the way, I made the names up. If anyone has similar names it's just a coincidence. "

###

I am out to a couple of very good friends, and *cough* best friends. 30 now, and all my closest friends are doing one of these: 1) having a rock in career 2) having baby/babies 3) getting married 4) romantically in love 5) enjoying life happily.

Ironically, no very good friends or best friends want to deal with a guy who just a) divorced b) depressed c) mentally ill and unstable d) suicidal e) trans f) freak g) thinks he's a woman. You name it, the issues we are have a high risk with, I have 'em!

For those who aren't in the 1) 2) 3) 4) 5), they're probably struggling so hard to be able to put any attention anyway.

So it happens, my best friend apparently sent me off because ""your therapist will take care of you"", and no more messages. Last night I thought I'd clear things up and actually scold her why she'd not catch up on me even though she knows I'm suicidal, and she's just like ""I'm not your girlfriend. I have a life. My husband has a birthday. I have a childhood wedding to go.""... blah blah blah, and mentioned I'm the first to ever yell her - and that she should not be treated like this for not doing something (some people just don't realize not doing something is already an action itself, e.g. not helping out an injured in an accident.). That it is my fault that I did not scream for help, even though she already knew I'm suicidal - oops, my fault. Ironically, she has a psychology degree from a I think rather prestigious university in UK. Oops x2. The psychologist's got to be right, right? They got a degree! I don't, not in this field.

I can feel it when people are reluctant to comfort or to at least listen: ""sorry, raining"", ""sorry g2g"", ""sorry this phone call is coming in"", ""find you later, promised!"" (w/o follow up), ""you can talk to me"" (and then no response or super slow response).

I left my hometown for more than a decade now. It seems like I have few reasons to cross paths with them, and I have kept them on my facebook list due to ""keeping in touch"" or what ""common history"" we have.

Anyway, I figured for the reasons above, transition is my own battle, and no one will be able to help, and eventually we will have to deal with the obstacles ourselves, however many. I removed almost 400 people off my facebook friends list last night, many of them ex-GFs who didn't pick me (they'll surely ridicule and laugh like crazy that they didn't get together with this loser/abomination/freak), childhood friends who's sharing the same values of my friend, past very close friends (just time and they have families to busy with), relatives (fuck them, just go to hell), secondary sch friends, elementary sch friends, past colleagues in other continents... just removing most of them. I think, there's no way I want to meet them again, I'm just too tired and I do not have attention for them. Fuck off.

It's really hard for people who are not going through the pain to relate to being trans, and even if they do, none of them have superhuman empathy and tolerance. For those who are going through hardship, it's hard for them to spare any attention already. Everyone is damn busy and struggling in life. Why would I get any attention anyway?

So, for my situation, even though I just started HRT &lt;2 months, I already arrived to the conclusion that it's really my own battle to fight. It's unfortunate that it has come to this state, but this is the cards being dealt. I just wish I know who is the safest to unload to, but now after typing this, I realized it's different for everyone. But I guess, my answer to myself is... no one, not now. So, reddit, here you go, my last line of defense...

Still, who else should I talk to? Who do you talk to? ... Let's see if I'm the minority/outlier in this type of experience."

The-Real-Mario,asktransgender,I don't know if my attraction towards trans guys is objectifying them.,"I am a manly looking male, mid 20s, I have a somewhat ""agnostic"" approach to defining my sexuality, simply because if I define something it must be defined clearly and I think that sexuality (at least mine) is to complex to define so why bother and make things more complicated. Anyway, I am attracted to most women that you would expect a 24yo dude to be attracted to, I am attracted a lot to androginous girls, girls who could easily pass for guys, even for mistake. I have been attracted to a handful of men-from-birth in my life, perhaps 2 or 3. And then ( you probably already understand my perplexity) I am attracted to every cute trans guy I meet, with baby faces and puffy cheecks that make me wanna squeeze the daylights out of them, I do see them as guys, some times I catch my self saying stupid things like ""WOW your falsetto voice is amazing"" witouth even thinking.

But ya, I wonder if I am am attracted to them because they once where the kind of masculine girl I tend to like.

Time moved on- tick tick.  Every day I grew to know more and more people through posts of happiness, breakthroughs, sadness, and dramas untold.  Still having only just begun transition, I browse the few subs I call home and someone mentions being in a tinychat room.  ""I'm gonna do it.. I can do this..""  I fight my fear of being noticed, I'm feeling daring.  I join the room and see six people.

I watch their streaming webcams and read the silly banter- a few similar pathed individuals that shared the same trail.  I hesitantly text, and then text some more. Soon, I'm part of the conversation, not just a passerby- I've joined the caravan.  One by one, as night grows later, we journey off on our own.  But I stayed, elated to finally meet someone a little like me.  We chat for a little and I never tell her what I see in her.  She's much farther along the way.  I look up to her, I seek her attention in small bits, as strange as it is, I kind of want her to say ""it's fine- you're doing fine.""  

And she does.  She calms my nerves about the future, gives me a hint about salt and olive oil.  We smile and then I'm off to bed.

Tock, tock. 

Things happen- timelines switch tracks.  She begins to get distant from many of us.  We don't see it at first. But we notice - deep in the back of our mind.  Then, one day, I find myself thinking of her.  Hoping she's doing well, and yearning to show her what bit of progress has been made.  So I search.  My messages have a distinct lack of her presence.  The boards still whisper her name in few places, but the more the clock ticks, the harder it is to find her anywhere.

I know I spelled her name correctly.  But she's gone- moved on.  Her life has hit the next highway, one clear of the thorns and brambles we tread in the beginnings. 

I still miss her.  One day, I hope to hear from her again.  We all have that person- the one who taught us something deep without knowing it.  The one that you're happy has completed a journey of unimaginable scales, and yet, you're still a little sad you can't say high to them anymore.

Tell those people when you find them- tell them that you care and you appreciate their thoughts and encouragements. 

Time moves forward...are you going with it?

Goodnight, T.c."

Somewhat long time reader; first time poster. Mid-20s. Almost certainly MTF. I'm a Chicago resident, so Howard Brown informed consent and therapy is in the cards. Before anything medical, sperm banking just in case.

ephemeregalia,asktransgender,Admittedly ignorant. Seeking to understand.,"I tend to be of the mind that I don't have to understand a person's choice to respect it, so this is less about dispelling prejudice and more about looking for another perspective so I can better understand and explain to others.  I am a staunch supporter of LGBTQ rights and I want to be able to lend my voice in a more educated way to help move the dialogue I see to a more accepting place.  With that being said, and hopefully providing enough background on the intention behind my questions to avoid any tension created in sensitive areas of conversation, I would like to ask some questions.
 
As a man, I've never really felt like my gender was part of my identity.  I have no doubt that I've been treated differently for it, but I personally have never felt like it affected my personality beyond whatever hormones have influenced my mind on a level I'm not consciously aware of.  I've always been of the mind, that men and women are equally capable of whatever they set out to do and the only real difference between genders is the sociological impact of being raised/treated so differently by society.  (We are far from equal in treatment, but one in the same in capability.)
 
This is clearly not how everyone feels though.  Until recently, I thought of cross dressing as a cosmetic choice and didn't think much more of it.  If that's what you like, then go for it, ya know?  People should be free to do what makes them happy.  But I've been seeing people online talk about comfort and feeling out of place in conventional gender roles/garb/whatever.
 
I suppose my question is how you view gender and how it plays into your sense of identity or changes you as a person.  What changes for you, as you make your transition or as it's completed and you're able to present yourself the way that you've always wanted to?

Do those views extend to others?

Joafie,asktransgender,Do most people really never question their gender? Are they really just satisfied being the gender they were born as?,"It honestly blows my mind to think that most people don't have this internal turmoil relating to their gender. I've never been happy with how I was for as long as I can remember. I always wished I was a girl. It's all I've ever known. I honestly thought all guys didn't like being male and just stayed male because they were supposed to. I just couldn't wrap my head around why anybody would be satisfied being male. I mean obviously people do like being male because cis men and trans men exist, but I guess I just can't understand it because it's not me. Why do you like being male cis and trans men?"
pianistafj,asktransgender,"The love of my life is trans (mtf). I'm a hetero cis 33/M. As of 4-5 years together, it's apparently not going to work out. Does anyone have advice for a very confused cissy?","I've been a wreck for the last 12 months since we separated, and there is little to no chance of working things out.  I fell in love with her for who she is: a talented genius in her profession, a gamer and anime nerd, a stunning cook, and the kindest, gentlest person...perhaps on Earth.  However, it was mental health related issues and developments that led to our splitting up (HRT/past trauma and abuse/lack of therapy etc.), most of which I am just now beginning to comprehend.    

It's been six years since I've been with a cisgender woman.  I don't think I'm a chaser or have a fetish for trans men/women; yet, I would give anything and everything up to still be with her if that were possible, and that's coming from the heart.  After 12 months though I have to start moving on, and after writing an album and a lot of therapy I have my side of things under much better control.  I could definitely elaborate on her issues versus mine, but that's not why I'm posting.  Something has been on my mind recently...    

I am incredibly confused about how this has affected me, namely my sexuality.  I'm not swearing off cis women or anything, but I deeply and secretly hope the next woman I fall in love with is trans (mtf, pre- or post-SRS).  I wonder if there are some on the other side of this, too.  Suffice it to say, lately I have been feeling that no cis woman I've ever met truly appreciates what my ex and some of you may never get to have.  I would rather be with somebody that struggles and even redefines what it is to be a (badass) woman, than the 99% of cisgender binary robots that take that very struggle for granted.  Sorry for the confusion; please help me make sense out of all this.  Thank you."
Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,Are my doctors misinformed about the sexual effects of having an orchidectomy on trans women who are already on HRT? (NSFW),"I'm planning to one day get an orchi and trying to get as much info about it as possible, from patients who've had orchis, and from doctors.  But I keep getting told by doctors that orchies result in no erections, and from orchi patients that no, you can still get erections.

So far, I've had two doctors, my Endocrinologist and my Urologist, tell me that if I were to have an Orchidectomy, then afterwards I would be unable to have an erection.  This is at odds with what I hear from trans women who have had orchidectomies, who have so far said that compared to pre-orchi when they were taking an anti-androgen and estradiol, after having the orchi and stopping the anti-androgen, they haven't seen that much difference in their ability to achieve an erection.  It's basically the same as when they were pre-orchi and taking the anti-androgen.

My Endocrinologist told me that after having an Orchi, I would have NO Testosterone.  I mean, she's an Endocrinologist, for crying out loud.  In cis women, testosterone is produced by the ovaries and the adrenal glands.  I will never have ovaries, but I do have adrenal glands, so it seems unlikely that I would ever be at 0 T levels, which would be a problem requiring treatment for low T.

My T levels have dropped from 449 ng/dL to 26 ng/dL and my E levels have risen from 28.4pg/ml to 92.3pg/ml, but I can still have an erection when I want one, it just doesn't happen automatically anymore, it's strictly voluntary.

So why do doctors think that getting an orchi will lead to trans women being unable to get erections? Is it a defensive medicine thing, where they're telling me the worst-case scenario is the most likely scenario in order to keep from getting sued for malpractice? Are they just unfamiliar with transgender medicine in general, so they don't have enough experience to know that orchies don't actually result in an inability to achieve an erection? Or do orchies actually result in an inability to achieve an erection in transgender patients who had previously been on anti-androgens, it just happens in a minority of patients?

Sigh.  Why can't everybody tell me the same thing?"

footworshipper,asktransgender,Has anyone had a therapist or doctor make them have serious doubts about being transgender?,"Hi all! This sort of happened to me received after having to change therapists. My first therapist was amazing, I honestly looked forward to our monthly sessions. She was always very supportive, informative, and I never left one of her sessions doubting anything. But, sadly, she moved, and due to financial reasons I started going to a therapist within the military (something I tried to avoid for a long time). 

She's nice, and on certain topics I sincerely enjoy talking to her. But... she's made me have severe doubts. She's older, and a lot of her feedback is anecdotal. I understand she's trying to portray the risks, but most of her stories involve ""She made the decision to transition, but it destroyed her family,"" or, ""I read a study a few years back that 40-50% of people who transitioned regretted it, especially in regard to GRS/SRS"", and similar stories. Plus, when we do talk, she focuses more on things I don't see as relevant to my gender issues. Our first session consisted of her lecturing me on smoking (can't blame her, and I am trying to quit to start hormones) as well as the danger of pornography. She will also sit down and go, ""So, what are we talking about today?"" I'll say my piece, and it's often pretty involved, and I'll get a piece of advice back plus an anecdote, and then she'll go, ""Ok, what else?"" I understand she can't do all the work, but usually after her stories, I have no idea what to say. 

That was sort of ranty, and I apologize, but I needed to vent. I can't afford to pay out of pocket again, so I'm sort of stuck with her. Has anyone dealt with something like this before? How did you handle it? Any advice? Thank you!"
KatharineRugburn,asktransgender,"How Positive or Negative Are Your Experiences with Cis Gay, Lesbian, and Bi People? Both Online and Offline? Also, Rants and Anecdotes.","***TL;DR:*** **How much understanding or misunderstanding from cis queer people have you experienced offline and online? How often have you seen people change? If online transphobia is at, say, 100%, how much percentage have you experienced offline (even if it's higher)?**

**Intro**

I'm lonely. Honestly, I've so far had better experiences and more understanding from cis straight people than from gay, lesbian, and bi people. It seems even worse online, where trans men and trans women are portrayed by many LGB folk as having evil ulterior motives, being mentally ill, and being sexually/romantically disgusting. Makes me feel even lonelier.

I have hope that maybe the offline world is better, but I've only lived as my gender (female) since January and had been in Tennessee since coming out. I moved to Massachusetts after sexual assaults from people in the local LGBT community.

So how is it for you? What have been your positives and/or negatives with cis queer people, whether online or in real life? How much of the transphobia online carries over to your life. What have been your pleasant surprises?

*––Intro: Part 2 (Sorry)––*

Damn. I just read an old AfterEllen article with comments that make me feel any cis lesbian will see me as an ugly man promoting rape culture towards gay women (and trans men as gay women). I see people on [Zinnia Jones's channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ZJemptv/videos) channel who say, ""*I have no problem with trans people,* but you are literally a guy, and your tits are so small."" And an evil motherfucking video with 23,000 views, bashing Gigi Gorgeous for coming out lesbian. Comments included how ""he"" is only trans to snatch away gay women's hard work with rape-y male privilege.

Is it really that bad? I don't seem to run into this sort of stuff in real life, but I may be stealth (11 months HRT) now (not totally sure). Cis queer people act like they're walking on eggshells when I out myself. I get so discouraged at how people *really* view my gender, but I'm quite socially inexperienced. How much negativity or positivity do you receive in real life and online?

**My Experience: Cis Gay and Bi Men**

*––Online––*

I think I actually find more cis queer men being understanding online than in real life. I've seen gay men defending trans women's gender online, saying [Gigi, Princess Joules, Bailey Jay] is a woman so they're sexually off-limits, and they'd only date *men*. But this could be selective memory. Maybe not all those negative comments I read were from straight dudes.

I haven't seen many gay men talk about trans men online, though my trans male friend is always posting Facebook updates about gay men calling his genitals gross, ""woman parts,"" or saying ""I'm gay, so I don't date girls,"" despite him being years into testosterone.

*––Offline––*

Like, what the fuck. My common experience is cis gay men treat me relatively platonically at first, making gay girl jokes (something something fingernails turkey baster), etc. I'll get comfortable and say I'm trans. Then *they wanna fuuucckk me **so hard***. Makes me feel horrible, like I must look like a gay dude. Or if *gay men* only view me as male, then all cis straight people *definitely* do. Just activates my dysphoria to level 11.

Oh, yeah, cis gay guys love to tell me I'm basically ""one of the good one"" because I look ""real"" (last I checked, I'm not made out of styrofoam peanuts). They'll bash ""non-passing"" trans women as being ""old drag queens."" They'll say ""some of them have been on hormones for years and are just men still!"" without realizing whoever they're thinking of may have been *out* for years but not necessarily on hormones. I look [like this](http://i.imgur.com/zhAIZlV.jpg), but they tell me I look [like this](http://i2.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article7262458.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/FILM-STILLS-OF-BREAKFAST-AT-TIFFANYS-WITH-1961-ACCESSORIES-CIGARETTE-CIGARETTE-HOLDER-AUDREY-HEPBURN.jpg), and that trans women usually look [like this](http://pushfestival.ca/2015/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/YoungChristeene_byAustinYoung-675x450.jpg), expecting me not to be insulted because of their ""compliment."" They'll call trans women ""she"" or ""he"" depending on how ""passable"" these men think they are. Fucking fuckers.

They'll show their ""support"" by finding photos of themselves in wigs that [look like this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CmvC9vqUMAAZkFi.jpg)

I barely run into bi guys. My ex (a guy; I mistook my trans feelings to mean I was a gay guy) whom I'm still friends with had to be educated *a lot,* but really came around over the course of a year.

*––ADHD Jump-Off––*

Then there was one who said he dated men but was also a gynephile. ""I'm attracted to women and those who identify as women."" Yeah, why do you put ""those who identify as women"" into a separate category from women? He kept making ""women"" and ""trans women"" into two separate entities with other language usage too, though he was trying to be thoughtful (which I appreciate). Also told me I look like a ""biological female."" Like, bitch, these tits and this ass are growing out of me right now, *biologically*. Not to mention [my brain is biologically female](https://youtu.be/Erexuu8PTo8). So if my *brain* is, and that's where my consciousness is from, then that means...yeah, I'm a woman. Gawdammit.

Tried to get me to make out with him by making me feel bad that no other woman wanted to. Then turned to me and said, ""Yeah, right, like the lesbian's gonna kiss *me*"" before giving me puppy dog eyes. I made a guilty face. He slunk into his car, and I tried to break the tension by nervously acting cheerful, saying, ""Hey! Hormones have been making my downstairs mixup smell like pussy! I didn't expect that!"" I think that made things worse. He just mope-drove home, and I fucked on out in my handy dandy station wagon.

**My Experience: Cis Lesbians and Bi Women**

*––Online––*

Holy. Fwuk. Like, I can't take two steps into the Web without hearing complaints that trans women are ""men in dresses"" with male privilege who want to push their penises onto women who don't want it. That ""turning trans"" is a means of subjugating women. Like, if trans men are "" gender traitors,"" then why aren't trans women viewed as traitors to men instead of being *even more supposedly harmful than cis misogynistic dudes*? They also think hormones *don't do anything* and that trans women's vaginas smell like cis men's balls or that our bodies don't feminize *at all* unless we ""mutilate ourselves.""

Also, we supposedly already have male privilege, so now we want whatever queer women have built for themselves too. Not considering how trans women deal with the loss of *cis privilege* as well as being *sexually and violently oppressed by male privilege in addition.* Gawddammitsunofabitch. Like, even *before* hormones, I got the shit beat out of me 1–3 times a week for six years and raped till I bled from my ass, breasts, and genitals by *two cis queer women*. But I'm not painting all of *them* to be evil. Not even specifically butch lesbians, which both of my assaulters identified as. But oh yeah, I also have to deal with the usual stuff cis women go through in a male-dominant society *on top of that*. Except periods. Aren't I so lucky to be infertile and a woman with no vagina, the envy of all other women?

*––Offline––*

So it's not nearly as bad as online, though that's hard to do. It's also quite mixed. But all in all, cis lesbian and bi women *try* to be understanding in real life. However, they often *accidentally* let slip they view me as male or another gender altogether. But there have been genuinely thoughtful cisbians. And bi-cisxuals. I'm stupid.

Yeah, I've been rejected straight up for being trans, even if the cis girl was very interested before. The only cis lesbians so far that have accepted me thus far were my two rapists I mentioned earlier who made me bleed from all my intimate areas.

This is getting off-topic, but the rapes have made me desperate, wanting kind sex with cis women who see me as a woman, because I haven't had any since coming out as trans. But I've also been hit with the ""pushing my genitals onto lesbians"" spiel from mentioning this, which hurts so much to hear, especially in real life as a rape survivor. I'm just analyzing my own psychology and expressing my feelings, not making demands or planning to jump anyone's bones. When I told two cis lesbians of my last rape (on the night before the Pulse shootings), they asked to see a picture of my rapist. I pulled up her Facebook on one of their phones, and they both debated how hot she was. That just fucking hurts. I still grab my breasts when I think about how much she physically damaged them. I've been in counseling; people suggest that, thinking there's no way I'd still be fucked up if I'd gone to therapy already.

However, I've gotten feedback from three cis queer women, saying they would date either me or trans women in general. It was all from cis butch lesbians who were married or partnered. Honestly, I've had more acceptance from butch women than femme ones in real life. I don't know why that is. Maybe they were all just being nice, but it was encouraging, and I think they meant it (accidentally typo'd ""mean tit"").

A lot of cis women will use contradictory language. They'll say ""You're a woman"" but also compare me to ""natal"" or ""biological"" women, like there's no biological basis to being trans. (I remember the 90s when everyone thought there was no biological basis to being gay, even many other gay people.)

Or they'll compliment, ""Oh! I thought you were a woman!"" And I'll say, ""I am."" Then they'll say, ""Oh, you've gotten the surgery already?"" They imply I'm not a ""full woman"" without surgery or that I'm currently half man, half woman. I'm zero percent man. Zero Percent Man, the hero this city needs! I'm so proud of this written ad lib that I fear someone will make their own story with it and get famous, and I'll be the forgotten originator. Why can't I focus?

Oh, god. So. Many. Women. *Instantly.* Talk to me like I'm a gay male drag queen as soon as I disclose. ""Yaasss, queen! Werq! Slay! Slay!"" Beeyotch, I'm wearing no makeup, a [Siouxsie and the Banshees](https://youtu.be/5PjUY8IXvnA) band tee, and 8-year-old men's cargo shorts. 50% of these women assume I'm into men and just a *super* gay guy. I once said I liked women to two ladies I outed myself to. They pointed to a *drag queen out of drag* saying, ""Oh, well you should dance with her!"" Also, many queer women in general thought my femme gay male friend with a *mustache* was a trans woman too by association.

With no sexual advances on my part, sometimes women I disclose to will tell me to show them my tits but that penises were disgusting and not to show that. Great job sexually objectifying and degrading me at the same time, buddy. I didn't say I wanted to show anything, pal. Compadre. Sometimes they'll get another woman or two to chant ""Show your tits"" at me. I admit I have (and this has happened multiple times), because I wanted to feel validated that cis women found me attractive, but also because they wouldn't let up.

I've sometimes successfully built up increased understanding on a deeper level with queer cis women who didn't ""get it"" at first. But it's very, very hard! It takes so much mental and emotional work. I have to phrase things so that A: I won't be misunderstood by some *other* stereotype I didn't even think about, B: That I phrase things interestingly so that I won't be interrupted, and C: That I won't put them on the defensive, which can lead to backfiring. I often have to take many emotional hits and bear some unintentional misgendering or backhanded compliments before seeing a change after months. But one friend of mine turned out to be very dear and to understand to the best of her ability, even if she mislabels my feelings or experiences sometimes. She and her wife really helped build my self-esteem.

I've been turned down from a date or two by bisexual women who were interested before I disclosed.

I had a girlfriend who said she was newly coming out as bi. But she wouldn't let me touch her and then cut off sex after reconnecting with her male ex-lover. The day she dumped me, she started ""politely"" challenging my dysphoria, saying cis people had dysphoria too, like with weight issues. I said it's different, because I have body image issues too (chest scars, mild [pectus excavatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectus_excavatum), yo-yo weight) but my brain was literally mapped for a different body which I *feel* is missing, like a phantom body, except that feeling never went away in my 31 years without hormones (I'm 32 now). She said dysphoria had not biological cause, that I *chose* to *identify* as a woman (when I contested I always was one), and that my phantom vagina feeling is merely like ""phantom skinniness"" to obese cis women. She was smiling, calm, and acting like she was really thoughtful. She also pointed to my frustration, anger, or defensiveness as evidence I'd lost the debate.

**Outro**

Sorry it was so long. I was having fun writing and ranting. I just wanna know how excluded or misunderstood I really am among the LGB. I hope it's not as much as I fear.

clovercoon,asktransgender,anyone else feel like they're lying to themselves?,"I'm waiting on a call back from a clinic that offers hormone therapy to schedule an appointment. I'm finally taking real, tangible steps towards medical transition, but the closer I get to it, the more anxious I'm becoming that I'm going to regret it. 

I've had several well-meaning cis people tell me that they don't think transition is going to make me happy, and I feel like I'm starting to believe it. Like all this time, I've convinced myself I'm trans and that going on T is the best thing for me, when it really isn't. I don't even know if that makes sense? I was super excited when I was put on the wait list for this clinic, but now I'm too overwhelmed by self-doubt to be happy about it. 

I'm so scared that I'm going to regret transition, but I'm so unhappy now, and I /was/ so unhappy trying to live as a girl. I just want to know I'm not alone in that fear, that other trans people have experienced similar feelings. "
UnnecessarilyFluffy,asktransgender,Am I trans? I'm unsure.,"Title says it all. It's an issue I've been struggling with for months - I don't really identify with either gender strongly enough to call myself trans. Somewhere in my teens, I realized I wanted to be a woman rather than a man, that being male didn't feel quite right, but I've never felt the strong sense of dysphoria that a lot of trans people talk about. I feel like I could live happily without transitioning, but I would very much regret it if I didn't do it. I also worry a good bit about whether or not I'd regret it once things are under way. 

Has anyone else had similar feelings? Am I trans/not trans because of this? It's been on my mind a lot lately and the decision to decide whether or not to make the choice to start transitioning has been causing a great deal of stress. Any answers would help."
yasqueen123,asktransgender,Amazing reaction by dad!,"Hi everyone!

I told my dad that I am doubting that I'm transgender which, I believe, is a coming out. And his reaction was great.

About a week ago I sent my dad a e-mail in which I came out, but I didn't really like it and it was a messy e-mail. I ended up logging into his account and deleting my e-mail.

Yesterday night I wrote a short letter about how I felt and I layed it on his pillow of his bed. I was home alone luckily and he would see it when I was in bed sleeping, because he would be home late. 

This morning he woke me up and asked me to come lay in his bed, so I grabbed my blanket and pillow and layed next to him. He told me he read my letter. I was very nervous and still a bit tired. He told me that he loved me and he was very happy that I dared to tell him. He said that he'll always support me and that I should do what makes me happy. Then we both got emotional and we hugged. He was just very understanding. Defenitely an example for other parents!

I'm glad that I told him, but everything does get real now. I can't hide my problem in my head anymore. But I don't regret my decission. "

My general practitioner has confirmed my diagnosis (and sent it to an endocrinologist nearby for me!) and my therapist of 2 years has written a letter backing my diagnosis &amp; recommending HRT. Basically, I've got the goods.

""Hey listen, FYI, I wanna grow a beard and lose some of the tiddy I've got going on, can y'all cover it?"" I'm at a loss. I'm also technically insured under two plans: one insurance covers my PCP and doctors visits, the other my medications. Which do I contact first? Do I ask insurance 1 to contact insurance 2 so that they fill my T prescriptions once those start rolling in?

tgpineapple,asktransgender,My brother is acting weird,"My younger brother's acting weird - as all brothers do - but I'm really curious what he's up to. He's 12 now and just entering puberty; his forehead is all bumpy. Anyway, recently he's been hiding what sites he visits on his iPad, and he stays up way too late at night (2am this morning) watching anime. He's being very cautious and secretive but last night I caught him up and I had a look at what he's watching.

I noticed a few things before I was banished from his room. He was watching Girl meets girl, and watched Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru. On his youtube app, he had ""top 5 gender bender anime."" My current guess is he's currently going through puberty and is just messing around and watching things that have girls in it? But I mean there's like so much more different anime for that, so why GB?

I contemplated that he might be confused about me, but I have 80% of my body in the closet and I don't think he knows - my parents do though. I secretly (and perhaps sadistically) wished that he was trans so that my parents would have to suffer a horrible blight and that he could convince my parents to get the treatment I never got. 

I can't let them catch him because they'd probably question it and it'll be very weird. For now, I'm just going to keep watching him. Any thoughts about what he's going through?"

katy1989,asktransgender,The idea of losing strength on HRT is terrifying me so much I don't know how to handle it,"Hello,

I'm pre-HRT MTF. It looks like I should be able to finally start HRT in the next few weeks, and almost all of the worries I've had about transitioning have gone away or proved to be nothing I needed to worry about in the first pace, which is great. I really was feeling like for the first time I'm just excited about HRT rather than a mix of excited and worried. 

Unfortunately there's still one major thing getting in my way, and that is when I think about getting weaker on HRT it makes me feel horrified and terrified so much that I actually feel sick. I certainly don't want to look muscly at all, I hate how bulgy my arms are. I have never worked out once at all, am probably average strength for a Male my size and almost never use my strength in day to day life. At the moment the most strength intense activity I do is either lifting food shopping from the car to the house, or moving my bass amp, both of which are at the limit of my strength. I feel on the edge of having a panic attack when I imagine the first time I can't one of those things any more.

I think that there is at least two major parts to this. One is just the general idea of losing something, or getting worse at something through choice. I am lucky enough that I haven't really ever got worse at anything in my life so far. I know ageing will soon start affecting things, but none of that will be by choice. 

The other thing is the idea of being vulnerable. Right now if I need to I can probably outrun anyone who is going to threaten me, but I guess that will change. I know that all women have to deal with this, and I think if it weren't for the first part issue this would just be stressful rather than harrowing.

Does anyone have a good way of rationalising this? If I was a ciswoman I certainly wouldn't want to take T to get stronger, but that doesn't seem to help with the loss angle.

I've posted about this before, and I really appreciated everyone's replies then, but I really don't think I've managed to get my mind any further along.

Sorry for the quite negative tone of my post and thanks for reading :-)

I told him that since I'm still settling into campus life, I'm just not prepared for that sort of thing yet. he took it well, and as of writing, we remain cordial.

...but obviously, ""I'm still getting settled"" isn't the full story. having spent most of my life unenthusiastically trying to be a straight guy, I have next to zero experience with any of this sort of thing, especially from this perspective. there's also the ever-present questions of if he knows I'm trans, and if not, how/when I should tell him. the housing option I'm in right now is the one meant to be trans-inclusive, and my roommates are two trans guys and a random cis dude who couldn't get placed anywhere else, so he's gonna figure it out real quick if we ever end up in my dorm for whatever reason. 

he seems like he's *probably* an okay guy, it's just that this whole situation is really alien to me, and I have no idea what to do on a very basic level.

However, even the one with the least nylon(22%) gave me contact dermatitis. And let me tell you, contact dermatitis and nipples are a terrible combination.

I'm currently stuck binding with polyester/elastane sports bras 1 or 2 sizes too small for me, and while they do help, they don't flatten my chest enough and are super uncomfortable.

Now, in my case the obvious solution to this issue would be top surgery, which is something I plan on getting eventually, but I'm currently undergoing treatment for unrelated mental health issues and my doctor wants me to get those sorted out before transitioning.

loveydoveysong,asktransgender,Black Transwoman Question (hair),"Alright so

I'm a Black Trans Woman (here's a pic in case you're curious http://i.imgur.com/Wvr2x6P.jpg) and I haven't started HRT yet. However, I did recently get a referral to an endocrinologist. I actually have a hormone imbalance (I have more estrogen than most men), and due to this, I actually have gynocomastia and little bit of feminine curves. Now, even though I have a general understanding about what HRT will do to my body, I still have a few questions. Specifically with Black Transwomen. (although a few of these questions aren't specifically aimed towards them).

1. Since I have Gynocomastia (my breasts are probably at B-Cup), do any of you think that my breasts will be slightly bigger than most transwomen naturally? Since I have a head start? I read somewhere that you are expected to be a cup size below most women in ones family (women in my family are D+), but then I also read that most transwomen only go to about B. Which I believe I am already at. 

2. Does HRT change the fat distribution of fat you already have? I have my ideal body for the most part already, but I actually have a little bit of a gut, and I'm not sure if the distribution will change with fat I already have. Probably not, this is a rather stupid question. Still, I have asked this question.

3. Finally, the one mentioned in the title, it's about my hair. Firstly, ethnically, I am Black and Filipino, but I have ""black"" hair. It's course, curly, and quite annoying to deal with. Will HRT at least make it softer/grow longer faster?

Bonus Question: So I'm actually not all that hairy, but I do have a little bit of stomach hair. I definitely do not want this, but I definitely don't want to keep shaving it if HRT will make it thinner/make it disappear all together. 

Sorry for all the questions, and thank you in advance for anyone who could help. ;A ;"

3. Leg hair-out of all the body hair I naturally have(but get rid of most), hair on my legs makes me feel ugly.
4. Baggy jeans-like who the hell let a pretty girl like me wear jeans that I could basically camp in. 
5. Bulky shoes-my feet are larger than most girls so this makes me feel like a clown
6. When my junk doesn't stay in the same spot. 
7. Messy unkempt eyebrows-this is pretty self explanatory but basically when they aren't up to par I feel like I look like a guy 
8. Lack of hips
9. Shirts that are too tight
10. Shirts that have a high neck and aren't button ups
11. Shorts that are too long-I don't feel sexy at all.

Oh, and I've got a vague hope that this would show the doctor that I'm serious, and perhaps cut the obscene waiting time on the HRT.

So, essentially, I'm trying to decide if I should just throw caution to the wind and begin presenting more feminine. I'm honestly rather masculine, so there won't be too many drastic changes, just a touch of makeup and something other than a 1920's suit every day, as well as growing out my hair.

I'm not too worried about malice or bullying from other students, the school's too big for most to care and I'm pretty good at ignoring people. (true story: I was apparently bullied and disliked all through middle school and just didn't notice.)

I dunno, I feel like there's something missing, or it's too early, or I'm underestimating the cruelty of my peers, or what. I've gone through this all intellectually, I logically think it's a good idea and my family/counselor/other misc support networks agree, but I'm still dreading the thought quite a bit. So, please: Advise me. Note that I'm not going to be able to wait until I graduate, as I've been on the brink of just blurting out ""I'm trans"" in every conversation I have."
trans123456789,asktransgender,Blood when I poop? Related to progesterone?,"So i just recently started progesterone, I have been on spiro+patches for almost a year and a half now. I also just started having issues where sometimes when I go to the bathroom I would notice blood on my poop/when I wipe. Its always bright red blood, and its only really happening when I have to push hard.

Is this a common thing? Should i be worried? Should I make an appointment to see a doctor?


EDIT: ok ok. I heard you all loud and clear. Appointment is scheduled. Also I plan to stop my progesterone for now since this started so close to when I started taking it and i want to see if that's the cause.

RocketQ,asktransgender,Dating as a trans guy?,"So I've had a bunch of experience dating as a trans woman,  a lot of guys ghost me as soon as they learn that I'm trans or they chase me. 

I've also had my sexuality shift a little, as before transition I never had any male partners. 


I'm interested to know from the guys when you reveal your trans status to a potential partner, how often do they break off contact? 

Also, have you found your sexuality shifting on T? Does it make you want to take control in the bedroom?"

not-causing-trouble,asktransgender,Do people who you knew pre-transition recognize you after a while on hormones?,"Pre-transition I was a regular at a board game emporium near where I used to live. I haven't been in there for about a year, but I knew a lot of people there fairly well and was a regular sight. Well, today I decided to head back there to play some board games.

I was there for about three hours and played a few different games with a bunch of people that I knew. But, no one recognized me at all. People who I had known pretty well introduced themselves to me. Everyone instinctively used she/her pronouns and saw me as any other new girl who walked into the emporium. It really blew my mind to know that not even people who knew me fairly well can see me as male anymore."
MrBaconKush420,asktransgender,Impossible for me to get prescribed HRT for MTF...what now?,"Well I had 3 different therapy sessions in Cali Central Valley...that were a waste of money and time... had 3 different ladys tried to treat my depression and low hormone levels with just pure anti-depressants...Firstly because my parents didn't want them to try hormone replacement due to their religion ethics, my mom says she would rather cut my p*is off then I becoming a girl. The last therapist saw how miserable my life was but still couldn't prescribe HRT and was gonna continue anti-depressants until I literally cried to her about all my research on medical cannabis and CBN blocking androgen receptors when high amounts of THC are present, rendering my ""disoriented"" sex cycle to pure asexual but still wanting to be girly. I get my prescription medical marijuana ( Probably the only happiest moment of my life since it helped me figure out I had a milk allergy...story down below if anyone cares) and for 1 year I was ""having fun on the clouds"" but NOW coming back down I feel the girl in me is already peeking, tearing apart its shell. Sadly my therapist won't meet me again since my mom didn't want to pay the last session.Almost 1 year later here I am 19 years old now and for 3 days I literally can't sleep anymore even with indica cannabis I just keep looking at my body and get depressed for it still being male, I gotta stay high to daydream I am finally a girl, which is not a healthy habit but atleast it keeps me active cleaning up the whole house while I get sorted in college. Once the high is gone I know just how bad my life still is and I instantly drop everything I plan on doing and lay on bed crying or crying to music. I stopped cutting when I got my cannabis prescription.WHAT SHOULD I DO I DONT WANT TO STAY HIGH EVERY 2 HOURS???? Now thats just my recent life chapter


...::::::::::::::::: THIS is why I had low testosterone levels it might be pretty sad and fucked up so be warned:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

I was 9 when I started getting weird hives and acne everywhere spreading from face to upper body my mom,since religious, bought a bunch of junk that either made it worse or just burned my face and got me scared to try again. Then seeing how no remedy was working we went to 2 different dermatologist both charged me atleast $100 a meeting and $500 for suppose anti-bacterial creams and injections on my butt...none freaking worked but reduced the inflammation so we kept trying them... School was a hell-hole for me since I had hives I would get mocked and beaten up giving me Social Anxiety Disorder and panic attacks happened everyday. I was driven to almost kill myself with anything I swear deemed killable when I was at high school and a group of gang decided to jump the poor hopeless me. I was gonna ditch school to jump off some height until a 12th grader got out of his car, seeing everything, offered a 8th of weed and I smoked a bit with him to calm my anxiety attack but gave me the rest for free. My mom flushed the weed without listening to me, even made me promise to not do drugs again if she moves us to another city. So another city same issues exepct no more cannabis so I finally tried about 4 times to commit suicide in my current city which made the cops finally drive me straight to a therapist on the 4th attempt (the last cop even told my mom my issues seemed more of a hormone issue than drugs, when she screamed saying to drug test me roughly). No drugs were shown and I had a low testosterone hormone count. So about 100 pills later none worked and made me continue cutting until the last one said which drug seemed to atleast work both self-medicating and prescription I cried out cannabis but she wouldn't believe so until I had printed pages from reliable sources. Got prescribed and first direction was milk edibles...didn't get me high and got upset stomach...contacted dispensary and they send a coconut oil edible which worked...FOR 5 BUCKS I FOUND MY SKIN PROBLEM IT WAS FUCKING MILK ALLERGYS :'(. Before I had my medical insurance cut at age 18 I did a allergy test and 100% allergic to milk. My life is sad anyways gonna pack bowl to cheer myself up"

I have also decided to tell the rest of my family before I started hormones.  I know my brother and my sister would support me fully I don't know how my mother would react, but that's besides the point.

SimplyBeingLena,asktransgender,Let's not be afraid to show ourselves!,"What positive experiences have you made showing yourselves? 

Today I learnt that for us, even some speech completely unrelated to transness can seemingly have quite unexpected consequences. 

A couple of months ago, I had decided to participate in a series of presentations by alumni at my old translators' school. I talked about my job, about what I'd been doing for the past 4 years - and it seemed like no-one cared about my trans status, though many knew me and probably figured it out pretty quickly - especially with what my voice sounded like back then.

What I did not see coming, though, was that 3 months later I'd come to know that, without me having said a word about being trans in this world but instead by just having been there and having held this presentation, I've apparently given a closeted peer of ours the last bit of courage they needed to come out of the closet and move forwards with open transition.

I was hesitant at first, afraid even, to give this presentation. But the entire thing went down pretty well and, apparently, touched at least some people more than I could have imagined.

Have the courage to show yourself. Your professional efforts are still worth showing and who knows, you might even give someone the chance to understand from personal experience that we trans people can be successful, too."

Lawful_Cupcake,asktransgender,Moved back in with my folks...,"On Saturday, I moved back in with my parents, which sucks on it's own, as they're unsupportive and unpleasant people. My dad is a bit better than my mother, but I think things are about to get very awkward tomorrow.

Today I did laundry, because I wanted to wash the plane off my clothes. My father has an obsession with getting stuff done, whereas I'm more of a let it sit until asked to handle it kinda gal. I own, as many young women at the age of 25 do, several lacy/sexy thongs. They went through the wash with everything, because I'm a lazy punk and don't really bother separating delicates from regular laundry. I removed my bras and dresses that I don't want ruined by the dryer, but the thongs were a gift and I don't really bother too much with keeping them nice because fuck the guy that gave me them. My father took my laundry and folded it before I woke up, which was when I was planning to do it. A very nice gesture, but now he knows that the person that he kinda considers his son wears sexy lace thongs when the mood strikes her. Awkward, but I could handle that. No biggie.

Tonight, I went out with my mother, because I decided that I wanted to get Fire Emblem for my 3DS. While we were out, my father decided to go into my room, and clean it. Again, a nice gesture, but there's a couple of caveats. One, he most certainly saw that I have a box of open condoms in my luggage. So dad now knows that I am sexually active. Maybe he assumed they were for me to use on girls or something, although I haven't even pretended to be sexually into women for years(sorry gals, but I do enjoy me some bringo brongo). Again, awkward, but handleable. The next one is much worse. 

I had left out my dildo. I hadn't recently used it, and the other night, I was planning to, found out I didn't pack my lube. I assumed that even though I have limited privacy, what I had would be respected, and no one would enter the room, just give me bunk about ""You need to clean this mess, yada yada yada."" APPARENTLY, that was a poor decision on my part. I had left it out near one of my suitcases, and all of the suitcases are neatly tidied away in the corner now. My awkward meter was hitting critical levels already. My father has just learned some personal things about me, and I'm not even done yet. Here's the most interesting part about him finding my dildo.

It's missing. I can't find it anywhere. I've looked through all of my suitcases. I've looked in all of my drawers. I've looked through the laundry. No where to be found. I think my father either threw away, or, much more interestingly, stole my dildo. Everyone's asleep right now, but I've left him a note asking where it is. My awkward meter is ded. Liek so ded. I'm a 25 year old god damned woman who can't hide her personal port-a-dick.

So that's my story of my father stealing my dildo. Thought that you guys and gals and inbetweens might find it humorous. If anything more interesting and if you all want an update, I'll provide one.

EDIT FOR UPDATE: I GOT IT BACK! The note I left said that it was in the bottom drawer of the dresser, which it definitely wasn't last night. I'M KINDA SCARED AND I DON'T KNOW IF I WANNA USE IT &gt;_&gt;"

valerie_6966,asktransgender,sublingual vs. transbuccal,"Hi there.

I take estradiol 2 mg sublingual tablets 3 times a day (2 AM, 1 PM)

However, when I take them sublingually (under my tongue specifically) , I end up salivating a ton and spreading the dissolved tablet all over my tongue and mouth. Through this I also end up swallowing a lot of it. Also, it's basically entirely dissolved, mixed, and spread all within only a couple minutes. I don't think it's ever in my mouth longer than 5 minutes.. and even that feels optimistic. I've had times where it's honestly gone in 1-3 minutes. And I'd actually also say that that was more common. 

I never really started thinking about it until recently, because I'm a little underwhelmed (to say the least) with my transition thus far. 

Just tonight, I tried sticking the tablet in-between my cheek and my lower gum. It has been snug there for at least 15 minutes already, and it still feels like it could go for at least another 15. I have not tasted it at all. My mouth is not salivating. The blue dissolved mixture is not spread all over my tongue, or my teeth, or anything else. It's simply staying right put and dissolving slowly. 

I've read that ""if you taste it, you waste it"" and that is what originally inspired me to really start researching this matter. I honestly didn't even think about it at all. I figured that if it was in my mouth, it's getting absorbed so it doesn't make a difference. I'm pretty sure I've been wrong about that this entire time. (ugh.. 9 months..)

Is taking the sublingual tablets transbuccal-ly (between gum and cheek) an effective mode of delivery? Why or why not? 

To me, the longer absorption rate seems like a positive thing? To think that it takes 30 minutes where it is being absorbed straight from the source seems like it's a good thing? right? As opposed to 1-3 minutes of sloshing it around my mouth, mostly being swallowed, and then being forgotten about until 12 hours later?

What do you think?"

DisposablePerson7373,asktransgender,How do I get past a body I feel I can never fix?,"Hello lovely gendernauts. I’m in my early thirties and would have labeled myself MTF for some time, and would still like to, but have lost confidence in the label. I have been hung up and unable to move forward in my life because of how much I hate my body.
I should say I am aware my thoughts are not super healthy, but they also seem to be completely intractable. I do want to preface this by saying that I can imagine the following rant might be upsetting for people with body image issues or issues with the gender binary or something else I haven’t even thought of. I hope that if you think you might be affected by this, you’ll skip this and not let my sickness drag you down. I fully accept that maybe I'm just a terrible shallow person... That being said, here's my issue.
I had two therapists tell me they thought I was trans and ready to put me on HRT 13 years ago. But I was never comfortable moving forward because when presenting female I felt like my body was making a mockery of me. Everything about it is so inextricably male. The size of my rib cage, the fact that I'm almost 6 foot tall, posture I can’t ever seem to get in line, I walk in a weird, clumsy way even for a male, I wear a size 12 in mens. This one especially kills me. I’ve heard some trans women talk about hating their penis and just wanting it gone. That’s how I feel about my feet, I just want them to go away. My head is abnormally large. My body language is wrong. I sit strange. When I was growing up, I loved presenting as a girl, even if I could only do it hiding in my room. But as I became an adult what I saw in the mirror became more and more distressing until it became more upsetting than being dressed as a male. Dressing in female clothes and adopting female mannerisms just highlighted how incongruous my heap of a male form was with my female identity. The incongruity became unbearable. I came to believe that if I transitioned, the changes wouldn’t be enough and that I’d still look like a man in a dress and be just as miserable, just with a bunch of medical bills and an inability to at least hide and be miserable in peace. I decided that my body had won, I tried to live in it. That led to several dark and empty years that left me miserable, stagnant and hollow, and over the past few months I’ve come to feel the only way forward for me is to transition. But I don’t know how to do it when I know it can’t really fix my body. I’m not trying to proscribe how anyone else should approach transition or anything like that. But for me, personally, if I can’t see a girl in the mirror, then I can’t be happy. Does anyone feel like this? Am I just profoundly superficial? Am I crazy? Sometimes this makes me question if I’m even really trans or some… other thing. I feel like if I was trans that bringing my body in line with my mental sex wouldn’t get so incredibly hung up on looking too male. I’m actually ambivalent about my genitals, it would be the way I look that would make me feel whole, and like my true self. The genitals are secondary. I’m sorry if I’m some kind of crazy person intruding because I don’t know better, genuinely. I’m just hoping someone with more fortitude has dealt with something like this and can give me some kind of guidance."

Harpesian,asktransgender,What should I do (concerning HRT)?,"So, I'm a boy and I don't really mind being considered such, but I really have to look more feminine and I've been considering that a little HRT might be the way to go, even though I have no idea how any of that really works.

I'm already feeling dysphoric about my height, shoulders and ""squarening"" face, but I'm happy enough with my appearance as is not to need anything...well, yet. BUT, I will NOT be able to deal with ""filling out"" in a few years' time if it happens. O_o

The way things are arranged in my household, pretty much everything I do goes through a parent. If I go to the doctor, one arranges it, drives me there and we go in together, so it's not like sneaking off to see a doctor is really an option. :/

Now, my parents aren't conservative by any means, but I can't help but feel like I may not exactly be UNDERSTOOD. I mean, they support gays and opposite-sex trans people and they're extremely reasonable people that I respect HEAPS; I'm just not sure how it would be taken if I explain that I want to look feminine enough to actually want to maybe take hormones, but I don't actually want to be a girl.

My mum already thinks (though not terribly seriously) that I have a twisted body image/anorexia or something (from telling her how I don't like being tall or I don't want to fill out or have broad shoulders, et cetera), but I haven't told her anything to suggest that what is the case might be the case. I'm just worried she'll think it's just a problem I made up in my head or something...

Now, I don't even know how HRT works so I'm not even sure if that'll work out for me, but I want at least to see a doctor about it. What do you think I should do? :(

PS. I would be severely comforted if you were to tell me how I probably won't fill out or something like that as long as it's true, but it probably isn't true, so."

fuzzybad,asktransgender,Injectable question - intramuscular vs subdermal estradiol,"About 7 months ago my endo prescribed estradiol valerate, to be injected subdermally once weekly.  This has been working quite well for me, however the last time I got my prescription refilled they gave me Delestrogen (which is still estradiol, but apparently a different preparation than I'd been using previously).

The Delestrogen vial says that it's for intramuscular use only, but my pharmacy put a label on it that says to continue my weekly subdermal injection.  Since I started using this vial, I've noticed irritation and swelling at the injection site, something that never happened with my old preparation.

So my question is, is there really a difference in the preparations for estradiol to be injected subdermally vs instramuscular?  If not, perhaps I have a slight allergy to the Delestrogen brand?

I'm going to my pharmacy today and will ask them about this, but would appreciate any insight you can share.

Mushi_Iroh,asktransgender,Question about depression and thoughts of suicide,"Hi

I won't go into details but the gist of my story goes as follows. I'm 29. I've only discovered I'm transgender about 2 months ago. The past decade (or longer) I saw my health (both physical and mental) deteriorate and I was increasingly desperate trying to ""get myself together"" but I kept getting worse because I didn't know what was wrong with me. I developed insomnia but nobody could tell me why. I became addicted. I became depressed and eventually suicidal.

The past year was the worst year of my life. Due to my insomnia I was always tired. I went to therapy on several occasions about ""my life grinding to a halt"" and feelings of stress, loneliness, and so on but nobody could point me in the right direction on how to get better. I had completely given up on myself and focused the remainder of my energy on my job. I worked in a hospital and thought that if I was a lost cause at least I could still help some people. Then I became destructive. My addiction got worse and I wasted a lot of money because I couldn't follow through on any of my decisions. With all I got in me I eventually beat my addiciton but I still felt lost. That was about 3 months ago.

Little over 2 months ago I was driving to a self help group but it all felt like a drag. I was seriously planning to just end it but I was going to enjoy myself ""one last time"". So next thing I knew I was wearing women's clothing and reality hit me like a ton of bricks. ""OMG, THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING!!!""

After a euphoric phase of ""I've finally found me"" and starting my transition, reality is starting to sink back in and now I've come to a point where I just want to give up. I still feel tired and although I sometimes look into the mirror and see ""me"" I start smiling but it's more of a ""what could have been"" sentiment. I'm looking back at the mess I've made of my life and I really don't know what to do next.

I know for sure I wouldn't have gone through all of this if I had just known earlier that the thing I was battling was dysphoria. I'm the kind of person that was always trying to improve myself until the point of desperation because I was completely out of options. I've finally got the answer but now I'm just sitting here, feeling defeated. I'm fairly certain that depression and thoughts of suicide are a result of dysphoria impacting my life over a long period of time. I also feel a lot of regret about what happened in the past, but I also know I did my absolute best.

tl;dr: Dysphoria indirectly caused me to become depressed and suicidal. **So what I'd like to know: I'm looking for a way to rediscover my ""will to go on"" and I was wondering if transition in itself could be a way of doing that? Does anyone else have a similar story? What helped you?**

Thank you &lt;3"

Having no money of my own, no means of transportation, etc. I kind of have to wear what my mom wants me to. I'd be really uncomfortable wearing something that's clearly more masculine, and since I can't wear a dress, something relatively neutral would be ideal. Does gender neutral formal wear exist?

JakeHNIMN,asktransgender,Dread at starting Sixth Form,"Hello,
I'm 16 and starting Sixth Form next week (school for people 16-18 in the UK) And I've registered as male (I'm FtM) And I feel I should be happy about this but I'm dreading starting there. I'm only out at the moment to one of my friends but I'm going to have to come out to everyone before next week as the majority of people I know from school are going to the same place as me and they see me as female.

I guess I would say I am completely and utterly petrified of what people are going to say and can't help but think that nobody will want anything to do with me because I'm trans. Any advice on how to deal with this way of thinking? And how to deal with the situation if my fears prove to be true?

I'm also feeling uncertainty over having to come out to so many people over such a short period of time. I can't help but think that I've somehow brainwashed myself into 'becoming trans' and that it's all fake and telling more people is just digging a deeper hole for myself. Even though I've been feeling this way for years and I'm sure I'm not female.

Has anyone got any words of advice or encouragement?

Thanks in advance,

Arduinan,asktransgender,I just had GCS 3 hours ago AMA :D,"**Day 1:**

Hi! I'm laying in bed in my hospital room after Dr. McGinn performed surgery for me at Lower Bucks Hospital.  I have never had a doctor give me so much confidence, she is just amazing.

Her assistant Crystal and the hospital nurses have been so great too, I'm hugely impressed. Everyone is warm and friendly, I haven't felt anxiety at all.

I hope I remember enough to share details later, although I feel sad and humble because so many others are still waiting for their surgery like I was. 

For now I'll try to answer questions if anyone has some.  AMA

**Day 2**

Thanks for replying everbody, it makes me happy to hear from other people since I'm alone in the room.

Sleep didn't really happen in the night.  The nurses needed to take a temperature and blood pressure every hour, empty the catheter bag, check the two drains in me and replace the drip bag and ice packs down there.  But I could have had a sleeping pill if I wanted.

I can see why smokers need to quit before surgery.  The only thing I was sorta addicted to before was caffeine in diet coke, and I'm glad I stopped that earlier since the withdrawl was not fun.

I forgot to mention that you get a leg massage while you're in bed. :D They wrap soft inflating leggings on you and a pump inflates them back and forth.  It's really nice.

You also have to inhale 10+ times an hour through a ""voldyne"" gadget that prevents pneumonia. My breathing gets really shallow without it, I think because of the morphine.  I still have nose oxygen too.

Dr. McGinn just stopped in to see me and tilted the back of the bed up, yay!  She said I'm going to start standing today and drinking a little liquid slowly.  She also checked my drains and legs for blood clots and seemed happy with my state so far.

I'm adding some random photos over here:

chelsea0808,asktransgender,Fistula symptoms / help,"Hello everyone.  :)

I had SRS surgery in the UK 1 month ago. I researched the risks etc throughly, and i am very certain i have developed a fistula.

Gas escapes from my vagina after dilation, and feces is present at the end of the dilator (brown in colour and has a strong smell) i have rarely had bleeding or discharge after my SRS so i know it is not dried blood.

The symptoms are only present when i dilate, and bowel movements are normal. I am due to see my surgeon in one week and i am going to have my gp take a swab from my vagina to check for any bacteria found in feces.

Has anyone else experienced a fistula (RVF/ recto vaginal fistula)?
Will it heal by itself? 
From my research, stretching the vagina will stretch the fistula, so should i dilate half an inch below my original 5"" depth?

I hope someone can give me advice as i am very scared. thanks in advance. "

humpback_camel,asktransgender,Has my orientation changed?,"I always viewed myself as a straight guy. Came out as trans to current gf six months into relationship, she's bi, all good. My sexual fantasies always had an occasional element of being fucked by a guy, I assumed mostly because it is a gender affirming fantasy.

 My fantasies of being fucked or sucking dick now are much more frequent after being of HRT for six months or so. Tbh it is the only way I masturbate (which I am rarely compelled to do but do for maintenance mainly). I even (rarely) use the fantasy when I can't get off while fucking.

However I am not at all romantically attracted to guys, and am still mildly repulsed by the thought of kissing a guy. I'm so in love with my gf and am very attracted to her body. Even if I was bi I know I wouldn't feel the need to experiment at the expense of my relationship as it is more important to me than anything.

Is anyone else in the same spot? I haven't told my gf about much of this, mainly because I know she has a lot of anxiety about me leaving her for this very reason, and no matter how I say this it will increase that anxiety.

So we are both in our 20's and we've been friends since high school. I've had feelings towards him for a long time, but it's never went anywhere. He's straight so there's no chance of anything ever happening.

I honestly always imagined he'd be the man to my woman, but after a long talk over a year ago it was clear it would never happen. We just recently talked about it again and everything was the same. He just isn't interested in dating a trans person. I know this may seems transphobic, but even if it is he is still an ally and 100% supports me and my rights. And honestly that just may be a way for him to turn me down. 

I cried that night again about it. I really want to take our friendship to the next level, but it'll never happen. I'm having a tough time recovering. Last time this happened I dated a girl off of the sort of rebound, suppressed being trans for her, and the whole thing was screwed up. But I really want to get away from the idea of being with him.

slytherlin,asktransgender,My friend doesn't want to be trans.,"[Note: In this post I'll be using he/him pronouns for my friend, despite the fact that he's likely a trans woman, since that's what he uses right now. I'll also be referring to him as 'F.']


This is gonna be a *long* post, but I was hoping to hear some thoughts from trans women/transfeminine people. F and I have known each other for a long time, and we've always been in a large friend group of queer people. He's been out for years as a cis gay guy, I've been out for about two as transmasc. A bunch of people in our friend group are trans, so it's a really awesome atmosphere to explore our identities.

I'm like 90% sure F is a trans woman, but one that plans on burying that part of his identity and trying to settle for ""just being a gay guy."" The thing is, I'm looking for help because I think it's becoming unhealthy for him to deny. 

F and I were having a deep conversation one night about what we were looking for in our romantic relationships, and I talked about how it could be frustrating to be transmasc and want to fulfil a masculine part in a sexual role/relationship. He said this:

""Oh, I know that feeling. I've always imagined myself as a woman in my fantasies.""

I was kinda stunned cause like.... that's trans 101 right there. I had previously just assumed he was a feminine gay dude, but when I asked F to talk more about it all the classic signs started becoming clear:

- He always chooses a female character when we play games
- When he imagines himself in a relationship, he imagines himself as a woman, with a man
- When he gets high, he imagines he has a vagina and loves it
- He ""jokes"" about identifying more with women than with men
- When he was younger, he would try on his mother's clothes/makeup and loved dressing like a girl
- He has body dysmorphia, especially related to his hair, but he won't talk further about it
- He's in a fraternity, but he feels much closer and more connected to their related sorority
- He would choose to be female if given the option

Super hesitantly, I brought up these things, and when he got a bit defensive, I started describing some of my feelings of dysphoria being trans. I asked if he related to them as I listed them off, and as I kept going he looked more and more upset and groaned and was like ""oh, fuck, shit,"" etc. 

He made me drop the topic at the time and won't discuss it sober any more, but every time we've gotten high/drunk together and I start talking about gender, he'll say something like ""shut up, urghhh, I know I'm trans, don't talk about it."" So like... he *knows* he's not cis, but won't do anything about it.

ANYWAY, now that that long af explanation is over with: what the hell should I do? Obviously it's not my place to try to push F to come to terms with his identity, but he keeps desperately seeking out validation from gay men in an effort to, I dunno, ""make himself"" a gay guy? It seems like he's in such a bad headspace about it, but I + most of our friends are transmasculine, so we don't know how to approach it. :(

EDIT - I live in the Boston Area"
Alex-is-Alexis,asktransgender,Looking for opinions on my answers for a gender themed talk show I'm appearing on tomorrow.,"* 1: What does the term transgender mean to you?

	The word itself holds no sentimental value to me personally, although it is a beautifully technical word with a very clear meaning in it's etymological roots, I feel that explaining it from this perspective serves to clarify where the word comes from. With my experience as writer I love to look to the etymological source when learning new words so I can decide how well it fits what I'm attempting to convey. Trans is a prefix that means beyond, and with the root word gender tagged on it comes to mean that the subjects gender is somewhere beyond the gender they were assigned at birth. While cisgender on the other hand is the opposite scenario, with the prefix “cis” denoting the subjects gender is the same as what they were assigned at birth. In this sense I feel transgender is merely useful for referring to a condition I experience.  
	With my active interest in science I've looked a little into potential causes for this phenomenon, for example one hypothesis is that hormone imbalances in the womb during the brains development may be a factor. Brain scans have shown that even pre-transition there are often certain similarities between brains of trans and cis people of the same gender.

* 2: What is gender identity? 

	Gender identity is someones personal sense of how they experience their gender or lack-there-of. Sometimes it can comfortably be boiled down to a single label,  while for others it may be more multifaceted. As a result of the astounding variety of experiences people have reported there is some debate on what can be reasonably included in the umbrella of gender identities. Some even mock this complexity, believing that such variety is impossible or a trivial modern invention, for example the apache helicopter meme is one case of such mockery. Despite this, as time goes on a complex understanding of gender identities is being taken more seriously by medical professionals and government officials. Changes are being made to explore potential non-binary gender transition options, as well as gender-neutral markers on identification documents. 
	
* 3: What is gender expression?

	Gender expression is the means by which someone conveys or lives their gender identity. This could be as straightforward as verbally identifying it themselves, or medically transitioning and changing their voice to bring their bodies more in-line with their sense of identity, Culturally dependent cues are also common through combinations of various stereotypes surrounding gender. These might include such things as clothing, activities, body language, hairstyles, and gender roles. In my experience the most reliable means of gender expression is when someone personally conveys their identity to you. That method is also the standard means of diagnosing transgender people, medical professionals are meant to merely assist someone who experiences gender dysphoria to sort out their identity themselves and offer resources for pursuing transition. The opposite of this method is called conversion therapy, which was shown in the past to be dangerously ineffective in treating gender dysphoria and is no longer the standard.

* 4: How do you express your gender?

	I identify as genderfluid, which to me means to me that my sense of identity and expression tend to change over time. One hypothesis as to how this might occur is that the brain could have had different levels of exposure to hormones in different areas during it's development, and as a result cause one's sense of gender to shift over time depending on which area's of their brain are active. In terms of how I approach medical transition, I have been pursing an ambiguously gendered body through various routes, as a means of more easily flowing between gender expressions to match my identity at the time. I picked my name with a similar reasoning in mind, Taylor that is, was common for both males and females around the time I was born. The less difficult to change aspects of my expression tend to shift more frequently, and I try to do whatever I feel conveys who I am or makes me happy, regardless of how it is gendered by society. 

* 5: What is the transgender umbrella and what groups are covered by this?

	The transgender umbrella is an attempt at deciding which groups can be described by the word transgender. Although in my experience this is an extraordinarily fuzzy subject with many contradictions. For example  I've met people who use medication or surgery to alter traits associated with gender and yet do not identify as trans. There are some who identify as trans but do not pursue medical assistance, and instead rely on gender expression as a means of social transition. Others who identify confidentially to me that they are trans, but do not transition because of their situation. And some who no longer identify as trans because they feel they have finished transition to their satisfaction. Such cases and many others make it virtually impossible to define a catch-all umbrella without excluding or including people to a side they do not feel they are on. I try to rely on a person by person basis, considering people as trans when they have identified themselves as such.

* 6: What is meant by the gender binary?

	The gender binary is the notion that a persons gender will fit into one of two categories, usually male or female. Proponents often define these two categories as a strict combination of characteristics that may include things such as having xy or xx chromosomes, whether genitals are either a penis or vagina, whether testosterone or estrogen is the dominant hormone, or even as cultural stereotypes associated with gender expression. These characteristics are often called upon to decide who is allowed to enter spaces meant for a certain gender. Such definitions tend to only serve the majority who fit into these boxes and exclude the minorities such as people who are intersex, non-binary trans, feminine men or masculine women, agender, or anyone else who does not blend perfectly with these definitions.



* 7: What is meant by the gender spectrum?

	The gender spectrum is a metaphor used to explain the diversity of the ways in which people might experience gender. I've seen a variety of different attempts to depict this as an image, usually involving mixing of colors or sets of sliding scales which are labeled with different components of gender, most commonly these include things like identity, biology, and expression sliding between extremes of male and female, occasionally with extra extremes like agender and genderfluid on the complex plane. Though honestly if someone was to make a fully accurate depiction of such a thing I'd imagine it would look more like the cockpit of a commercial aircraft. The problem here is very similar to what I discussed in the question about the gender umbrella, that is, in some cases gender is a highly individual experience where an immense amount of factors may come into play.

theRedSabre,asktransgender,"Am I moving too fast? And if not, how can I cope/help others to not feel like it's the case?","I came to the realization that I'm transgender about January of this year.  Since then, I have spent nearly every evening learning more about the trans community/experience and trying to figure out how I fit into it.  I am 26 years old, and within the last 2 months moved to LA from Southern Ohio.  I couldn't really do anything about my gender there for lack of adequately-informed psychologists and doctors.  Since moving here, I have started seeing a therapist, and even had my first facial electrolysis appointment this week.  That act has made this whole thing really real.  Even with introspection, the path I am taking is the one I want to go down, but it's kind of... scary? I feel like I am past a threshold from wanting to transition to actually transitioning.  I haven't started hormones yet, but electrolysis is pretty irreversible. (That's kind of the point, right?)

I have a loving wife, but recently, me starting tangible steps in my transition took her off guard and she told me that it felt like I was going too fast.  It has me second-guessing myself.  Even though I've been clear about things as I know them and some of the specifics were unknown, after a month of speaking to a therapist, I've decided to start acting on my needs to reduce dysphoria and not just talk about them.  I know there are people that take years to figure themselves out, but with it being nearly a year I have been mentally processing this, is it fair to say I'm not moving too fast?  

I know this is completely subjective, so I guess my question is has anyone else felt like they needed to take steps, but in doing so felt like it is too soon because of fear of no return or otherwise?"

[deleted],asktransgender,How to pass as androgynous?,"So I've come to the unfortunate conclusion that I'm a fucking mess. If there was a third gender in our world, that'd be me. Unsure how to go about this because I have very, very female features: extremely short (5'0), large chest (30f), childish round face (people assume I am in middle school but I am 25), tiny hands/feet, and a super high voice.

Testosterone is a no-go for me. I was on it for 5mos as a teen. My voice didn't so much as crack, but I got all the bad things from it: I began to bald (pretty much the *most male thing possible*, IMO) and grew body hair. It was like puberty 2.0: me wanting to die because something that shouldn't be happening was happening. Just like growing breasts all over again. I became dysphoric towards those two very-male things and went off. Back into the closet.

I'm unsure of how to go about this. I've never seen someone pass as androgynous without already being kinda androgynous with no effort involved. I've rarely seen androgynous people in real life. I don't want to look like a butch lesbian. I don't want to be a political statement. I also don't want to become a bald, hairy man just to get a lower voice.

So far, my ideas are to:

* Lose as much weight as possible (while still being healthy). I am currently 130lbs, I could probably go down to 95lbs. This will take a year if I am extremely diligent.

privatecarnage,asktransgender,I received an email I don't think was meant to go to me and found out about a terrible staff training policy at my school- is there anything I can do about this?,"I don't want to get in any sort of trouble, but it really bothered me a lot.  I opened the email thinking it was the student handbook, trying to find the policy on which bathroom I should be using.  Somehow I ended up with the staff training book instead.  And I found out that the teachers as their training have the OPTION of whether they want to watch a video on transgender students or not.  It says:

Choose One of these Videos:  “Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights-NJ” OR “Cyber-Bullying” OR “Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Awareness” OR “ Student-to-Student Hazing and Harassment” 

Obviously, a good portion of these teachers are going to choose one of the other ones because they're applicable to a significantly larger portion of students.  Is there anything I can do about this without getting myself into trouble?"

katiecakesss,asktransgender,First month on HRT.,"I haven't posted here in a very long time.

So tomorrow I have my third trans-related appointment and it marks my first month on hrt.

Nobody irl knows that i'm trans except for my healthcare provider and one of my coworkers. I came out to my parents as trans almost a year ago and I said I was gay four years ago (I'm actually pan leaning towards girls) and they've reacted extremely negatively. They've been abusive because of it. I've been punished because I came out. I've tried to run away from them a few times in high school because of this. I have to hide myself and present as male for as long as I live with them. I can't present as female at school/work because the people there know my father.

I moved to Kansas from Europe with my family about three (??) months ago and I really don't like it here. Every day I hear transphobic things in class. I see the confederate flag often. Some of the people I serve at work... I've generally had bad experiences living in the US. Every time I live here I get the ""not-fun"" southern states. I'm using my art, animation, and soon web design skills and music to save up to get out of my parents' house and move to BC. I've already completed the Discover Canada handbook and I'm taking my IELTS next month. There are both personal and political reasons as to why I'm leaving the US.

I have my own car, a full-time job (I can get fired to being lgbt here), and I have a full-ride scholarship at a very small two-year ""school"" (basement of a daycare center) in which I'm working to graduate early. I'm majoring in ""general science"" and although it's not what I want, I get a free degree.

I am $2,500 in debt to my parents because I couldn't completely pay for my $8,500 car. I payed property tax on it just before due date because my paycheck slipped in just in time.

It costs $16 for a full tank of gas. That's how efficient my car is.

Anyways, I'm doing slightly better rn, but I'm not ""good"". I want to leave this place so badly, but I'm getting there."
nate4ward,asktransgender,Need some medical transitional knowledge/experience.,"Hi I'm recently new to the reddit community and you guys have been a big help in answering my questions. So I decided that I want to transition (M2F), but I just don't know when. My problem is that I still have what most would consider a silly dream of wanting to play in the NFL and I want to wait til at least after I try out and see if I make the cut or not then transition. I just recently graduated, I am about to be 23 and played division 1 collegiate sports for 4 years. My parents are very supportive and are letting me forego looking for a job at the moment which will allow me to put all my time into training and working out (not out of the closet about transitioning yet though). This is where my question comes in, what is my likely hood that my hands feet will get bigger, or my face will get any more masculine. I am already on the borderline of wanting FFS because of it, and I certainly don't want to exacerbate it, also 6'4 with big hands and size 14 shoes. Based on my age and other factors are there tests I can take to determine if my face will get any ""manlier"" or if you think it will definitely get ""manlier"" as well if my feet and hands will get bigger. Iv'e heard of things like Dihydro-testosterone resulting in exactly this (please correct me if I'm wrong). So if there are any ways to prevent this from happening I would really like to know. Even if by some miracle I do make it I honestly don't expect or want to transition any later than age 26-27, so we are talking about what can happen in a 4 year period tops. In summary looking for:**1. possible tests i can take 2. ways to combat said problems or 3. the knowledge that this is completely unavoidable if I don't transition asap.** Not looking for people to say, ""not worth it to even try for the NFL"", trust me I am a very skeptical/realistic person and know I have a shot so please don't even mention that. 
Thanks in advance.

This line of thinking seems really helpful in that realizing you're trans can be terrifying and you need all the reassurance you can get.  Do people think the ""i think I'm trans; therefore I am trans"" is a good way of managing self-doubt?  Or might there be problems with this way of thinking, for example if the reassurance ""doubts are normal"" dispels legitimate doubts for someone for whom transitioning may really not be the right thing to do."

aquestioningperson,asktransgender,'male' hairloss and minox / dutasteride,"Hi boys, girls and others. I'm AMAB and currently still on male hormones. 

I have been on finasteride for a couple of years to combat male pattern baldness, and it is definitely helping. I do still worry it's a little thin though, and have thought about minox on the crown... Two things put me off - i have rather long hair, which makes me worried about a shed, and the need to continually use it... As i understand if I used it for two years then stopped, the additional minox hairs would fall out despite having a more fertile hair environment through finasteride/hrt?

My other question is about dutasteride, finasteride's big brother. As far as I know it's basically finasteride but knocks out a higher percentage of dht than finasteride. Hairloss people say it's riskier with feminising sides but in mtf folk presumably that's desirable... How come I don't see it mentioned more? 

In the uk it seems standard practice to prescribe finasteride with oestrogen for hrt, why not dutasteride instead if it's more effective?

Aoveron,asktransgender,Achievement unlocked: gendered correctly even though I thought I was in boy mode.,"Today started out shitty.  I had laser hair removal on my face a couple days ago, my 6th session.  She did a really good job which means I had tons of stubble that is dark and tender, making shaving risky.  I felt like crap all day, going out in a hoodie.

My dysphoria hadn't been this bad in months and the difference really sent my brain into a rut today.

A girlfriend and I planned to go out for sushi tonight, and I decided I couldn't let it get me down anymore, and I defintely couldn't go without shaving.

But, I knew I also didn't feel right going in full girl mode. So I shaved the stubble away, just put some concealer and foundation over the redness dead hair shadow....

- no other eye makeup
- puffy post-laser jaw
- no bra (I only wear a bra if I feel confident)
- just jeans and a tank top.  I even forgot my necklace I wear no matter what.

I thought the whole time I was that ""interesting looking feminine guy with the really pretty girl.""

But after I'd been there an hour, and we were finishing our food, our waitress came up and said ""Are you ladies all finished?""

My jaw about dropped and she made my night.  What a difference that confidence makes!!

Here's how I looked.  I know the M is still visible, but it is a huge improvement over months ago after laser sessions.

MadeOfDiesel,asktransgender,Confused... :(,"Sooo.... hai. I wanna make it clear that if I'm posting in the wrong place, I'm sorry. I love Reddit, but it always confused me abit. :3

I was planning on asking you guys and gals and theys if you could help me figure out something. I don't know what gender I really am. My guess would be I'm either Bigender or Genderfluid, but I could be wrong. I also know it's hard to tell over the internet, but I'm scared to ask anyone else. :(
Now, I was born in a male body. Penis, lots of testosterone, ect. But recently I've been really interested in the more... ""feminine"" stuff. As in, I'm going around doing more girly stuff. I'm letting my classmates put makeup on me and I don't take it off most of the time. I wore my friends skirt and I felt happy, almost excited, even. I've been shopping with groups of girls, putting off sports with my bros... I even begun hating my body. Or, more so, my masculine features like  my strong jaw, muscles, even what's below my belt. I guess you can say I've ditched my manly side and went full out chick. Not saying I don't feel manly, though, I still wanna play sports and games and other ""guy stuff"" sometimes. But still... I don't know if all this makes me Bigender or Genderfluid. Either those, or I'm feminine as helllll.

Sorry for the wall of death text, but I'm just really confused and stressed about this stuff. Google didn't help so I turned to Reddit. Again, sorry if I'm in the wrong place and if I offended anyone, I'm really sorry! "

TheIndependantVote,asktransgender,What's up with Dirt and Mrs. Dirt? How did they get like that?," It's so incredibly sad.  


In case you don't know Dirt and Mrs. Dirt (their respective online handles), [pictured here](https://i.imgur.com/kmc9mXW.png), are a couple of over the hill aging and almost irrelevant bloggers who seemed to have taken it in as sort of a couples therapy quest to write extensively to propagate anti-trans and anti-science talking points. 


Each of their sites is often used by TERFs to download the latest update to their irrational beliefs. If you dare to read their drivel, it's like a walk into the inane and a glimpse into the psychology of people who are desperate to make their personal hate relevant. 


Mrs. Dirt, I can kind of understand. After all, she is *that* demographic of lesbian. And her very privileged upbringing sort of fits all the check-marks for that type of behaviour. 


But Dirt, is more of a mystery to me. Is this a self-hating transman? Is this a butch lesbian who has been called a trans man too much and feels upset about it? Or is this a situation where Dirts wife is leading Dirt into ruin? 


That's the part I wanted to question here and get all your feedback. It's just odd, to me, for a couple to take on such a public group project together that literally revolves around **irrational** hate. So I assume they must have some rational to it, even if they aren't aware of it.


Like it seems like maybe Dirt was on their way toward something else and Mrs. Dirt decided to play some psychological games and abuse what little education it seems she has received.


Also, Mrs. Dirt claims to be a psychologist as of at *least* July 22nd of this year, but some say she hasn't graduated yet. Is that legal? Also, shouldn't she get reported to any kind of licensing agency for going against the DSM so recklessly? She is causing real harm to the treatment of others with her behaviour.  She's like an anti-vaxxer in the middle of an outbreak. Seems professionally unethical and intentionally harmful.

OMGBEAR,asktransgender,"Accepted new job before coming now, now concerned about how to not get fired for being Trans.","Backstory:  I'm a truck driver.  Currently delivering propane cylinders off a tractor trailer.  It's a decent gig; good pay, respect, and nice co-workers.  But I knew I had to leave, because over time I'd likely suffer a work injury from the difficulty of the job.  

So I was offered and accepted a job as a delivery driver for a major food distribution company.  Not giving the name, but they're headquartered in Texas.  I start there on September 12.  I wasn't out when I took the job, but now I'm going into it knowing I'm Trans.  

In my mind the only way to keep this from being a rocky start is to play it straight for at least 90 days, while setting an example of ""excellent"" employee.  After that, I don't know what to do.  How do I transition without getting axed?  I'm in a ""right-to-work"" state, and that means you can be terminated for any reason.  And this state is not among the few with protections for Transgender employees.  Couple that with the fact that this company is HQ'd in Texas, and that adds some scary job stability questions.

Truck Drivers; especially those with clean records, tend to be coveted, so I'm hoping this plays in my favor.  But it's no guarantee.  Then there is the fact that it's a male dominated occupation, and I have to anticipate getting at least some shit for my transition.  But it'll likely be a lot of shit.

AirRaidJade,asktransgender,I'm uncomfortable using my name with family.

I chose my current name (Jade) in 2012. Everyone I've met since then I have introduced myself to as Jade. At work all my coworkers and managers call me Jade. I love it. I generally hate being deadnamed by friends and the like.

This past Wednesday I came out to my parents. They're both accepting and supportive, even moreso than I had expected. My dad has hardly acknowledged my new name, which I understand because it's a big change and also he's the one who named me, but my mom seems to actually be trying. And when my mom calls me Jade, I just feel really uneasy about it. On one hand I'm glad that she's open to the idea, but on the other hand, I kind of wish she wouldn't.

I don't understand it. Why do I love it when other people call me by my chosen name, but seemingly hate it when my parents do?

The only thing I can think of is that this is a version of me that I had tried to keep hidden from them for so long, but still, is that not true for most of us?

I present female everywhere except in my house when my mom is around. She still is under the impression that I stopped hormones 9 months ago.

But now I've found a place. I couldn't have asked for a better roommate, she is a sex-positive queer woman who has had at least one genderqueer partner in the past. I'm excited but anxious and as I clean out my room the foreboding feeling of these first 27 years of my life being over becomes more and more real.

Last night I texted my mom and told her I'm moving out. I'd wanted to tell her in person but she was being immature and avoiding me so I texted her. I went to bed after writing the text. When I woke up this morning, I was greeted with this:

&gt; ""I will always love you. I hope this works out because you will not be coming back to this house as a girl.""

I'm heartbroken. *I love you, but you're not welcome in my house?* What kind of fantasy world is she living in where she thinks that makes sense?

I won't be going back ""as a boy,"" because I'm not a boy. I can only hope that my family members stand up for me and I don't just become a ""forsaken son"" in their eyes. I hope that one day she'll understand all this, and that she will realize that the only way she will be seeing me is if she invites me, her daughter, to the house."

I can't see it in photos, but I've never liked photos anyway, I've always felt they looked odd.

Does passing to yourself early on, even if it's usually when you're in a good mood, mean you've got a better chance of actually passing? or is it a perceptual shift that comes with thinking about trans stuff and everyone gets it? I don't want whether I can pass or not decide this for me, but i still want an answer to this question.

I guess what I'm asking is has anyone else looked in the mirror when prehrt and gone to themselves ""yeah.

Findingmyhopetoo,asktransgender,"With the ability to go full time, I freeze.","I'm only 2.5 months into HRT however because my family could not compartmentalize my transition and gossip began to pile up, I came out to everyone. I mean there is not a person in my rural community or in the far reaches of any social network I'm attached to that does not know I'm Trans.

I don't present as a woman very often. I was going to wait until some of the effects of HRT started to take hold, maybe the six month markish. Now there's no good reason I can't. My employer and all my peers at work know. The administration at my kids schools know. 

I live in western Canada and even though I reside in a northern conservative community, I'm not fearful for my safety really and no one would openly discriminate against a me. We have Trans rights explicitly spelled out in our human rights code.

I'm just stuck. Like I'm staring at the lake from the end of the dock. Watching the fog role over, shivering. 

I had been looking forward to a time when I could be myself full time and now the only thing stopping me, is me.

Thoughts?

AltAcc1274,asktransgender,How long does it take for Boy mode to fail?,"Hey everyone, just a quick question. 
I want to start HRT before the end of high school (I'm in 10th grade), but I don't want people at my school to know that I'm transitioning. My current plan is to wait until 12th grade before coming out, and hopefully starting HRT towards the end of the year. The thing is, I don't want to start it too early because I don't want people at my school to find out that I'm transitioning. On the other hand, I'll probably go to College and I want to pass as a female by the time I get there, so I don't want to start too late either. Is there an approximate amount of time until boy mode fails from the time HRT is started?"
AmITransOrBD,asktransgender,Am I a transgender woman or am I just obsessing or do I have body dysmorphia?,"I seem to constantly obsess over having particular features such as a big butt, big hips, etc so much that I Google them and look up on YouTube before and after results, how I can get these features such as big breasts, big hips, big butt, etc. I seem to say things to myself like 'when I look in the mirror in the future I'm going to have an amazing body and I'm going to have the perfect body'. I say things like I want my hips to be this big, my thighs to be this big, my butt to be this big, my waist to be this small, my breasts to be this big, my face to be this way, etc.


I want a fat transfer to my butt for example and I said if the surgeon will only put so much fat in my butt I'll get so much done with this surgeon and go to another until I get the desired result. Wouldn't this just be classed as a revision though? Does this sound normal? Or do I just sound like a transgender woman who wants to have certain features?"
Zeuphrosyne,asktransgender,Penile inversion technique,"I know I'm only 17 so it may be a bit early for SRS but I have a question. Hopefully I will have my SRS in 3 years (there is a huge waiting list in my country because only 1 surgeon is good) and it will be a penile inversion technique. 
I feel like everyone in this sub is saying that this technique sucks and that Thai surgeons are the best of the world, that their techniques are the best etc.. so I'm kinda afraid of penile inversion now :/.
I can't go abroad so I will have to stick to my surgeon because it's fully covered and my family and I want to be near the hospital in case there is a problem even after months.
So my questions :
- What are the advantages of penile inversion over non penile inversion? I always see this question but the other way around so I'm curious.
- is the vagina less stretchable than the other technique? 
- is everything in place like in a cis woman anatomically ? 
- What about depth? How much can I hope to have?
- Is there a clitoris hood for this technique? From what is it made? From what is made the inner lips?
- Is 6 weeks of rest enough to go back to the university? 
- Can the vagina become wet with this technique? 
- Where the prostate is located compared to the vaginal walls?

Thank you for your answers."

OtomeOtome,asktransgender,Would a cis woman be able to get a more feminine/attractive voice using trans voice training exercises?,"This is kind of weird, but I've always been jealous of women with really beautiful speaking voices, so I wanted to see if I could improve mine. I tried researching what it is that makes a voice beautiful, and apparently it comes from having:

* High pitch
* Breathiness
* Wide formant spacing

The only resources on getting a more feminine *speaking* voice I've found have been by/for transgender women, so I've been wondering if they could be used by cisgender women too. For pitch, at least, I don't see any reason they couldn't be.

Two things I've noticed are that trans voice training doesn't seem to have any focus on formant spacing (is formant spacing unchangable?) On the other hand, it focuses a lot on resonance, which doesn't seem to be part of any vocal attractiveness studies (but is probably still important to having an attractive voice.)

What tools/resources would you recommend to a cis woman trying to make her voice more feminine? EVA seems like it would be good, but I don't have an iPhone (is there any way to run EVA on a PC?)"

Last week we did my hair really girly-like and I loved it (though I pretended to being doing it because she wanted to) and I feel like it would be helpful for me to have her teach me girly stuff.  She's not super girly but she's my only female friend that wears make-up on a regular basis and whatever.

Only problem is that her mom is super close with mine, and I don't want my mom to find out before I'm ready."
failtrocity,asktransgender,My SO recently came out as trans (mtf). I have a few questions on how to support her throughout transition,"First of all, thank you for being such a supportive community and my apologies if this is a repetitive topic, I did search a bit beforehand. 

My SO is the love of my life and we had talked previously of how she had sometimes thought of being a woman. Recently, it became more fitting for her and she came out to me (in the sweetest way). I told her right away that I love her for her and I really mean that. (I had always identified as asexual until I met her and we just clicked. We have known each other a very long time and have always been very synchronised and together). I guess it also made me feel more comfortable with my bisexuality. 

I am very happy with this. I love her immensely and it is very important to me that she can be who she is and so we have started with some baby transition steps (shaving, dressing etc). It has been really great to see her confidence grow (and how amazing she looks in a dress). 

SO has made it very clear to me that it doesn't change our engagement - she still wants to spend our lives together and I feel the same. 

I just have a few questions to make sure I can be as supportive as possible throughout transition. 

1. During transition, what should I be mindful of, particularly during hrt - how best can I support her? 

2. Are there any things your SO/supporters did for you (or you wish they did) to help you if hrt led to dysphoria or rough reactions from people? 

Thank you for your response, I really appreciate it. I love her so much and I want to make sure her transition can go as smoothly as possible. I know it is the beginning of a long journey but I am excited to join and support my future wife on it. 

Edit: Removed first question. Had been reading more and more stories of married couples and long term relationships and it helped make me feel more confident. It was more a passing concern that occasionally cropped up but not something I would ever act drastically on!

Edit 2: Thank you so much for your words of support and advice! It means so much to me how supportive this sub is. I teared up on the bus home, reading the comments. Thank you so much!

Edit 3: showed this to SO and she was really happy and touched by everyone's heartfelt advice and support. Thanks again : )"

Could the hormones be the reason we have the same scent?"
forty6_and_2,asktransgender,"First year of HRT under the belt, still nonpassing. What should I expect in the second year? Is there hope?","Background info: I started HRT at age 22, and am 12 months into it. My levels are all fine.

I visit the self esteem crushing r/transpassing a bit too much, and I've noticed some trends. Namely, most people who post pass relatively flawlessly, and that these people have generally been on HRT for less than a year. The people who post with longer transition times are usually closer to non-passing or still do not pass.

I understand the bias involved here regarding r/transpassing. I know it's not anywhere close to a representation of the trans population as a whole. My question is whether the second year of E can effectively continue/finish off the physical changes that it begun in year one to cross the threshold into passing (purely physically, obviously).

In other words, should the pathway to physical passing be measured in months or years?"
OnePunchRoxanne,asktransgender,Weight loss question,Will my shoulders get smaller when I lose weight? O.o
throwaway47548383,asktransgender,I have an issue with how friends perceive me,"I'm using a throwaway because of, well, reasons.

So, I transitioned a few years ago. My current main friend group didn't know me beforehand, but we met within a couple months of my starting HRT, so the fact that I am trans was known to them. Pronouns had to be corrected for a while, but otherwise they were all accepting.

About a year ago, I helped one of these friends (I'll call them A) with a project they were conducting on social issues that trans people face. I decided to give A the benefit of the doubt, having known her for quite a while now, and bared a bit more of my soul than I otherwise would have (with the caveat that they tell no one my identity). Everything went well. They were respectful. The world moved on. But since then, A keeps making comments like ""welcome to being a woman"" in relation to everything from being cold to being in a bad mood, despite the fact that I've been stealth for a good couple years! Another time was when I asked for help shopping, because I have horrible luck when it comes to clothing. I had to keep pointing out to A that I knew how women's sizing works, I had just fluctuated in weight and had no idea how anything would fit me.

One thing that has gotten under my skin is that I'm pretty sure they have told their other friends. These others are people I have only recently met, and they seem to not only know my trans status, but also certain details that no one should know. Other things aren't as overt, but I've overheard my name in the same conversation as trans topics more than once with (and not a broader LGBT one, either). This makes me feel paranoid, but it's happened enough that I am fairly certain.

Now, the one that really got to me. My friend A, myself, and some others had gotten together. At one point my SO was brought up, and I mentioned that she was sick - nausea, etc. A then asks if SO is pregnant. We all take it as a joke, laugh, but then A reiterates that she was really wondering. And to everyone but two people in the room, I had been a cis lesbian until that moment.

A is someone that has only known me post-transition. They have quite a few other lesbian friends. I feel like they keep looking at me as an ""other,"" or if they aren't, their comments sure make me feel that way.

I like A. They aren't bad. I have no idea how to bring this up without getting emotional and possibly mean about it, and it's making me resent them. And, to make it more difficult, cutting off A would more or less ostracize me from most of this friend group. But I have been outed too many times, and all of them are connected to A. I am tired of being reminded every moment I am with them that I am trans.

**TL;DR**: A friend appears to have outed me to others, and continually makes comments pointing to my trans status. I don't know how to handle the situation."
lovetehlolz,asktransgender,What am I? long rant,"So I've been lurking here for a month now after the last wave of questioning began. But first, some history.

I'm biologically a 21yo male, but I can remember as far back as childhood when I envied girls for various reasons. One thing I can remember was when I was quite young I actually cried when my mom had to correct me that I couldn't have/actually give birth to babies. In a lot of cases I always felt like ""I'd make a better girl"". When I play games or write stories I tend to chose to personify myself as a female protagonist. I tell people ""Oh it's just because it's funner to draw girls"" or ""Hey, if I'm gonna be looking at a character for 40 hours it might as well be a cute one."", things like that. Honestly, I feel more like it's just because I identify better that way.  When I was 16 I came VERY close to seeking guidance and confiding in somebody but my mom found a poem I'd written describing my feelings of  not fitting my sex and she lured me into a ""trip to the store"" on which she pulled into a parking-lot and began interrogating me. I chickened out and was in no mind to even discuss it. A while later I got a crush on a girl from my language class, as a homeschooler this was my first out-of-home class. I was like ""Ok, so I like girls, I can't be trans, right?"" Well, I eventually still wondered and used the guise of Halloween to try cross-dressing. I felt so good. But how could I come out if I really was trans? I have a job now, it's a small town, and my family would never understand. Flash forward to now, when I've had another wave of intense feelings that I don't belong as a 'man'. 

Recently the two things that triggered it was I was playing a game and as a joke, I RPed as this female character, Crystal Maiden and voice chatted everything in character, I WAS A GIRL AND I FELT SO FREE. But the match ended, and that was that, but i didn't want it to be. In the past I'd crossdressed when nobody was home, but I'd stopped but recently I discovered something that's been haunting me, when I masturbate, I get off more by 'being the woman' I never got off on blowjob porn r anything like that in the same way as a girl getting eaten out? Just a fetish right? RIGHT? When I masturbate, I always have preferred to grind on something, insertion feels 'proper' but has never felt 'natural', and now I find that I cum much harder when I just stop with using my hands as a 'vagina' and lie back and pretend I'm being penetrated, just a fetish? I hope. But when I think about he frame of mind I've often had when I wanked, I often, EVEN WHEN I CUPPED AROUND MY WIENER, was pretending I was a chick getting it doggystyle and that what I felt wasn't my wiener but the hand 'vagina' was my vagina and I was being penetrated. 

I can't stand to be seen shirtless, it's embarrassing when I'm at a pool and all the other guys have their shirts off but me. 


Lastly as for sexual orientation,  I actually have found that while as 'a guy' the idea of doing a guy isn't very appealing, if I just imagine that I'm a woman, I have like a split-off of myself that I'm like ""He's cute"" and I'm immediately filled with horror, shame and guilt. 

How can I be trans? I'm a guy, I've always been a chivalrous guy who just loves sensitive things right? Most guys probably think being a girl would be better right? Like EVERY guy would use one of his 3 genie wishes on that RIGHT? WHAT AM I??

I don't know what to do, my family is super important to me, but I'm afraid that my parents will disown me. I have chronic health problems and rely heavily on them. It's an immune issue and so if I get sick I need somebody there with me.  Or worse, I know my mom has said outright that transexuallity is simply a form of insanity, I heard that about twice a week when the whole ""Caitlyn Jenner"" thing was all over the news. 

Sorry if the formatting and writing is odd, I just needed to get this off my chest and to get advice, I DON'T want to be transgender, I just want to be ME. I have enough issues as it is and I'm scared. :(

beeasaurusrex,asktransgender,Entitled?,"My dad told me this morning I was 'reverse-bigoted' for giving my parents the ultimatum that either they needed to make an effort to gender me properly or I would remove myself from their lives.  I told them I'd always love them and that I didn't hate them if they made that choice, but I would love their support.

They treat my transition like a joke, and they all but roll their eyes when they correct themselves from 'she' or 'deadname' to 'he' or my gender-neutral nickname.  They outright refuse to use my chosen name.

Am I entitled?  I can see their point - it could seem a little unfair to someone who's never experienced dysphoria and has spent their whole lives being transphobic and homophobic to suddenly be expected to either lose their firstborn or have to change massive beliefs.  I certainly don't begrudge them honest mistakes, as long as they try, and correct themselves when they screw up.  And I've never yelled at them or anything for misgendering me, which they both admit I've been very polite about at all times.

Is it actually close-minded of me to not accept or allow people to make the choice to not gender me correctly?  I know in my rational mind when I'm away from my parents that it's healthy and okay for me to set those two options in front of them and hold firm.  But when they're sitting in front of me with that disapproval and disappointment in their eyes, reluctantly saying ""he"" and staring into space as though someone had a gun to their head...

I don't know.  I feel guilty."
lyaa55,asktransgender,Almost coming out story,"HI!

I'm a transfem person still kinda struggling to answer the question ""am I really doing this"" in the affirmative every twelve hours when I pop my 'mones.

A corollary of my uncertainty is not being ""out"" to my housemates.  We all just moved in together, and 2 of them, cis str8 guys, and I have been going out together fairly regularly.  I like them, and think i'll have a relatively easy time coming out to them (I was tempted to do so tonight).  In the meantime, I feel like i'm consciously ""not myself"" for the first time in my life.  Like, I just started thinking of myself as trans recently, and previously I would generally be like either ""oh I have social anxiety in a lot of contexts"" or ""i'm an eccentric guy so ofc i'll go out in fishnet stockings why do I only have fun at parties where I can dress up"" without even registering the gender issues I had going on.  I was pretty good at being clueless.

So anyway, I like my friends but in the gendered space of ""bros at a bar"" often feel v. awkward and unable to be my general charismatic self.  We live in NYC, and today we went out and there was a big group of trans women at the bar.  I wanted to talk to them, but worried both about appropriateness and probably more about outing myself.  I didn't wanna read as a chaser although i'm sure they would have read through my eggmode immediately.  I felt very jealous and thought back on my ""belle of the ball"" x-dresser days, when I did so so cluelessly and innocently, wishing I could be having fun at parties like that more often currently.

So idk!  Wanting to get on with things.  Wanting to make up my mind on the remaining indeterminacies (do I want to pause 'mones a moment and bank sperm? blech).  Realizing that while HRT has been really helping the debilitating anxiety I had been having, I still feel like I'm very routinely less than myself.  Starting an in-person trans support group in about a month.  I wanna make out with someone!

HammersAndBells,asktransgender,My Big Fat Trans Wedding. How to cope with dysphoria and shame?,"So this Friday I'll be marrying my amazing, beautiful partner of 8 years. She supports me for who I am, and who I want to become.

For the past six months I've been see-sawing between gender dysphoria on one side and shame, fear and internalized transphobia on the other. 

I've started HRT (mtf) for a month and stopped. The mask I've worn has fused with my face and prying it off is harder than I thought it would be.

Weddings are the ultimate gendered space and the pressure to conform to society's expectations was too much for me to resist. I am ruled by fear and shame of who I am.

Yet more people close to me now know and most are supportive. Many still do not know.

I love my partner and I'm so excited  to be celebrating our love. But I'm also feeling deep dread and dysphoria about the gendered character of the ceremony. It feels like it is the mask that will be getting married and not the real me.

You can see my previous post for more details and past history. I watched a Youtube video about indicators of wetter or not you are trans and the thing is, I dont hate my body... Im not really happy with it but I dont hate my body either,  I feel like if I was never able to transition or explore more feminine personality aspects, I would be ok with it, embrace stereotypical hyper masculinity and go with it. Also I am unsure about dysphoria... I don't think I ever get dysphoric, maybe on rare occasion I might feel a little jealous/ envious of a woman's physical aspects or clothing, but I am not sure that falls under dyunderia. I never really considered actually transitioning until recently, but, my desire to explore more feminine aspects, wear women's clothing, growing hair out, shaving... Comes in waves, usually a couple of days to a week and then it passes and feel like I should embrace masculinity.  Input, thoughts, personal experiences, and advice appreciated."

The problem is that doing said voice is incredibly fatiguing, to the point where it starts to decohere after 30-50 seconds of continuous talking. After a little while I can't do it at all anymore and I have to stop.

I am assuming that this gets easier with time as muscles and such strengthen or whatever? I figure it would, and certainly there are quite a few people on YouTube who seem to talk in their True Voice for eons at a time.

As I get closer I get angry my glove compartment and center console are open stuff strewn everywhere.  I guess I forgot to lock it I run through my head of all the things I'm there checking off what's still there. Minus some change everything is there except my bag.  I'm crushed this sucks so much I feel violated, and it feels personal  (I know it's not). Now I'm at work knowing this is one of the first times something so personal was stolen from me. The worst is the wig it's so hard to find good wigs and this one was given to me by a trans friend that had gotten it years ago and never worn it, so I don't even know where to begin looking for another. So here's to a shitty day hope yours is going better asktg"

However today I started HRT tablets and wondered how I'd go about taking them with me to America next year.

catfusion,asktransgender,"Vison/perception changes: Color, motion?","(Trans men, please read and post too - I'm very curious as to whether this is something any of you have experienced as well, maybe in a vice versa way.)

So the 'sense of smell gets better on estrogen' seems to be a real thing, if not one experienced by everyone, and it seems like women in general have a little keener sense of smell than men (I think there've been some studies on this, although I don't have links, and some of that stuff gets awfully essentialist and veers into Mars/Venus BS territory. Anyways.) 

In a similar vein, there have been some studies that show women in general have a little better perception of variations and differences in shades of color (although it's unknown how much of that is learned - professional wool dyers, regardless of gender, can discern more different shades than anyone else.)

But. My boyfriend was remarking on the similarity of the color of some colored pencils the other day, and to me, the difference in shade is obvious and pronounced. Again, no way to tell if that has to do with HRT, or practice, or just variations between humans that has nothing to do with gender, but it got me thinking.

Conversely, these kinds of studies show men responding to motion more. It's been speculated that this is why guys do that thing with the windshield wipers - on, off, on, off - and women, not so much, for example. And the really weird thing to me is *I did that thing* - the wipers drove me nuts. Now I'm like, 'It's raining, wipers on, good to go.' But I feel like I'm a little less likely to see something moving in the corner of my eye; another car changing lanes right at the edge of my field of vision, for example - which has necessitated a few changes in the way I drive (I've become my mom and double check before changing lanes...)

So.

Tl;dnr: **Has anyone here noticed any -perceptual- shifts/changes in their vision; more or less acute/obvious distinction between colors (magenta is not crimson!/they're both red) or sensitivity/awareness of motion, between prior and on HRT? "

TheMathCat,asktransgender,Explain to me what you think being transgender means?,"Hello Everybody,
Hopefully this post is not offensive to absolutely anybody, I am just genuinely curious. First off, I will say that I am incredibly supportive of everybody in the LGBT community and will always vehemently support them, however, I have honestly been confused lately to why you would want to change gender. I am probably just unbelievably naive, but instead of continuing to question myself, I decided to ask reddit. I myself grew up in an incredibly non-sexist household, I did some stereotypical ""girl things"", such as playing with dolls..., my sister did some stereotypical ""boy things"", my mom worked, my dad worked, my mom took care of us and my dad took care of us, so I have never really thought of myself as a boy, but as as just me instead. Thus, gender identity seems incredibly foreign to me. I have always thought myself to be a boy, because that's what I was biologically said to be, but I never thought it changed who I actually was, so I am curious as to why a transgender person would desire to change their gender, why does it even matter? I feel that I am uniquely who I am and that you are uniquely who you are, so I guess I have in my naivety always assumed that gender was purely biological, but I am learning that it is not, so I would like to know what it is.  Is it simply because of culture and stereotypes or is there something much more that I am missing? I hope, hope, hope that I have not offended anybody and if I have, please tell me why and I will change how I say it for the future. I respect and support transgender people, but am curious about the topic.      "

This evening I was chatting to a friend which suddenly turned to me and said that she wasn't happy with her body and had tried binding with ducktape causing whole pieces of skin to get ripped off her body. ��

So together we have set on a mission to find her a proper binder!
Only thing is.. she never really tried on and I am MtF so that isn't really helping here.

So does anyone know a store online or offline (preferably offline so she can try fitting one) where they sell binders in the Netherlands??

e1iza,asktransgender,Are these initial dosages normal? (MtF),"About a week ago I met with a doctor to get a prescription for hormones for the first time.

She said she likes to start patients off slowly but I can't shake the worry that I'm getting a small dose. To be fair, it was one of the things I was paranoid about before even visiting.

ImTheAriana,asktransgender,Transgender men and women 'are actually a combination of the two'.,"I came across this YouTube video of the famous show Loose Women (the British version of The View) and this clip is kind of old now but something that was said in it upset me. The women on the panel were discussing Caitlyn Jenner and the TERF feminist Germaine Greer and most agreed that Caitlyn Jenner should not NOT get the Espy award for Glamour Woman Of The Year 2015. And at the end of the video the woman says that transgender men and women 'are actually a combination of the two'. One of the women said they wouldn't accept a transgender as a woman, they would only see her as a transgender woman. There are a ton of offensive things Said. One even said that she is afraid to say anything about the transgender community because if she says the wrong thing we  as transgender people will go crazy!

DoIHaveDysphoria1,asktransgender,Does this sound like dysphoria?,"I can't seem to recognise that I have gender dysphoria even after living as a female and starting hormones soon, wearing makeup, etc. I'm not sure if this is dysphoria.

Another example is I think about how masculine I think my face looks (even though people tell me they don't understand why people clock me and how people perceive me as male). Then there is another example where I don't like to talk in public very often in case someone hears me and thinks 'that's a man's voice' or 'that doesn't sound like a woman'.

privateaccount95,asktransgender,High school and just general trans issues,"So I'm a junior in high school and I feel like this is the year that I need to start transitioning or this will be it, so I guess I should get to it.



* My parents. I expect them to be pretty accepting (here is to hoping) my big issue right now is how to come out though. I am thinking I will write a letter but I have no idea what it should say.



* My friends. Not like there are many to begin with amiright? I don't know what to do here really. For the most part I am the unnoticeable one in the group that gets forgotten and so people don't really talk to me that often so I don't really have any friends that I am that close to. I still feel like I should talk to maybe 1 or 2 of them but should I do that before or after coming out to my parents?




* School. This is where things get fun! Should I just keep to myself and not say anything? Start wearing baggier clothing so if I start developing breasts no one will notice? I don't really have much social dysphoria, just physical so I would probably be fine there.



* Gym. At my school changing is mandatory for gym. Would I be better off talking to the school before hand and trying to work something out there? Changing in the boy's locker room doesn't seem like a good idea and neither does changing in the girl's. 



* Doubts. I feel as though if I do transition (which I hopefully will) I will just look like some half boy half girl amalgam forever. What if I somehow look worse that I already do (if that is even possible)? 



I don't really know what to do, this whole idea is terrifying to me which means I will probably never actually go through with it. I will just be stuck like this forever and hate myself for it. "

kiDsALbDgC9QmLFiIrrj,asktransgender,Is it a mistake to start hormone without any real life experience?,"So, I've recently gotten the energy (chronic depression is a bitch) to make some real, concrete steps in my transition. I've been feeling more and more confident in my identity, and I'm tired of just sitting around thinking about it.

I've set a soft deadline to get myself on hormones by Halloween. I think this might be a little too ambitious, but I need something to aim for.

I mentioned this to a friend of mine, and she told me to make sure I go out a few times /en femme/ before I start.

This does kind of present a few problems. 

First of all, the thought of going out in girls clothes as I am now, for all the public to see me, is terrifying. 

Second of all, I'm not sure when I could do this. My job takes up all my time on the weekdays, and I hang out with my friends (most of whom I'm not out to) on the weekends. I'm just not sure when I could do this. 

She suggested that I should dress feminine with my friends. But I really don't think I'm ready to do something like that (I only recently worked up the courage to let one friend see me in an outfit I bought, and I'm not sure she was totally comfortable with the experience).

At the same time, doesn't the fact that I'm not willing to show this side of myself to my friends suggest that I'm not ready for something like hormones?

Is it a good idea to do hormones without having dressed in public first?

alfox086,asktransgender,Sure about my sexuality but still questioning my genre,"Long story short: Last year I was decided to make transition, passing from a therapist, crossdressing myself, even made appointment with the endocrinologist but at the end I cancel it all. The reason? I met my actual boyfriend, and he show me that what I need in reality was someone who likes me for what I already am emotional, physical and sexualy.

Fast Forward to the present: I'm pretty secure I don't want to make transition at this moment, learn to love being what I born, but I'm still questioning something pretty strong inside me and I still cant figure why I love and admire, even envy the female figure, but I don't really like women (even have mother issues)

I adore, envy, even desire to been born with a delicate slim body, hairless, being a twink, have effeminate characteristics, long hair, female mannerism, even being a trap only because I can (I have such envy and jealousy of all of those femboys and traps on tumblr), that is my definition of perfection. My boyfriend is the incarnation of that ideal, and he hates it for some reason I don't understand, he is beauty.

I like men, being one, learn to love my body for what it is, but still don't understand why I still this envy, this desire to being what I never can be. It is my age (I am 30 and think I lose all hope and accept my appearance fate)

I contacted my doctor and she said it wasn't one of the side effects to be worried about.  Some websites listed ""side pain"" as a side effect of spiro but don't give any information.

flacdada,asktransgender,So I've been avoiding this subreddit on my subscriptions...but there's no denying it anymore.,"I'm just a girl.

That seems so awesome to say!  

I have been slowly realizing this and denying this as I move from genderqueer to in the middle to leaning female to this.  It's been something that Ive been struggling with for a while. 

That final jump didn't come easy for me to realize that I'm just happier when people perceive me as female.  I've been avoiding this sub because it's something I don't want to think about much. You guys are fantastic and fabulous and beautiful and insightful.  I was scared of calling myself female because that ballgame is so much more challenging than just kinda eh about being male but it's me.  I like being called a girl.  I like thinking of myself as a girl. I don't like being perceived as male and I don't like thinking of myself as male. My dysphoria is mental and social as opposed to physical.  My body is just this vehicle which with my brain travels around in. 

Right now a variety of carefully picked people know this.  My lgbt friends and my one school friend.  It's awesome because everyone is being supportive. One friend, my one trans ftm friend is awesome.  He's just like ""you go girl"" and I respond with gigantic smiles.

Now I am working on what it means to be u/flacdada the girl? I don't like a full time transition, I don't like super feminine things.  Medical transition isn't for me. We will see for me but for now.

DanielleBasel,asktransgender,FFS with Dr. Bart van de Ven at 2pass clinic - Part 1,"Now it's nearly three years ago I decided that I wanted to undergo an FFS. After that decision I dived deeper and deeper into everything related to FFS. And as more as I studied that matter, as more complex it got. But I wanted to understand what can be achieved and what would make sense in different situations.

After that long time of study I had an idea what I wanted to have done in my face. During the same time of study I followed endless blogs with reviews about different surgeons and their techniques. I tried to collect all informations about each surgeon and surgeon team, which seemed to be worth to have a look at. And so I made a small database with pros and cons of each surgeon and their technique used for every separate part of the face. At the end I started with contacting each surgeon and/or team to see them personally in a personal consultation. So I had appointments all around the globe... some by personally traveling to them and others trough ismple skype chats. Thailand, Korea, Belgium, Spain, Argentina and last but not least the United States.

I compared what each surgeon suggested to have done with what I thought should be done, prices and reputation.
Horror stories I found for every single of ""my"" surgeon, so I tried to look and weight them very carefully as well.

So I learned as well, that the personal esthetic point of view is something very subjective and important as well. So I tried to get also feedback from others about my research to see what they think and feel about something specific.

After all I decided to undergo my FFS in Antwerp at the 2pass clinic with Dr. Bart van de Ven and his Team...

Here's my story.. I'm a 24 year old guy who's married. I love my wife and would never hurt her intentionally. She's my world. Been together 4 years married 1.

My whole life I've struggled with my sexuality and who I am. Recently the urges to dress up in female clothes are so strong I can't contain it. I don't wear them for pleasure but because they look good and I feel good. 

When I have sex I imagine I'm the female, I think about how I'd look as a female and this makes me happy. I want to tell my wife how I feel except she would probably leave me. The thought of telling her scares me to the point that I have a mini panic attack.

The idea being that cisgender people reading it could maybe get a feel for what it's currently like to be trans in real life. (change of perspective)

And written in such a way that trans people would enjoy reading it too, recognizing what they go through except on the opposite end of things.

What do you think? Would you read it?"
Atreyawise,asktransgender,Fertility storage options? – Philly area?,"So as the title states, I am interested in fertility storage options relevant to the Philadelphia area.

I am currently a patient of Dr. Fellows at the Mazzoni Center in Philadelphia and he recommended Fairfax Cyrobank as per the Mazzoni's trans resource guide. I was wondering what other people have chosen to do for their fertility storage options, especially in the Philly area.

If you could share your recommendations, opinions, costs, suggestions, etc. about fertility storage I would sincerely appreciate it.

Thanks.

oxoaro,asktransgender,Is it reasonable to start HRT while living at home?,"For some backstory, I'm 22 (MtF) and I currently live at home with my parents. My father is very against anything LGBTQA+, and he's also very controlling. I think my mother would be supportive but I don't think I could tell her without my father finding out. I have a reasonable amount of income that I could use to pay for HRT (along with a medical plan that would cover most) but my account is still under my parent's name, and my father checks it every now and then. I live in BC, in the greater Vancouver area.

Would it be reasonable/possible for me to start HRT in this scenario? I'm getting more dysphoric and stressed, and I feel like I need to start doing something soon."

weightymtf,asktransgender,"MTF's, has anyone else been overweight prior or during their transition and decided not to lose weight?","For disclosure, I'm 5'7 and 198 lbs and when I started i was 145. I was somewhat skinny but hated my appearance. I never grew facial hair and I always had soft skin... It seems obvious but I was in such denial and ignorance that even though I had gynecomastia, I kept thinking all the time ""Why aren't my breasts bigger?"" 

Obviously this lead to depression and weight gain (overeating, etc). When I finally got treatment for this problem, I found out my testosterone level was like 220 or 230 ng/dL, which is very low apparently. So being on HRT, I went from 160 to 198 as I type this. 

Obviously I'm pretty heavy. But looking at my old photos, it's like a completely different person. I have a huge butt now, and thighs. My breasts are a 38D. I had a big belly before I started transition, but despite the fat redistribution its to the point where it hangs over my skirt, or my pantyline even. I usually wear conservative attire, partially due to my personality and preference, partially due to work to minimize this (hi-brief panties, pantyhose, knee length skirt, shirt, blazer, flats, you get the idea)

The point is, despite my distaste for my stomach, I'm more comfortable with my body than I've ever been. No one outside of my family or my close friends knows about my transition, or what I look like before. Everyone knows me as what I know I am, a woman.  I'll always have dysphoria but the worst of it is gone. I'm worried if I lose weight it might come back and I'm comfortable with myself. Has anyone else felt or done the same? "
LameBuzzard,asktransgender,Preferred name on work ID?,"Been on hormones for 3 months.

I do go by my preferred name when introducing myself to people even if I'm not presenting especially feminine. So I rarely use my legal name save for formal stuff. 

K so I recently started work at a relatively high security job location which requires me to wear a work ID. ITS KIND OF A BUMMER that is has my legal name on it and after asking 2 people there and receiving inconclusive answers usually asking me to ask someone else I figured I'd ask you peeps. IS IT REASONABLE/allowable or I guess is there precedent for having my preferred name on a work ID even though it differs from my drivers license/birth certificate. The only reason I gave my legal name to begin with was because the application specified for it then neglected to ask preferred name (as is usually the case when distinction is made)  messeged HR (outsourced so reached with much difficulty) about it and they said they noted my preferred name on my profile. No they did not. So for now everyone's calling me Thomas and its lame and makes me feel gross."

xJustxJordanx,asktransgender,Serious question about taking things a bit too seriously.,"Okay, I'm a straight guy. I'm a straight ally. I'm libertarian.
What I am NOT is good with being politically correct in my vernacular regarding the LGBT community. It isn't through hate, it is through ignorance and lack of exposure. So moving forward, please excuse me if I said something insensitive. I promise I just didn't know any better. 

I have a friend (Mark for sake of argument), that is gay. He has a job, is studying at university, has a steady boyfriend, etc. Dresses like a dude, works on his own car, etc. 

I once had a roommate who identified as male-to-female trans, who was interested in men. No job, no school, performed in drag shows, only hung out with other trans peeps or dudes who did drag (know I'm missing the proper vernacular there), met doods of craigslist who were interested in people like her (James, er Michelle). She insisted I use Michelle, which is fine. But she made no attempt at being passable unless she was going to a gay club. No makeup/wig/clothing to suggest it, no hormones, no surgery. It was odd. Oh yea, my question.

I love my friend Mark, but could not stand my roommate Michelle. The only way I could think to explain it is that Mark was ""a person who happened to be gay"". Had a life, goals, aspirations outside of his orientation, real depth as a human being. Conversely, all Michelle was concerned with was her orientation/identification. That was the only aspect of her personality. She was just ""a trans person"".

How do people on this side feel about this distinction? Is there a more polite way to put it? Do people that are more like Mark distinguish themselves from people like Michelle? Is there a term for it?

Example: The Orlando Nightclub shooting. Someone tweeted ""Angry straight people, please stop shooting my people"" and I was offended. I'm angry and straight and know at least 100 straight people id shoot long before I randomly shot up a gay club.

Okay, I've ranted long enough, begin discussion.

tl;dr - Any difference between ""a person who happens to be LGBT"" and ""a person who's only concern is being LGBT""? Is the latter a negative connotation in this community? "

Grassgrenner,asktransgender,What is going on with me? Am I trans or very sexist?,"I just found this place a few moments ago, read some information about it and decided to ask this because I'm very lost and have no idea about who could be able to help me with that. 

I'd rather not give so much information on such personal matter in public, but I bet there are other people on the same situation as I am and are afraid to ask this. So, a little background: I was assigned female at birth and have been comfortable with this gender role. Of course, I wasn't a big fan of makeup or dresses, but nothing out of usual. It changed on my pre-teens when my body began to show more feminine traits. I do not feel disgust or like the body is not supposed to belong to me. The problems arised because of the way other people were reacting to it. By the way, I wasn't exposed to strong female characters very often, probably because I avoided it... 

Anyway, soon I learned through the media, my family and my own life experiences that women were inferior to men. Females cannot be strong, independent and rational. Males can't be sensible, caring and loving. I internalized those feelings for a very long time. It eventually led me to think that I'm not worth and that every single time I was ""attacked"" by a man was because I was foolish by trying to make friends with people that can only see women as their toys. 

I felt like transitioning after figuring out it was possible and the results appeared to be just good enough. I'm afraid of ending up by bringing more problems to me though. I don't really want to feel trapped inside my body or a fake identity. This issue is probably even one of the main causes for my self esteem issues and... Well, I really don't know what to do. I do know that this is only internalized sexism, but I don't know what to do. Do you have any advice? How did you became comfortable enough with the person you are to show them to the world? I'm sorry if I got it wrong... I'm just lost. If you know somewhere else that could help me better, I'd appreciate it."

Lately it seems after I finish, my body image of being female is harder and takes longer to shake, especially the feeling of having ""phantom boobs"" or feeling I'm missing something there.

1ghz_or_faster,asktransgender,Am I overreacting? (Co-workers misgendering),"So I got a weird situation at work and it's making me really upset. (Worked there for over 10 years, 400+ people factory, if that can help the context.) I've been out and presenting female for about 1.5months now and ""everything"" is fine. No insults, no harassment, not even weird looks. People are actually very supportive. They call me by my new name, Jessica, and mostly use female pronouns when talking directly to me. 


BUT. It came to my ear more than once that when I'm not there, they misgender me constantly! Ex.: Someone asked my boss ""Did you ask Jessica for the overtime tonight?"" and my boss said ""He said no."" ...wtf... I'm pretty sure it's not said in a way to insult me or to actually misgender me. More like a nonchalant misgendering, like it's not really important to call me she if I'm not there. But this makes me mad! Mostly because I have no power over this.


What should I do? Give them more time to adapt? Should I just not care (at least they respect me to my face)? I correct them immediately if it happens to my face, but if nobody gives a fuck when I'm not there, they'll be calling me ""he"" forever (?).

AngstyCanadianTeen,asktransgender,Questions on name change,"So I'm 17, MTF, pre-HRT and out to my immediate family (Mom, Dad, and sister) and a select few friends. Right now I'm still identifying as male (mostly for school and work) but I'm considering changing my name soon (or at least telling people that I've chosen a new name)

I've pretty much decided on the name Harmony kind of because it's symbolic to who I am (like how in music a harmony isn't needed but can make a piece better, I'm not needed in my group of friends, but I make the group better). I'm just not sure if it's really the name that I want since I had already decided on a completely different name (Zoey) about a month ago. 

My mom suggested just going with Jo, since my birth-name is Joseph. I just told her I'd think on it, but in my head was saying ""no fuck that"".

So, question 1: did any of you have any ""issues"" like this when deciding on a new name?
Question 2: what do you think of my choice?"
g4_,asktransgender,Dear Deadname,"I received your letter. It was really hard for me to read. Honestly, it gave me a headache. I did find a contradiction in it, though. You said that male hormones wouldn't help you feel like a man, but then you said since you began taking female hormones, you have felt feelings like you've never felt before.

I have been told you think I don't love you and that is not true. I love you more than anyone else does. I haven't tried to make all of this about me, but you have torn my heart to pieces. I am devastated beyond belief. People at church wonder why I cry all the time. I haven't told them. You have broken your mother's heart. And your grandparents' too. The only grandchild they can be close to is your sister. Your cousins live across the country, only come around for Christmas, or are stuck in a custody battle between their parents (which is causing everyone lots of pain). Your grandma said she felt like she lost you. She said it reminds her of losing and not seeing your half-siblings when your father and I divorced (she loved them as if they were her own grandchildren). You just don't understand the devastation your family feels. 

This has been a sorrowful year. Your sister has had such a hard pregnancy. We were all so excited about the baby girl, then you come along with your news and devastated the whole family. You brought such a cloud over us all and took away our joy over the new baby coming. We should have been focusing on that, but you made us all so worried and concerned about your mental health and your body. 

What I think happened is that you didn't know what an evil thought could do as a child. You thought you were a girl, and when you were told you were a boy, you just accepted it. But in the back of your mind you dwelt on the thought that you were a girl. When you dwell on things, Satan works on you and your mind. The Bible speaks about this and how we should dwell in spiritual things. We must guard our hearts and minds or Satan will work on us, causing us to make bad decisions. You dwelt on this and now it's taking over your life. 

Your obsession with thinking you are female blinded you to reality. You withdrew from everything, either to hide how you were feeling or because you couldn't face the truth. I'm sorry you robbed yourself of happiness. I thought you were just shy or socially awkward. I was like that as a child. I didn't know you were gender confused. You were such a good baby, toddler, and young boy. So loving. I enjoyed your company and tried to be a good mom. Tried to make sure you had everything you needed, that you went to church, that we ate meals together, that we did special things together like birthday parties. Apart from the divorce, you had a very normal life. I loved you. I still love you. I feel like maybe you don't love me because you are so focused on yourself, how much you wanted this for yourself, fearing how I would think it was wrong. You built up a resentment towards me for something I knew nothing about. You dwelt on this non-reality, and instead of coming to me to seek the help you need, you entertained them. 

It's unnatural, what you're feeling and thinking. Similarly to the unnatural affection of homosexuals. I don't believe this is of God (your feelings like a girl). Your gender was determined in my womb and you were born a biological male. To change that would be a rejection of the truth and rebellion against God. He designed you as male, period. You can't determine gender from feelings and it's definitely not fluid. Your sister is having a baby girl, and we know that from the ultrasounds which show the body of a female. You're a male. You have the body of a male. 

It is not unloving for me to tell you this because it's the truth. I'm telling you the truth in love. It is unloving for people with agendas to tell you that you can change your gender. They don't love you, they're not concerned about your soul, and more than likely they really don't care what God thinks. If you sought Godly counsel, as the Bible says to do, you would find that true Godly people like ministers would counsel you against this, and help you deal with it in a positive way. With your family's love and support, plus the help of good psychiatric care, we can help you through this, just like another family at church is helping their daughter with her battle with anorexia. They didn't let her give in to the notion that she was fat or let her starve. They sought treatment for her to eat and accept her body. I will get that help for you, my son, because I love you. I believe you can overcome this through strength in Christ. The Bible says we have strength and prayer through Jesus and the Holy Spirit. If you pray, read the Bible, and ask God for help in getting through this and to accept the body He gave you, He will give you the strength to overcome this confusion. 

I will help in any way I can. There's a clinic near you in CA, it's 3 or 4 days long. I will pay for you to go. They evaluate the whole person and they will determine if you are female or male.

Deadname, you are only a female in your thoughts. It isn't reality. Remember the story of the emperor who got new clothes? Everyone told him how beautiful the clothes were, when in reality, he was wearing nothing. They played along to appease the emperor. It was a small child who said that the emperor was actually naked. Who was more loving here, the people who lied or the child who told the truth? 

One time I said sometimes the truth is ugly. Someone quickly corrected me and said no, the truth is always beautiful. A lie is what's ugly. Jesus is the truth. Trust in what is truth. 

The truth is that you're a male. You always have been. Gender confusion is an emotional issue. Emotional issues can be overcome with the right counseling and sometimes medicine, lots of love, prayer, family and friends, and church family.

No one wants to see you go through this and see you struggle. If you continue down this path, the true and honest God-loving people will see you as you truly are,  someone who is confused and needs help. You will always be a man. You will always be a man who is pretending to be a woman, wanting everyone to just play along. It just isn't right. I'm begging and pleading you, Deadname, to stop this change. As your mother, I'm asking you to do this for me. I know you have the strength to fight it inside of you. You are a very strong-willed person, just like your father. You also act like him a lot, you're very smart, and you have a lot of his characteristics that I don't think you'd have if you were a girl. Deadname, you have to trust me on this. I'll get you the help you need.

I pray for you all the time. I have always prayed that you would find a nice Christian girl, fall in love, and things would he okay. I know you loved your ex-girlfriend so much. Just because she ended up not being a good person and things didn't work out doesn't mean there isn't better for you out there. If you don't want to be a father, you don't have to be. You don't even have to get married. But I'm asking you to stop doing this. 

With the right counseling and therapy, you can be reconciled to your body. Nothing is too hard for God. Through his strength and blessings, you can overcome this. 

I pray for you, I love you. I am here for you. I will pray for your heart, mind, and soul. I love you very much! 

Love, 

Mom"
Skylarskye,asktransgender,I'm writing a paper trying to explain what it means to be transgender but I don't know where to start,"I'm writing a paper for a class about the word ""transition"" and its significance in society. so I'm talking about the lgbt community, specifically the transgender community. While I may not be exactly cis, i'm not exactly trans either, so I want to be sure what I'm saying is right, and the terminology is correct.
How do I explain what it means to be transgender? Cause like, saying ""Born (this gender) but transitioned to (this gender)"" doesn't really work? cause 1st, that's rather insensitive to this very sensitive subject, and saying they were born a certain gender kinda obliterates the fact that they are in fact, not their designated gender at birth?"

I can't hate my body, I can't hate my masculine behaviors, I can't hate my the way I was born, heck I can't even hate myself for my ability to gloriously fuck up 90% of my interpersonal relationships because I can't shutup. And I can't hate myself because I can't hate myself. Like I can hate other people and things no problems, I usually hate them vigorously and mercyless, but hating myself? Thats a nono. My best guess is that its a relic from my past times, I remember getting a lot of flack all around for just being plain weird from parents and other kids, so I ended up embracing staying true to myself, instead of trying to force myself to change for others. I guess my brain just lucked out eh?

I've also heard that transitioning more to the female side may lower libido, but I don't really want it to lower as I enjoy it as it is right now.

So what I want to ask is, is it possible to get what I mentioned in the second paragraph? Feminine in a lot of ways with breasts, curvier body with less hair and such, while still having my dick functional (and possibly fertile)?

I feel like im making this harder on myself since I feel like Im in the middle of things, neither male nor female alone, so some help would be appreciated. Also I know very litle on the whole transitioning bit when it comes to what to take and such, but I want this cleared out first to know if I should even bother :(

But I first found him posting himself on websites such as craigslist and what not only looking for women , soon it became TS. One specific email back to him was a man asking him to do DISGUSTING things to him in exchange for money. I later found him having conversations on KIK, via email etc with what I'm almost sure are trans women And his only concern was to make sure they had tits. That was all. We did break up for this matter(not that I have a problem with the trans family) I just want someone who's about me and only about me. But we did get back together and now things are getting weird . He's doesn't seem to want to touch me and when he does it seems forced or just wants to touch my asshole.  He seems angry with me at all times. And he locks himself in the bathroom or our spare bedroom for so long every morning and every night for more than a normal time frame . I have confronted him about what I have found and what people are saying because somehow people are finding the same info I am but when confronted he gets defensive and all he does is explain how many ""bad bitches"" he can get with.

2. My ribs. I can't even really imagine what boobs would look like on this giant torso.

3. Hips. This might be my biggest dysphoria, except that HRT has a better chance of balancing the scales here a bit. Plus, my butt is pretty okay.

4. Body hair. Another huge problem, though relatively easy to fix (if only I could build the courage to come out and move forward...)

5. My junk. The junk itself is whatever; not ideal but not a huge dysphasia for me. What bothers me more is that yoga pants will never really work for me, and just throwing on a pair of panties, even if tucked, never fits quite right. :(

Theres a reason I have been very tired for the past few days,  and it isn't for any reason you might think. I've been very nervous about how to tell everyone this and have been losing sleep over it. I've been extremely nervous these past few days because I knew that I was going to explain soon. 

I'm transgender. I feel that I was supposed to be female and I have always known something was wrong, but I only figured out what it was when I was about 13. I learned how to hide this because I knew that it would change a lot of things between all of our relationships. I decided to come out now because I would like to start taking HRT before my puberty is fully done, as that is the only way to come out of this looking good and being confident in my appearance, and not just looking androgenous. 

I have looked at multiple websites to see that HRT does not conflict with any way with any of my current medications. I'm not sure if our insurance will cover it fully, but from what I can tell it is around $10 a month for the pills. I am willing to make sacrifices and take on more responsibilities for this, as I need this and don't just want this. 

I know that you probably think this is just a phase, but I assure you that it's not. I truly want this and have wanted this for a long time now. That is not going to change. This is not a disease or a mental illness and no amount of therapy is going to change how I feel about this. I am fully aware of the strains it will put on my life and I am prepared to take that. It will be a much easier strain than it has been keeping this locked up. 

Know that in no way shape or form is this any of your faults, and I am still and always will be the same Dante that you have known for 16 years. 

I know that this may take a while for you to process, but I have been waiting a long time already, and I can wait a bit more. Please come talk to me about all this. I want to clear up any questions you may have. 

Below I'm going to put some links to websites where you can read more about why some people (including me) feel this way.

[deleted],asktransgender,[Online Dating] Does identifying as a cis-woman vs. just writing 'woman' make it harder for transwomen?,"Originally posted at /r/OKCupid.

I know, neurotic. But I've been wondering for a while.

Does listing myself as 'cis' place an unfair expectation on trans women to identify? Does not listing myself as 'cis' make it more difficult for transwomen who don't want to write that they're trans in their gender field (even if they mention it elsewhere), because I'm perpetuating that 'woman' = cis by default? Is there some sort of consensus on this issue that no one told me about?

carefreearchgeek,asktransgender,So I spoke to my doctor last week and she seems like she won't be an arse about this,"I wasn't going for the GIC referral just yet (UK NHS process) but I thought as I was going in anyway for other stuff I'd talk to her about this and let her find out what she needs to, and to see if she's likely to be obstructionist or difficult over this. In the appointment it turned out she's referred people before, but none of her patients got as far as the GIC appointment (I think that means they cancelled it, didn't ask). She was a little behind on the protocol, thought she had to refer me through mental health services, and before I left she said she'd check what the 'local' protocol was, which I took to mean she'd still want to refer me through mental health.

Anyway this morning I got a call from the health centre, she's checked and she'll be happy to refer me directly once I'm ready. So I'm overall optimistic about this, feeling better (especially considering I nearly threw up before going into the appointment)."

Kasurin,asktransgender,I´M IN RAGE!! (rant),"Okaay, I never thought I would ever rant on here, BUT OH WELL.

I just had a discussion with my father and I´M SICK OF THIS!!

A little background :

I´m 21, 4,5 month on HRT. I came out first when I was 15 to my dad. He did brush it off saying it´s a puperty phase and with no support I kinda went back in the closet. I came out offically exactly a year ago, again first to him. His response was that he doesn´t like it.

He´s completely uneducated and missinformed about trans issues. He dosn´t bother to educate himself, so the first weeks after I came out I had to deal with a shitload of transphobic comments and endless ""are you sure!?"", ""I think you´re too young to decide that!"" talks. THANKS A LOT!

I asked my parents a few times to call me by my chosen name. They always just replied with things like ""We need time"" or ""When it´s legally changed.."", so I didn´t even bother with it. 

One time I had a fight with them and my father started using my female name, but used it in a way to make fun of me. USING A NAME TO MAKE FUN OF SOMEONE AND PROVOKING THEM! HOW LOW CAN YOU GET!?

Well whatever.. Today he offered me to call me by my name, but he forgot it so I told him. After that he called me by my deadname multiple times again (he was drunk, so probably no ill intent), but I thought, I´ll try correcting him and see how it goes. 

He replied with ""He needs time"". No probs with that, buuut.. directly after that he said that with my **DECISION** I´ve been causing trouble to everyone else. BECAUSE OF ME EVERYONE ELSE HAS PROBLEMS AND THAT SHOULD BE MY RESPONSIBILITY AND I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL!! GRATEFUL THAT THEY STARTED ""ACCEPTING ME"" AFTER A YEAR OF MAKING ME OUT TO BE A MENTALLY ILL MAN. I can understand when people need time to get used to it or even when they don´t understand it.. but when you love someone you accept them for who they are and CERTAINLY DON´T EXPECT THAT THEY´RE GRATEFUL TO BE WOTHY OF THEIR SO CALLED ACCEPTANCE. Literally all the time I tried to say, that it´s a medical condition and I´m not mentally ill, he interfers saying ""stop that!"" extremly angry telling me again that it´s MY DECISION and (not his exact wording, but what he meant) :""Other people have a better image of you. they see you as a guy and they´re right. You can do what you want, but you´re delusional. You don´t live in reality!"". What kind of acceptance is that!? That they think I´m crazy, but they won´t stop me?? Should I be thankful for someone telling me they´re kind enough to not ruin my life, while telling me I´m to blame for everything!!? WTF? WTF? WTF? WTF?

I don´t care if they accept me, really. Misgendering is annoying, but whatever. Once I´m out I´ll cut contact with everyone who dosn´t want to adapt to name and pronouns, anyways..

But a whole year and they´re no further from day 1. Never even trying to use my name or the right pronouns, never bothering even listening when I tried explaining it to them. Not even informing themself about the topic and expecting me to thank them for ""accepting"" me. IT MAKES ME SO MAD. I know that they care for me as their ""child"", but this shows me, THEY DON´T CARE FOR ME AS A PERSON. 

Ahhhhhh... I wish there was an offline mode and only friends mode for real life."

The problem is that this location just so happens to use the lab I work in as a reference lab (they send all their samples there). If I was out, this would not be a big deal; however, I am closeted and would like to remain that way. I know that my tubes will be seen in sample processing with estradiol orders on them. I also know that when my sample goes through our analyzer, since I am marked as male in the system, the results will likely be flagged in the system for human follow up (instead of being automatically, and quietly, added to my chart). 

I'm not quite sure what to do. Any advice would be great. "
lilyhasasecret,asktransgender,To give cis people are reference point.,"If a cis person couldnt understand how trans people felt but were willing to try what would you have them do? 

The obvious answer would be to make them live as the opposit sex for a time but not everyone can afford a wardrobe all at once. How would you modify this idea?"

Firstly, since this post isn't a question, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post this, but if it isn't please go ahead and toss this :)

Today at college, I had really bad chocolate cravings (yay depression) and I vocally shared my cravings with my class. We're a small group of video game design students, and I'm quite comfortable around them. 

One of the guys in class, who is condescending anf a bit of a twat, immediately sniggers. ""Women,"" he said. I look at him, slightly taken aback. ""What?""

""You're a girly guy,"" he said, clearly trying to hit my ego. Do note, I'm pre-everything, still questioning. 

I felt a pang of happiness. Internally I simply laughed and thought, thanks! Externally I laughed and played it off. 

My girlfriend, who's trans too, thinks I have feminine traits too!

Anyway, I am very athletic and have the possibility to go D1 for Track almost anywhere and a goal between me and a close friend (we're only close because of this common goal) is to qualify for the Olympics. It doesn't matter if we went out in prelims, we made it there and there's a big sense of pride that would be unfathomable just to make it there.

Why is this a conflict? My dysphoria is killing me and I don't know how long I can go with this but if I transitioned I wouldn't be able to compete at this level anymore. I'll lose all my testosterone etc so I wouldn't perform at a men's level but I couldn't compete with other women because I'm born genetically different? Is this a thing?

I looked in the mirror today, and I saw a cute girl. Maybe I can just be that cute girl? I've been wearing binders exclusively for most of a year, but I'm tempted to go get a bra and some more feminine clothes. Did I just convince myself I was trans? Did I talk myself into dysphoria?

I'm so confused. What if I go on testosterone and it's not what I want? My voice will be changed forever. If I make a mistake, it is permanent. Am I just psyching myself out? What is going on?"
Alice_Ex,asktransgender,It just seems to be getting worse and worse.,"This obviously isn't a question.
 
I've been on HRT for 2 years and 8 months.
 
I wish I could say it's been a long wild ride, but it hasn't. It's been a monotonous block of depression waiting for my features to become feminine enough that I feel comfortable being outside.
 
Well. That day is never coming.
 
I started on my twentieth birthday but I wouldn't be happy unless I had started at 11. Every day I see some kind of transphobic post on the internet, I usually try to put in my 2 cents to educate people. But my soul is rubbed raw. I think I just literally cannot take it anymore.
 
https://imgur.com/gallery/wlMnU Look at these comments. (*Note: this is not me. Just a post I found on reddit.)
 
I don't even have it that bad for a trans person. I seem to pass in day to day life despite my masculine features. Some of those I can get rid of with FFS but it's not really a light at the end of the tunnel because my body proportions will always remain.
 
Being trans isn't my main problem, I have clinical depression or maybe bipolar that I'm currently searching for an effective medication for. I've been holding up relatively well for the last 7 years but I feel like I'm finally cracking. The trans stuff is just another hammer striking at me.
 
I've been to the ER twice this month for self inflicted wounds, something I had never done in my life previously. Not even suicide attempts although they were definitely deep and long enough to cripple me if I had cut in a slightly different place or different direction. I just did it because I was bored. I have no friends. I have no particular reason to live save the fear of death. I've just been slowly alienated by society to the point where being in a hospital to me seems better than spending another day in this house. My sense of personal consequences, empathy and gratefulness are just gone. I've spent so long trying to better myself and climb out of this hole that i don't even want to anymore. I've been trying to gain weight hoping that would help me feel better about my body but it's not. And it's incredibly difficult for me as well since I have no appetite. Eating is disgusting when you're not hungry.
 
I guess I just want to hear from some people who aren't ignorant and transphobic. I just want to read some words from some reasonable people. Distraction. Maybe advice. Maybe just attention. I have no friends. I'm too afraid of them. Or I hate them. Or I don't know how to get them. Or I don't want to burden them with myself. I have a lot of pills that I've been thinking about taking because it would be better than what's going on now. Even though I half-hate the hospitals now. Those fucking IVs are so uncomfortable but I guess if I was mostly unconscious it wouldn't be so bad."

ts_curious,asktransgender,"MTF questioning, I was asked of my therapist to think about my masculinity? Anyone else ever been asked that?","Hi

So, I have been here a few months now. Been questioning whether I am MTF with a repressed transgender identity. I have finally after 6 months had my first few sessions with a therapist where we have talked about my history for crossdressing since age 6, how I thought of my self as just a crossdresser since I didn't like men, and my fantazies/dreams of being a woman, having sex as a woman, etc.

So after the first few sessions my therapist asked me a few things, and mentioned that it might sound like it is more related to some sexual triggers then gender identity. I know its still early after 2 sessions, and maybe he wanted to test the waters, but I said that somehow I struggle to just accept that. I feel there is more that is lurking in the shadows so to speak. He seems really sympathetic to it, and I know he is one of the leading ones on this area in my town, so I don't think he has any hidden agenda or anything.

After the last session he asked me to think about my masculinity, and I was like: ""huh'', I don't know if I am a very masculine guy.... but not being masculine has never really been any worry of mine....

But of course I thought I'll check if there is a test for this, and of couse on 7 out of 10 test I score with a very feminine brain, and this kind of sent some warm shivers down my back (if that makes sense). Also, I know that I should not take these tests as science, but it was more just to see what answers I would get, and these were not gender testst, but just more about having a more masculine or feminine brain. I know that men and women have a mix of masculine and feminine traits, but the more I poke, the more I see that I seem to have a stronger feminine side in realtion to how I process things and how I think about people, without really presenting as very feminine.

So, did anyone else get this question when you were talking things through with a therapist? I'm struggling to find things that I can say are masculine traits, I am not very dominant (I fantazise about being submissive in bed), I care about other people's feelings, and according to my family I am kind and gentle.

Any thoughts or suggestions?

Thanks"
throwaway353635,asktransgender,First time coming out to one of my guy friends...,"...well, it was awkward. (SKIP TO END FOR TL;DR). 

Some background info, I'm mtf and am transitioning soon, and I just met up with a really good old friend. I told him because of course I'm going to be transitioning soon and what not. We were/are pretty close friends.

I'm still presenting as male but a very feminine male, and when I first saw my friend after a year or two he was questioning why I looked very feminine compared to before. I explained to him what I was going to do and who I am (I came out to him). He said ""So you're going to dress like this?"" very casually.
I replied ""No, I'll be more feminine. I'm just going as feminine as I can go without presenting female"" He was confused, so I showed him a picture of me dressed, hair and makeup, etc. How I would dress.

And then I asked ""So, what do you think?""

He says ""Eh...""

I was just stocked and got really upset. He saw that I was really upset all of a sudden and then said ""You'll find someone, but I don't like you like that, I know you as (current/almost dead name)""

""What? No, no, no, no, no. When I said ' What do you think?' I meant 'Do I look female?'""

He then said ""Yeah you do except for this (Points at makeup that I messed up on.)""

""Ummmm, yeah.... Cool....Thanks...."" 

Awkward silence takes place afterwards.

TL;DR: I'm mtf, asked a male friend how I looked as female. They took it the wrong way and assume I was asking if they'd date me...like what?

heartshapedgrave,asktransgender,worst things I could ever hear from my own mother,"My mother wanted to have a discussion again. Besides the usual she says that I have crazy thoughts because of the internet she pushed it too far. To begin with she told me trans women become prostitutes because no one wants them in a job. She said they get fucked by perverted old guys for 5$..she surely has read a post of mine but I guess she forgets the part when I said that I felt weird being a boy since I was 10. Then she makes some wonderful comments that im a handsome male and im ugly as female,good thing to hear for my dysphoria and I.was always full of insecurities so that's good as well. And again she said the usual stuff that im gonna destroy my whole family and that I will kill her but it didn't finish there,I guess she was on fire and mentioned really nice stuff that everyone will leave and I'll be alone and not invited to them again. They would leave cuz of the shame I'd bring on them. And besides being whores all trans women are drug addicts as well and that she is trying to stop me from destroying myself. She also mentioned anal sex and that she knew a girl who had a lot of anal sex and shat herself and something like that. What the actual fuck.. What am I even supposed to do? She's killing me day by day. Every time she opens her mouth only hate comes out of it. How can I not hang myself? Tomorrow,maybe today who knows we are gonna have again a discussion like that.. I told her to stop making me sick and trust me I completely understand that she doesn't understand LGBT people and shes almost 50 but we are talking about.your fucking kid. Maybe I should save money and just get the fuck out of this country, thing is that It will be really hard to find a.job cuz I will study something,I dont even know what I'll study. I mean yes the dream would be to go to USA or Canada but I would need to suffer 2 years to finish my studies so I can actually have a degree on something and then move but I have no relatives or any acquaintance and I will pretty much be alone against the world. The only thing that makes me a little happy is that I could secretly a psychologist and start t blockers for that year before getting out of here. I suffer every day and everytime I feel better she starts talking about it again. I told her to never speak about it again but she will,im sure of that.im sorry for long post and if something doesn't make sense sorry im tired,I can't take much longer. She went to buy some things before and the only thought I had is to take a knife and kill myself. She thinks I want to become a woman to punish her? That makes.no fucking sense wtf. So here's.my vent boys and girls,how fucked am I ? I love the hypocrisy as well,after 2 mins she was done talking she came to my room and said 'i love you'. I hate you mom."
pandachoco,asktransgender,At what point do you stop having to tell people you're trans?,"So I'm at a point in my life now where I'm thinking if I now meet new people (in a non trans environment ie not support groups) should I tell them I have a trans history or not. I don't think should spend 10 minutes of my life telling them my past when we're doing introductions or whenever. But on the other hand I feel if I don't tell them, and they later find out somehow from someone else, would they think I couldn't trust them enough as a friend to confide in them my past and therefore jeopardise our future friendship? Am I technically going stealth by economy of truth?

Another worry of course is what if I unknowlingly befriend someone who should later turn out to be transphobic and they direct their anger to me on finding out that I am (obviously I'd drop them, but things might still get nasty). 

May be I'm just overthinking this all."

All the time I feel like a damn fake and nobody can see the damn girl in me, just a fucked up guy I Who am I kidding? I'll never be female. 

I wish I could forcefully make myself male if needed. If I just put all those damned trans feelings into a box and put that box away, perhaps I'll feel better.I don't want to be transgendered, I just want a normal life. I want to be happy

phdinfunk,asktransgender,Trangender and Peak Experiences,"TL;DR:  During peak experiences (in the Maslow sense), does it happen on a clear background of ""Oh, right, I was clearly a (preferred gender) during all of that?""

TL;DR 2:  Everyone is more their ""real self"" during peak experiences.  Maybe for transgendered people there is an obvious dissonance within the body, but for most humans there is still dissonance between their ""real self"" and their lives outside the peak states.

I was just reading this particular thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/2rua4y/what_crazy_stories_did_you_made_up_during_puberty/

Looks like there's a lot of commonality there.  I had the experience where I didn't realize that there were actually male-bodied humans on the planet who wouldn't much rather be female.  I started realizing this wasn't 100% true at 23 or 24.  I was amazed reading that thread just how common this is.  Now I am wondering about something else I've experienced quite often and how common it is.

When I am having peak experiences, maybe while travelling, or exploring the woods, or hiking a new river, or cycling through the mountains, I notice one of two things happens:  

One, at that time, it just becomes obvious, ""Oh yeah, I'm a woman and I always was a woman.""  This is unquestionably obvious at this point, and doesn't even require that I do anything about it.  It's like a fact that just 'is.'   This normally isn't even accompanied by dysphoria (though sometimes in my life this has BEGUN a period of dysphoria, when it turns out it's not so ""simple"").

The second thing that sometimes happens, is maybe I'm swimming out in the woods, or biking up to some ancient temple or something, or maybe just riding my motorcycle through the breeze and feeling immense beauty and wonder of life being amazing.  When I think about it, not particularly trying to conjure any sensation in particular, I sometimes notice entirely incidentally to the beauty of the experience, I seemed to be a woman during all of that time.  I mean, in the memory, my body is shaped differently, and I seem to just CLEARLY be a woman.  It's not like attempting deliberate imagination or self hypnosis, which I've found normally requires a lot of work and is pretty frustrating and fleeting.  It's more like seeing something out of your peripheral vision, which is much more solid and real and just HAPPENED to have been there the whole time.

I'm 38 and only started noticing this second thing in the last couple of years, but I think it's been there a lot longer.

================
------------------------------------------

The next point, to anyone who is still reading, when I do a lot of meditation or if I'm taking Ayahuasca or anything else which is taking me to VERY deep and intense peak experiences, during those experiences, regardless of whatever else is going on, usually healing and letting go of armoring, it's also EXTREMELY OBVIOUS that I'm a woman, or spiritually a feminine being.

I also get the experience that my peak experience self is my 'real self' and has been sleeping all the time that I'm not having these kinds of experiences.  I have whisps of wakefulness during the 'lesser' peaks like a sublime bike ride through the jungles, or swimming in a remote canyon, but most of my life I'm in a sort of a dream and the ""real me"" is the me of the peak experiences.  I am guessing this would be common for everyone, trans or not.

This makes me think of a guy I met once while traveling in Eastern Europe.  He was in the French Foreign Legion, and had a tattoo on his neck that said, ""cut here.""  It seemed like his ""true self"" was some kind of warrior, and he had found a way to live his life very congruently to that.  He seemed very HAPPY and also extremely capable as a soldier/warrior.  But not everyone finds a way to let their ""real self"" be expressed in their life.  If that guy had been forced to sit behind a desk at an office job, I'm guessing his dysphoria could be as bad as any of ours.  Plenty of people in roles that their SOUL isn't cut out for end up killing themselves, so it's got to be comparably hellish to live that.

So, I wonder, is the ""Real Self"" -- which I am saying is the self experienced at our utmost PEAK a thing which everyone may find dissonant to their lived life and their body?  We trans-folk maybe just have a particularly biting case of ""Wait, the 'real me' I feel kicking around inside of this flawed and dying meat puppet is VERY different in physical shape to this bag of bones and blood.""  I mean, is that, in fact, possibly the case?"
tinyshain,asktransgender,What kind of stuff in the media do you want to see re: trans people and issues?,"I'm still in school at the moment, but eventually do want to work in media in some capacity, hopefully through film/tv and writing. 

I'm wondering - what do you want to see in media in terms of representation of the transgender community? More trans characters in general in film/tv? Stories centered around trans issues, or just stories with trans characters that don't necessarily relate to their gender identity?

Do you want there to be more visibility of transgender people to normalize our existence within the population? Do you want our issues (social/political/medical/etc.) to be discussed more? More documentaries, and if so, on what topics?

Etc., etc., etc.

These are just suggestions of questions that I'm curious about, but if you guys have other ideas or other things you'd like to see or read or have discussed, I'm open to it! I think media is a huge factor in our everyday lives and how we perceive ourselves and others, and it's a fact that we are not represented 1) very much at all, and 2) incorrectly, and I'd like to hopefully be a part of changing that."

a_username_0,asktransgender,Gaps in language and identity.,"In a conversation I was having with u/poingcritter in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/50qiok/what_is_the_point_of_neopronouns/) about the point of neopronouns, we were discussion a source of tension that occasionally comes up in the community.  I would like to continue that conversation here.  

Keep in mind that this isn't a conversation about whether or not non-binary identities belong in trans spaces or to the community.  **They do.**  This is a conversation about a gap in language that exists that can cause confusion and tension.  

How do we as a community distinguish between someone with this experience: 

&amp;nbsp;

*""... a person has an experience of gender that doesn't match their body.""*

&amp;nbsp;

From someone with this experience:

&amp;nbsp;

*""... someone who experiences dysphoria and has the need to transition to a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth.""*

&amp;nbsp;

I've understood the latter to be the experience of someone who is transgender and the former to be a description that ties together the greater trans community.  Unfortunately trans and transgender are now synonymous leaving us with a predicament.  What do we call our community?  Or, what terminology do we use to describe those who have the second experience?

This can be a tough topic at times and in the past has spurred divisive language that only ends up hurting our community. I want to reiterate that the topic of this discussion is not ""Who is more trans?"" or ""Who belongs and who doesn't?""  

The topic is terminology and identity.  

I have every expectation that the mods will shut this down if it gets out of hand, and I sincerely hope we can have a positive, productive, and informative discussion.

CrowleyIsCrowling,asktransgender,How did you know your name was right for you?,"Hey people.

I've been around this subreddit for a while, but I've never posted anything. It was enough to see there's a community much more decent than on most ""trans"" spaces I've seen online, so I've decided to ask this.

I've known I'm trans for quite a while now, and I've been thinking about a name enough to be extremely uncomfortable whenever someone pronounces my birth name, but not enough to actually find a name. Or really, I've had enough time but I just can't find one that feels *right.*

I like many names, really. I actually enjoy names quite a lot, they interest me for some reason. But when it comes to me, it just seems as if none will ever fit me. My birth name does not fit me, but none else will either. And it feels horrible because it makes me feel as if I had no name at all, which isn't the best feeling. 

Those of you who've found their own name, how did you understand it was ""the one""? 

My mum recently told me that I just need to try one out for enough time to *make* it fit, just like babies are not born knowing they're called Gabriel or Terry or whatever. 

I agree with this but I just can't manage to ""try them out"" as I'm not out with most people. I hate my birthname and I don't want to come out until I have an alternative; I also don't want to change name every two months to try it out.

Thank you to who'll answer and please excuse my poor english."
shelbon22,asktransgender,Came out to parents over the weekend,"I went to have lunch with my mom to give her the news. I told her to assume I was going to give her the worse news imaginable and she asked if I was gay, getting a divorce, or moving...Lol!

So I told her that I am a trans woman and that I am starting my transition. The first thing she said was ""I love you and support you."" Not gonna lie, I almost broke down and cried right there in that cafe.

Overall she and my step dad have reacted very positively and I feel very lucky. She did say some concerning things though that feel a little problematic. She expressed that she's worried I might ""change my mind"" later on and ""not want to be a woman anymore"" which bothered me a little and she seems to have a hard time actually accepting it. She also said it's hard for to believe because I was never really into girly things growing up and I was just like mom pls!

But anyway, that went well overall and so far everyone has been pretty supportive! In other news, I bought girl stuff from stores in person in boy mode. Bought a purse from target, some cute pink converse from the mall, and really sexy girl jeans from lucky.

Buying the jeans was probably the most nerve wracking because I had to try them on and deal with the employees basically knowing I was a guy trying woman's clothing, no real way to hide it. But they weren't rude or judgey, just super helpful and nice so I feel a lot more relaxed now about buying my girl stuff in person even though I still totes look like a dude.

Anyway, love you all and hope you had a great weekend as well! :)"

SpinningInLife,asktransgender,Took a break for about 4 months from this sub and everything trans. Still conflicted.,"I read a comment or two that taking a break from reading trans stuff may help to clear some mind fog. So I did, and I guess it kinda helped, as I didn't really let my mind wander too much and cause me distress over being possibly trans. The reason for the mind fog is because I seriously have divided conflict within me. I cannot comprehend what it means to be the 'opposite' gender much anymore. Long hair doesn't always mean female. Having a less 'masculine' identity doesn't automatically mean female. Basically, all these surface and personality traits, I feel as though start to fall apart on me. Wouldn't I be a horrible person for being a walking stereotype? Is my view of being the opposite rooted in misguided stereotypes?? If so, I don't feel morally  right. 

These thoughts of trans only re-surfaced recently as I had gone to a pop-culture/geeky convention not too long ago. I dressed up as a character that wears a mask; I felt different... Like a little free? No one could see current me and loved the feeling of being something different. It's when I realized that I do have a fascination for masks... possibly literally and figuratively. What does this say about me? I already have plans for a making another costume, and along with the outfit will include a mask to hide my face. 

Ugh, I don't hate how I look per se, but something compels me to live life differently. Am I just wanting to start life over? Is trans just another outlet to explore that? I'll never know truly I guess. Yes, I have been given the question from this sub before, ""if you had the magical opportunity to push a button and not be MAAB, would you?"" My answer is yes, but again, the more I think more into it, the less it makes sense. 

Apologies for long rambling and being vague."

Anyway, my wife and I have had a few discussions on this topic and I'm kind of interested to hear opinions from different perspectives. 

I'm not sure I'll ever pass as 100% cis and be able to go stealth (or even if I want to), but damn the torpedoes if I stop transitioning because of that (dysphoria sucks too much to not deal with). I've found that I look good in the feminine androgynous zone and that I also don't really find a lot of women's styles appealing or flattering on me in the first place.  

Anyway, the question: is non-binary is an actual form of being trans, or is it more of being binary transgender ftm/mtf paired with the rejection or societal standards, norms and expectations, such as how it seems to be shaping up in my case? "

SelfLoathing91,asktransgender,I wonder if anyone else is similar to me in this regard? Delusions?,"I know this word is a touchy one on this subreddit, but.. it fits what I go through. I suffer from delusions, not because of being trans although it certainly makes things harder I can't lie there...

I'm not even sure how to put this honestly, a good way of starting is that I see myself as an extremely masculine near spitting image of my father. Seldom will I ever not see this when I look at photos of myself or the mirror. It doesn't stop there either, I also hear what isn't real.. I'm literally incapable of hearing my voice no matter what I do.. I always hear this horrible stereotype flamboyant gay man voice no matter how I talk.

It all started back when I first came out as ""gay"" but questioning. I started to get a desire to be more feminine and that's when everyone around me became.. critical. ""You'll never be shaped like a woman."", ""You're a stud, keep it that way."", ""You can't look pretty as a girl.""

Got to the point where my older sister would even pay people to pretend to be my friend, then when I opened up to them.. slam me down, hard. Insult me and humiliate me. This led to me building up a lot of trust issues and then I'd also constantly get pulled in front of a mirror daily and told to look at my reflection. I tried to point out the positives and I'd get hit in the back of the head each time I did, Eventually it got to the point where I couldn't see any positive(feminine) traits in my appearance.

Same thing happened with my voice, particularly one friend who was supposedly an ally led me into a group to be introduced as a woman.. told me my voice was fine and I ended up humiliating myself. Made me really grow to resent people too, but it intensified my self hatred more if anything..

Fast forward to now, these toxic situations aren't near me anymore but I still see and hear what isn't real. I have to constantly go to others for their opinion on how I'm doing which has forced me to come out to people I'd have rather not have came out to. It's also leading to people sugar coating and lying to me...

What I know is I don't seem to get any disgusted looks or weird ones when I go out in public and for the most part I do pass. My friends vouch for that... but it doesn't change what I see and when I described it to my best friend she said I don't even have one of those flaws. I mean some of my friends don't even know I'm trans but they could also be claiming that...

..Anyways this isn't about whether I pass or not.

This is also the TL;DR basically.

I'm asking whether anyone else suffers from delusions that were implemented into their head because of their anti LGBT surroundings. If you did.. you ever get better.. and how did you go about recovering? 

I've tried therapy and I've also tried body positivity exercises but nothing sits and it just leads to me hating myself even more."

EliasSays,asktransgender,Constant thoughts and crippling anxiety - question about transitioning (ftm),"
I am 23 years old (f) - I've been incredibly androgynous all my life. Gender stereotypes were never enforced in my home, I was very lucky. I grew up wearing boys clothes, playing in the mud and all round just never really felt like a girl. But I was ok with that because I never received pressure from my family. I came out as a lesbian at 15. For about a year now I have had this constant urge to start presenting more masculine. I started to bind about 6 months ago and the immediate confidence I gained from that was absolutely outstanding. Suddenly the mens shirt I wear fit better and I just felt way better about myself. I have wanted to cut my hair for quite some time but I am really scared to take the leap because my girlfriend really loves it. 

I think she kind of picked up on my gender queer'ness and questioned whether I would ever have top surgery. My heart raced. I knew it was something I wanted to do but just never considered it a possibility. 

I have started reading more and lurking the ftm community and I can't stop staring. I could read stories and look at x-amount of time on T photos all day. It just inspires me in a way. But the second I start thinking thinking about what it would be like for myself to start taking on T I start to have a physical reaction. I get anxious, my heart races really fast and I get clouded. 

It's confusing. Really fucking confusing. Because I feel like for a lot of people it would be a clear No if they didn't want that for themselves but for me, it isn't a clear no. 

I guess what I am asking is, is this a normal reaction for someone questioning their own gender identity? I mean I feel like I'm pretty old to be going through something like this. A lot of trans people that I have spoken to have always known and I feel like it's weakens the fight for someone like me who is just hopping around this grey area. But maybe it doesn't. I don't know I guess that's why Im posting here. Hopefully someone can offer me some insight. I have held off posting for about a year because I wanted to make sure it wasn't a passing thought. And it's definitely not a passing thought, it's all I really think about. "
talex365,asktransgender,Reasons for me to NOT transition? (looking for input),"So I want to make one thing clear up front, in a perfect world I would transition, no doubt about it.  I can handle the costs (minus surgeries) since those can be quite manageable however there are several factors that give me great pause in seeking to transition:

1. I have a preschool aged son, and I am his primary caretaker. His Mother is not in the picture and while I get some help from family in caring for him, that amounts mostly to babysitting. The entirety of his parental responsibility falls to me. I don't doubt that he would probably be fine with daddy becoming a mommy but I don't want him to have to deal with the ugliness of other people (we live in a fairly conservative state, not deep south but definitely pro trump if you catch my drift).

2. I work in IT at a Catholic university, granted this one has quite a few liberally minded individuals, since it's a religious institution I'd be concerned for my job/career. Since I'm the sole income we have, and I understand it can be extremely difficult finding work during transition, I'd hate to be fired for who I am and have difficulty providing for my son because of that. And as far as legal protections go, this state has no LGBT protections, my local city does however there is an exemption for religious institutions so I doubt it would apply.

3. I don't want to live the rest of my life alone and I'm deeply concerned that I may not get even close to passing even after years of HRT. I'm tall, fat, balding, and have not had much success working on my voice. 

I guess I'm mostly looking for anyone that has had similar experiences and if things worked out ok for you? I'd consider getting a new job however the education benefits where I am are outstanding and I still havent completed a degree in my field so I really wanted to finish that before moving on to a new job. On the other hand, I'm not getting any younger and I really don't want to be doing this transition during my 40s or 50s. 

Any thoughts?"

Exceedingly,asktransgender,I'm so lost right now,"(mods this is just really a massive rant so feel free to remove it) 

I'm 28 mtf, I was on hormones from Jan 4th to May 10th this year and everything was going well, but my mother flipped out massively when she found out when I was about 4 months in. I hadn't told her at the start as she had always made little snide comments about trans people, and when I was trying to tell her pre everything she said something hurtful and I just closed up and couldn't tell her. I'm close with her, but communication is difficult sometimes. 

I started without her knowing but she started noticing physical changes so I had to admit it to her. When I finally told her what I was doing she had a breakdown and stopped sleeping, was taking days off work, was crying down the phone to me constantly, wasn't eating properly. I'm a reasonable person, I don't like to get angry or shout but her reaction really pushed me. She said the news was the same as if she had told me she was a serial killer, saying it's not natural and loads of other horrible things. I seriously tried to get her to understand it's not something you really choose, that doing this would help me out with depression and whatever. 

But she just didn't get it at all and that hurt me, not only because she's someone who's always been there for me before but because at that point 4 months in to HRT all emotions were heightened for me and seeing her in pain like that broke me. It was a catch 22, I couldn't carry on trying to make myself happy if I was hurting her like that especially as I felt everything stronger, and to give in meant going back to being miserable. 

Unfortunately I stopped at that point, literally just stopped taking all HRT. And for a month things were fine, I still felt like I did on them. I had some crazy good changes on HRT, I finally felt true happiness for the first time ever. I didn't have any mental issues before, but in comparison to being on HRT it felt as if I had been autistic before. It's hard to explain but in male mode my reactions are always think first and feel second, and I think more internally. On HRT it was like feeling pure emotion all the time, reactions felt more genuine, I was able to cry at sad things, I couldn't stop chatting, my sense of humor was heightened, I enjoyed social interactions way more. It just felt good. 

And now being off HRT for 4 months I feel exactly as I did before, I think the best word to describe it is numb. Back to being more introverted, not feeling things as much. 

Anyway, I was feeling really lonely in June and met a girl online, she messaged me so it felt like a gift from the universe. Things have been going well, and I told her about the trans stuff and while she doesn't fully understand it she is supportive and she says as long as I'm a guy we can make it work. 

She's one of these people who always has plans, I've already got like 3 holidays planned with her, a music gig, various seminars, family plans etc. And that's kind of cool as it helps beat depression. 

She's got me to sign up for a marathon next April as I told her that's always been something on my bucket list. I wasn't being too serious about it at first but she printed off forms and phoned someone up and got me a place, and I sort of felt obliged to go along with that. So now I'm trying to figure out how the hell I'm going to run 26 miles. 

I did loads of running last year, probably ran 20-30k a week, but I've since been on spiro and estrogen for 4 months and that's kind of the opposite thing a man wants to take to train for a marathon, so it's like starting from scratch.

Besides that I'm now dealing with having A cup boobs, which actually didn't grow at all in the 4 months on hormones but have appeared since being off them. And the stupid thing is I love having these so much. They sort of jiggle when I walk and the same for my ass which was sort developing well, they both feel so good. 

I honestly don't know what I'm doing at the moment. I had a serious plan at the start of the year: I had banked sperm, had seen a gender therapist, had started LHR.  I'm in a decent job and can save £25k/$33k a year, so I would have been able to save for surgeries. But now that all feels like it's been thrown out the window. I'm not even joking, it feels like a distant dream now. I just have thoughts of myself feeling happy.

I'm not really looking for advice here, I have a feeling some of it will be to go back on HRT, or to just do what makes me happy. I just feel like I'm drifting again. 

And the universe isn't helping, I was walking to work today and there was this truck with ""cargo trans"" on with half of it blocked by another truck, do it ends up looking like [go trans](http://i.imgur.com/CLgvFiRh.jpg) with an attractive woman to the right �� (excuse the awful photo). 

I feel like I've been cornered into trying to make guy mode work again, but I'm not enjoying it. All the hairs that had started going fine are dark again, my old strength is returning, I'm sweating way more and I was sitting at work the other day and I could smell myself (ew). 

If anyone's actually read all this, all I can say is please please always be true to yourself. Life is too short to try and make other people happy, just stick to your own plans ��"
Quinncidences,asktransgender,FTM pregnancy and general health questions?,"Where do i start. I think I'm trans, but the only thing (literally the one and only single thing left in my mind) that's legitimately stopping me from transitioning is the fact that i want genetic children. I've read that it is possible for trans men to get pregnant. I feel like i personally need to repress the want to transition, or put off transitioning until after i've had a child of my own, as im not concerned with disphoria as of now. I can live as a female. I'd much rather live as a male, but then with that, I am choosing to not be able to have children, and that is not something i am willing to give up. I understand that there are many women who cannot have children of their own, but I know I physically can, and to have to chose between the two is unbelievably painful. 

I understand that there are trans men who go through pregnancies relatively okay as things are concerned (dealing with disphoria, etc) but I've also read that the likelihood of reproductive cancers is a lot more increased in trans men who keep their reproductive systems and have been on testosterone for more than 5-10 years, but that it's not something people talk about.. And this scares me beyond words, and to have the ability to have my reproductivity permanently removed from me makes me want to scream in fear and gives me horrible anxiety.. I really don't know where to go from here.

If anyone has any advice on dealing with this, I would greatly appreciate it."
MxMusician,asktransgender,I keep getting offended at being called 'cisgender'.,"I love being a girl and calling myself a girl which would supposedly make me cisgender but sometimes I get really frustrated that I'm not a guy and want the option to call myself a guy without people freaking out and I keep changing my mind on what I want. I mean I've always struggled with my gender identity but I've never identified as transgender. If I'm okay with being a girl then I shouldn't get offended over this, right? Sometimes I really do want to be a guy though just for the sake of being male and I can't forget that part of me and I get overprotective over myself and hate when others don't recognise that part of me. I don't really feel valid though - I'll respect other people's gender identities but mine always seems to end with ""does this even make sense""? The only people that seem to be using the word 'cisgender' though actually understand and accept transgender people and that makes it worse when people assume I'm cis - acting like and assuming I don't struggle with dysphoria (because I swear I do)."
SerellRosalia,asktransgender,How to deal with literally no one liking you?,"Short back story. I'm 19. I tried coming out to my parents at 17. It did not go well. At all. I ended up having to see a therapist to become 'fixed.' I was in so much pain all I could do was play along to make it all stop. 

But I can't do this anymore. I'm seeing a REAL therapist next week, and beginning my journey. I'm afraid, deeply afraid. I know everyone around me, not just my parents, will hate me. Suddenly everyone I grew up with will no longer want anything to do with me. What will hurt so much is how far everyone will seem to be even while they are right next to me. I've been best friends with my next door neighbor since I was 9, I know him in and out, and I know he will never want to see me again. He will never want to see some mentally ill, freak, pervert, fake woman.

It hurts, to look at everyones faces, and my home, and know that soon what once was caring and loving will become just a stranger, if not worst. Don't tell me to be optimistic, that not everyone will hate me. I tried being optimistic once before with my parents, and it was the worst mistake I ever made. I know all of them. They will never love me again. Family, relatives, friends. No one. I haven't even done anything yet, and I already feel alone.."
TradMusicWarmSocks,asktransgender,Should I pause my transition because of school?,"Hey ya'll, so, I recently started my senior year of high school. My last year, I was very open and presented in a very gender-nonconforming way (makeup, skirts, and the like.) While I wasn't out as ""TRANS!(trumpet noises)"", I was just being myself, and everyone was supportive, and some of my friends used my new name. In general, a great time. 
However, senior year I am at a trade school, for Agriculture Tech and Welding. Here, The political climate is far more right wing, and there is less of a culture of acceptance. I am not sure how well it would be taken if I showed up to the farm or forge with makeup and painted nails. Also, I am beginning hormones soon, so even If I decided to go boymode all year, I don't know If I could pull it off.

Here's where we get to my question. How should I approach this situation, should I come out to the shop, should I go boymode all year? I don't want to lose inertia with my transition, but I am also unsure if I should just keep it down for simplicity and easiness's sake."

So I would know if I hit and injected into anything besides the muscle of my mid-front facing thigh, right? There was a little blood when I withdrew, but of course there would be. I just swabbed it and stuck a bandaid over it. It hurts some right now, kinda stings. It's been about 15 min. I don't remember it hurting when the nurse did it for me before. Although, she's probably a lot better at giving shots than I am, maybe I did it right but my technique wasn't the best. Steady hand and such? Maybe I missed some air bubbles? Oh, now I'm worrying that I didn't get the correct dosage because I missed some air bubbles...."
KrisEtKris,asktransgender,Goodbye America.,"So, just a heads up on what happened. I just got kicked out of my parent's house. They found out that I am working in a transgender bar. My dad stalked my Facebook and apparently found out everything about me. They pushed me right into my room, shoved my fucking door shut and gave me two options. I can either get out of their house and keep on working or detransition and be a guy again. And... most importantly, they are no longer paying for my college tuition.

After 3 years of explaining, it didn't really help them much at all. They would always connect and compare my stories to their shitty religious views and they also tried to send me to a Christian psychiatrist once to make me detransition. It's a fucking shame. I had such a great plan and now they are all shattered into pieces.

You might wonder, why the hell did I get a job in a transgender bar? Well being transgender in Korea means you will have 100× difficulty getting a job compared to others and no one will basically hire you. That's why I chose it. I really wanted to show that I am capable of earning my share... And the outcome was totally unexpected...

I will be packing my bag tomorrow morning so today will be my last day spending my time at home. I probably won't miss my family with their religious retardations and although it will be difficult, I will get through it..

And... As of today, I am giving up my plan on graduating college... I will keep everyone updated on Reddit though... So peace "
TheRavingEster,asktransgender,"Doing research on Facial Feminization Surgery - Any input about price, results, etc would be greatly appreciated.","Hello Any, Every and All!

I'm a MtF woman, and I'm beginning my earnest research into Facial Feminization, it's costs, results, and the surgeons that perform the surgery, that I am hoping will be the death of the disgust I feel when looking at my face in the mirror. This is a very big thing for me - I need to steel myself every morning I look in the mirror, because the absolute despair and disgust I feel ruins my day in the worst of ways.

I did some basic research into this before I began my transition almost 6 years ago, but didn't pursue it due to life rapidly changing with no stability (All good changes, however, for which I am extremely lucky and thankful).

As a result, I'm basically back to square 1 when it comes to the research. And I'm at the point where I have just enough stability in my life, and just enough ""I'm f-ing done with this"" at my self loathing that I'm looking to set a goal to aim for.
As the title says, I would love for any input at all regarding prices, surgeon's work, results, things to watch out for, and personal experiences. 

I am even so bold as to ask, if you have had this type of surgery done, and are brave, and generous enough to share with me the results, I would be extremely grateful.
I only dare ask this because I do not know how much trust to place in ""before and after"" picture sets on many sites, or even the legitimacy of certain sites themselves.

Thankyou in advance, and I wish you all strength in your journeys of becoming and being you.

P.S - I will be rather inactive in this post during the day (Due to a busy work schedule) but I will absolutely monitor and reply to as many as possible."

lalouisaille,asktransgender,Forcing feminity and dysphoria.,"This might be a bit long.

I'm a 23 year old trans woman, 3 days away from being 7 months on hormone.
I am not femme, that has caused me at some point to question whether I wasn't some form of gender non-binary. I'm not, I'm a lady, but if I could spend the rest of my life without makeup and only wearing t-shirts and jeans, I would. The problem is I can't.

I don't male fail (except when people only see my hair... sometimes), if I wear neutral clothing I get read as male by literally 100% of the people who talk to me. I try to reassure myself that I have proof that I'm looking more androgynous, like people using less gender specific language, or the weird looks, old people smiling at me until they get close and then frowning, the boob double take... I'm definitely read as male, I might be a bit androgynous, but people have 0 confusion about the fact that I'm male.

I kind of feel like it's my fault. I'm not giving them any social cues. I might dress pretty neutral/feminine on the ""male clothing"" scale, but those are still male clothes (those I can still wear... half my shirts look horrible on me now because of my boobs). I'm desperate to go full time, I can't handle boymode anymore, and even if I don't pass, I need to go full time to get the ball rolling on the surgery/administrative front. So just wear ""female clothing"", wear makeup, keep working on the fucking voice, and we're set right ? I did this for a week two years ago, and nothing horrible happened, I even confused people (heard an argument between two people on weather I was a boy o a girl...), with short hair and not 7 month of hormones, and 10kg heavier ?
Also literally everyone I know is cool with it. 

Socially, I'm one of the luckiest here, my family is cool with it, my friends are cool with it, being deadnamed (in the only place where I'm not out) feels super weird now because it never happens with anyone I see frequently (helps that I have a gender neutral name but anyways). And I kind of feel I owe it to them to transition, to be congruent with the efforts they are doing.

I just cant. I'm a depressive pile of shame and anxiety. I find myself ugly as fuck, and on the few occasions where I feel things might be okay, or if I feel like my face has gotten more feminine, my brain immediately goes ""you are not allowed to like yourself, you are deluding yourself, you still look like a dude"". I can't trust anyone on the issue, I don't even see my face as male or female anymore, just shit; close friends will always see me as a dude, and all say I still have a masculine face; people I just meet now who find me feminine I'm gonna assume they are just being polite, also this happened just once and she might have been sincere, but feminists tend to be more open about others appearance than the average person; I can't get advice from strangers on the internet because of course I'm gonna put a good selfie, and if I get positive feedback, it's because the selfie was too flattering. I have absolutely no way of knowing where I stand. I know give it time, and honestly, who fucking cares if I pass, not me ! (as if). I shouldn't care, that's not the point, that's not even the point of this post, so let's get back to it :

Presenting femme. Putting makeup on makes me hate myself even more. It doesn't help that I'm still bad at it, but that's not the point, even when I do something that's kind of good, even when people compliment me on my makeup, all I can think of is ""fuck I'm ugly"", all I can see is a dude trying to be a lady. The same goes for clothes, I still despise my body, I still feel like I have monstrous arms and tiny hips, and I still feel like nothing ever suits me. My shopping experience is now trying to find something, anything feminine that looks good on me, and not finding shit. Even the most simple cut t-shirts that now fit me better than dude t-shirts because boobs, I feel like I'm in drag. When I'm in ""boymode"" (what I consider neutralmode, just putting clothes that fit me), I can sorta kinda keep my physical dysphoria in check but social dysphoria is killing me. If I try to present feminine my physical dysphoria goes through the roof.

And I don't know what to do because I don't know where the problem comes from. I don't know if I feel like shit when I try to femme because that wouldn't be me if I was cis. I don't know if I'd be the femmiest femme who ever femmed if I could pull it off. Maybe if I try to power through it, get really fucking good at makeup, get really good at wearing clothes that fit me, if I get my voice to be feminine, then my self hate would go away. Maybe I do look like a bad drag queen and I'm seeing myself objectively, and I just need to be better at that shit. I might revel in the skirts and the winged eyeliners and the cute tops once I master the art of not looking like shit in them.
 Additionally if this is just self-hate that makes me see myself the way I do, I might as well try to force it anyways, completely disregard my opinion of myself, and try to rely on others to see where I'm going. 
Or if I'm really just completely averse to the idea of being femme (and why, I fucking love femme girls), then what ? Just wait ? I have absolutely no guarantee that I'll ever pass without the help of very heavy social cues. So just keep delaying things until I just end up magically male failing ? Which I have no guarantee will ever happen.

I feel like I need to just force it for the time being, and if I can ever tone it down, then I will. But I have no idea how to deal with the emotional side of things."

Transmasc people please post yours!

For me, from a transfemme perspective:

-Looking down and seeing my hair flowing all the way over my chest and onto boobs.

-Feeling the sudden jiggle of boobers when I walk down stairs or run.

-Accidentally brushing my hand against my own skin and being surprised at how soft it feels now.

-Those small moments where you completely forget what's between your legs.

-Realising that it's getting harder to fit my thighs into old skinny jeans.

-Have girl friends ask to see my boob and feel them out of curiosity and self comparison.

-When you're out with other women/girls and workers refer to your group as ""ladies"" and everything just continues as normal.

PaitheCecil,asktransgender,Pre-everything MtF support,"Hi, I am actually creating this thread for a friend that is transgender. I don't know so much about this subject, however, I am always looking to learn, so I apologize in advance if I use any incorrect terminology or perhaps say something that is incorrect.

My friend is very dear to me and I want to do everything I can to help her. I am the only person she has come out to, and it seems that I am the only person she has for any form of support.
As we are far apart (different countries) it is difficult for me to provide any physical support.

We planned for her to move to a city where it would be easier for her to transition, however, as time has gone by, she is getting worse and worse that I fear I may lose her :(

She seems to have lost all hope, and feels that it's not even worth for her to transition as she won't be able to pass.
I understand that one's mileage varies to another, but, I know that it's never too late to transition, which I keep telling her.
I am trying to explain to her that transitioning will allow her to live her life as her true self, and help with gender dysphoria; that there are a lot of people that transition so late in their lives and are able to pass (from the little knowledge I have, correct me if I am wrong); that there are many things that depend on what makes you pass and even though it may require a little bit more it is still possible.

Her concerns are that she won't pass, or if she tries to, it will require many surgeries and/or laser sessions (sadly she lacks the financial resources) and the fear of discrimination or that discrimination is just waiting around the corner, so to speak.
Although, I understand that there are therapists that help to cope with this (again, I may be wrong and correct me if I am), which she will be able to have access to once she has moved.

Is there anything I could do to help her with any of this?
As I am not so knowledgeable in this regard, I am always unsure of what to say in reply, so, it would be awesome if you could help me with the moral support, or something that will give me a better idea of the things to consider.
Something to prove that it **is** worth for her to move and transition.
Although, I do understand, ultimately, it does depend on her, that is, for her to transition, and that mileage varies, and it depends on various factors, so a definitive answer may not be possible.

I thank you in advance for your support :)"
PunAboutBeingTrans,asktransgender,Freaking out... Really need some advice,"I'm 22, MTF. I think. Most likely. After dealing with feelings of wanting to be a girl for pretty much every day for over a year, and after moving out of my abusive father's house to my own place finally, I decided to finally see a therapist to talk about things. It's been going fairly well, a bit awkward because it's a male therapist but he's easy to talk to, very understanding and about as good of a fit as I could hope for. Eventually we came to the discussion/decision that I did want to start on HRT. There's no set date yet, nothing has actually started, but I've been mostly calm and confident thus far, albeit a bit nervous/confused. 

Then randomly tonight after work, I just thought ""I'm actually going to be starting hormones relatively soon"" and out of nowhere I freaked the fuck out. Internally at least. I was exhausted but haven't been able to sleep all night, every time I close my eyes my internal monologue is just screaming. I... I don't even know why. Anxiety/Depression have always been constants in my life but I've been on very helpful medication for awhile now, I have a handle on it. 

But I'm laying here, and I'm just... absolutely terrified. I'm not even sure of what. I specifically decided to start hormones because I know that I can stop if it doesn't feel right, and that's better than always having a ""what if"". I'm usually a really logical person, but it's like someone set off a panic button and there's just a Klaxon alarm going off nonstop without an identifiable reason. 

Worry is something I deal with a lot. Actual Fear though, almost never. And I am fucking afraid. Idk why. I can't think of a logical reason, but that isn't changing this fight or flight bullshit going on right now. 

If anyone has any idea what could be wrong, or any advice, please say so.

When I got a blood test done my starting values were:
36.0 pg/mL Estradiol
478 ng/dL Testosterone

Also I might of said I was on 2 mg estradiol, that was a mistake... I thought I was, almost called the pharmacy about it and ugh I felt like an idiot afterwards.

I've see otherwise progressive people mock the idea of straight guys dating trans women. It's gotten to a point where I have to warn guys not to tell people because I've heard so many negative stories. I am not super knowledgeable on gay men dating trans men but from what I've heard its equally taboo. (it also doesn't seem to be as much of an issue for tans attracted women)   

I think most of you guys know just as well as I do how common it is for men to be into us, so why is it still such a taboo? Is there any way we can try to combat that kind of attitude? I know its easy to say ""whatever, fuck them, it pales in comparison to what we have to deal with"" but to me it honestly feels like shaming our lovers is as transphobic as shaming us directly.

has anyone else experienced a long pause in growth after 3mo, and did it resume again after some time, or was that all the growth i should expect? "
Ilineri,asktransgender,MtF | Butt workout and losing weight before HRT?,"Hi,
I would really love to know if I should building up butt muscles before getting the hormones. After I found out that I'm trans, I started working out to lose weight, because I desperately wanted to look feminine. Some time ago I reached healthy weight to height ratio ( 1.65 m, weight around 55 kg) and I started working on my butt, but I got no idea if it's even worth doing it now, so could anyone help me out please &gt;.&lt;
And could anyone tell about the expierences you had with food and HRT, because I heard girls in HRT start wanting to eat alot. The more you tell the better, I'm really curious +.+.
Thank you :3"
Estronaut-23,asktransgender,Partially closeted name flippy-flopping.,"So I've decided on a name, and I'm planning on coming out in a few weeks, but I have a problem.

I go to school with my brother, and I don't plan on coming out at school until at least a couple of months after coming out to my family, so he would have to switch names with me a few times a day until then. I'm scared he could mess up and accidentally out me.

Anyone have any ideas?"
KosherDillPickles,asktransgender,Off hormones for a week...,"This isn't so much a question as much as me looking for suggestions so sorry if this doesn't really belong here. Due to me needing to be on antibiotics I cannot take my anti androgen for about 10 days, does anyone have any movie, tv shows, or literature suggestions that they enjoyed to help me get through the week?

Also just wanted to add you're all wonderful people, and I hope you're having a good day."
Saturdalia,asktransgender,Help/advice on coming out to a friend for the first time?,"So, I know how this is not the best question to ask, because obviously every interaction, every relationship is different, so there's no single right/wrong way to go about it. But I'm heading into uncharted waters here, and I don't have much of a map to go off of. 

Since I started honestly questioning my gender, I've found that I need to be open with it to at least one person whom I know personally, especially since some day I'm going to have to be out to everyone else eventually. But since I'm still in this process of questioning, I want to still be kinda discreet.

I have a friend who is trans (mtf) who I think could be helpful just as someone to talk to, and as someone who knows what I'm going through and understands the nuances of the situation. The thing is that we're not particularly close, just because we've (like a lot of people) have kinda branched off since college. I think I've been in touch with her once since we graduated and she came out/transitioned, and it was a random question about book recommendations? We were not best friends in college, but she and I ran in the same circles and had good times together. And she's great, the kind of person I'd always wanted to get to know better, and I've been supportive from afar, while not all that directly. And I trust her. Bottom line, though, there's no ""natural"" way for me to ease from ""Hey how you been the past two years"" to ""I think I'm a woman and I need your help with it."" 

So if I approach her out of the blue, I don't want her to think that I'm just taking advantage of her, that I'm just turning to her as ""the token trans"" without any regard to our friendship (we'd known each other for a few years before we grew apart). I don't typically reconnect with old friends, and have never come out in any way to someone I know. So, I was wondering if there are any, uh, guidelines to consider when approaching this? For any trans men/women here, is this a situation you've encountered before? How would you feel if an old friend came to you like this? I'm extremely nervous but hopeful. But mostly nervous."
carmensandieg00,asktransgender,How did you pick your new name?,"Hello, I'm new here. I just recently came out as a transwoman to my wife - who actually is super happy about it because she's bisexual and prefers women. Yeah... Complicated as all fuck. Lol. Regardless, I am trying to decide on a name now. I have some that I like but I am finding that deciding on a middle name is increasingly harder. For now, my wife and I both like ""Beth.""  Its wonderful to meet you all and I appreciate your insight."
rlsharkboy,asktransgender,Am I overreacting or this actual transphobia?,"I'm a college student, and I've been out to all of my friends since the beginning of freshman year (I'm a first semester sophomore now).  This includes this guy, who we'll call Alex for now.  Alex knows I'm trans.  It took him months to acknowledge my pronouns even though he's known from the beginning, and yesterday he called me she and her.  Five times, in a period of two minutes.  Didn't bother correcting himself either.

Now I'd just not bother and try to avoid him and everything, but he's one of the executive board members of the campus LGBT club.  And I really like going to the club meetings because I can be myself there, but it's really disheartening and makes me not want to attend events when Alex is there constantly calling me she/her (and confusing other people who then call me she/her because they think he's right).

I kind of want to talk about it with the president of the club, because surely it isn't acceptable for a member of the executive board (who is gay so also a member of the LGBT community) to be so disrespectful of someone's pronouns even though he knows them and has been reminded plenty of times.

Would it be overreacting to approach the club president about Alex?  Or should I just suck it up and just hope that he doesn't talk to me so I don't have to deal with being misgendered in a safe space?

**EDIT: thank you for your responses, everyone.  My anxiety is really bad, so I'm always pretty worried I'm overreacting.  It's good to hear that I'm not.  For everyone who asked, I have talked to Alex before about it, and all of our mutual friends have corrected him too.  I don't think he's being malicious, but I do think he's regularly stuck in his own head, so hopefully the club president talking to him will be enough of an authority figure that he pays more attention to what he's doing.  Thank you again, guys and gals and everyone else.**"
ImElissa_WasGQTrans,asktransgender,Anyone else who feels that they transitioned more for the physical ( body ) part of things than for the social part of things?,"I honestly don't give a f**k if people recognise me as female or not. After being honest with myself I realise that I transitioned to have a female body and less for being a woman in general to say so.

The aesthetics of having a female body give me so much more happiness than the aesthetics of a male body.
While there are handsome males I would rather want to be a pretty female.

I feel feminin but not per se a woman. If though I like to be recognised as female and see myself as female.

My point is that I didn't transition for / because of the feeling of being a woman but because of physical dysphoria / a strong preference of wanting to be a woman physically.

For the rest I don't really care about gender . It's the body difference that lead me to transition.

Is there anyone who recognises this because sometimes I feel like a scam because my desire to be female is almost exclusively physical ( appearence ) . I don't know if physical dysphoria was valid enough to say so. 
That said : I'm happy to be on hormones and to be able to alter my body like I want it. I just stopped caring about the social things that come with being a woman. Socially I'm just wanting to be human , physically female.

I hope that there are other people who recognise this because it's an alien feeling sometimes."
riijen,asktransgender,"[NSFW] Post-op girls, how ""stretchy"" is your vagina?","After writing that title this question feels pretty weird but I feel I need an answer anyway. I'm scheduled for GRS with Suporn early in the new year and since my BF is a fair amount thicker than average I'm nervous that he won't fit post-op. We're talking big enough that Soul Source doesn't even make a dilator that big.

While I'm primarily interested in people who have had theirs made from a scrotal skin graft, can anyone chime in on my questions:

1. What is the maximum girth you are able to achieve?
1. How long post-op did it take to get there?
1. If you've dilated beyond the max girth that dilators come in, how did you do it?

Thanks in advance for any answers!"
ohgodwhereisthis,asktransgender,Passing privileged; but can't see it for my self. Does anyone else have this situation?,"Long time lurker, short time poster and returning redditor here. I've found this board and the other transgender communities on this site to be helpful in earlier parts of my transition and I'm currently more confused than ever; I hope someone can relate or suggest something to aid this.

Little bit of background, I transitioned fully in my teens, I went through some of the growing pains of androgyny and early puberty like we all do at some time or another. I've been living as a woman in my private and public life for quite some time now and I've been lucky enough to have the chance to blend seemingly effortlessly. However I'm finding more and more I just don't understand why? 

I look in the mirror and I see it like it's written on my face in black marker, I often feel quite horrible about my appearance and even go as far as considering harming my self(and have in some times) because of what I see.  

I live a fairly normal life, I've dated completely heterosexual men long term, even got engaged at one point but that got dissolved. I've not faced the ""regular"" set of transgender challenges like: getting stared at, people misgendering me or not being accepted as the gender I identify as.  So for what I can tell, I've blended in. 


I'm honestly just looking for some others out there that are in my situation, of the world seeing you as you identify but you not being able to see it yourselves. Any feedback would be incredibly appreciated.

NowImAli,asktransgender,Update. And can anyone recommend a therapist?,"Note: I live in North Central Texas, so please recommend therapists from that area all the way to the DFW area. Anywhere further might not work out due to travel arrangements for sessions. And please if possible have them accept insurance, Medicaid in particular.

So I made a post on Saturday regarding my parents finding my DIY hormones and everything falling apart. They have become less hostile but no more accepting than before. They've stated things such as I can't be a girl because my hands are too big (as if I hadn't noticed), I don't like guys (this has been big, they're saying I'm either a guy or am a girl so guys will like me), haven't been this way my whole life, am just confused, got my mind messed up by the Internet/anime, etc.

Anyway, I had hope because they were no longer going to force me to cut my hair off, and they told me we'd see my GP and see what they think. Bad news is my GP handled this the worst way possible, feeding them exactly what they wanted to hear. She prescribed me antidepressants, saying my troubles were not related to transgender. She painted hormones as some extremely dangerous substance that could give me a stroke or blood clot or electrolyte problems and told me to stay away from them (lost hope on getting them back from my parents), and stated that people who transition are never truly happy and the people who sell hormones or surgeries are only in it for the money (this was the worst). She told me to contact Medicaid to see what psychologists were available, but wasn't able to help me find a specialist in the matter.

Could anybody refer me to a therapist who is qualified to get me HRT, and soon? As things are proceeding, I'm being referred to a local general psychiatrist and I really don't know how that will go. I've already been on treatment, know that it's what I need, and my life's been horrible since I've left it and detranstioned, losing what little benefits I might've felt in my month on HRT. I need someone who people have experience with, isn't a gatekeeper, and might be able to bring my parents around. I've been starting to have self-harm and suicidal thoughts, which I've never had before, and it's scary. I need to resume treatment soon.

Oh, and not related, but on Monday when I got back to my trip I tried and failed to run away as soon as we got back into town. That's when my parents were at there worst, yelling and exclaiming their disbelief among vulgar expressions (""Do you plan on cutting off the f**king thing?!"" ""Don't be a coward. Don't you have any balls?""). If I can't resume HRT soon and things worsen I might still consider leaving home. I'm leaving on another trip by plane in two weeks. I'll be in Dallas TX, Washington DC, Albany New York, Williamstown MA, and Charlotte NC. If anyone's in those areas and open to taking in a 17 year old girl and providing her temporarily with shelter and meds, do speak up. If this is crazy talk, please disregard.

Thank you all so much! This sub and its community has been my lifeline."

3conrad3,asktransgender,Mtf Boy mode passing question,I want to start hormones but am not near ready to be out to family. I always hear people that take hormones for a few months and then say they fail hiding it? Will just keeping a beard or wearing boy clothes or something hide it enough?
Nurayathebitch,asktransgender,MTF... totally confused.. just shaved my head...,"I was so dysphoric today and felt so bad about my body and how it looks i just really didnt see a point in trying. In an attempt to push me over the edge I shaved my head completely bald (from shoulder length to bald)

But it worked out differently than I expected

I honestly kinda like the way my face looks now and think I will keep my hair like this.

transitioning to female is pointless in my case (thx to my frame). something in between is honestly fine to me if I can just be myself. 

My plan is to continue hrt but to present male. 

My questions are:
am i being impulsive? will guys find a male presenting mtf with boobs, a dick (without function) and a shaved head attractive? 

am i being rational?"
FavoriteColourGreen,asktransgender,Ftm bad experience with family member.,"So I came out for the second time to my younger aunt tonight. I told her about my plans to take testo and have a chest surgery and she reacted like it was some kind of joke. I felt so bad after that and I still do. At some point she got it that it was not a nice thing to say. I did not ask for a proper apology though. She has said transphobic things before but she is generally like that, not thinking that much before she speaks. It hurt because as a kid I looked up to her. She is an artist as well as me. I am having a crisis with my artist identity as well so I think it hurts an extra bit more therefore. "

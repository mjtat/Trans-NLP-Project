fnvt,asktransgender,Friday Night Voice Thread #209,"Welcome back to the weekly voice thread! This thread will be posted every Friday night here on [/r/asktransgender](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender) until the community loses interest.

So what is this thread? Simple: it's an attempt to encourage others to work on their voices, by showing the progress others have made on their voices over time. The previous voice thread is below if you're interested in seeing how we've progressed since last week. Feel free to post a voice clip, even if you're just starting out. I know it's something that's not easy or fun to work on at first, but trust me - once you get something that starts to sound good, you're going to get a huge boost in confidence!

**If you feel like you're late to the party, don't worry!** You can still drop a voice clip even if it's been days since the latest thread was created, and hopefully someone will help you out. Also, feel free to drop more than one voice clip in the same thread!

##Some tips for working on your voice:

* Stay out of falsetto! Falsetto is only useful in finding your head voice, it's not a very good place to go for finding a voice to speak in. Falsetto is the vocal range above your normal vocal range, and you should feel a ""break"" in your voice as you transition from your normal vocal range up into falsetto
* Work on your resonance! You should feel no vibrations in your chest when speaking. The target you're looking for is your ""head voice""
* To find your head voice, try pushing your larynx (the thing your adam's apple is attached to) up as far as you can, and attempt to ""throw"" your voice out of the top of your throat instead of your chest. You should feel vibrations in your mouth, teeth, upper throat and maybe even your nose when you're doing it correctly
* Once you get your head voice, take your guy voice up into head voice and you should get something that starts to sound female.
* Talk to yourself in your female voice when no one else is around, so you can build up muscle memory

##How to rate others' voices

If you don't know the vocabulary to describe what someone is doing wrong, feel free to simply state how close you think they are to passing. Please be honest and respectful, and don't tell someone they pass when you know they don't so that they don't end up using the wrong voice techniques. There's nothing worse than building confidence in a non-passing voice and then realizing it doesn't pass later on and you wasted your time.

If you are going to post your own voice clip, please help others with their voices as well! The best way to make this a useful thread is for everyone to pitch in :)

SolitaryOrchid,asktransgender,Taking the Next Step,Despite my husband telling me he does not support me I've decided to take the next step toward transition. Tomorrow I'm going to ask my therapist for a letter to get on HRT. He's not a gender therapist and he is pretty conservative but has worked with transgender people before and helped them get hormones and surgeries. I'm not 100% certain he will write me a letter but in the case that he does what type of things should I go over with him to go in there? Is there a format that needs to be followed?
adamj95,asktransgender,Electrolysis Session #5,"Today I had my fifth session and forth clearance overall. My chin was very painful today, not sure why. This session was two hours and twenty minutes in total and cost me $100. I didn't shave at all between my last appointment and today, which was exactly 2 weeks ago."
brad_furd,asktransgender,My parents are kicking me out of the house,"I'm 17, MtF. I came out to my parents a few weeks ago and they were accepting of me at first. Since then, they've started telling me I wasn't born like this, that it's against their religion. We got in to a huge argument today where my mom told me she's done with all my shit. She's been actively denying me hormones and I admit that I stupidly told her when I kill myself, my blood will be on her hands.

I understand that that's a terrible thing to say, but I got extremely passionate and that's truly how I feel. Anyways, I left the house for a bit, came back and she told me how she knew deep down inside I was normal and loved God. Once again... I stupidly said ""Fuck your God"" I know how cringey that sounds, when I'm replaying the memory I can even picture the Fedora and neck beard.

I told my mom I wouldn't go go school anymore if I can't get hormones. She's trying to make me go while also threatening to kick me out of the house. I don't know what to do anymore. Suicide seems very appealing right now. Where do I go if I get kicked out? "
ts_curious,asktransgender,"Did anyone experience that the thought of being transgender got weaker after you came out to yourself, and before you started transitioning?","Hi. I have been trying to work on myself for the last few months, to figure out if I am transgender or not. I have shared a bit about it here ttps://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4ccbnn/any_mtf_transgender_and_ftm_for_that_matter_that/ and here: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4d8aky/if_you_are_a_transgender_that_realized_it_as_an/.

I do feel like a broken record for coming back with new questions, but I think there is a lot of uncertainty for me at the moment, and I am just struggling to sort these thoughts out. 

Its been a few months now since I first seriously started to question whether or not I am transgender, and everything is leading to believe that I am, but I have probably repressed this for so long, that I am struggling to really confirm that I am. As mentioned in my other posts I am waiting to see a therapist but the waiting list is a bit long, and in the mean time I feel like in a bit of in between sort of. In the first few weeks after I started considering I experienced periods of depression, anxiety and just fatigue. I am not sure if that is gender dysphoria, but part of me think it is. But the last few weeks have been quite good, and I haven't felt so down, which again has led me again to question if I am for real transgender. 

It could very well be that my struggle to accept that I am is tricking my mind to think that I am not, as it has been the last 30 years, but it's just so confusing. A few weeks ago I was certain, but the last week it has kind of calmed down. Anyone else experienced a similar thing? It might just be that my coping mecanism has kicked in and the robot me is taking over.... I don't know. It can be quite confusing at times. Just can't wait to finally see the therapist."
Kittani77,asktransgender,Am I wrong in not caring about what others think?,"Hear me out on this.  My flair gives the vitals but strangely after spending my whole life being careful what I say, how I act, how I dress, etc.... I really don't care if I'm outed or not.  I know the point A and I know the point B and I know that somewhere's along the lines I will switch from male to the public world, to female, but I don't care if I pass, really.  My only real motivation for not being full time right now is logistics.  There's people I want to tell at certain times and I want it to come from me.  I want to have the legal stuff dealt with as much as it can (My birth state is one that doesn't allow birth certificate name or gender changes until GCS is complete.)  But honestly I'm ok with people knowing I am trans.  I think that a little bit of obviousness on my part can open doors to discussion.  I know I'll catch more haters than someone who passes fully, but I know I can take care of myself in almost any situation. (Father was a special kind of navy sailor and kind of a jackass when it came to teaching his boy to fight, not abusive so don't go there.6)  I look at my life as one of service, and I think that if I'm going to be part of this community, I need to serve us.  Perhaps being not so scared and not so silent can win some hearts and some allies along the way.  It could get me into trouble, it could get me dead, sure... but I have this feeling it won't.  What are your thoughts on it?  Should I be more active publicly and come out sooner rather than more passably later?  It's intriguing to think about it.  We need allies more now than ever with this election causing the republicans rallying the hate-base.  

Edit: I suck at typing and punctuation.... sue me."
TheGiratina,asktransgender,"This is a bad idea, right? (Trigger-Warning)","I've not been able to stop thinking about a DIY orchiectomy the past few days, but it's so difficult to face the WPATH standards and have to wait another six months - at least - to be able to get one the right way. But six more months is a lot of time for testosterone to take it's toll, even with anti-androgens and blockers, right?

I feel sick from it most nights, because I keep watching procedures when I can't handle that stuff to begin with, and reading papers on the procedure. What should I do in this circumstance? How can I deal with this?"
DysphoriaSucks,asktransgender,Alone and scared to transition. I need advice.,"Hi everyone

I'm 23 AMAB from the UK and strongly considering transitioning. Dysphoria and confusion with my gender isn't really that new to me, it's something I've been dealing with on and off since I was around 14. However for the first time it's truly *real* and I'm actually realising it's time to confront it, and this makes me truly terrified. Part of me is still questioning if I'm legitimately trans, but I'm more and more realising that I meet most of the markers and it's probably the right thing for me to do for my happiness.

My dysphoric feelings have never been constant, and have mainly come in phases over the years which I've done a reasonably good job of repressing. It's all coming back to bite me in the ass now though, and things have just erupted for me yet again and I'm really just forced to deal with this however hard it might be. I just can't cope with it, and since I'm getting older I really feel I need to start the process as soon as I can.

The issue is I'm so terrified of never actually passing, even with HRT and FFS. I'm 6' tall with quite broad shoulders and a large ribcage, I've got hair pretty much all over my body, and my face hasn't got any particularly feminine features to it. The only place I'm actually losing hair is on my head, oh the irony. I know hormones can do wonders, and there's laser and electrolysis for facial and body hair. It all feels like it's a total shot in the dark though, and while there's a lot of great inspirations on /r/transtimelines I feel these are the minority of individuals who just got lucky with their natural facial and body structure.

Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and think ""Yeah with work I can do this!"" and then the rest of the times I just want to cry and try and repress everything again because I feel I'll never be able to pull it off. I'm so incredibly worried that I will go through with this, risk losing friends, family, and so much and at the end of it *still* looking like a man. Even worse, I'll look like ""a man pretending to be a woman"", and face ridicule and become totally ostracised by society. 

I know people will say I should transition to make myself feel better, to fix my dysphoria, and become happier and more acquainted with myself. That's all true to an extent I know, but what if I'm worse off for it at the end? Right now presenting male I can walk down the street without fear of harm or ridicule, I can talk to people without constantly worrying I'm going to be outed as trans or if they're going to laugh at me behind their back. I don't have to worry about finding a partner or finding love, neither do I have to worry about the thousands and thousands it will cost me to even attempt to do this.

And then what if it's for nothing? What if after putting my heart and soul into it I'm still unhappy. Even if I spent every penny I have on surgeries and hormones and implants and all of that, what if I still look like a guy? I'll still not be truly accepted as a woman, and I'll not be happy with myself and I can only imagine feeling worse because of how society will treat me. Sure I will feel more myself and my dysphoria will be reduced a fucking ton but then my life situation just got a whole lot worse.

If I knew I'd pass after 3 years of work and hormones then I'd start right now and never look back, excitedly embracing the future and the prospect of actually being happy. If I knew I could never pass then I don't know, I'd want to just give up again but I know this will just keep coming back again and again.

I'm 23, and I don't want to lose more of my youth. I already feel I'm too old to do this even though I know I'm younger than many who decide to transition. I just think I'm going to need a good result to be happy, and there's no way to really know if that's what I can get until I try. The only reason I gave up the idea of transitioning when I was 16, 18, 21 and all these other crazy times was because of my fears of never passing, so I guess that says a lot about how much this means to me.

So what should I do? Should I just go ahead anyway? Am I just being overly fearful about the whole passing thing given how hard I'd be willing to work to do it? I really just need someone to tell me that I'm doing the right thing. It's just so overwhelming and I'm really quite alone with it all. Are there any girls here who thought they could never pass, but now are and are happy for it? I just need some encouragement I guess, I'm so overwhelmed."
SuperDesk75,asktransgender,"For people who have done MTF voice work, did you notice that you had phlegm/hoarseness problems using your 'male' voice that went away with your new voice?","[I sure hope I can describe this adequately. For a long time—even before I was trans-aware—I have felt like I would benefit from seeing a voice therapist. Like I haven't been ""using my voice correctly"". I constantly feel like I have to clear my throat. My voice gets at least slightly hoarse very quickly with any amount of talking beyond brief small talk.

But recently I've been looking into MTF voice stuff and—not really *trying* yet, but just experimenting. And I'm noticing that when I do speak in falsetto or just a slightly higher register my voice feels like it's not getting strained as much. If at all.

I like to think that this is a sign that i'm ""supposed to be doing this"". As though my vocal chords were meant to sound like a woman and i've been misusing them my whole life. Even though I realize it kinda makes sense that speaking in a totally different way would work them differently. Anyway - has anybody else had this experience??"
k_dragon,asktransgender,Any notable differences between Chettawut and Suporn?,I know both use the non-inversion technique. Do you guys know of any noteworthy differences between the two as far as quality/patient satisfaction/anything else really?
Allyn1,asktransgender,[MtF HRT] Is there a time-sensitive correlation between caloric intake and breast development?,"I'm looking for any study or doctor's advice or anecdotes on if there is a time-sensitive window in the first 2 years of HRT where the body must generate fat from excess calories in order to properly grow breasts.

I understand that old fat in masculine areas does not get moved and must be burned, and calories over maintenance will be turned into fat in feminine areas.

What I want to know is whether a transwoman could inadvertently reduce their *final* breast growth by not having weight gain while on HRT. That there might be a difference in permanent breast growth between a weight-loss diet and a weight-gain diet during the first stages of breast growth."
NaomiOni,asktransgender,Im new here and desperate for coming out of the closet advice.,"Greetings all. I'm new here to reddit and this subreddit so I hope I can get treated kindly here. &gt;~&lt;

I need some help. I'm a 20 year old mtf transsexual. I want to come out to my dad but there are so many barriers stopping me from doing so. Here are the barriers:

- My father and his uncontrollable anger issues. He is also prone to long fits of anger. I suspect he has some sort of mental illness or OCD issue because ONE thing will set him off for the rest of the day. He claims to accept the LGBT community and but I don't believe him. He's dating a religious Christian woman and she is insanely conservative. I can only assume the worst. 

- My inability to pass as a woman if I start hormones is a HUGE roadblock to even talking to my dad about it. It's insanely depressing for me. Even though I'm only 20 years old I doubt I'll pass because I'm obese, and my body and face has ALOT of hair in the former of body hair and a horrible beard and mustache. The good news is my family is full of busty, big butt females.  Getting laser is an impossibility as it costs too much money. I won't be able to get laser until I finish college. Though if my dad supports me I could get hrt, make up and change my wardrobe. That's as far as it gets until I can support myself. If I have to wait to start hrt until age 25, will I atkeast be passable? God I freaking hate being trans. I see a lot of amazing transition timelines on here (which prompted me to make a reddit account) and I'm trying to stay positive but I really can't take this anymore... =( each day I wait the effects of testorone are worsening on my body. 

-I'm half black.... and being blunt here, black transwomen don't pass nearly as well as anyone else. I really hate being black... =( I'm sorry if that's racist. I don't know how else to say it nicely. 

-Family instability. I'm essentially the only one that can take care of my mentally ill brother once my father passes away. Leaving me to a life enslaved to my brother until I die. He doesn't accept trans people period. I don't want to abandon him because he really can't take care of himself without the aid of a family member. 

I don't know what to do. I've grown angry at myself so much to past year. I'm starting to get angry at the smallest of things about myself. I can't seem to concentrate on anything anymore. I've been thinking of checking myself to a mental hospital so I can get some sort of help. 

Logically I'm thinking that suicide is the only way I can attain peace. Since my family binds my life so much I don't think it's worth living anymore."
Sugoiki,asktransgender,My transition ruined my marriage and it's destroying me.,"I had been struggling with thoughts of transitioning for awhile but about a month and a half ago I finally got to start HRT! Apparently my excitement in finally being able to be myself made me blind to how far away I've pushed my wife away... We are now beginning to work through a divorce and she is already with someone else that she unexpectedly met. I'm in such a bad place right now and no idea how to work through it. :(  I feel so lost and alone with no direction. I feel like I can't move forward, my present is terrible, and my past will never repeat itself. She is all but gone and is all I've ever wanted in a partner until I pushed her away. Sorry, my only question is just for any advice or any encouragement that anyone can provide for me. :("
Throwaway732724,asktransgender,Is it okay to get FFS if you're still not really sure you want to transition?,"I'm still not sure if transitioning is what I want to do, but I do know I don't want to start unless I get FFS and fix my problematic features (forehead, nose). Is it okay to get these procedures if I'm still not sure, I hate these features anyway whether I stay male or female so I think it would still benefit me even if I decided not to transition."
phnzdvn,asktransgender,[MtF] One Month on HRT. What should my levels look like?,"Hi everyone!  So I started taking hormones a month ago today and I have started to notice some, albeit, minor changes (which is still exciting though).  But my main question is what did your Testosterone and Estrogen levels look like this early on? I go in for my next panel soon and I wanted to see if I am doing well; I am my endo's first MtF patient (he mostly does FtMs) so he doesn't have much to compare me to.

imgrowingsunflowers,asktransgender,Any tips for how to lessen extreme shame?,"TL;DR: I'm super super ashamed of myself for being transgender, and I feel like I am an unloveable freak for presenting/identifying masculinely. I would like to move on from this and I'm not sure where to start.

I'm operating right now on the assumption that in some way or another I am trans and I will not be able to make myself cis. I'm also taking a few steps to feel more comfortable with myself - I'm wearing my packer, binding most days, presenting more masculinely and trying to talk in a more masculine voice (I am lucky in that I have a somewhat deep voice already so mostly this is about inflection/mannerisms/remembering to talk with my lower register). I've asked my boyfriend to start using he/him and male terms for me again and honest to God, I already feel so much better. I feel so much more like I am seeing myself in the mirror and I feel more confident in  everything I'm doing.

I am also filled with an unbelievable amount of shame! I feel like a freak. I find myself going on TERF sites trying to make myself stop being trans and also kind of as a form of self injury. I keep flashing back to my experiences when I first came out at 14 and was beaten/abused/bullied because I was trans. I'm terrified of being assaulted again. I kind of want to slink away into a hole and I feel like me being trans is an unspeakable burden on the people who are close to me and I feel bad that they have to deal with it.

This is not doing me any good. It's not helpful to me or anyone else. It just makes me weird and insecure. How do I feel less ashamed? I'm going to ask my case manager for a referral to a gender therapist next week but in the meantime I would like to feel better. I've made the choice to be myself, so I might as well try to feel good about it, right? I feel life is too short to keep hating myself but I'm not sure what things I can do to make me hate myself less, in this regard 

Thanks!"

zoodleoop,asktransgender,Coming out (again) this weekend,"Hey y'all, I'm planning on coming out again this weekend with more successful results than when I was 15. I'm still terrified of losing my family and want to stay in the closet longer for that stability, but stronger is the notion that I don't want to waste another year like this. I wish I could just be content being a guy online and a girl irl but it's not working out for my mental health and ability to not feel like my life is a lie. I'm 18, have money and a place to stay over the summer, solid college scholarships/resources for the fall semester, and at least one parent that I know doesn't completely suck.

I live in the dorms at a community college about an hour and a half away from home. I'm planning on coming home on Friday afternoon, coming out Saturday morning, and high-tailing it out after if I need to. I'm pretty lost past that. I know I should grab important documents/personal items and do something about my bank account (as my parents do have access to it). Thoughts? I'd rather not wait until the semester's over to do this, but if I'm really not prepared right now, I can handle it.

Extra note: I'd be okay with living at home if my family was just gonna be really, really tone-deaf and misgender me all the time, but I'm really not emotionally (or physically) safe around my mom if I'm openly trans and bi. I don't know if she's gonna actually kick me out this time around, but I might just kick myself out."

SleepNowMyThrowaway,asktransgender,"Coming out via letter? Yes, no, experiences?","I'm needing to come out to my spouse around 10-12 months; she's well aware of *something* going on and commented on my ""gender issues"" several times.

So it won't be a complete shock or surprise. The problem lies in the fact that she's been violent in the past, has assaulted me before (I divorced her because of her abuse once already) and I'm afraid of her going much further than simply using her fists...

My other option is coming out to her while in therapy, but then there's the ride home and sharing the same house...and her temper which can be volcanic.  The safest option I can think of is a letter, and a period of separation so she can (hopefully) cool down to a controlled rage.

Seems so damn cowardly to write a letter, though?

hohahuhi,asktransgender,"Is ""body based"" only gender dysphoria could disqualify me for transitioning ?","Hello,

I will keep it short. I was wondering if you need (or should ?) to have some sort of ""social"" gender dysphoria to qualify for full on HRT.

Actually I think being a dude is sometimes easier (no make up, people are less judging etc.).
Nevertheless, I would like a female body to the point that I'm thinking about it everyday (and annoyed because it turns me on). I just can't get it out of my head.
If there are people that were in my case and transitioned, I would like to hear your experience.
Thank you."
An_Android,asktransgender,A series of questions reguarding voice...,"So, I just came back from the last concert for my choir class. Naturally, I rocked it. I got compliments from strangers, aquaintences, and family alike. My whole family was begging me to go back into choir next year. I denied, because I want to get started on voice training, and I fear choir would be a hinderence on that.

This got me thinking...

- Would voice training negatively affect my voice?

- How much milage is possible from voice training? (I'm a bass)

I realize that these questions might be ymmv things, and I apologize. I just feel aweful ridding myself of a voice this good..."
Meowsuu,asktransgender,Anxiety is awful... Will I perfectly pass without FFS?,"Hi everyone... I've been dealing with really bad dysphoria lately and it's been getting worse. Every time I look at my face I start worrying that I'll never pass. At least I won't pass without FFS. I've been panicking a lot and even taking this following picture was really hard so I've love to get your honest opinion. On a side note, I am 4 months on HRT.

Here is a picture of me, no make up, no wig, unmirrored. I don't know why but my unmirrored pictures look disgusting to me :c

I really like the way this picture turned out but I don't feel like it's me at all. It only looks alright because of the angles, and the make up and stuff and that really concerns me because I most likely don't look like that without all these things. As in even if I left my house with my wig on and make up on, I only look okay in certain angles. I just want to pass without ffs or make up/looking at specific angles if that made sense.

Thank you for reading and giving your honest opinion.

ZelkyZo,asktransgender,What should I expect from an orchiectomy?,"Given my abysmal luck with HRT thus far I am considering this option.  I don't really want to do it but I fear that my T won't be pulverised until I get this done.  Outside of breast buds I've made no progress with HRT and my endo won't boost my AA any higher due to blood pressure concerns and I doubt she'll boost my E either since my levels aren't too bad there, not that I think it'll help suppress my T much.

With that said, I have a few questions for those of you who're more experienced with this.

1. What are the average costs of getting an orchiectomy done?  How likely is insurance to cover any portion or all of it since it's not in any way perceivable as cosmetic?
2. Which type of orchiectomy would you recommend and for what reasons?
3. What does it look like after the procedure?  Is the entire sac gone too or is it just like a hanging crumpled up empty bag?
4. Has anyone bothered to get prosthetic testicles?  What do they feel/look like?
5. How will this affect sex?  I presume this procedure will make me infertile (correct me if I'm wrong), but will I still be able to get hard, ejaculate, experience orgasm, etc?
6. How would I go about finding the right surgeon for the job?
7. How common is it for trans women to have an orchi done?  Do most of us have to get it done eventually anyway due to AA complications or whatnot?  Or are some of us just very unlucky with our HRT?
8. Where can I look to learn more about the procedure and its consequences online?  Please don't tell me to Google it because I tend to not be very successful when I try that.  :(
9. Most importantly, am I looking into this too soon?  Should I give HRT several more months before giving up on my efforts at T suppression?

Thank you all for reading and hopefully answering my questions.  :)"

But now, it's different. I'm a girl and I'm totally happy about that, but because I'm a transgirl people treat me different. They stare at me, they ask me SUPER weird questions about transness, politicians use me as a political scapegoat, people all over the world revile me and call me ""rapist"" or ""pervert""...

Randamirin,asktransgender,Should I call a lawyer or maybe the ACLU?,"Short version of the back story: I am still presenting male, I paint my nails often - I rarely dont have them painted. Three months ago we had a big shake up in our company and we had our local management fired.  One of the temporary replacements sent down raised issues with me painting my nails.  Our handbook says nothing about nail polish or appearance for men or women.  She told me falsely that the handbook doesnt allow men to wear nail polish.  That led to her outing me to my coworkers. It ended with her telling me it is no longer an issue and that I can paint my nails.  That ended with no disciplinary action against the old bitch, which I am now going to follow up on.

Today my immediate supervisor said that there was a complaint from coworkers about me painting my nails.  I believe the new manager asked her to talk to me about it.  I am about to confront the manager and ask if he is ordering me to not paint my nails.  

If he says yes do you think I should persue legal action?  There is nothing posted anywhere that says it is against our companies policy, nor our parent companies policy.


Edit: I live in Charlotte North Carolina,  I imagine that someone might want to persue this."

Not to be an ungrateful bitch or anything but i think the biggest cause of both of these is my situation at home. My parents in particular. 
Just a few minutes ago my mom made a comment on my nails that im trying to grow out. Saying they are disgusting, despite having longer nails herself. When i tell her that she responds that she is a lady and im not so its okay for her to have long nails. 
Might not sounds like a big deal but the way she says it is REALLY rude and then she just stares at me as if ive cut of her leg or something. 
She makes alot of those kinds of comments, not just regarding my appearance but my mental illness aswell. 

I have absolutley no way of getting out of the house. Im turning 18 soon but the issue is that i cant function well at a workplace because of my anxiety/phobia so im completley reliant on my parents.

Beth_L,asktransgender,How to get career references when your former co-workers only know you by deadname?,"I started HRT when I was still in my old job, but I got that contract from an associate who had no idea I was transitioning. The contract ended in early March and now I'm out looking for work again, but I'm doing it presenting as female for the first time; in IT, where sexism is overtly present, this has been not an easy venture. Making it worse is the fact I have no former co-workers who know me as Beth, that I can use as references. 

I do have one former co-worker, who knows I'm transitioning but she would still be like ""Beth who?"" if asked about her former co-worker; I can speak with her on FB and let her know ""Its Beth now..."", and she will be a reference, I've used her before and is cool. 

Thats only one reference tho, due to the current job market most jobs are asking for 3 ref's and I'm not sure what the best way of resolving this.

My first thought was ask my friend from uni, who out of some weird coincidence took my old job at an agency I worked prior; the problem here is when I asked him for a reference once in the past (before I was out), he said he cant ethically say we were co-workers because we never actually worked together. He did say then he would go a personal reference since we studied the same things at uni and he knows my skillset. I declined that offer at the time, as I could find others I had actually worked with who were willing to be put down as a ref. He is one choice I have (but will may turn around and say ""well we never actually worked together"" again).

One of my references I use to put down on my resume was a co-worker at a catholic college we worked at. I email him: ""Hey this is B from [college], I'm transitioning... will you still be my reference?"". I have no idea how he will respond.

Another pre-transition ""usual suspects"" reference I use to use was my former Dean of School of Information Technology at my university. He is a Mason and if you know anything about them, you might be aware they dont like trans folk (generally speaking), so I'll want to speak with him in person, not just send off an email, basically so he cant just ignore my request. (Also he did once say ""Yeah I'll go a reference for ya, but what am I meant to say? that you are a shit programmer but you can drink anyone under the table?""). Not the best option I thinks.

My psychiatrist said he will go personal reference, but obviously cant comment on my skills and work ethic.

The next option is a former boss who fired me for (a minor) breach of confidentiality, it was not his choice to fire me, but being my line manager, it was his job to. Why I'm even considering using him is because he worked under a particular high-profile transwoman (who I decided not to name) when he was in the army, and speaks of her in the highest regard. Not sure how to approach him as he's not on my linkedin and he's no longer with the org he fired me from, and has a common name like John Smith. If I find him, I still dont know what he will say--I mean he did fire me after all.

There really isnt anyone else I could think of who I have worked with, and I'm going to have to take a different approach with each of those mentioned above. 

My old Dean of School, I'm just going to have to go to the uni tavern and wait for him to rock up for a pint and a ciggie after work, that is pretty terrifying a thought for reasons extrinsic of seeking a reference.

Basically, I'm seeking advice from people who have been in this position, how did you approach professional contacts with coming out? and what the ""best practices"" are, what not to do, and maybe even things I may have overlooked?.

Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.

throwaway443422,asktransgender,Viability of this method of getting with a gender therapist/HRT when under 18 with unsupportive parents?,"1: Since gender dysphoria often causes depression, tell your parents that you're depressed and need to see a therapist for it. Do not mention anything related to transgender, if they have a problem with it.

2: Once you're at the therapist, assuming patient confidentiality applies to minors, let them know that the depression involves gender dysphoria.

3: The therapist can then say that they figured out that gender dysphoria was causing the depression, and tell your parents that (but hopefully not tell them that you brought up the dysphoria yourself). And since the APA says that the appropriate treatment for dysphoria is transitioning (with HRT) or else natural puberty could lead to suicide, the therapist will hopefully urge your parents to the right path, which is consenting the prescriptions you might get."
YoshikuniKazuko,asktransgender,Talking to Doctor for First Time &amp; Telling My Dad,"I'm not sure how I should start so here it goes.

I'm 15 (very close to 16) and want to transition from male to female. I told my parents about a year and a half ago. My mum has said she will take me to the doctors on Wednesday and it sounds she will finally do it this time. The are two problems though. The first one is that I don't know what to say to the doctor and the second is I don't know how my dad will react.

I'm horrible when it comes to communicating with people and don't often talk to people other than 2 close friends. I have no idea at all on how to start talking to the doctor and what I should say to him. There is also the chance I will just freeze and be unable to say anything like I did while telling my dad. I've read about just being yourself but that doesn't really help much (sorry) I have no clue at all where to start and where to go after that.

The second issue, my dad. I did tell him about this a while ago and he wasn't happy at all. My mum told me when she was talking on the phone with him he blatantly said ""No"" to it. I get along really well with him and I don't want him to hate me for it. I think over time he *might* accept it but that isn't certain. I guess this is also a problem with talking to someone. I don't know how I should tell him once I start (and that I did so without his permission or knowing), last time we had a conversation I got stuck and was unable to speak. I froze up and couldn't answer anything he asked properly.
I don't know how to put how I feel into words. It's this strange strong feeling that that I have. I can't come up with reasons why I want to transition, it is just this uncontrollable feeling that to become a girl

I was hoping you could help me with talking to the doctor and my dad and also with putting how I feel.
Thank you in advance, I hope this doesn't bother you."
babygirlskunk,asktransgender,34/FAAB questions,"So I'm trying to work out my feelings regarding my identity as a mostly-masculine leaning genderqueer person...and more importantly, what I want to do about it as far as some sort of partial transition. The subject of transition has come up for me 4 times in the past 12 years.

I am FAAB but have never felt comfortable with my chest. Like in 20 years, I've literally never looked in the mirror and been like, ""oh my gosh, I love having boobs!"" They are small, not even an A cup, but I am considering chest surgery to make my chest appear less feminine to the point where I could take my shirt off at the beach or outside, if I so choose, without the world exploding/getting arrested (I live in California- Bay Area- if it matters).

I am also considering low-dose T for a few reasons, mostly involving further masculinizing my already pretty neutral physique, maybe even lowering my voice a little, and even facial hair. I've wondered for a while if it would help to ""balance"" me emotionally because chemically, not a lot of other things have worked for me, especially in regards to shark week and the week leading up to it. I think a lot of the discomfort and unease I feel about my body/how others perceive and treat me, would be alleviated if I could move towards a slightly more masculine appearance without making any major changes (i.e. without going on a more typical dose, without changing my name, and without changing my gender marker). At least that would be my starting point. Who knows what the future holds.

In regards to being ""out"" at this time in my life however, I would only want to be identified as queer within the circles that I feel are safe/comfortable for me. I don't feel like my chest should be my family's business, nor should hormones. The most I would probably ever tell them is that I feel pretty fluid about my gender and that when I think of who I am, I'm just ME, not necessarily a woman.

I am close to my family and value having a good relationship with them. I seriously considered full FTM transition about 8 years ago and my parents were horrified and devastated. I would not want to lead them down that road again. I live across the country from them and as much as I love them, I want to sort of honor and protect their perception of me as much as possible. To me personally, it's kinda like how when I first started getting tattoos, I kept them covered from my somewhat-conservative grandparents. In short, I don't feel that my gender identity should affect the relationship I have with my parents or any other members of my family.

But am I dreaming? Is this doable?

TL;DR: FAAB, 34 years old, I already have a pretty flat chest, a pretty low voice, and give off a pretty genderqueer vibe as it is. Ideally, I would seek surgery and hormones to simply make myself even more so. I know you can't pick and choose the effects you get on hormones but the more I see people who have gone on low doses, the more intrigued I am.

How feasible is it to navigate the world as a masculine-leaning person who still wants to retain the ability to pass as a woman?

If you identify in a similar way and have gone on low-dose T and/or had chest surgery, how easily were you able to keep those things a secret?
Is 34 too late, from the standpoint of, what will happen if I keep ""phasing out"" these feelings every few years?

Similarly, has anyone had the same type of experience where they've repeatedly considered full or partial transition at various points in their lives? What finally pushed you into doing it, or not?

If there is a better sub to post this in, please let me know. And sorry for the length, I know it's a lot. Thanks!"

""Would you be a cis woman or a man that has no trans thoughts?""

Now, as for a lot of trans people, the answer would be the one that changes you to be the gender you identify as. But choosing the answer that makes me a woman means my daughter would not be existing right now and I don't want that. I would choose the answer that preserves her existence even if it's painful towards my gender. I love my daughter so much.

TheClaireProject,asktransgender,"Lots of rambling but there IS a question in here, promise~","I intended to make this post with a simple question but now it's turned into a possibility of advice. I literally just found this, and scrolling through just the first page of ""hot"" posts alone I feel as if I've stumbled upon a cache of knowledge I didn't think I'd find. Not to say finding information online is hard or impossible, merely I didn't expect to find this today. &lt;3 So uh...hi? 

I write this, about myself, not to make it seem like a journal entry or with any intention on someone reading this and being utterly fascinated with tidbits of my life. I'm hoping to get some advice, actually. Not someone making decisions for me, I hate that. Just...advice I can take into consideration from people with more experience than me. 

I'm turning 22 this year, which will mean I've been seriously contemplating the transgender change for 2 years. I had thought about it once when I was 18 and, as I searched myself a bit, I had a few thoughts on it when I was much, much younger, younger than 10 at least. At 18 I told my parents I was into guys, and the thought of them having a ""gay"" son (because there's no way you can be into both, that's ridiculous -sarcasm-) really didn't sit well with them. The reason I include this nugget of information is because this past March, after not speaking a word of truth about my love life or thoughts on myself to my parents for 3-4 years, I told my mom...well everything. I'd recently told her I was seeing a therapist, and finally she sat me down and pretty much begged me to tell her. ""I'll love you no matter what"" and all that. 

Without explaining the entire conversation, she actually guessed that I was transgender, or at least contemplating the thought of changing, which completely shocked me. I'd thought I'd done very well to hide it, I made sure not to talk the way I did online or on the phone with people that knew, I kept everything VERY private. I had told my older cousin, someone I trust with quite a lot of confidence, and he admitted he knew I was into men but never would have guessed I'd thought about being a woman. 

So, more onto the point...I now have my mother's full support, a complete 180 from where she was when I was 18...and to anyone who is having a hard time, be it with employment problems, the lack there of, love life, even family and/or friend support...I swear to you, this roller coaster will have an up at some point, and it is by far one of the most intoxicating, exhilarating feelings...at least in my book. Two months ago I was losing my mind...I was afraid of telling anyone around me what I was thinking, I couldn't find a job anywhere, regardless of rather or not they were hiring, and I'd reached a point in my life where I felt...stuck. Nothing seemed to work right and all I wanted was to move forward with SOMETHING instead of being trapped. I confided in my cousin, then my mother...last Monday I began my training class at my new job (which will pay anywhere from $600 to $2000 a paycheck, depending on how I do with bonuses), a place which is liberal enough that someone in the company is already going through the male-to-female process and as far as I know no one bats an eye at it. 

My dad is...eh. He isn't a bad dad. Not gonna go into all that, but he's been my dad as long as I can remember, even though he isn't my biological dad. He's not too supportive...more paranoid that his work will know what I'm doing from his insurance, which we've explained time and time again that isn't possible. He's a teacher, who's always felt employment and education should come before all else. Mom has told him that regardless of what I do, if I go through with it she'll be there with me, with or without him. A very kickass response I didn't see coming. &lt;3

If you haven't rolled your eyes to this wall of text yet, I promise I'm getting to my point. My mom has been more than helpful since I told her. I'm seeing a psychiatrist for anxiety medication, just to try and see if it helps me, and we THINK we found a gender therapist covered by our insurance just half an hour away. I say think, because we're not sure if they're specialized in the matter or not. I live at the southernmost tip of Ohio, so being in the bible belt we're worried of the possibility of this being one of those ""pray it away"" situations...but the progress is enough for me. 

At this moment...in my mind I am gender fluid. I know I'm biologically a boy, and I have no problem with it. However...when people talk to me on the phone, unless they know who I am first or have known me for years, I get ""ma'am"" and every other female pronoun. I LOVE IT. It sends a shiver through me and I smile and laugh and it's incredible. I grew up very...impressionable. My first memory of any form of feminine thought was me telling my mom I've always thought about being a girl, and being told that was gay, which was wrong. Which of course, being young, I took that as complete truth, without question. All my life if I've been uncertain on things, I would ask for advice...if someone told me I was a certain way, I believed it. This isn't that, though. I know I love being perceived as a woman. I know if I learn about the process entirely, all the important information...as long as nothing throws me off and I'm medically cleared, I'll go through with it. However...I know myself enough that I'm not going to be suicidal or depressed if I can't or decide not to. I'm afraid to say this because I've seen people take this very...negatively. Specifically when I was 19 I tried to find some online information, and stumbled upon a chatroom full of pre-op individuals, and several told me to leave, saying my uncertainty was an offense. I know now that's not the case, but I don't want to upset anyone because of my uncertainty.

I'm sure I'll be able to find plenty of information here...and I feel like I should mention, I have realistic expectations, when it comes to appearance. I know I won't get shorter, I won't get cute small feets and what not...I also know I'm not guaranteed to come out looking like some pornstar. I actually find ""bigger individuals"" to be rather attractive. I'm not happy with my body in that I don't think I'm attractive as a guy, regardless of how built I could be or skinny I could be (I'm not fat, just have a bit of a gut I'm not proud of). 

Looking at all I've typed (which I hope doesn't generate some ""fuck off no one cares"" responses, I'm not looking for sympathy or a shoulder to cry on), I'm actually laughing the question that lead me to this corner of the net was ""male to female clothing"". I've decided to get financially stable, get rid of some debt I've made and get a car, maybe an apartment too, before I sit down and decide rather I'm the Justin I've been for going on 22 years now, or the Claire that's in my head that loves to come out and...well, exist. That being said, i don't think it could hurt to look into clothes...even though I know for a fact I myself could never be content with simply dressing as a woman. I've heard something about ""tucking""...I understand what it is, just no idea how you go about DOING that...I've also heard of...I guess underwear with cups to hide my bits, or something? This subject is entirely new to me...I've been so afraid to try it because of having to hide and now that I don't have to, my curiosity is approaching a giddy level.

So...um...ramblings aside...is my uncertainty rude, and what's a good way to open the door to female fashion?

Final note: Uh...I've never made a post before, and I dunno how this ""send replies to inbox"" works, rather it shows up responses like it does on the few posts I've clicked on or if I get them all in the mail thing, so...I'm gonna leave it ticked and experiment. &gt;.&gt;"
angel-ina,asktransgender,How do you experience gender identity?,"What's it like having a magical internal compass that lets you know who you are, what to be, and how to identify?

I don't understand gender identity. Every day I feel more and more disconnected from the reality everyone else seems to experience. I'm 3 months into HRT and my chest is developing visibly and I feel more positive about my image every day. I love the (femme) direction I am taking my presentation and optimistic, for the first time, that one day I will achieve a comfortable, balanced self-image. I am quite happy to be slowly loosing the shackles of intrinsic maleness that I felt constrained to, but that doesn't mean I am feeling any closer to intrinsically female. For me, femaleness feels like its behind a glass wall. I can see it, approach it, imagine it's my reflection, press my face up against the glass in desperation to get as close to it as I can... but at the end of the day, I'm over here and they're over there. I'm scared that the genuine happiness I am experiencing with carving my own identity and shaping my body image, finding a home in non-binary space, will be tarnished if I can't rid myself of the jealously.

Transwomen seem to just ""get"" it. Did I miss the memo? How did I get left behind? Why does everything about my identity have to be a massive struggle of demolition and reconstruction? Why can't I just ""know""? How does one EVEN just know anything? How does one live your ""truth"" ""authentically"" when you have no truth to be authentic to? Everything is choice for me, and agency is a double edged sword crushing me under the weight of self-determinism. I wish for once, just once, I could intrinsically know who and what to be with no explination."
patdabaker,asktransgender,How to deal with heckling,"Hey everyone! 

So recently I have been the subject of heckling about twice. Once was this creepy guy who when I was checking out an apartment said he wanted to move in with my girlfriend and me. ewwww. The second time were these like middle schoolers that asked me if I was a boy or a girl a couple of times and laughed about it. Prior transition this wasn't an issue and I didn't have any sisters so I'm pretty clueless when it comes to this stuff. Does anyone have some words of wisdom to offer this poor soul?

Lain42,asktransgender,Nostalgia Critic (unfairly?) compares being a Transgender person with believing oneself to be Otherkin.,"https://youtu.be/TbeqC1cwe4g?t=1m51s

My response:
""Please do yourself a favour and don't speak about medical issues as those they are at all comparable to otherkin and other internet delusions. People having a gender identity that doesn't match the one people assigned them at birth is the result of a combination of brain development and social expectation of gender. Otherkin are people who claim to be something they are not because they feel like it and for no other reason. While one is the result of a complex neurological development, the other is the result of delusion. They are incomparable.

For more information: http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/transgender-what-it-means﻿""

I also pointed out the reason why i feel the comparison is fallacious and unfair:
""...the comparison doesn't fair because one is a medical condition while the other is a persona someone is rping with. It's an example of a false/moral equivalence fallacy
(http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Moral_equivalence)

It's like saying that 'believing in evolution' is equivalent in any way to 'believing in creationism', or that 'believing in climate change' is the same as 'disbelieving in climate change'. It's giving unfair invalidity to a scientific position and respectively unfair validity to a pseudoscientific position.﻿""

I'm open to disagreement on this though. I don't think he was coming from a negative place when he was talking about this issue, but rather was only making the comparison in passing without understanding the problems inherent with such a comparison. But perhaps i am wrong and other people don't consider being trans to be particularly different from being otherkin? I certainly don't but i'm open to hearing from anyone who believes otherwise."
EmilyATrans,asktransgender,Recommended threads/advice for new MtF?,"Hi. I'm 24. 6'3"", size 15 shoes, lots of body hair, and fat. Oh, and I have kind of a bad hairline. I don't think I'm balding. My dad and my grandpa both had my exact same hairline when they were 24 and still have it in their 50s and 70s respectively. Point is, I look very male.

I've known I was trans for a while, but until recently I suppressed those thoughts pretty thoroughly. I thought if I just ignored being trans long enough, it would go away (it didn't).

I've finally come to the realization that I need to transition. But because I've never allowed myself to think about this before, I have a lot of questions. I'm hoping that if I just get them all out here, you can provide answers or links to good threads where answers have already been given.

-HRT: how do I start? What can I expect from it? Is there any way I can do this on my parents' insurance without them knowing (I actually did see that question elsewhere here, I am keeping an eye on that)? I've set up an appointment with a therapist for the first time in my life. She specializes in LGBT stuff. That seems like the first step, but I don't know?

-Doubts: How do I deal with those? I realized that I needed to transition after both a lengthy conversation with my one trans friend and reading Nevada at her suggestion. It's been about a week since then and I keep having these thoughts, like, ""Wait, what if I'm not trans."" I've felt like I was a girl for a long as I can remember. I started secretly crossdressing when I was 12. When I talked to my friend, she immediately knew like, five different things about me that I didn't tell her because it was all stuff she went through as a trans woman who needed to transition. I definitely need to transition. I think part of my doubt comes from fear. It's especially prevalent when I'm around other people and I know how much I look like a dude. I also have a tendency to doubt myself about literally anything. On more than one occasion I have been standing at a urinal and suddenly panicked thinking that I had walked into the women's room by mistake (I'm sure that has NOTHING to do with gender issues). I just know that if I don't transition now all that's going to happen is that I'm going to spend another five years miserably avoiding my own thoughts and maybe trying to kill myself again. So how do I get passed these doubts?

-Coming out: how and when do I do that? I've literally never heard my parents say a single word about trans people. They're very religious. They go to a mega church (that my dad works for) that's never explicitly anti-LGBT but I know the pastor personally and he's definitely not a fan of ours. They're also Democrats, but not especially liberal. I have no idea how they'd react. My friends are all the type who support trans people in theory but also roll their eyes when they hear the term ""cis"". It's all very frightening to me.

-Community: Is there a good way to meet trans people in real life so I can be open around someone? I went to a trans support group at the local LGBT center. There were only four of us there and we didn't really connect at all. The one trans friend I mentioned earlier lives on the other side of the country, we only know each other online.

-Practical stuff: How I do find my style? How do I find my sizes? How do I put on make up? Can I buy good make up on Amazon (because I can send it to an amazon locker since I'm still too embarrassed to buy it in a store or risk my roommates seeing the packages)? What can I do about my hair? And I'm talking about the hair on my head (how do I make it look more like a lady's hair) and the hair on my body (how do I get rid of that nonsense)?

-Body image issues: I would like to be able to pass. I recognize that's not necessarily going to be possible. How can I be okay with that? There are trans women who don't quite pass but are still beautiful. How can I see myself the way I see them? Gwendoline Christie is my height and she's awesome. I try to think of her. But how many Gwendoline Christie's can there be in the world?

Finally, this is a small thing, but how do I describe myself right now? Not in a major way, I'm a woman and I prefer female pronouns, I know that the way I look has nothing to do with that. What I mean is, literally what is the best way to describe myself in the title of this post. I already used ""new MtF"" but that doesn't feel totally right since I've thought of myself as trans for years even if I tried not to and haven't decided to do anything about it till now.

TL;DR: GAAAAAAAH HOW DO I TRANS???????????

I_hate_naming_things,asktransgender,I now know why therapists suggest weekly sessions.,"I had my first therapy session almost a week ago, and it was good. It felt great to get these thoughts of wanting to be a woman out after bottling up for so long. 

Right now, I have it set up where I see here every other week, mainly because my insurance doesn't cover her (I'm planning on switching to one that will, but I have to wait until October to do so), and I have a lot of medical bills and student loans debt. I didn't really want to pay more than I have to, so she agreed to do every other week and if only I didn't gave her any reason to move it to weekly. Since I don't have suicidal or homicidal thoughts, or a drinking problem (now I really could use some beer or some whiskey, but I can't since I'm on pain meds because of a recent surgery), I really don't have to worry about giving her a reason. 

Since the session, my issues are just getting stronger, stronger than they have ever been before. It's to the point where I'm having trouble sleeping. I think that is because I only have one person to talk to about this, and that is my therapist, which I can only speak with her every other week. I don't have a girlfriend or a wife, and I'm not going to tell anyone else, at least not until I figure this out. 

I usually can sort out my issues by myself, but when I started getting anxiety, I knew I needed some help. Did a lot of research and wanted to make sure that I would fit my needs and I was comfortable with. There was only one that meet all my needs that was covered by my current insurance, and it was a man. For some reason, I wasn't comfortable speaking with a man about this. So I thought it was best to pay a little extra for someone that I would be happy with. 

The guy who has been training me at work said that I should try working every other Saturday for some overtime. And I thought, yeah I could do that to help out with my student loans. Now I'm thinking about doing overtime to do weekly therapy sessions. And use what is left over for my student loans. 

Is it normal to have TG issues become stronger after seeing a therapist? Should I go for getting overtime so I can get weekly sessions? Would that help if I did?"

I'm 23 cis male. 
1. Will I pass? I most likely need lazer hair removal and FFS.
2. My dad will kick me out and disown me. 
3. I would have to find a place to live, maybe live in a new state.

His wife is not supportive of his cross dressing and does everything in her power to not acknowledge it. She is ashamed he likes to dress up as a woman and it's putting a huge strain on their marriage. 

I feel he is in a spot where he is trying to identify if he just likes dressing up as a woman or if he is trans.

daisylake,asktransgender,How do I stop caring when people stare?,"*sorry that this post may be long*

I am a non-binary person who is just beginning to ground myself in my identity. Ive began transitioning from female to where I am now by things like cutting my hair short, buying more neutral clothing etc. I haven't come out to many people yet so I guess part of me is still closeted. 
I'm still finding my feet but I'm becoming comfortable with my identity and expression. I feel most myself in loose shirts, jeans and sneakers, but part of being NB is also still enjoying some old purses or small feminine backpacks or cardigans I have.

So today I'm wearing 'boyfriend' jeans, a stripe shirt, black hoodie and converse sneakers.. With a over the shoulder crochet purse I love. I would probably 'pass' as a boy if I hadn't worn the purse. (I think I look cute though ^^)

And as I was approaching the bus stop a guy was staring very obviously at me. I looked him directly in the eye with an unimpressed poker face for a while to try to make him feel uncomfortable back and stop, but he'd glance away then stare back at me again. I had to wait behind a tree so I knew he wouldn't just stare at me. Not gawk in a sexual way like you'd get dressed as full female, but stare in what I imagine to be bewilderment of what gender I am or why a guy is wearing a purse. 

I know in the scheme of the universe and my blip of existence within it, a guy staring without caring how I feel about it for 1 minute is no big deal. As a female we are taught to brush it off and ignore it, so do I just do the same for this as well? I guess its just frustrating that people chose to stare rudely than just accept people vary from one another and move on.  (and Soul Essence by Rameses B stared playing hahaha)

Blargh. How do you do it without getting mentally worn out and mellow about gender oppression? #Firstworldproblem? I am the sort of person who just wants to blend in the background and not stand out a terrible deal, so this sort of thing makes me very uncomfortable.

sgftmthrowaway,asktransgender,"How do I tell my parent that she's not as ""supportive"" as she thinks she is?","(I'm FTM)

I came out to my mum 6 years ago, and started physically transitioning 5 years ago. She flipped out completely at first, correcting strangers when they addressed me as male, getting upset when we were out and I went to the male bathroom, and so on. 

Over time I think she has mellowed out or gotten used to it a bit, she doesn't throw her silent tantrums any more. However she still never calls me by my chosen name (I've been known as ""dear"" for 6 years now!). She avoids using pronouns in front of me, but behind my back uses female pronouns and my birth name. To her, she thinks she's being supportive. I would like to tell her that I don't feel respected as a person, even though she doesn't call me female to my face. I just need help expressing that because I'm not good with words and feelings, so I was hoping someone could help me with that. We're the kind of family that doesn't communicate - we haven't talked about me being trans for 5 years, so maybe she thinks I'm okay with her behaviour. 

Even though it's not outright abuse, it makes me feel uncomfortable to be around her because I know that she doesn't think of me as a man. I don't mean to sound petty but I would feel no remorse about cutting ties with her. I would like to move out, and I will as soon as I'm financially stable. 

I would appreciate any and all advice about how to approach talking about it with her. "
watashi04,asktransgender,"Indecision(that I don't need to decide about, but like, identity and stuff)","So to clear, the flair is legit, I've never had real concerns about secretly not being transwhatever(thoughts of that nature are frequently solved with 'Then go use male pronouns, you dork!). Obviously I am loving the shit out of hormones(even a fairly meager 1mg dose has given me entry-level boobs, slightly softer skin, a better face and... leaks), and I'm probably getting my dosage upped soon(woohoo!). No, this is about the other thing - pretty much the only thing I have a choice about in this process.

I was so sure of myself for the longest time. Like, *Okay, gonna get hormones, a very specific orchi, tuck like no tomorrow for literally ever, then SRS ASAP!* was my thought process, because like, fucking ugh - boy parts. Gross, right? As a side note, the feeling probably comes from spending so much time on /d/ and seeing 

\&gt;feminine dick 

shitposters. But like, whatever.

I was talking to a friend recently--actually also from 4chan--about getting SRS. The conversation was as follows, verbatim;

me: fucking hate this shit

her: nani?

me: the thing that makes the tiny jeans not fit

her: but why ;~;

me: cause it's a gross boything?

her: but like

her: what if

her: girls could have dicks dude, like, did you ever consider that

And the thing was, I kind of hadn't. Like, I always figured it was gross and bad and un-womanly by nature. Maybe it was /d/, maybe it was social stigma, maybe it was that its associated junk spent like fifteen years pumping T into me, but whatever. So I went soul-searching, and at the end of a very pensive week I had these conclusions;

I would only really hate this because

- Clothes don't fit because tucking is hard(would become easier after an orchiectomy)

- Social acceptability issues

...I realized I at least didn't mind it. I did a bunch of looking into genital dysphoria and such, and like, those people's experiences, the feelings they expressed, were nothing like mine. I use it during sex a lot, I can see it and not burst into tears, and it's kind of fun, even. The only time it bothers me is when I see it in a mirror--partly because I don't pass very well, so it doesn't help, and partly because *eww, boy parts*, which I know isn't necessarily true, but... that's a hard notion to beat out of myself. How do I dis-associate it from that notion? 'Cause like, I feel like the auto-associated male-ness skews my view.

(As a side note, the friend also brought up that SRS techniques, while rapidly improving, aren't so great--dilation is still required)

Now, I know a lot of you are gonna say 'You don't have to decide, you have time', and like, yeah, but no. 'Cause being sure of my identity is nice, and not knowing pisses me off to be honest. So like, share any useful thoughts below!"

Hi_im_Lexi,asktransgender,"Thank you, Caitlyn Jenner","While in the shower, I was listening to a bit of M83's new album, Junk. It's really good, but it takes me back to when I went through my last M83 phase.

It was early June 2015, and my family and I were staying in the Foxwoods hotel/casino for a night for my aunt's birthday. I remember just laying in bed, staring out the window at the starry sky, and listening to Moonchild by M83. I remember feeling that I just wanted to be let free. I couldn't explain the emotions at the time, but it was around the time that Caitlyn Jenner was in the news.

The next day on the trip back to my family's place in Rhode Island, my family started discussing Caitlyn Jenner and GRS and stuff. I instantly started defending her and how she felt. In that moment, I knew that I was transgender. I understood those feelings that I had the night before. It all came together. And to this day, I have vivid memories of those events. They were the real start to my transition, even if I didn't actually start taking steps for a few months afterwords.

So thank you, Caitlyn Jenner, for bringing visibility to the transgender community, and giving me the internal push I needed to start my transition. 

It's just crazy how music can bring back so many memories.

I haven't told the school yet, and I don't really know how they would react to the news, seeing as though I didn't hint at or imply this at all in my application. There's a dress code during the day for the boys which i'm really not looking forward to, and i'd have to live in the boys dorm and room with a complete stranger. If I'm going to be seeing changes during that time period, and also dressing like a girl in my free time and on the weekends, i'm worried that its going to be extremely awkward for everyone involved.

Has anyone else been in a situation like this? I'm afraid of being harassed and/or having to sacrifice my identity to fit in."

BellaEllaElla,asktransgender,"I was trying to get an internship, I decided that I don't want it anymore, but someone stuck their neck out for me. I thought about calling as if I was srill interested but dropp that I'm trans and ymsee how they react.","I'm getting really tired if trying to communicate with this guy. He's probably tired of me too.

We've been corresponding for over 2 months mostly via email. 1 time over the phone to set up an interview for over thw phone. He asked to have it at a very small window/inconvenient time for me, but I didn't want to show I wasn't flexible so I said yes and set my alarm, but still missed it because I was super busy.

He didn't like that. I can't just not try again because it's making the guy sho recommended me look bad which in turn adds much mote stress than having to find an internship for my major for the summer next month. I don't want to make this guy look bad, I also do some side business with him. He does know I'm trans but would recommend from me mentioning it to the interviewer. 

I'm about all out of options and really don't want to have to play the trans card, but maybe he'll understand and show it, or he'll ""not discriminate"" but actually discriminate which kinda gets me off the hook as.

Has anyone else ever done this?

defsophiaray,asktransgender,Has anyone used messaging-based therapy Talk Space? What was your experience?,"I ran into this and it sounded like it could be a great option for people (like me) who find it difficult to get through all the hoops to find a therapist who: specializes in gender therapy, is covered by my insurance, is taking new patients, is close to me, and is okay to talk to. It's also relatively cheap ($99/month) for anyone who doesn't have insurance or has a high deductible plan or something. I just started it today so I'll post back when I've used it for longer.

The basic gist is that you tell them info about you (like that you're interested in gender therapy) and they match you up with a real therapist who you communicate with over basically a messaging system. When you are matched up with a therapist, you can switch at any time. And the therapist basically checks twice a day to respond to your messages. I could see a lot of people disliking the lack of a face-to-face interaction but I think I actually prefer this method, at least right now. Anyway, I'm curious what everyone else's thoughts are.

Here's a [link](https://www.talkspace.com) to their site. They also have a referral program but I didn't want to include my referral link because I don't want to be spamming people."
mylifetrans,asktransgender,Dosage question?,"So I'm just about to be on Estradiol and Spironolactone for one month, and after visiting my Dr. today to renew my prescription, she didn't up the dosage at all. I don't know too much about it, but I generally heard that the dosage is supposed to go up after a month, right? 


I'm only on 0.5mg Estradiol twice a day and 50mg Spironolactone once a day. Is that too low to really see any progress in the coming months? For some insight, I am 5'5 and 120 lbs. Thanks in advance!

Edit: I thought I should add that the only changes I have seen/felt so far both physically and mentally, is that my nipples have become sore since about 2 weeks ago. Nothing noticeable about skin of facial hair or body hair. Maybe I am just over optimistic at how long it takes to notice some changes?"

I know there's not much clinical literature about this specific problem, but from what I can tell, this effect *seems* to be connected with whether or not a person has experienced a significant drop in libido. I've also read that certain HRT components can actually raise libido...

I'm already 24 and I seriously want to have a talk with an (East Coast) endocrinologist regarding my options as soon as possible. Getting that appointment will be a world of hurdles onto itself, but I want to know: has anyone else had similar stories about this sort of thing? Weighing the pros and cons, or maybe dealing with unwanted changes? And if anyone else has any insight into my precise situation, that would be greatly appreciated too...

At this point I feel like I'm stuck having to choose between losing ""my penis"" as I know it (I know that's a weird way to put it, but it's true to what it feels like to me) or living my whole life in a body ruined by testosterone..."

tryagainsvp,asktransgender,Melancholy Ramblings,"Maybe it's the right-wing articles I found myself reading, or perhaps it's just a bad day, but I can't shake this, I need some support.

Is this alright? Is it okay to be transgender?

It's been over a year now, and I want to stay true to myself, and what I'm feeling, but the media and the people around me more often than not, would like me to doubt myself, and doubt myself I do. The doubt shifts to self-loathing, I don't want to live, I feel like a mistake.

If this is a mental illness, and addressing me with different pronouns is feeding into my delusions, what other options are there? I don't want to be a woman. I have never wanted to be a woman, and all that comes with being female.

All I want is to live as any other person and strive to find eventual happiness and comfort. What's so wrong with that? Is it really such a big deal to address me as a man, even if you think biological sex translates always translates into gender?

Thanks for reading this melancholy rambling, cheers."
anna3012,asktransgender,Bad Situation with Mum,"I'm just so down right now, fuck! I'm 23 (MTF) having my first appointment with my endocrinologist on the 10th of May, my therapist is gonna give me an indication for it on the 25th of April. 

So friday night I came out to my parents. So far so good, they were really supportive and I was massively relieved. I talked a lot about how I felt during the whole time, I told them about the endocrinologist and that I plan on starting HRT soon. Fast forward to the next morning, I come down for breakfast and she's crying. It really hurt seeing that an she kinda mumbled how it feels i like a loss for her. I told her i can understand and she replies ""no you don't"". That response was the first moment where I realized things weren't going in a good direction. She seemed very tense the whole day, in the eveing we had dinner with my 2 brothers who came visiting (one from abroad) so it seemed better. 

Then, this morning the same situation again. But now she's not only crying but now she's kinda angry and making me feel guilty. She accuses me of just telling them and leaving them in the dark about how this is actually going to go about. Now it is true that I dont have everything 100% planned out, I finished my bachelor in february and doing an internship till the end of July now (in an other city, so I live in that city during the week). Afterwards i planned on probably finishing my civilian service (instead of military) for 5 months and then starting my Masters somewhere next year. I initially thought of socially transitioning in late summer maybe. That said, I have a lot of question marks still, but I'm sure I want to transition as well. But the only thing she does right now is making me guilty about how in the end it's always them having to deal with everything and so on. She said if I were independent it were no problem, but that she and Dad would like to  finally ha some time to do stuff on their own and everytime there's something more coming. The thing is, there was a situation a couple of years ago where my sister wanted to go abroad to study (which she did) and this whole thing really reminds of that. Right now, literally everytime I talk to her its a fucking accusation about something. 

In her view, I was making demands to them when coming out, even though that's literally the last fucking thing i thought about on friday night. She's coming at me with all this questions about what exactly my plan is. I told her, that first I wanted to go on hormones and about my the rest, but she makes it seem like I am suppposed to have some kind of masterplan for everything right now. I was opening up to them with my biggest fear in life and all I get to feel is guilt now. I completely understand her grief and that it's difficult, but I feel so fucking bad now. My dad is really cool with it, but he's also the quite one and doesn't stand up to her. My sister is coming for holidays in June and I told them I might tell her then. Today she even accused me of that, of how I'm so selfish, she's coming for holidays  and I'm gonna tell her something like that. Btw, medical costs for transition and stuff is all covered by insurance in my country, so that shouldn't be the problem.
 
Wow, writing this I realize how fucked up this all is. I know that she's going through a process of grief now and that I shouldn't let myself dwell into that as well, but it just feels like my life has become a fucking mess now in an instant. I can't even think about transition stuff right now, it's just making me feel so bad. Sorry for the text being such a mess, but I just don't know what to do right now. I feel like the relationship with her is never gonna be the same again.."

i don't know where to ask this at all, but it has to do with moving out and being able to transition. plus i trust you guys. i know someone here can help me.

i'm american. i live in italy. i'm moving back to the US very soon. i'm turning 18 next month. my parents shelter me and i need to learn how to be an adult.

i don't have my own bank account. i need somewhere to store money and do online transactions (i want to sell some of my art) so i can afford to move out of a toxic household and transition.

i can't let my parents find this. i know nothing on banks and money. there are so many banks to choose from, and i don't want to pick the ""wrong"" one. i don't know if this is too personal, but what bank do you use? is this something i just shouldn't ask?

also, i need to know if i can create an account under my ""new"" name, or if it must be made with my birth name/gender (i haven't started transitioning yet). if not, where is it easiest to change my name/sex marker? are there any banks i should avoid because i'm transgender (who knows)?

mind you that i'm not 18 yet. should i wait until then? will my parents find out about my account?"

And I'm not going to stop HRT just to lose weight when I've been on it for nearly 4 months.

[deleted],asktransgender,Am I being impatient?,"I've been meeting with a psychiatrist for about 4 months now, and we've almost exclusively been talking about my dysphoria and helping me think through my gender identity. He obviously recognizes that I'm trans, and he has been very useful in helping me deal with my poor family dynamic, and to ask me essential self reflection questions about how I want to present myself. 

However, what we haven't talked a whole lot about is treatment. My dysphoria is really bad, and i've made it clear to him that its affecting my life in a very negative way, and that i'd like to alleviate that burden. Of course, talking about the small things I can do to better be myself without HRT for the time being is good, but I don't think he understands that I'm ready to move on to the next step. These past few days I've been really paranoid that my body is becoming more masculine, and the idea itself scares me to the point of crying sometimes. He's not even a gender therapist, all I want from him is a referral. I recognize that I've only been out to people about this for a few months, but I've felt like this for a long time, given this a ton of thought and decided that I want to start HRT to change my body. He even knows that I feel that way, but it still feels like we're taking this at a snails pace.

Sorry if this is coming off like a rant, I just had an appointment with him today where I was silently hoping during the meeting that he would suggest I go to a Gender Therapist, but he didn't. My next meeting with him isn't for another 2 weeks from now, and I don't think I can last 2 weeks more of paranoia and self hate. Am I asking too much? Should I be taking this slowly and not focus so much on HRT as the end goal?"

I'm 20 and live in the UK. I spoke to my general doctor and they referred me to a service that I already use to deal with my depression, which surprised me. I spoke to them on the telephone, and they said they actually didn't know much about it but could refer me to yet another service.

I have done some thinking as to why it is and while I am starting to accept myself I fear that this therapist will tell me that I am not trans. I might even believe them. I never experienced much dysphoria to the point where I realised what the source is. I hated my body and I thought it was because I was fat. I hated myself as a person for seemingly no reason. I don't hate my voice but would love to have a female voice, I don't hate my beard but would love to have no beard. I fear that the therapist will not agree that I am in fact a woman and I fear that if I lie to get hormones anyway I will end up realizing I am not trans. On good days I don't feel dysphoric at all on bad days I'd rather kill myself and shave every 6 hours because the stubble on my chin is annoying me. I want to be a woman, *I am a woman* but fear that I am not trans despite who I think I am. Help me to understand this whole thing to give me some piece of mind. I am in germany and it can take up to god knows how long but at minimum one year before I can start anything in terms of medical transitioning."

I casually e-mailed the admissions office, though, just to confirm my suspicion. But to my surprise, they just emailed back telling me that they have, actually, admitted trans men in the past and that they continue to do so! I'm super psyched.

strangleroot,asktransgender,"I think spironolactone is causing sexual dysfunction, what should I do?","Hey all, I'm feeling really scared, conflicted, and alone over this, so I thought I would come here for some advice. For some background, I've been on estradiol for about 15 months now, and spironolactone for 13-14, with my dosage being steadily increased over that period. I had been on 8 mg of estradiol (4 mg twice per day), and 100 mg of spironolactone (50 mg twice per day) for a good while now, but a few weeks ago, my dose of spiro was doubled, and I now take 200 mg per day.

Initially, I was happy to be upping my dosage, since things like body hair have always been an issue for me, and I felt that it might help my breast growth, but I've run into the problem of sexual dysfunction, which I feel is a result of this, as well. About a week after upping my dose, things got physical between myself and my new partner (a cis woman). From the get go, I found that I was having difficulty keeping my erection, and actually finishing took considerable work from both of us. I was a little bit drunk, and had smoked a decent amount of pot before this, though, so I initially felt this may have been the reason for the difficulty. 

Fast forward a week or so now, and I've had similar problems every time we've had sex, culminating in me not even being able to keep it up long enough for p-in-v intercourse to happen last night. Prior to upping my dosage, I had not been sexually active for about a month or two, save for some irregular masturbation, but this had never happened to me, and I was understandably really embarrassed, and honestly heartbroken at the thought that this could be the direct result of my HRT.

As of now, I'm contemplating not taking spiro for a few days, before dropping down to 100-150 mg/day in order to see if this will help solve my problem. Is this a fair course of action? Does anyone have alternative options for me? I'd really appreciate the help."

Simply not passing I can live with- being told ""oh, you're such a cute girl, you can't be a man"" I can't. Especially when it's from my family. After a day of suffocating in a binder and 4 layers of clothes, avoiding speaking to people and eating next to nothing to lose the weight off my cheeks, the last thing I want to hear is how pretty I would look in this dress or that one. 

I will admit, before I came out I was usually very feminine, to the point of being stereotypical even.  But these things are not part of who I am anymore. The only thing is, I still wear jewelry- not a lot, and nothing incredibly feminine even- should I stop? While it is still certainly nice to be seen as attractive, I'd rather not be reminded of how unpassable I am all the time.

I do not intend to medically transition as it is against my personal views, but besides that, I've done everything I could think of. Has anyone else experienced this? Please forgive me if this came off as too much of a rant."

The problem is now that I've come out to them and they're fully supportive (though I now know I don't like the term 'sex change' but they didn't know the proper terms), I immediately started regretting the decision. ""What have I done?"" ""What if I'm not trans and this is a mistake?"" Things like that, and now wanting to transition is far from my mind and instead I can't help but keep thinking about all the negative things that could happen if I did start."
_Twigs_,asktransgender,"[NSFW] Comfortable being Female, but hate my genitals. Am I trans?","I'm cis female and identify as female/hetero-romantic/grey asexual. I have always not liked my genitals.

Does this mean I'm trans in some way, and if not what am I?"
sultrySylph,asktransgender,Am I still a trans male if I enjoy wearing feminine clothing sometimes?,"I am not on reddit very often (and I've never posted or responded on this section of it), but I don't have any other places to get advice from so here I am regardless. I am ftm and have identified as such for nearly two months now, though I suspect the identity has been in the back of my mind for much, much longer. I've dealt with severe dysphoria for around a year and have gotten pretty good at managing it. (Most times I only feel dysphoria every few weeks.) I have began to transition by wearing more masculine clothing and cutting my hair but I'm a little confused with myself.

I want to be a guy and I want he/him pronouns to be consistently used but I also like to wear girly clothes on certain occasions. I'm not big on skirts or dresses, but sometimes it's nice to wear other types of more feminine clothing such as certain shirts and jeans. However I don't think of this in a crossdressing way and just see it as me wanting to wear girly clothes on some days. I haven't come out to my family (though they suspect anyways), and I am stuck with them due to health reasons (nothing too severe but it does require blood work often which is too expensive to pay on my own.) I don't want to be perceived as a woman or any of the nonbinary genders as I am comfortable being male. I also see no need to get surgery of any kind because I am generally comfortable with how my body looks with just a binder on. I'm mostly wondering if this makes me any less of a guy or if it's just the end of an extensive phase. I'm also wondering if anybody else has gone through anything similar.

tl;dr I want to be perceived as male (and not nonbinary or female) but I also like to wear feminine clothes on certain days when I'm in a more girly mood and without other people around (I do not like to crossdress). The only thing is I'm questioning if that still makes me the trans male I've identified as for a while now or if it was just an extensive phase that I'm now getting over. 

Thank you in advance for any responses, and I apologize if this wasn't said very well."

The trouble is I can't seem to get a job despite having a two year degree and I know it's a bad idea to move thousands of miles away (live in Tennessee) with no plan but my home situation isn't getting better and it's time for me to just leave.

For anybody that lives in Tacoma are there any decent shelters I could perhaps stay at until I get on my feet. Preferably one that's trans friendly.

Or if anyone is generous enough maybe let me stay at your place I may not have much money but I can cook, clean, house sit, baby/pet sit, or help with school work for those in college (especially history and geography). I love animals and I'm ok with alcohol and 420 just as long no legal trouble occurs on my end. I also promise I'll be seeking a job and not be a total bum. In the end I just want what most on this board want to be able to transition and live happily. Any help I can get is much appreciated.

I will make an effort to tidy my house and care but I clean for a living and as I said I can't be arsed. I don't want to blow this because this woman is my type (trans isn't my type..) and she seems really awesome. My last relationship was with a nice trans girl but I ducked that up royally. Am I overthinking? My therapist said even if there is no chemistry it's good for me to meet other trans. I'm pre everything and don't really want to transition unless I have to.

Lizasaurus2,asktransgender,I don't want to just be post transition. I want to leave the trans label behind as well. Anyone else feel the same?,"Hey everyone.

I don't like being trans. Dysphoria's a bitch, people are a bitch, everything is just a bitch in general. I want to transition and then be done with everything. In doing so, I want to leave the trans label behind.

I feel like it wouldn't accurately describe me any more. I mean, I would have changed my sex right? Some people would argue otherwise because I can't play the female role in reproduction but that's just semantics. I would have changed enough such that I *clearly* resemble a female rather than a male, while performing the reproductive role of neither. That's good enough. In doing so, technically my gender identity will match my sex. Meaning I'm no longer trans.

That's how I want to feel about myself. I don't want to be post transition but post transgender also.

I'm not disagreeing with trans people who want to keep the label either. It's really about what you think applies to you.

Anyway, from what I can gather my local community looks down on this type of thinking. They think it'd be like turning your back on other trans people. Plus who wants to be a cis person amirite? They're gross. If you're trans then you'll always be trans /s.

I don't get it though. Just because I'll be a ""cis"" person doesn't mean I won't continue to support those who are transitioning...

So I feel pretty alone. I was wondering if anyone else feels the same way I do. Also I'd like to know how everyone feels about my thinking. Like I said before though, I'm not disagreeing with post transition people who continue to call themselves trans. I just think this way about myself. The trans label is all to do with how you feel about yourself anyway.

Thanks in advance."
lexibabys2,asktransgender,(Post 2weeks SRS-Chettawut) Dilation,"So I got my srs by Dr. Chettawut along with BA (so painful) and it's been little over 2 weeks. The concern that I have is that I think I might have been doing dilation the wrong way... So my ass thought that the whole process including getting to full depth (which was initially ""6 inches"" by the nurse after the packing removal) was included in 30 mins. But I don't know if i lost depth or if the nurse measured it wrong but when I'm spreading my legs and inserting the dilator, the 6 inch mark never disappeared but it was very close to my labia majora which btw is really puffy atm. So i don't know if we are supposed to measure our depth ending at where the ""lips"" of vagina is or actually in the ""hole"". because to me, it seemed like my ""in the hole/non visible"" part is between 5.5"" and 6"" and 6 inche mark is little above the lips. But, if I don't spread my leg and kind of let my legs parallel, then the lip part of the vagina closes so it looks like my depth is 6 inch since the lip part of vagina hugs the dilator adding fewer depth with the skin part. So to me, i was extremly worried whether I lost depth or not because it was like that since the beginning of dilation and I made sure I hit the end of the wall where i can really feel it if I twist it around. And I heard pushing too much can cause damage so I don't push beyond that. So to all the girls who have gotten SRS (doesn't have to be chettawut girls) 
1.  did you guys notice like almost 1/2 inch shorter than what your nurse initially tell you after the packing removal? 2. For the dilation part, do you start 30mins after the dilator reaches the ""full depth"" mark or is the whole ""going in till the end"" part of the 30 mins?
3. How do you actually measure the depth? is it including the skin of the labia majora (lip) of the vagina or actually the depth of the hole itself excluding any external skin or whatnot."
protodro,asktransgender,I'm struggling with uncertainty about whether my partner will leave me when I transition.,"My boyfriend of three years is cis and heterosexual. I came out to him when I was seriously questioning my gender identity last summer. To begin with I was only planning to change my pronouns and explore my gender presentation, and he wasn't exactly happy, but he was willing to accept it and eventually he got used to using ""they"" pronouns around me.

After exploring my gender for several months I eventually came to realise that I identify more-or-less as a non-binary trans guy. I expanded out to include ""he"" pronouns and told him that I was pretty confident that I wanted to start taking testosterone eventually. I just started the GIC referral process, got my blood test a few days ago, and am hoping that I will have my first appointment within 6 months. If I'm very lucky I might start transitioning this year, but otherwise I will probably start testosterone in the first part of next year.

He wasn't exactly happy, but he said that he was willing to stay with me and see how things changed, and that he wanted to try to stick it out with me. He said he wasn't sure how he would feel when I transitioned or if we would stay together, but he wanted to give it a try.

But how am I supposed to deal with this kind of uncertainty in our relationship? Loving someone is a really emotionally vulnerable experience, and I'm supposed to just make myself vulnerable while I wait for him to decide whether or not he wants to reject me? We've had other issues in our relationship lately, but this is the main reason why I find myself becoming more emotionally closed off, because I can't fully give myself to someone when I'm anticipating that they will lose their attraction to me. I'm prematurely finding myself already trying to move on, because I don't know if I can handle rejection at the same time as beginning a physical transition.

I've talked about this with him but he just keeps saying that he wants to try to stay with me and that he loves me. I understand that, and I feel like I should at least wait and see what happens. But I really don't know how to handle this because he's not able to give me any reassurance or confidence about whether or not we have a future together.

Anyone had a similar experience? What should I do?"

windlep7,asktransgender,I think aspergers complicates things.,"I've read countless stories of people encountering harassment, discrimination, abuse, etc here and I honestly don't know how they deal with it.  People just seem to take it in their stride, while I think I would curl up into a ball and die if it was me.

I think the problem is I've never learned how to respond appropriately to abuse.  I was bullied in school and never responded to it, so people kept doing it because they got away with it.  When someone gives me abuse I tend to get filled with rage, which I have to suppress, because I know I can't lash out or I'll get into trouble.  I then don't know what to do and become depressed/stressed/frustrated.

The other issue is my emotions are often intense and sometimes erratic.  I can go from feeling perfectly fine to feeling like I want to kill myself, to feeling fine again, in minutes.  

I'm just wondering if anyone else struggled with these issues and did seeing a therapist help?  I feel like I need someone to teach me the social skills required for dealing with abuse, etc."

[deleted],asktransgender,"After the months I've spent here, I had to come to the conclusion that is a toxic community.","I hate to say this, but I'll delete my /r/asktransgender-only account, and not look back at this place again. This community became more and more toxic recently, and I don't want this anymore. My 7 reasons in increasing order of importance (i.e. least important first):

1. Bandwagon &amp; general love of drama. It's rare for a single legitimate question to receive responses from more than 3 people. But if it's subreddit-drama? Hundreds and hundreds of you come to bandwagon.

2. There is only one person in the modteam who I can fully respect, /u/CedarWolf. Brilliant job, handles the community very well, deserves a round of applause. The rest are either ""not too bad, but could be better"", and there are 3 who clearly feel like they are superior (let me give you a hint, you aren't).

3. Refusal to help people become more knowledgeable. The active people here seem like they assume that ""y'know, I know of transgender, so I can expect this cis person who's never had dysphoria to know everything and use the correct words and if not, I can hate them"". Well, no, you can't, and every time you do that, you make me (and yourself) lose a potential ally.

4. This is something the community is divided on, but nevertheless: people constantly trying to ban suicide posts. I know why would you wanna do that, I've been through that shit and still experience awful things every time someone talks about it, but if even one life is saved, then I'm willing to recollect memories from the worst parts of my life every once in a while just by browsing the sub.

5. Very clearly visible everywhere: **95% of you ignore the existence of us non-binary folk**. I've come here with the ""knowledge"" that yeah, I'm just as trans as the binary people here, but I see that this idea is being constantly shit on. I'm not trans enough to not be erased in the majority of the comments you make. I don't even know if it's deliberate, but it still hurts. The only reason why I haven't posted this as the most important problem is because this is probably accidental.

6. Lots, and lots of bad advice. Someone is questioning? Instantly trans. IRL, I know more people who were questioning at some time, and are cis, than I know people who are trans. Someone wants to genuinely know if they are passing? The answer is always yes. Could continue, but I don't wanna. And then often times, inconsistence. Someone can say DIY is their only option and get shut down with ""no DIY!"" or someone might not say anything about it, but still get DIY as an advice (which usually gets shut down, so that's a plus point for mods).

7. Something that surprised me, loads of people refuse to see that other people have different experiences. Example: Someone says that passing is important for them? You'll come and flood that person with replies like ""but passing is not important!"" - maybe not to you. Someone says about an experience that was different than that of the majority? They are gonna be shut down.

So, yeah. I don't want to be here anymore. It hurts quite a bit, because my main intent is to help others, but with such a toxic community, I can't, and don't want to. I might try to look for people wanting help on tumblr, even though that's the least suitable platform. Or re-register for the genderqueer sub only."
TomHenrik,asktransgender,"People make it sound cool, but don't understand...","I have this issue which is really bothering me. Since I've come out as ftm to my friends, things have been going ""great"". They're all supportive and very nice about it. But whenever I talk to them I feel like they don't really get my situation.
Very often, if I have a bad day because of my dysphoria and stuff, they are like: ""I don't get why you're still feeling bad. We're accepting you, so you don't have any reason to feel bad anymore."" Or other times they're like: ""Don't worry about anything. It will work out and you'll manage."" I guess they mean it in a nice, encouraging way but they make it sound so easy - like they really have no clue how hard it is sometimes. All the dysphoria, all the daily challenges we have to face - starting with the public bathroom problem to unsuccessfully trying to pass, to having to use an ID with the wrong gender on it and so on.
Sometimes it feels almost a bit degrading. Like I'm going through hell and they make it seem like it's a walk in the park. Do you feel like that sometimes?"
NickyB8355,asktransgender,When to discuss with a spouse?,"Hi everybody. 

First of all, a thank you to everyone who posts on here. I've been reading for a little while without posting, and for me this has been a hugely helpful and informative space - as well as a comforting one. It's nice to know that I'm not the only person in the world dealing with so many of the questions that I've seen posted here. 

I know people have asked about spouses on here before, too, but I haven't seen anything that felt quite the same as what I want to ask. I haven't been lurking for that long, though, so if I'm wrong, and such threads exist, please do point me in the right direction!

I am coming to the conclusion that I may not be completely cis. Even after reading so many stories on here, I still don't know exactly what that means, but I do know that I was AMAB but have daydreamed about being a girl periodically since being a teenager. I have not always known I wanted to be one, and nor do I know that for certain now. But I know that the daydreams have only grown more persistent and all-consuming as I get older. And when I ask myself the old question about the scenario where I can press a button and change overnight - yeah, I want to press it. 

I know for some people, that might be enough to say it's time to do something about it. I'm not so clear. Maybe it's a question of time, and maybe it's not. I don't *hate* being a guy. Sometimes, I positively love it. Other times, I just think it sounds a whole lot easier than the alternative: trying, aged 34, to transform my body from that of a 6 foot 3, broad shouldered, guy, into something that the world at large would accept as a woman. 

But what I have accepted, finally, is that I need to at least talk about this with someone - because bottling it up is not succeeding. Which takes me to the crux of the issue mentioned above. 

TL;DR - I have booked myself in for a counselling session next week. So far, I have not told my wife. There is no immediate need to do so - my appointment is in the middle of the day when she'll be at work (I am self-employed). It kills me to do this without talking to her. We've been married seven years, we're high school sweethearts, and I have long believed her my soulmate. The one previous time I had counselling, also to discuss something I'd never been able to tell anyone before, I made myself tell her before I did the counsellor. 

I don't know if I can do the same this time. I don't know if I should. I don't know what the outcome of all these feelings is going to be, and I'm worried that if I blurt something out, it's going to hurt her horribly - as well as changing the way she sees me forever. But I can't stand lying to her, either. I already feel awful enough that I've never spoken to her about any of these feelings for so many years. 

So should I be honest and try to explain? Would it be helpful, or only stress-inducing, to tell her that I'm going to see a counsellor but that I can't tell her why yet because it's just not something I'm ready to talk about until I understand my own thoughts a little more? Or am I really just better off staying quiet until that time arrives? If anyone has ever found themselves in a similar position to this, I'd love to hear how you handled it. "
Zedkloe,asktransgender,"Started dating a girl, I'm a closeted trans woman","I'm about a month into accepting that I'm transgender or at least partially fluid, still exploring and I recently started dating a girl from work. She's really sweet and we care about each other a lot and can't get enough of each other. I honestly don't know what she sees in me lol. I want to come out to her as bi trans but I'm worried as to how she would take it. I'm not taking hormones but I shave my body, my nails are grown out, and my hair is grown out and I shave my face. She's attracted to all those things and whenever I talk about how I'm not masculine like most guys she tells me that I need to do what makes me feel happy and be true to myself and it that's shaving, growing hair out, doing whatever then I need to do it and she has been very supportive. What I'm trying to ask is does anyone have any tips to go about doing it? I want her to know I'm just afraid she might not take it well and it could ruin the relationship and possibly get out at work. We've known each other and have been talking for months and just started dating two weeks ago. By the way I'm only out to one old highschool friend and I think one of my other friends questions it but doesn't say anything.

Update: Sorry for the late update but I told her and she was very supportive! She loves the feminine things about me and thinks they are cute and sexy and it went very well. We touched on transition a little and I told her that I wasn't sure because who knows when I'll feel comfortable to do that. She said we'd cross that bridge when we got there. So overall it went really well and when she's accepting of me starting to wear feminine clothing in private which is all I'm comfortable with at the moment anyways. We talk about clothes and nails and shoes and I was really surprised she took it so well. The first time I wore women's skinny jeans with a feminine outfit I felt confident and sexy and loved that she supports me, it's euphoric.

Anyways I wish all of you the best and thank you for contributing and reading my post. Take care!"

Yesterday I had my testosterone levels measured via a blood test and I found out that my levels are at 5.0 nmol/L, which is equal to about ~144 ng/dL when converted. My question is, do I need to take any AA's or will E make my levels drop into a more normal female range overtime?

I'm already 1 month and 1 week on E at 4mg per day as of today, however I did not measure those levels because I'm DYI'ng and I really don't want anyone to know about it yet, as I live in a very transphobic country."
trapdoordoll,asktransgender,Kind of an odd question about race and passing,"So, this is purely anecdotal but as a white trans girl who works in a predominantly black neighborhood I get hit on a lot. Like sexual harassment a lot. Its always on casual Fridays at work. I'm in boymode at work but I'm starting to fail a bit and I might have to start going without a casual day. Boobs are thereish even with a sports bra, longer hair, no facial hair, girls jeans etc. Anyway what I'm getting at here is that I get hit on at least once a week by black guys or even some ethnic guys but never ever in my life has a white guy even showed a second of interest. Do you think this is the classic we all look alike? Meaning it's harder for someone of another race to clock a person of another race? I just find it interesting. "

whitegold42,asktransgender,Looking for anecdotes on slow boob growth,"Hi y'all,

I've been in a weird mood lately regarding breast growth. Specifically, today marks five months on HRT for me and I have almost nothing. Basically just a slight amount of fat. The pain is also gone unless I really dig into them.

Does anyone have experience with ""late blooming"" that they feel like sharing? I know the motto is YMMV, and I know fat redistribution takes time, but I'm also getting a wee bit worried and could use some reassurance. I'd be fine with small boobs, but I do want boobs of some sort.

I'm also a little worried about my levels and wondering if they are responsible. I'm at 100 mg spiro and 2 mg of estradiol. My last test was at 74 pg/ml and my doctor said she had no intentions of trying to get that higher."

Dracowulf,asktransgender,Do you ever get blamed for hurting other people for being who you are?,"I came out last night on a facebook post officially (I have come out to many people previously in person) specifying every detail about how I feel, what name I want to be called and what pronouns to use.

However, this morning my Dad called me to tell me, in the calm passive aggressive way he always is with this thing, to tell me that I am hurting my family for what I am saying publicly trying to make me feel guity about being me and for saying who I am in a way to convince me out of it like it is a choice, he even called me the name I specifically said not to use. Now, I'm used to him doing this in a round about way, and I deal with it by just hoping he will help out anyway but this time he really pissed me off so I hung up on him before listening to any more of his bullshit.

segashoujo,asktransgender,I'm so hurt and confused. What do I do? What CAN I do?,"This is going to be a long post. I'm not really sure what it is that I should be asking for, other than that I know I need help. I mention sexual abuse in this post, which I've tried to not be graphic about, so I don't think this is NSFW, but as a heads up, in case that bothers someone.

EDIT: to clarify, yes, I'm aware that some of the feelings that I've had are problematic and conform to a gross societal standard of what women are expected to be. Yes, it's wrong, but I can't help how I've felt. I'm just being candid.

I'm trans (surprise! weren't expecting that, were you?) and I've known for a while. I guess the best place to start is from the beginning, but I'll try to be as concise as possible. 
At first I never felt anything wrong or different, that I can remember. I remember being happy. I'm pretty sure I was. I didnt see things as masculine or feminine, or I cant remember having done so. I liked and did a lot of traditional 'boyish' things, but I also did a lot of traditional 'girl' things. I mean, I dont think I noticed that I was any different from other kids until I was maybe 6 when boys started playing with boys and girls started playing with girls. When that separation started happening I didnt fit in. I didnt want to play rough or do sports or skate and I'd get picked on by boys so I started getting uncomfortable around them. I tried being around girls and that worked for a while until the whole ""boys are icky"" stage where I didnt fit in there, either. I remember being really upset about that but I didnt understand why - I cried a lot. I thought no one liked me or wanted to be friends with me. 


One of the earliest feelings I can remember having is wanting to be ""pretty."" I didnt want to be muddy or dirty which were like the best antonyms I could associate with the word at the time. I used the word a lot and I remember getting corrected and being told that I should use the word handsome instead and I remember thinking that word sounded silly. I had everything about my appearance decided for me, what I wore, my haircut. I've always wanted my hair long, but I was always told by my mom that men shouldn't have long hair and I was too afraid to ask. I remember feeling embarrassed about my hair a lot and so I would wear a hat when I was allowed. 


As I got older I just kept feeling weirder. I didnt understand what I was doing wrong and why no one wanted to be friends with me. anything I asked that my mom didnt know how to explain was given the ""god"" catchall. ""Well, we cant know what gods intentions are but he has a plan for everything and this must be a part of it.""


At first it was only noticing that I was different and not understanding why aside from the ""because god"" handwave. the first time I felt wrong and bothered by my body was when I found out what sex was. I think I was 7; or real close to being 7. I asked her what it meant and what resulted was the talk. ""god made men and women to fit together like puzzle pieces; when a man and a woman get married and want to make a baby, the man puts his penis inside the woman's vagina."" I just remember this instant feeling of grossness and disgust, like - sure, in hindsight, as a kid that's gonna be gross no matter what, but I remember actually feeling almost physically sick at the idea. I instantly felt like putting my penis in anything was wrong and I remember telling her that I would never want to have sex. she said I would change my mind one day and that was pretty much that.


From then on I just remember feeling really weird about my body in a physical sense. until that point, I had felt fine, but once I knew that boys and girls had different bodies I remember feeling really bothered by that fact. that was the first time I felt like something was wrong with me. before I thought I was just different because that was the way ""god"" made me, but then I actually felt bothered. I was a really good at reading from a young age and always read several grades ahead and I remember going through my mom's magazines like cosmo and redbook because I knew that they talked about girl's bodies in them. I don't really remember what I read or if I retained any of it but I just remember being desperate for some kind of answer other than ""god"" for the way I felt. I didn't know how to explain it and anything else i'd ever asked was just handwaved with god this and god that, so I didn't expect that to be any different from the status quo. I never found the words; I just continued to get more and more uncomfortable.


I specifically remember reading the book ""are you there, god? it's me, margaret"" by judy blume for school. if you haven't read it it's the story of a girl in the 60's who goes through puberty and how her friends and her own life changes with time, the things she says and does, having crushes and getting her first period being confused and undecided about religion and having to deal with what results from that. it really spoke to me, because I would imagine I was margaret and I would be excited for the things she was excited for, to grow up, to develop a feminine figure, to be noticed and found attractive.


The feeling continued to worsen but I didn't know what to say and who to say it to if I did. The only person I could talk to was my mom, who was (and still is to this day) emotionally and physically abusive. If I wasn't getting the religious brushoff, I was being insulted and belittled. I couldn't trust her (and again, still can't) and so eventually when I got older I learned to keep quiet, because that was what made her happiest. I had a few other family members (dad, grandparents, all now dead) but because of their close connection to her, I didn't feel I could communicate my problems to them, either.


At about the age of 10 things began changing in a big way. For one reason or another I wound up home alone for weeks on end and had to learn how to take care of myself. At this age and going forward for the next three years until I was 13 and moved away, I was routinely sexually abused by my female music teacher. I was touched and molested, during which she attempted to comfort me by telling me that I was a ""good boy"" and that what was happening was natural and right. Of course, I had no one I could go to about this. Not long before the abuse started, my mom's father had died and I learned he had sexually abused her as a child. She became even more violent and emotional afterwards, and knowing this I knew there was no way I could come to her about what was happening.


At the same time I realized on the inside that it all felt wrong, not just that what was happening to me was wrong but that my body felt wrong. having a penis felt wrong. it didn't feel good when she touched me, not because I was scared but because it really didn't feel good. it made my stomach hurt. that probably doesn't make sense. around that time it seemed like she and everybody else was talking about oh what a handsome little man I was growing up to be and it just haunted me to no end because I looked at men and I saw men and I realized that wasn't what I wanted to be when I grew up, I didn't want to be big or tall or strong or have hair on my face or my body, I didn't want to have a deep voice and rough hands and go bald and wear men's clothes, I just knew that was not what I wanted.


I had always wanted to be soft and pretty and small and skinny ever since I was little but these feelings intensified, and I remember that I started looking at women and girls and being jealous of their bodies, how they sounded, what they looked like, what they could do and I felt just this awful sense of dread that I wasnt going to look like them when I grew up. I started to feel like that was what I wanted to be all along but it didn't make sense because I was a boy, everyone had always told me I was a boy, I had boy parts and I had no choice. at this point I was still trying to pray and I remember asking god a lot why I couldn't have the choice of if I wanted to be a boy or a girl, but I never heard back. I prayed sometimes that I could be a baby again but that I could be pretty and have girl parts and when I didn't hear back I thought it might be because god knew that I was letting my teacher touch me and that it was sin and because I was sinning that he wasnt helping me but I was still too scared to talk.


I specifically remember one afternoon when Oprah was on, when I was about 11.  I remember she had a guest that was almost my age, she was AMAB but had always known she was a girl and that was how her parents were raising her. It really hit home with me because for the first time I saw someone else that knew what they felt on the inside didn't match with their body on the outside and it just gave me this like.. you know that feeling when you find out you and someone else like the same thing, it was like that. It just devastated me because I wanted to know why, what good reason could god have for putting me in the wrong body? why would he do that? if god loved me so much why would he make me feel so bad on the inside? Why would he let my teacher hurt me? These were all questions I asked myself and couldn't find the answers to.


When I turned 13, we moved to a new city and in doing so I left my abuser behind. Then came my teenage years and all the turbulence that accompanies that kind of thing. My mom began routinely questioning my orientation, asking me if I was gay. Of course, having been raised in a Christian household I knew that being gay was a bad thing, so even if I was I wouldn't have told her. I noticed an attraction to boys first, but not that long afterward I discovered that I was equally attracted to girls (I'd describe myself as either bisexual or pansexual.) Of course to validate myself I only ever mentioned my attraction to girls in an attempt to get her to leave me alone.


In high school I went through a number of phases to try and surpress my feelings. I had a few harmless relationships with girls, all of which ended pretty quickly and none of which felt 'right' for lack of a better way to put it. I then tried to ""make the best of a bad situation"" so to speak and decided that my best course of action was to present myself (outside home of course) as an effeminate gay male, feeling that in that way I could outwardly express my desire to be feminine with the body I felt trapped in. I very briefly rushed into a relationship with a boy who too was going through a 'phase' (as he afterward realized that he was, in fact, very much straight) which ended just as quickly and made me realize that it didn't make me happy, either.


My next course of action was to reject my feelings entirely. At 16 I moved from California to the midwest and was determined to begin life over. I shaved my head, packed on muscle and did my best to appear and act as 'masculine' as possible. This backfired. I looked like an ass, ruined a few friendships and embarrassed myself in public. This having failed, I then attempted to invest myself in Christianity, in hopes that by devoting myself to god that he would then magically fix all of my problems. This had the same effect - ruined a few friendships, embarrassed myself publically, and generally made my life worse. I gave up the ghost on trying to be someone I wasn't at that point and just began to accept the fact that nothing I could do would change how I felt on the inside; that I would always feel terrible and wrong.


Things got pretty bad at the time. I had to drop out of high school to get a job when we hit the skids. I was homeless for a short while until my mom and I got a place to rent and got back on our feet. In the time since, my dysphoria only began to intensify and worsen in ways I can't even describe. I don't use ""feeling trapped"" as a euphemism, I literally feel trapped inside this body. I feel as though I'm wearing a shell I can't escape from. I feel physical pain from it's size, as though I'm being stretched or contorted to fit a shape I'm not meant to be. I have no access to a psychologist where I live, and prior experiences with being taken to (Christian) mental health professionals by my mother (mostly for what she considered 'behavioral problems') never turned out well.


Save for two close friends from when I was younger, both of whom live in other states, I have no one to come to in person. I'm now 23 years old and I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I'm terrified. I look and sound like a man, everyone sees and refers to me as one, and so I spend whatever time I'm not working hiding in bed, trying to sleep and ignore the pain. I'm so distraught. I don't want to be like this anymore. I regret not understanding what I was as a teenager or child so I could have transitioned then. Now I feel as though hormones have already destroyed this shell I'm in, I don't 'look' or 'sound' trans or like I was meant to be female, and no matter how hard 

I try I'll never be able to do more than make people think I'm a costume or an imitation of the 'real thing.' I'm miserable and I have been for years. I don't enjoy my hobbies anymore. I'm trapped in a body I want to claw out of, living with someone who will never accept me for who I am and sucks away what little I make financially (my mother) in a small Midwestern town where gossip gets around. I hate it.


My best friend, one of the two I mentioned above, tried to kill himself a few weeks ago and it was only by happy accident that he didn't succeed. That sent me into panic mode. I don't want to die, but at the same time, I can't stand living like this, how I have for years, how I have for most of my life. It's gotten to a point that I've cried so much over it that sometimes the tears don't even come anymore, my eyes just hurt and everything just shuts down.


I'm sorry if this post is overly emotional or dramatic. I just don't know where to turn at this point. I don't know anyone trans, anyone who understands. I want help, and this is the best thing I could think of to do, is to try and reach out here, I guess. I don't know what else to say, other than thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this. Thank you."

blairmichod,asktransgender,"After I come out at work, what is the best way to address gender and name?","I'm finally approaching the point where I could see coming out at work (which in of itself is exciting and crazy!). All my friends know and I always present as female outside of work, but at work only my manager knows I'm trans and as does his manager.

However, I am concerned about the logistics on the lowest level, people who aren't in the same department and only see or hear of me occasionally. Or anyone else who wouldn't connect the dots if I started wearing makeup to work despite the fact that I'm obviously not very masculine...

SNTPA,asktransgender,My history teacher explained perfectly how I feel,"So before this class discussion, my 63 year old history teacher was my favorite teacher I've ever had so far. 

We had about 10 minutes left in class to talk about random stuff. Being that he was talking about Bruce Springsteen before, I casually brought up the NC LGBT laws and why he cancelled his show. Now, I am still a closet transgender, have only told online friends and guidance counselor so no one else knows I'm trans. I go to an all boys school and they are VERY religious. 

After his whole speech about it I asked him, ""Why do transgenders want to be trans in the first place?"" He then gave an explanation I'll never forget. He said, ""You know, people sometimes feel like they are trapped in their bodies. They want to be able to experience sex from a different perspective, but that's only a small part of it. They mainly don't like the way they are accepted in society. They usually hate the way the need to act, dress, talk, and sound in public. I honestly have nothing against it and sometimes sympathize with them and how unlucky they were with genetics. Many people like you and me never have had thoughts about how it would be like to be the opposite gender, but they think about it constantly. God has a plan for everyone. He challenges these people to go against society to achieve their true identity and happiness."" 

Now this just seals the deal about how he is and will forever be my favorite teacher. I just thought I would share this positive attitude that a 63 year old white male has about us. "

bellsprouts69,asktransgender,I'm having a really hard time. Advice?,"I'm having a really hard time coming out to people. One friend and 3 members of my university's medical staff know I'm mtf. The problem is that I've been on hrt for 2 full months ,and by the time I'm home for the summer it will be 3.75 months. I will be living with my mom and brother all summer, which will end with my 7th month hrt mark. 

So, I need to come out to at least my family in the next month, because there is no way I can hide this through month 7. This may seem stupid, but I'm pretty sure they would be totally accepting. However, it would be really awkward on our relationships for a while, and my relationships with those two are the most important things in my life. I just don't know what I would do if my relationships with them changed. 

Also, I know my mom would be so upset. The thing is, I think she would be upset I didn't tell her years ago. There's nothing hidden in my family, and if she knew I was hiding this from her it would really hurt her, thus affecting our relationship negatively. 

I know that eventually our relationships would probably stabilize, and this probably wouldn't take as long as I think, but I just don't know if I can handle not having these relationships.

My breasts are swelling, my facial features softening considerably - my friends at dinner tonight kept asking what I was doing that would cause me to look so good - they said I looked much younger and I've lost 55 pounds. But they said there was something else they couldn't quite put their finger on.... I KNOW I KNOW!!!!

As much as I would LOVE to reach a point where I could 100% pass, even if it's just once. So I said that on the scale I'm about a seven - my female characteristics lean towards the female end of the spectrum.

But one Reddit poster in particular said that was a cop out --- I'm either a male or a female. No Likert scales and it's not about your plumbing but your mental attitude and how you perceive yourself. Soooooooooo..... okay ...... I get it but still have been clinging to the idea of a seven.

Then it happened. I've been trying to get into a big university gender clinic and see an endocrinologist for hormone therapy. I've done everything they've asked - I completed an enrollment form where, for the first time, I took a GIANT leap of faith and put my name down declaring myself transgender. That was mid-December. I've heard nothing since. Then a message saying they would only schedule an appointment if they had a letter from my therapist --- which was already written and sent to them. Several more months go by - zip - zero - zilch - nada. So I got a bit pissed and wrote them making my case. I did hear back with apologies of course. Then a social worker called me and it appears as if he's the **""gatekeeper""** for who gets in and who doesn't get in. 

He asked many questions challenging my interest in doing this, the therapist in the letter apparently used a phrase of ""exploring his feminine side"" and the guy said we don't work with people who want to explore. Towards the end of the call I just got very pissed and said to forget it - I wasn't going to play word games with him and parse every sentence or adjective. I also said if they didn't want me - fine - I'll continue with my DIY program buying estrogen and progesterone online. It's worked good to date and I'll just keep on doing what I do. 

BUT - THE ONE KEY THING I WANT TO MENTION TO THOSE WHO RESPONDED TO MY POST IS THAT YOU WERE RIGHT. SAYING THAT I'M A SEVEN DOESN'T WORK - THEY ONLY WANT 10s. If I didn't declare myself a woman and do it quite publicly then I didn't meet their test for admissions. 

This was a hard call as I have no idea who this guy is --- he seemed very aggressive, he seemed to enjoy his power as gatekeeper, but he met his match with me. I told him to call my therapist to get a new letter with the correct words and phrases. 

Oh - and another issue that came up --- when I enrolled I noted my medical problems over my lifetime which likely impact a diagnosis of intersex or AIS. At the time their program manager wrote to me saying she thought I would be better served by first going to see an endo in the Disorders of Sexual Development Clinic and the endo there could prescribe hormones. But the guy who called me said that if I went to the disorders clinic, which was mostly for children, I might end up with a diagnosis but that diagnosis would need a treatment protocol prescribing estrogen. He said it's very unlikely that would happen. However, if I wanted to go to the general gender clinic the endo could also diagnose the same issues and I could have hormones for the asking. 

So I'm now on the roof of my apartment building in East Lansing, Michigan facing northeast towards the University of Michigan campus yelling at the top of my lungs, ""I AM A WOMAN!!! HEAR ME ROAR!!!!!  All this said, they're scheduling out into August....  :(       

Lastly, my apologies in particular to **shaedofblue** ..... You were right :)

TheGiratina,asktransgender,"Thanks everyone, for everything. (not really a question, just an expression of gratitude)","For the past several months, I've been somewhat active on this subreddit as my transition has essentially dominated my life. I've had dozens of questions and concerns I've raised on this forum, and am unexpressively grateful for the effort put into the answers of those more experienced, wise, and objective than I could ever be. Your input has definitely influenced me for the better, and this thread and others exposing me to other's experiences and stories has undoubtably helped me overcome internalised sexism, transphobia, and impossible expectations I once held for myself, and to a lesser extent, other transgender individuals. So again, thank you everyone who ever offered their advise and knowledge not just to my questions, but to everyone's; perusing other threads has earned me quite a bit of insight, as well as allowing me to understand more of the situations that are unique to other individuals."

Harper1017,asktransgender,How do you know? And what now?,"So first off I don't know if I'm transgender or not. I've always told myself that I'd *prefer* to be female, but I didn't know if this was some sort of desire to have that body due to attraction or what. My internal voice has always sounded a little feminine to me, but I still don't know if that makes me female, because here's another thing: I'm not exactly uncomfortable as a male? I feel averse to masculinity, but it's not something I think about. Being female just feels right, being male does not lean either to right or wrong. 

I should note that I'm not a particularly effeminate guy. I feel like I want to be but I grew up in the kind of place where you get stabbed for that. 

A few weeks ago, for no reason whatsoever, I imagined how I would dress/look/interact as a woman, and I just felt both good and conflicted enough to warrant tears. I started thinking back to my childhood and all the female characters I identified strongly with and wanted to embody. I thought about all the Barbies I played with as a child, like an entire drawer of them, but were eventually taken away by my parents. 

But even though that fits our political myth (as in a stereotype or common event, not to imply that it's a fantasy or fiction) of ""parental misgendering"" it doesn't necessitate transgenderism, right? Boys can play with and identify with female toys and characters. 

I'm attracted to both men and women, but somehow I've paid a little extra attention to women. I've always chalked it up to the people I've surrounded myself with and all the hazards of masculinity and what not, but this is both making me question that and in turn causing who I am to doubt any transgenderism. It feels like a betrayal to my friends, in a way. The ones who are accepting of my sexuality and might be of transgenderism. I've always presented as a guy, and now I'm just supposed to turn around and go ""The person you know will change remarkably"". 

That's what I'm concerned about: could this be a phase? I've acted according to whatever conception of feminine around friends I'm comfortable with as a teenager, but my close bro-bro dude-friends did not get that same person, and got more of a toned-down ""chill guy"" due to my shyness as an adolescent. 

I don't exactly understand what a ""gender experience"" is. What do I do if this is just a phase? Dress up, feel embarrassed, and then go back? What's if it's not a phase and I simply ignore it?  What if I'm doubting it because I'm generally insecure and don't feel like a legitimate *anything*? What if my doubting it so heavily is the actual answer to whether or not I'm trans? What if I'm just self-loathing and the reason it feels good is cuz I wanna escape myself? Scarier, what if I'm a woman? What the hell then? 

It just feels nice to say, though. I am a woman. It feels beautiful. But if I'm not, that makes me delusional in a terrifying way. It makes me a fraud. What now? "

footworshipper,asktransgender,How do you keep going?,"Hey everyone, I'll try to keep this short. 

Right now I live alone (prefer it that way) in Baltimore without many friends who live in the city. The friend I have hasn't warmed up to the idea of going out with me as a woman (I'm a pre-everything MtF), so I live pretty much every day in guy mode due to work (thanks military). 

And it's starting to eat away at me. I try to do subtle dressing under my clothes like socks and underwear, but coming home every night and not being the real me is starting to get to me. I've been trying to stay active, go out more and drink (not to forget, I don't get shitfaced, but just to get out of the house and my head for awhile). 

I'm writing this because of an incident at work the other day. I don't really have emotions, in fact, I tell people I'm either happy or in a constant resting state of pissed off, haha. But, last week was rough, work was very mentally draining (I work in an office essentially), and I had requested a day off next week. I wasn't able to check my work email for a few days, but I was so excited to come in and see that ""You're good to go!"" Email. Except, it wasn't there. I guess they changed the routing procedure, so the day was denied because I did it the old way. I wasn't taking the day off for any special reason, I just wanted a day off to just relax, to take a break. 

But, I felt so... defeated afterwards. All of the trans thoughts came bubbling up, the thoughts of me hating my job, being lonely in the city, having a simple request denied for beauracratic reasoning, it just all hit me, and I almost started crying. I had to actively fight to hold back tears, and I haven't cried since my grandfather's funeral probably 3 or 4 years ago. I don't know what it was, and it kind of scared me a little. :/ 

So, what do you guys and gals do to keep yourselves going? To fight through the waiting and the constant fluctuation of doubt and being overwhelmed by it all? "

It also doesn't really help that I'm starting transition possibly really soon and all of the bigoted people are coming out of the woodwork and being as vocal, or possibly even more vocal, than everyone who is supportive.

Sometimes I feel like it'd be slightly easier if I was just invisible or the regular weirdo that people wouldn't think twice about like 8 years ago.

My question is what I should be doing right now. I'd ideally like to find a gender therapist to talk to, but I'd need my parents to agree to take me and probably pay for it, which is very unlikely. I know there are therapists available online as well, but I'm not sure if they are trustworthy.

He came out to me last year and every now and then I'll even give him a ride to go get his hormones in the neighboring state.

Well recently he told me he came out to his manager and not knowing it would offend him I asked why he chose to when that information could potentially be used against him and apparently that was enough to upset him and give me the cold shoulder. 

I had no ill intent and was at the very least relieved his manager accepts him for who he wants to be but I'm starting to have second doubts if I should even bother with someone who's so quick to cut someone off like that. I tried apologizing and he still is silent, no other friend I have would be this passive-aggressive, we would just talk it out and try to resolve the issue since ignoring doesn't solve anything."

Because I'm afab and I'm definitely a woman. Like on a personal level I could never give up or let go of my womanhood because of how essential it is to me as a person. Which makes me feel pretty cis. But I'm also not cis. I'm not really a man, but I am very identified with masculinity and I have terrible dysphoria on an almost daily basis about my body and the way people see me socially. And I experience myself, somehow, as also being distinct from women, as being the same but not the same simultaneously. What would I even call that? Am I allowed to be a woman and also not a woman?

I honestly don't know if I'm just really ugly. When I do myself up, I feel like I look really pretty, and if I take a flattering picture, but whenever I see myself in a picture someone else takes, I always look awful and masculine. And if someone happens to take a picture of my profile from the side? I'm sent into an awful depression like I am now.

I feel like every other person my age looks normal, except for me, and not even because I'm trans, I'm just really ugly.

affordableintuition,asktransgender,"new to US, need some practical advice.","hi,
i've been on HRT for the past 9 or so months, that i started in canada. The process there was simple, I went to a clinical psychologist for a number of sessions and then had them phone my long term family doctor, who then prescribed the appropriate hormones.
however, i've recently arrived in California where i will be living in mountain view for the next few years. the medical system seems much more complicated with insurance and networks and the like.
Given that I have no written record of my diagnosis, should I basically start from scratch here with the same process?
Or would it be reasonable to just go to a walk in clinic with an informed consent model to refresh my hormone supply? It would be a lot more convenient to skip finding a family doctor thats all of in network, understanding and nearby...
I live around mountain view, if anyone has any doctor/therapist recommendations.
Additionally, I've noted that my insurance requires two referral letters for GRS, from ""qualified mental health professionals"". What exactly counts as such? Does a psychologist qualify? How about a family therapist?

whitestarkirby,asktransgender,What's breast growth like?,"So I just turned 21 and started HRT. A lot of sources are saying that unless I have an [orchiectomy](https://www.quora.com/When-do-transgender-womens-MtF-breasts-start-and-stop-growing), I'll never have past Tanner stage III breasts. I just feel helpless. I have pectorals, but they're not that big, so from a side view it looks like I have boobs, but it's muscle. Since being on HRT for a few weeks, I've noticed my nipples are extremely sensitive, to the point that they hurt when touched too roughly. They're also harder in the center and I have bumps on my areola. Some women in my family have big breasts, others don't. I can't afford any surgeries at this point. I'm also only on pills because I have a fear of needles.

What in all likelihood are my chances of stage IV or V breasts? Do most cis women hit these stages? Even if they're A or B cups?

LRP,asktransgender,I wish I had never came out.,"I feel like ever since I started transitioning, my life has actually gone downhill. Before I started HRT, I was relatively social, I had quite a few hobbies and a small group of close friends. Now, in the past couple years, my anxiety has completely skyrocketed. I have no friends and I don't even remember how I made friends before. I never want to do anything anymore and I feel like I just can't connect to people at all. 

I was excited about being on T for the first year or so, but now I dread doing my shot every week because all it does is remind me of how much I fucking hate being this way and that I'm gonna have to be dealing with this for the rest of my life. I'm not even happy with the changes anymore. At first it was great, but now everything has kind of settled in and I'm becoming increasingly upset with the cards I was dealt. I feel like now I just look like a hairy butch lesbian. People stare at me all the fucking time and I always feel like they know.

Obviously at this point it would be foolish to detransition, but honestly at the place I'm at in my life right now I feel like I would be a lot happier living in denial than being this fucking trainwreck of a man. Being transgender is the single worst thing that has ever happened to me and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."

evernorthward,asktransgender,Dysphoria or Just My Depression?,"I'm not really sure where else to turn about this, so I figured I'd post on here. For the past four years I've identified as male, and I'm starting to try to slowly introduce myself as a man to important people in my life. However, lately I've been having a hard time convincing myself that my feelings of being trans are, for lack of a better word, legitimate. I have a lot of trans friends who discuss their dysphoria with me, but I feel like my experience doesn't fit theirs and that lumping myself in with them is a disservice to their struggles.

Rather than panic attacks or breaking down, I constantly have a feeling of ""numbness"" about my body. My body moves when I tell it to, but I only really have a sense of ownership over my hands and my calves (odd places, I know). I look at those parts and go ""Yes, that's me."" But when I look in the mirror or at pictures, it just seems like some sort of stranger or doll that's standing in for me. I've sort of lost interest in keeping up my appearance beyond the bare minimum because of that. It feels like it isn't me, so why bother to keep the stand-in looking decent?

However, the fact that I've stopped really caring about looking ""good"" and that I describe my view of myself as ""numb"" makes me think that it might be more tied to my depression than my gender identity. So is it dysphoria or depression? I'll probably mention it to my therapist soon, but in the mean time I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter.

I'm pretty overweight severely depressed and have no hope of transitioning and considering my family history of diabetes and high blood pressure I'm worried that taking hormones will be difficult for me even if I do get on them at a healthy weight.

I constantly seem to be weeping lately and I honestly feel almost everyone's life be better without me in it. When ever I voice my fears to my female friends they shut me down ""Being a woman isn't about being pretty, if you're doing it for that then you're doing it for the wrong reasons."" Like holy shit, is it so wrong to want to feel attractive? Like I spent nearly thrity years of my life in this shitty body I hate and its not okay for me to worry about if transitioning will be able to make me comfortable in my body or if I'll just always be struggling with dysphoria? Its probably already too late anyways. I'm basically 30 with no real employment prospects and no hope of transitioning really and I need to know how to find the strength to keep living? Whats the fucking point? Part of me thinks there is nothing wrong with being trans yet I also feel like it ruined my life and I'm just sitting here morning myself as pathetic as it is.

My blood results show my T at 495(Reference range 250-840) and my estradiol at 32(7-50). I just feel like starting at 50mg would just be a waste of time, and that essentially I'd be waiting three months just to prove that to her. I'm 6'0"" and 173lbs if that's of any importance.

Also advice and experiences of coming out/transitioning in Australia. Legal stuff Welcome too.

Recently came out to my Mother (also have come out t several of my gay and bi friends), considering coming out to my Sisters as they will be understanding. Not sure about coming out to my Dad or Grandparents (though one has said to a family member that they think im gay).

Only discovered  this reddit yesterday. Saw immendiatly a post about someone in a very similar situation as mine and because of that i have decided to share.

&gt;I understand exactly what your experiencing. Im in my early 20's and I came out to my Mom earlier this year to almost the exact same reaction. She also said that while she suspected i might be gay or asexual she didnt see any signs of this. She also on our second talk explained how that while she accepted what i told her, she couldn't understand or see it and wanted me to explain WHY i feel this way (i would if i could), but i basically told her i have felt uneasy growing up and recognized what i felt as being transgendered when i was around 10.

&gt;She hasnt brought it up again recently but during our first and second talk she brought up if i wanted to see a Councillor or transition or if i want to come out to more family members like my sisters. I can  tell she is worried too.

&gt;Sometimes i wonder if i shouldn't of come out because it worried her and i don't want that. Especially because i don't plan on coming out fully or transitioning yet (perhaps at all). I mainly don't want to transition because despite how i feel about my body, i fear becoming alienated from my friends and family, being discriminated against and whether i can at this late stage successfully make a passable transition. Mainly im scared and i regret not coming out when i was younger before/during puberty.

&gt;However i also feel i made the right choice because lately i've been considering taking it further and with my mom's help getting counseling, perhaps coming out to 1 or both of my sisters and maybe starting my transition. Making the first step i feel has made me braver.""

lostpath87,asktransgender,Random Questions (in order of decreasing seriousness),"So, I have a couple questions. Feel free to answer some or none. Some serious. Some not so serious. Do all of these questions belong here? No. But, I figured I could post here first before I try the beyond-here Reddit-verse. Also, apologies for the wall of text. 

1 - How did you come out to your grandparents? (Here’s my conundrum. I want to let them know because they have been such an important part of my life for years. However, I find it unlikely that they will take the news well, their son, my father took it very poorly, after months of finding out, we are now barely on speaking terms. At this point, I feel like I can give them the option of not knowing and asking them to ignore any changes they notice. This seems like a viable option because I don’t want to tell them, they react poorly, and lose my respect for them. I lost that respect for my father. Losing it for my grandparents too would suck.) 

2 - How did coming out at work go? (Right now, several friends at work know, but not the majority of folks I work with. This will be especially interesting to watch because I will be the immediate superior for six folks.) 

3 - How do you figure out your style? 

4 - Where can you purchase a reliable but inexpensive gaff? (I bought a really great dress that I like, but I need some tape or a gaff or something. It’s a concern . . .)

5 - Has anyone tried corsets? Where did you purchase yours? (I’ve always wanted to try one but have no idea where to start.) 

6 - Anyone a fan of Pokemon RPGs? Any recommendations? (I used to play them and enjoyed them immensely. My favorite was Pokemon Silver. I haven’t played since Pokemon Platinum but plan to get a 3DS in a few weeks.) 

7 - Anyone a Marvel comics fan? Any recommendations? (I used to read comics all the time, but I stopped. I’m getting back into them now, with Marvel Unlimited, but I was wondering if anyone had a particular series they like that’s worth trying.) "
transthrowaway15505,asktransgender,Danger of double dosing accidentally?,"Hello! I have been on HRT (estradiol and spironolactone) for about 6 months now and today I had a very hectic and emotional day and I have totally forgotten whether or not I took my prescription today during all of the turmoil.

I have missed doses before and I definitely want to avoid that whole emotional mess if possible, but I don't know if it'd be worth risking a double dose or how serious a potential double dose would be if it were just a one off thing and not something that happens regularly. 

It's also worth noting that if I had taken it, it would've been this morning so it has certainly been at least 12 hours. 

Thanks! :D

EDIT: I should include by the way that I looked around and found some posts about double dosing, I just thought my situation could potentially be different since it has been so long since the only opportunity I would've had to take it that maybe it might be okay. "
bellsprouts69,asktransgender,Coming out letter to be emailed to my mom. What do you think?,"Okay, I don’t want to take forever to get to the point, and I think it would be best to just go for it.
I’m transgender.

Please read this whole thing before doing anything else (writing back, calling, etc)


I know you probably have a lot of questions, so I want to try to address some of those. Please read through this whole thing. It took a lot to put it all down, and I would really appreciate it. Thanks

My guess is that your first question is either going to be Why I didn’t tell you or How long has this been a thing. I want to address both of these, as they are complicated issues, and I think that writing this will work far better than trying to vocalize it right now.

-	Why didn’t I tell you?
Like I said, these answers are complicated, so bear with me please. I want you to know first of all that I wasn’t afraid of what you would think. I wasn’t afraid of how you would view me. I didn’t think you wouldn’t love me. 
I think the main reason I kept this to myself was that this is really something that takes a lot of grappling and energy. These are complex feelings and thoughts. It’s not like you wake up one day and just think ""You know, this gender thang aint gonna work"". Initially, these were things I needed to deal with. I needed to do a lot of introspection.
So, that’s part 1 as to why I didn’t tell you. But I think something else went along with it. You see, this took a lot out of me, and I my relationship with you and [name] is my foundation. You two are my rock, and I needed you to be there for me in the way you have been. I don’t think it would have done me any good to disrupt that foundation at the time. Now, though, I’m ready to move on. I’m telling you this now because I need you two to be my foundation and my rock through this.

-	How long has this been a thing?
I’d guess since maybe 7th grade. Maybe 8th. Middle school is kinda a blurry period. Honestly, I don’t know anybody who misses and remembers middle school.
It was around this time that I was, upset. Deeply upset. That’s really the only way I can find to describe it, though that still doesn’t really work well. This wasn’t an I wanted an Oreo and somebody ate the last one upset. When I say “deeply” I mean that I could literally physically feel this deep inside me. Like in my gut. The best example I can think of is that there was a black hole inside of me. Don’t ask me how it got there and how it doesn’t consume all matter in my vicinity. I don’t know. The universe is a real mystery.
It took a long time, as I’ve said already, to deal with this, and I don’t think I fully (well 80%) finished grappling with myself until sometime during senior year. I was so busy with school and college at the time, though, that I didn’t really put any more of myself and my energy into it for quite some time.
Pick back up around October 2015 (or something like that). I’m here. Classes are going great. Life’s smooth sailing. It was at this point that I began to put more energy into this again, but I quickly came to the conclusion that I couldn’t do anything more on my own. I needed to talk to a professional. 
So, I went to [university’s health center] and was set up with [name of counselor], a specialist in this kind of stuff. We chatted till the end of January, and she really helped me grapple with this stuff. We came to the conclusion that my best option was to seek medical assistance.
So, since the beginning of Feb. I’ve been taking daily pills of Estrodial and Spironolactone (a testosterone blocker), and that’s about where I am right now. Oh, and [name of counselor] is worried about my mental wellbeing keeping this to myself, so she didn’t-make-but-made me see a counselor named [name of counselor] regularly. Between you and me, I find it useless, but it gives her peace of mind, so whatever. I talk to you about everything so I don’t ever really have anything to talk to him about. It’s kinda awkward.
This process has lifted a huge weight off of me, and the only ones remaining are telling you all of this and my college debt, and since I can’t do anything about the debt I figured I’d deal with the other one. 

-	What does this mean?
My hope is that this doesn’t really mean anything.
I’m not any different. I’m not going to suddenly act different. I’ve always been myself and genuine with you. This doesn’t define me. My blue eyes don’t define me. You know what I mean? If my eyes suddenly changed color I’d still be me, just with different colored eyes.
I’m not asking or expecting you to call me anything different right now.
I’m not going to suddenly dress differently or do anything different presentation wise. Jeans, tees, and hoodies all the way!
If you have any questions about sexuality, which usually come up with this, I don’t have any answers for you. I’ve never actually liked or really even been attracted to anybody before.

-	Lastly
I just want you to know that I love you. I love you and [name] so so so so so so so so so so much. I’m sorry I never told you, but I hope you understand that I felt this was something I needed to process myself and that I needed the normalcy of our relationships to hold me above water. I know you may feel betrayed, like I kept a large part of myself from you for so long, but I really didn’t. As I said, the eyes.



Now that you’re done, I think it would be best everyone had time to process. You can try calling me if you want, but I may not pick up right away. I’m just going to need some time to process this. I don’t really know what to do with [name], and we can talk about that. I’m focusing on you right now, and I’m not really ready to open up about this to the whole world at the moment, so keep that in mind when talking to others (I do want you to talk with someone if you have to, so don’t feel bad or be afraid of doing so).

LordDio-chan,asktransgender,Why can't I be brave?,"18 year old mtf here. I know I've posted here a lot, and in other places begging for help, and so I wanted to ask people, why can't I be brave?

I've spent almost all of today in bed, crying. I tried to have a conversation with my mom about me being transgender, and I asked her to stop making vulgar, hateful comments about it. she got repulsed and angry about me bringing it up a lot, and shouted at me for a while. I had a panic attack and kind of shut down for a couple hours. After I guess I kinda came out of it, I started crying. I can't stop thinking about how everyone around me will reject me when they find out I'm trans, especially my teachers, and people at school. I'm terrified how people will treat me.

I'm really pathetic. I see so many transgender people and people in general who are able to be strong, and independent, and transition into really beautiful men and women. Why can't I be like them? I'm so useless, I sit around and pity myself, and think about being normal. Why am I so awful? If I can't be strong and proud of myself, why shouldn't I just die? or shut myself off from everyone in the world and pretend I don't exist?"
the_108th_Sage,asktransgender,What am I?,"OK, this is all pretty new to me, on a conscious level, so bear with me.  I'm AMAB, attracted to women, and have been presenting as a ""slightly gender bending man"" for basically my entire adult life, by which i mean long hair and goatee, but numerous affectations and lifestyle proclivities that would mark me as a woman in an even more gender binary world than we are already living in.  And I've been... basically happy? 

When I was a kid, on numerous occasions, I'd 'try to do things the feminine way', like wearing my female cousin's perfumed body powder, crossing my legs like a girl, playing with dolls when access to a girl's rooms/toys, etc. but, would be ""gently corrected"" by loving but Conservative Christian parents, so I quickly learned the gender norms that were expected of me, and managed to somewhat obey them.  I got called ""gay"" a lot (by kids, not parents), and assumed that they were right (until I learned what it ACTUALLY meant).  Eventually I found a happy medium where I dressed in baggy pants, got to grow my hair long, and got more open minded friends, and life went on, and I was ""just an atypical guy"".

Sure, occasionally I'd wish i'd been born a girl, imagined what it'd be like if I had a vagina, usually identified more with women characters, preferred to play female characters in games, and only really felt comfortable sitting down to pee (and was confused but silent when guys talked about it being easier to pee standing), but then, I didn't like playing sports either, so whatever, right?  

Then, I heard the term cisgendered for the first time, and learned that it meant: ""anyone who is not trans"", and said ""oh, guess that means I'm cis, since I am not a transwoman"" (at least as I understood it).  Then I heard it defined as ""their gender identity conforms with the gender assigned at birth"", and that must have started the subconscious ball rolling, because, some months later I admitted to myself that my gender identity wasn't really male, then followed by me admitting that my ""internal/ideal body type"" would be very similar to how I look now, but with a vagina (i.e. I love how I look with the facial hair I have, and have never had 'breast envy', but have long felt... a bit disassociated from my penis, especially when hearing about how other men feel about theirs, and am most definitely not asexual/agender).

So, I've come to the conclusion/realization that I'm genderqueer/non-binary, and not gotten much further.  I'm not considering surgery, for several reasons, many of them related to financial/job logistics, but also because my ""body dysmorphia is mild"" and I don't think hormones are right, since I ""like my upper half the way it is"".  

So, one question is, is there a term for ""top half definitely a guy, bottom half definitely a girl""?  Another is, Are genderqueer people considered trans?  I've seen several trans people ask genderqueer people not to refer to themselves as trans, because It ""dilutes the cause"" or ""confuses the issue"", which I totally respect.  I just know I'm not cisgendered, and understood it to be an either/or type situation.  There certainly is a wide gap between me, able to pass as a cisguy (heck, I was passing to Myself until recently!), and many trans people, who can't easily pass either way, and feel utterly miserable in their current bodies."
HorribleAlly,asktransgender,How do I unlearn the binary?,"When I see someone who presents androgynously, I am able to see them as masculine and feminine, but not at the same time, and I somehow fail to see them as beings beyond binary gender.

I have enough to get all of us something as a surprise, but if I don't act soon I know I'll end up sprending it on something more ""neccsary"" in some peoples eyes.

ITriedIPromise,asktransgender,Best way to get my mother to knock it off?,"She has this thing she likes to do, where she takes random stabs in the dark to try and catch you off guard. When you convince her she's wrong, she fluidly slides into the next random stab, until she finds an argument you can't really argue with, which is usually something like ""God said so."" She's very narcissistic. I try not to argue with her because of the whole ""Don't argue with idiots, they'll just drag you down to their level and win with experience"" thing, but I need to get her to shut up because she's fucking with my mind.

I came out to her and my dad a couple weeks ago, and she will not accept it. She went from me lying, to it being an ""adolescent phase,"" to ""you'll regret it when you get older,"" which is what she's currently on.

Not gonna lie, it really sets me off when every time I look at my phone I've been texted another story of someone who transitioned and regrets it. I could ignore her, but then she starts spamming calls, then she takes other peoples' phones and starts texting/calling, and it's a nightmare.

I don't really have any way to counter this argument, besides obvious common sense. I tried explaining how dumb her nonexistent reasoning is, but she hangs on to the ""how can I be *absolutely sure*"" argument.

She is also constantly trying to get me to go talk to a priest so he can ""cure"" me, or trying to get me to go to one of those therapists who tries to convince you that you're not trans.

How on earth can I get her to knock it off. I don't mind if she doesn't accept me, but she's making me feel very bad about myself and is causing a large amount of stress/anxiety/dysphoria. Completely cutting her off is unfortunately not really a viable option."

I don't want to come out at work yet, and would prefer to be able to hide it for a while, so I'm already considering lower doses. I know sometimes progesterone is taken in combination with HRT to help push development to the later tanner stages, but would lower doses accomplish something similar?"
transbutterfree,asktransgender,Is it possible for T levels to raise after upping spiro dosage?,"Hi again! In advance, I want to say thanks for all the replies I got in the two threads I have posted here so far. You gals and guys are wonderful. So... thanks!

Anyways, a few days ago, my endo upped my spiro dosage from 100mg to 200mg, because my levels weren't quite where they are supposed to be yet (E levels were at 57 pg/mL and my T levels were at 244 ng/dL). 

Problem is, it seems like I am feeling much more... masculine, since then. Erections are more common and my libido isn't as low as it was the past 3~4 months. ;_; It seems like I am getting annoyed/angry more often, too, but it might be placebo.

What might be happening? Might my body be adjusting to the doubled spiro dosage? Or somefin worse? :T

MakingUpMyMind,asktransgender,Make up and hair in Singapore?,"Hi everybody. I need your help again. I am facing the prospect of a workplace transition in Singapore and I am hoping to develop some makeup competence, find a foundation, etc., and see if I can find a hairstlye that distracts from my bony jawline.

Can anyone suggest any trans-friendly places in Singapore that can help me with makeup and hairstyiing? I have light skin, so maybe someplace that gets a lot of expats.

Thanks, as always."

Sheepywashere,asktransgender,How do I go about this?,"So I am planning on taking my transition very, very slowly especially at work. I am worried about them finding out. mostly because I had a half hearted conversation about trans issues with a queer girl (my most trusted coworker) because she is dating a mtf. I had mentioned something about having imagined myself as girl and she gave me a strange look. I then replied ""not that *I'm* trans or anything, I mean I would make an ugly girl, right?!.""

To which she replied ""oh thank goodness"" followed by ""I was going to say Oh no &lt;name redacted&gt;!""

At the moment everyone loves me at my job.


What should I do? How should I go about this? Maybe I should I give up?

ItzMiyu,asktransgender,How do you train your voice or let it out?,"Okay okay so there we go, I can do my -real- own voice, and I can get it high and it sounds pretty good..

rvd42387,asktransgender,I want to change...,"Hi /r/asktransgender first off i ask that you ignore any punctuation or capitalization mistakes I am in tears as I write this. I am dealing with a bit of an identity crisis right now, For 16 years i feel i have been hiding from this but at this point i dont think I can anymore,when i was 13 years old i felt like i wasnt in the right body, I wanted to be softer i wanted to be different than i was, over the years i have let my body hair grow out to the point where i look like a hairy monkey, i have let my beard grow into the point that its half way down my chest, all to cover up my true feelings.

I turn 29 years old tomorrow, and I don't think i can hide anymore, I'm thinking about talking to my therapist about it on Wednesday, ive been an emotional roller coaster lately, I am diagnosed with schitzophrenia but its only a strong female voice in my head and anti psychotics haven't been helping it and I'm wondering if its just a mental manifestation of my female self trying to come out, ive been finding myself a lot more sad when I cant hear her talking and stuff so I'm thinking that it might be the right route to take but I don't know.

I worry about lack of support from anyone I know, I worry because of my complete lack of fashion sence, I worry because I'm afraid of my therapist and psychologist telling me that its just the ""Schitzophrenia"" that isnt able to be managed, hell I even worry about the 10 hours it's gonna take to shave all the hair off my body if anything does happen.

I need to know should I keep hiding these feelings i have in side, or  should i finally let them out to the world. I am honestly not sure at this point."
Abire,asktransgender,"For those of you who are married, what did you do?","How did you folks go about telling your significant other that you are transgender? 

I'll preface this by saying that I tried coming out when I was 16 (I'm 24, now,) but I wound up getting spooked and went back in the metaphorical closet - and suppressed it until now.

Prior to marriage, we were both in the military, so I couldn't do anything then - hence why I didn't seek help as soon as I left my parent's home. 

I married my wife almost three years ago, and I thought I had it sufficiently suppressed and could just put it out of mind - it wouldn't be an issue. In hindsight, this was a stupid idea, and I've been struggling with it ever since. Love has a funny way of making things seem much easier than they actually are, in my opinion.

Also, she wants children - but we have fertility issues for whatever reason, and we haven't managed anything in the almost three years we'e been married. I feel selfish by mentioning anything, as that could potentially destroy the relationship and she didn't sign on for any of this. I feel like I'm betraying her to a certain degree by wanting to get help and transition.

TL;DR I'm struggling trying to figure out the best possible way to tell my wife what's going on in my head. I have no idea how she'll react. How did you folks do it?

Edit: Just for the record, MtF :)

Another edit/update for anyone interested: I told my wife tonight, and as expected, it didn't go quite so well. Essentially, she gave me a choice. She won't be married to a woman, so I'm supposed to choose between my mental health and being married to her. I explained that this isn't something that will just go away, so my mental health will always be in question should I not act on it. That's essentially all there was to it. We wound up walking the dogs, and she hasn't talked to me since. We're still sleeping in the same bed I guess, but I feel like this particular relationship is over, sadly. There isn't any real way around the issue. We're just at an impasse, as someone below mentioned a few hours ago. 

 My issues don't go away, and she's simply not in to women. I'm fully prepared for a split, I guess. 

Thanks for all of the insight folks - I wouldn't have be able to muster up the courage to say anything tonight without reading through all of your replies. Overall, I'm glad I finally got that metaphorical monkey off of my back. Though, now I'm struggling with how to handle the fallout. That's a hard choice to make. "

I've been sending out the following to the therapists:
I am looking for a therapist to help me with gender identity issues. I have two questions: Are you familiar with the WPATH Standards of Care? Have you ever dealt with transgender clients before?

I was limited by number of characters, so I tried to be a concise as possible, but received this response from one therapist:
""Hello. I am not familiar with WPATH but have been successful with many transgender clients using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Please call the office and we can set up a time to meet""

mtfsth,asktransgender,Do i have to take hormones for the rest of my life?,"I'm only 19 and pre HRT and i'm kind of put of taking hormones because i have been told i have to take them everyday (depending if you have pill, injection, implant, patch, gel, etc) for the rest of my life and this kind of irritates me.

HopefulFreelancer,asktransgender,Should I include my former name on LinkedIn?,"I'm just starting out trying to make a career out of freelance writing/editing. Problem is, I'm also a trans woman.

However, one thing I'm very proud of is having won 1^st place in a writing competition back in college; so I want to include this on my LinkedIn as I think it really speaks to my talent and ability. But I did this achievement back when I was still &lt;former name&gt;. 

I don't know what to do regarding this. Should I just omit this past achievement and hope its absence doesn't hurt me professionally? Or should I put it on there (hyperlink to the announcement webpage included), thus forcing me to also list my old name on my profile as well?

On one hand, I don't feel comfortable just announcing to every possible client that I'm transgender, as a) it's none of their business, and b) it could cause me to lose a potential/actual client.

On the other hand, I'm worried leaving out this achievement (a huge one, in my opinion) could cause potential clients to overlook me."

cosmeow,asktransgender,Is there a parallel between transgenderism and transracialism?,"Hello all!

I am writing a feminism and philosophy paper about the parallels between transgenderism and transracialism. I have not quite decided my position, though I detested Raymond's views and allusions to it in support of her despicable anti-trans manifesto 'The Transsexual Empire.' 
Anyway, I am very supportive of a metaphysics of gender which would support feminist solidarity with the trans community, particularly Jenkin's Ameliorative view. 
The details of my paper are not that important; I have just provided them for some background. 

While I have known some trans people in my life, I unfortunately do not know any personally very well and do not want to offend people by asking them questions which they may find offensive. So I am turning to the internet, where I hope this question does not offend. (If anything I have said is offensive, please know it is not intended that way) For a long time in the feminist tradition, non-trans people wrote authoritatively about the trans experience and I do not want this to be one of those cases. I would really like some trans opinions on whether transgenderism is similar to transracialism.

My paper's question is: If transwoman is a woman, could Rachel Dolezal be Black? 

This is a 3500 word paper, so don't think I am asking for homework advice or anything. I simply want some input from people for whom this issue delves beyond academic interest. As a philosophy paper, the focus in more on argumentation than opinion. Thanks so much in anticipation for any feedback :D "

So she currently lives in Albuquerque, moved down there late last year from Massachusetts. Sadly, she's still unemployed, poor, and had to go into some programs, including the state's Medicaid. 

Since last month, she lost access to her primary care doctor and her MtF HRT back in Mass and has been trying to find one there to continue her treatment. The problem is that her state insurance (Presbyterian Centennial Care) probably doesn't cover a transfriendly doctor and she's scared they'll refuse to continue treatment.

I came her to see if any of you, those who've lived and currently live in Albuquerque, have any recommendations and advise. She's pretty much stressing out about this and I'm doing my best to help her out. At the point, she's being looking at shady online pharmacies that don't need prescription to continue her treatment."""

Last summer, when I found you all, I was confused, depressed and dealing with what felt like more than I could handle... and I was self medicating (with alcohol) and it was a bad time for me...  in fact, I had been drinking for several years as a kind of escape.

You all gave me an outlet for my troubles and i was able to hear that I wasn't alone... almost every fear i had was echoed on this subreddit. 

since then, I've learned to accept myself, take the world one day at a time... i came out to my (then friend, now girlfriend, my family, and several close friends.

what's more, I finally started hormones last month. and the icing on top of the cake is I'm now 2 weeks sober =D =D =D and it's an AMAZING feeling =D The day after I got my script, I poured the bottle of wine I opened the night before down the drain and haven't looked back yet!

I know I'm not going to be dry the rest of my life, but it is definitely nice to put the bottle down, eliminate my dependence on it and the weight is melting off too! =D (down to 145lb)

So, I must say..

I just talked to him today and he wants me to start taking an extra pill of both spiro and E today, taking me from two pills of each a day to three. He said that my testosterone was around 200(I think) and he wants it to be lower, and that my estrodial was only at 80(eek!) and that it should be around 200.

I have not noticed major effects from Hrt(I have noticed some though) so this makes sense to me. I am 18 years old. I was just wondering if anybody has any experience with upping their dose and if so what differences did you notice?
Thanks:)"
brad_furd,asktransgender,My parents think being trans is a ploy to steal money,"My mom just came out and told me she won't let me transition before 18 based on three reasons.

1. Moral- She doesn't believe I was born like this. She is explaining everything away by using something called Kleinfelters Syndrome.

2. Legal- She read a story about some trans kid suing their parents for all their money because he regretted transitioning and was angry that his parents let him do it before 18. I got extremely angry at this one. She actually thinks I could be doing this to steal her money.

3. Medical- She said it's a huge decision that she doesn't want me to go through.

I'm so fucking scared right now. I can't live with my dysphoria until I'm 18. Every day it gets worse and I don't know what to do. Every day, suicide becomes a more appealing option."

keep in mind i began hrt at 16, now i'm 18."
[deleted],asktransgender,Did anyone else discover they were trans late because of upbringing?,"Growing up in the Bible belt, I had a pretty poor perception of the trans community growing up. Trans women were just men in drag, probably trying to seduce men, and Transmen were...well, they didn't exist according to the conservative south.

It wasn't until my early 20's when I got a clear understanding of being trans was, and it wasn't until a few years ago that I kind of put the pieces together. I'm actually still putting the pieces together. I'm in my late 20's now, and I feel like I missed out on a lot of important self reflection because my mind simply wasn't open or educated enough to really understand what's going on.  Shit, I have trouble in women's cloths simply because I feel guilty for enjoying it. Because *men aren't suppose to do that, right?*

It's all a weird experience. I'm both envious and glad for those teens that have discovered themselves so early, and had the proper channels to go down to get what they need.

But I'm wondering if anyone else had a similar experience? Anyone else kind of late to the party?

##Some tips for working on your voice:

* Stay out of falsetto! Falsetto is only useful in finding your head voice, it's not a very good place to go for finding a voice to speak in. Falsetto is the vocal range above your normal vocal range, and you should feel a ""break"" in your voice as you transition from your normal vocal range up into falsetto
* Work on your resonance! You should feel no vibrations in your chest when speaking. The target you're looking for is your ""head voice""
* To find your head voice, try pushing your larynx (the thing your adam's apple is attached to) up as far as you can, and attempt to ""throw"" your voice out of the top of your throat instead of your chest. You should feel vibrations in your mouth, teeth, upper throat and maybe even your nose when you're doing it correctly
* Once you get your head voice, take your guy voice up into head voice and you should get something that starts to sound female.
* Talk to yourself in your female voice when no one else is around, so you can build up muscle memory
* Want to practice **LIVE** with other redditors? Try the [Transpeak Discord server](http://www.transpeak.org/discord)!
* Check out /r/transvoice, where you can share links and receive feedback all week!

##How to rate others' voices

If you don't know the vocabulary to describe what someone is doing wrong, feel free to simply state how close you think they are to passing. Please be honest and respectful, and don't tell someone they pass when you know they don't so that they don't end up using the wrong voice techniques. There's nothing worse than building confidence in a non-passing voice and then realizing it doesn't pass later on and you wasted your time.

If you are going to post your own voice clip, please help others with their voices as well! The best way to make this a useful thread is for everyone to pitch in :)

fenxibat,asktransgender,Dear Trans-Person Who Worked Here Before Me,"Thank you. 

Today: I had to talk a supervisor about a health issue that is trans-related.

To explain the situation: I had to come out. My supervisor told me I am not the first trans-person who has worked here. 

He told me about you. 

You didn't pass. It didn't matter. What he remembers best about you is that your sense of humor was hilarious. 

You did not bother to hide that you were trans, in fact, you emphasized it. 

He said that our co-workers were difficult at first, but that you didn't give a shit. You set them all by the ears, until their foolishness had passed. He liked that too. I like that too. 

Was it hard? I feel like it might've been. But you never cracked, and you won them all over. 

When I explained my problem, he was sympathetic, because he knew you were fantastic. And that means that I did not have to explain why I am not awful. 

Today, I had significantly less bullshit to deal with than I might've, because of you.

I hope, in the future, I will be able to contribute to further bullshit reduction here. 

In the meantime, this glass of cheap, gas-station Shiraz is for you, trans-person who worked here before me.

AprilsSecretAccount,asktransgender,Seeing myself startles me.,"So, I've been full time for 6 months, on HRT for 11.  I pass most of the time...the estrogen really started kicking in a couple months ago and my face is very feminine now, and I'm getting a bit of a butt and thighs, with a B cup.  It's spring and sometimes I get smiles from guys at lunch, which is a new experience.

I have a software engineering job, and when I go to work I see myself in the reflection of the windows as I go into the building, and it always startles me.  If I've been concentrating on something and then catch my reflection in windows or a mirror, I'm always surprised.  I guess I'm just not used to it yet.

Has this happened to anyone else?  How long does it take to go away?"

I was aw struck, he told me I could use a locking tanning booth to change but that still doesn't answer the question about were i can use the washroom. He then proceeded to apologize and tell me that was the law I can't use the woman's.locker room. I live in Illinois, that is not the law.

I just came out of a relationship with somebody I still love very much. We live quite a way away and I visited him, it was amazing. We went on dates etc. and we were really happy. The only issue is we did things, not 'all the way' but third base. To each other. I can't stand my genitals, they're disgusting and revolting and I can't get it out of my head how disgusted I am that he saw it and... It's just... I can't explain how disgusted I am. It happened once on my end. I don't mind doing it, just not... recieving it. And we broke up soon after I came home. I just feel so disgusted. I don't know why im posting, I am just... I feel somewhat used and I can't get the disgust out of my head. Anybody here got any tips? This has definately made me opt towards SRS ASAP, I don't know what to do :("

fleila,asktransgender,Pre-op intimacy difficulties,"Background: I'm a 25 year old trans woman who just entered a relationship for the first time in her life a week ago.  Unfortunately, while I started transitioning 5 years ago, I have not been able to afford bottom surgery yet (working three jobs - I'm trying!!) and have significant dysphoria surrounding what's downstairs; I've never been able to be think about sex, much less actually be intimate (I often wake up and then feel sick to my stomach when I realize what's down there).  I used to just gloss over this, but now that I'm dating, I don't want my partner to be unfulfilled...

So for my question, has anyone here experienced similar issues, and if so, how did you address them?  

For reference, my partner is aware I'm trans, and while she's still a bit ignorant on the matter (she just sees me as another woman), she is very open-minded, supportive, and generally a wonderful person."
duelsa,asktransgender,Please help,"I really need some advice. So here it goes. My husband just told me from the ages of 14 to 21 he would secretly dress up like a women. I have known him for about 18 years and we were best friends before we got together. We started dating when he was 23. We have a great relationship, which is different in many ways then other people's relationships. He is sick and has been his whole life. We have never taken our time together for granted like most couples because we never really know how much time he has left. We have been together now for almost 12 years and have a 12 year old son that he adopted from my previous marriage. I've always known that he has many feminine qualities, which works for use because I have many masculine qualities. When he told me this he thought that I wouldn't care and that everything would remain the same as it has always been, but I'm having a hard time. It feels like I have loved a complete lie. We have always been honest with each other, even when it hurt. We prided our selves on our communacation and our love for one another has inspired many of the people we know to seek the same. I find myself wondering if the man I feel so deeply in love with and who has been my best friend for 18 years is real. Has our sex life been real. I'm the only person he has ever been with, and he never thought he would live to see the age of 35, let alone get married and have a child. I know he loves me and he says he is not gay. He just feels like he should have been born a women and he would be lisbian. He is says he wants nothing to change, that he loves his life and doesn't want a sex change because for one he couldn't anyways do to his illness, but also because he loves being his kids dad and my husband. He says he stopped dressing like a women when he started perusing me because he decided that he would rather be with me than be a women. But he never gave me the option to decide if I wanted to be with a man that didn't want to be a man. I still love him with every single fiber of myself. And I think I would have still got together with him if I know the truth. But I am not second guessing everything we have together. All the times we have been together sexually, was he always wishing he didn't have a penis? Was I the only one who was all there, mind, body, and soul? I don't know what to think or how to feel. I know I still love him and can not picture my life without him by my side. But do I love a lie?"

jessietee,asktransgender,Raised testosterone after starting hrt??,"Hey, 

So I've been on hrt for about 2 months...ish, taking 1mg of progynova twice per day, my testosterone level on initial Base bloods was 7.6 nmol/L.

I took a blood test last week to take to my next appointment with the GIC (I'm in the UK) and while my oestradiol level has gone up from nothing to 170 pmol/L, which is great, my testosterone has also gone up to 12.2 nmol/L from 7.6 at my baseline :( 

Has this happened to anyone else? Is my body fighting this?! I haven't seen major changes yet on E, possibly changes in my nipples but not enough to say yup they've changed, is this why, is that because my T is also rising to fight against it?

transthrowaway0647,asktransgender,"How many of you pre-transition lesbian-identified girls had thoughts like this prior, and on HRT became attracted to men?","So I am only attracted to the female form: curves, breasts, feminine rear, not too much body hair, and prefer femme girls; any masculine body features turn me completely off, and while twink guys don't turn me off, they don't really turn me on at all either, in the sense that ""why would I look at a twink guy when I can just look at someone far more feminine"" plus twink guys don't really remain twink for too many decades, do they? 

I really tried picturing myself in the future as a woman with a man, I really tried letting go of any repressed internalised homophobia and letting it sink in that it'd be completely different from the idea of my current pre-transition self with a guy, but I still can't see myself being attracted to guys.

But whenever I think of sex, thinking of sex with a dominant woman (even if she uses a strap-on) doesn't quite turn me on as much as the thought of sex with a guy. In fact the idea of sex with a guy turns me on more than seeing some of the most feminine women.

Could these just be thoughts due to straight sex being subconsciously seen as gender-validating and/or usually easier to have a dom/sub sexual relationship with?

Could it be that I only am so attracted to feminine women because I want to be a feminine woman myself and I don't consciously realise that my sexual attraction to them is actually envy?

Is it possible for someone not to be physically attracted to a gender but still be turned on sexually from the idea of having sex with them and from actually doing it? As in, I'm sure it is possible, just is there a label for this (I realise labels shouldn't matter, but I want to find more people who had similar experiences) / is this common? Is this bicuriosity?

Despite people saying that HRT should not change sexual orientation but just help with coming to terms with pre-transition subconscious insecurities about attraction to men, I've heard of anecdotal evidence before of people who really tried to let themselves see themselves as women with men too but didn't feel anything, and after HRT it flipped completely over.

I realise I will only find out after many months or even years on HRT, but I'm very curious to hear others' stories."

Riserrt,asktransgender,MtF FtM couple &amp; sex problems.,"We're a MtF and FtM couple (I'm the girlfriend).

It's a great relationship between us, but neither of us are happy sexually which makes it less than ideal since we really love each other.

But right now, we can't seem to be doing well. The things that I enjoy, he doesn't seem to enjoy and the things that he enjoys, I don't seem to.

The only thing that is sometimes remotely pleasurable for both of us is PIV sex which is difficult since I can't always get hard enough erections to be able to perform and even when I do, half the time they don't last long enough to give him the pleasure long enough.

Ps. Can be all aspects of being transgender individual and not exclusively in relation to transition.

I'm hopeful but it's also scary, who knows what will happen. Though in retrospect trying to talk about it with the spouse was the blatantly obviously correct thing to do.

I also came surprisingly close to suicidal thoughts, which was unexpected. It went like this: What is the best case scenario for us? That both people are happy. But if that isn't possible, then what is the second best case? That one is happy and one is not sad. And how to get that? To take out a life insurance policy, wait a year or two for the suicide clause to disappear, then that money plus the money we've been saving in the meantime would allow spouse to live a happy and free life, while I have nothing to worry about anymore.

“It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not.”
― André Gide

For as long as I can remember, I feel I’ve been living my life for other people. A lot of the time, I don’t do things because I really want to do them, I do them because I’m scared of what people will think if I did something different. I live my life based on what other people want me to do. I always thought I had to be the same as everyone else to fit in or no one would like me and I’d never have any friends. Over the past couple of years, I’ve been trying to change that. I’ve been trying to act more like myself and do what makes me happy. I guess that’s what won me the senior superlative of “Dares To Be Different”.

When I was young,  I just kind of did whatever I wanted. I wasn’t really old enough to understand what was going on. I did what was instinctual and what felt right to me, but a lot of the things I did or wanted to do were considered feminine, or in my case, wrong. As I got older, I started to learn what is and isn’t acceptable. Eventually, I became self aware, I was taught by society that I was a guy, I have to act like one, and acting like a girl makes me a pussy, bitch, or a fag, to name a few. I then felt embarrassed and ashamed for who I was.

All these years I wasted hating myself for who I was and trying to change, I could have been learning to accept my differences and loving myself for who I am. In honor of today being Transgender Day of Visibility, I think it’s time that I finally stop hiding who I am and become visible.

quitetentatively,asktransgender,MtF: did you need electrolysis or was laser enough?,"I've been doing laser for about 10 sessions over 15 months now, and my facial hair is almost completely gone. I've been having laser sessions every 6 weeks or so lately, and all that's left is some very light shadow on my upper lip and perhaps a little on the very tip of the chin, but even these go away almost entirely for a few weeks in the middle of the cycle. I have very light skin and the shadow is composed of dark hairs. 

My question is, will I be able to eliminate this entirely by continuing with laser? I have a pretty good deal with the laser place as a long-term client (they charge me 35 AUD per session) and the expense of electrolysis is very intimidating. If I am going to need electrolysis, when should I think about switching to minimize the total cost? 

My ultimate goal with this is to rid myself of facial hair to the point where I could feel comfortable going outside in the daytime without concealer, I guess."

And I'm sure most of us hope that one day we might feel able to be as helpful to others as you are now, in whatever individual or personal or little way we can.

For example, I just saw a video on YouTube on my homepage from some guy I'd never seen before. He was talking about how HB2 was a good thing and was basically equivocating trans women with child molesters. The video had 200,000 views and roughly a 20:1 like to dislike ratio.

With occasionally browsing female clothes, always playing as female characters in games, being seen as 'not quite right' by others.  I don't even know how I got used to the idea of being a woman-in-a-man's-body but somehow didn't relate that to being trans, and *certainly* never considered transition.  
  
I was comfortable, but not happy.  
  
Now I feel the entirety of what they describe in Matrix as ""the freeing of a mind after a certain age"".  I feel the horror that Neo felt initially too.  The idea that I could transition, and I really am 'this' (whatever this is) is enough to cause a full blown panic attack.  
  
In many ways I feel like I've even regressed.  I used to could go into women's stores and browse/buy female clothes no problem (""I'm so crazy"").  Now the thought fills me with a greater dread than it ever did before.  I've also recently heard diatribes about how awful these trans people are from everyone in my life again (as if I haven't already internalized that enough throughout my life).  My god damned phone won't even stop autocorrecting trans to 'Trans'.  Even Apple thinks I'm confused.  
  
Anyway, I guess I'm just saying I understand why Cipher was saying: I wish I could just take the damn blue pill and go back to my successful and comfortable life.  It wasn't happy, but it was damn sure convenient.  Now I can scarcely stand to look at myself in the mirror anymore."

failure202,asktransgender,Has anyone else's transition failed?,"Forgive the grammatical wonkiness of the title. I couldn't think of how better to word this. I'm not expecting many people who have willingly detransitioned to pop in, but if you're out there, I'd like to hear your perspectives, too.   

Trans woman, early 30s, US South, [""just move"" is not reality](https://newrepublic.com/article/131743/poor-get-trapped-depressed-areas?utm_source=atl-politics-daily-newsletter) and can fuck right off. So my transition has basically failed. I began about six years ago and it initially went well; not a lot of huge issues re: ""passing,"" voice, etc. and most people who knew were decent about it. Then some things happened and I lost my job and transportation. I live in an impoverished area where trans healthcare is nonexistent; the majority of providers are openly hostile. So it's DIY or bust, and without income I had to go off HRT for about a year. Which led to a testosterone surge and a lot of regression and, while I'm back on HRT now, I don't pass well anymore.   

Legally, I've never been able to get anything substantial changed. Everyone I know here who has done so has had to pay thousands of dollars and at least a year of their lives to change their name/gender markers, which I literally cannot afford. Any time I have to apply for a job or seek medical care or anything dealing with legal name/info, I humiliatingly have to explain why I look/sound the way I do. Many people, once they know, will then go out of their way to misgender me. I may have some money coming in for work I just did and the thought of needing to disclose my trans status terrifies me.   

I have no support. Family is hostile. Friends disappeared. Local support group imploded as we're all poor and struggling. I feel like, at best, people who are semi-respectful about my identity are just being polite or humoring me at this point. Relationships are beyond the realm of possibility.   

I am disabled and have a lot of problems. It's never going to get better. It's clear to me from my experiences that being trans in our society is a privilege; you either independently fund your transition, go back in the closet, or you kill yourself. Society just doesn't want us to exist.   

Has anyone else basically failed to transition within their aimed-for timeframe? For whatever reason; poverty, homelessness, disability, discrimination, lack of support or actual conscious choice. I have no hope or future, but I'd like to hear your story if you've been through anything similar."

brad_furd,asktransgender,Was I in the wrong here?,"Im 16 years old and MTF. I came out to my parents yesterday and was going to come out to my brothers through text today. Please note that when I came out to my parents with my therapist help they were extremely supportive. I asked my parents to read my coming out letter before I sent it to my brothers. My dad said not to send it because I'll change my mind about being transgender and I'll regret it.

I kept telling him I won't change my mind and he kept repeating that it's a phase. I admit that I overreacted and told him ""Fuck you."" He started screaming and yelling at me, threatening to beat the shit out of me. I decided to nope the fuck out of there and leave but he tried to stop me. I drove around him on the grass and left. 

I'm now sitting in a Wendy's parking lot crying my eyes out that I'll never be able to transition. I'm honestly contemplating suicide right now. I don't know what to do and if I'm overreacting."
eclecticbluekoala,asktransgender,"I'm at a bit of a turning point (pre everything), I'd appreciate people's thoughts (and need some advice on how to find a therapist worth their salt).","Edit: grammar.

So I guess I'm at a stage where I'm really questioning myself.

I don't quite feel happy cross dressing for long periods, guy clothes are more comfortable and don't cause self loathing, and I feel that's like a negative mark, but right now if I don't work past that in the evenings and present female I find myself full of anxiety and acting out my unpracticed female mannerisms at work when I'm distracted by thinking about code, and that's dangerous.

I love to be referred to with female pronouns, and my desire to have a female body can be consuming. If I could trade my current life to transition perfectly I'd do it in an instant. Despite the fact I have my doubts when I go around with intent to transition I actually start eating right, taking care of my body and generally stop hating everyone... I'm just so consumed by the idea that I don't know if it's got any grounding in reality, especially being accepted by other women.

The really scary part is that I'm nearly thirty, so it's less likely that I'll ever pass completely. The fact I'm six foot four and usually the second tallest person in any group doesn't help and leaves me feeling awful. If I'm going to start hormones I'm desperate to do it ASAP, being a late transition is something that terrifies me and I hate myself enough for being a giant as it is. But the fact I'm desperate is kind of a red flag to the part of me that's trying to act in my best interest overall.

So I guess I'm asking if anyone's felt similarly, especially if they've decided not to transition in the end because I feel like I'm being blindly driven in that direction by a part of me that just kind of eats me when I try to understand it.

Also, what sort of thing should I look for in a therapist? I've worked with a couple of really good ones though university/nhs for general mental health issues, but both the private ones I've tried who say they do gender issues have turned out to be an expensive way to to vent at best (which isn't totally useless, just a really painful chunk of income every month for something I'm not sure is making real progress). I thought both of their qualifications looked pretty reasonable, but I guess I need to be looking into real psychologists. I'm not keen on that because suddenly their fees become all of my disposable and most of the money that I'd save, especially as my experience with private in the past has been less than stellar. There's a bunch of them in London attached to the GICs who may be worth the cash, but taking the time off work every week to commute is not something I can do.

Thanks a lot for your thoughts."
bluepeople567,asktransgender,Current mood: Mulan,"Mulan has always resonated with me since I was much younger and I could never figure out why. Even when I was cognizant of myself being trans I could never seem to connect the dots. That is until fairly recently. Fast forward and today I finally got to let the world see who I am inside, the way I see myself. 

It was amazing. I'm pretty sure I got clocked (I noticed some stares), but to be honest, it didn't even matter. Of course, I am fortunate enough to live in a safe, fairly open-minded place so the risk of associated violence was likely lower than for others, but I was finally able to wear the clothes I want, move my body the way I want, and just be.

I think that was the most striking part for me. I had kind of built the moment up in my head, but as the day wore on, it was all so... regular. I did errands, bought a sandwich, etc. It just so happens that I finally did it as me. 

Sorry, this isn't a question, but I really wanted to share this moment with you all as today would not have been possible without this subreddit and I am forever grateful."
HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,"[NSFW]Orgasm questions...multiple different types, and cumming post SRS?","MtF here, just to clarify-I'm speaking of my genitals pre-SRS--I like the feeling, even if its only for a few seconds, of spasm and ejaculation.  Its a nice releasing feeling.  But it lasts such a short duration.  Still, I don't want the feeling to be gone forever...is there any comparison to it post SRS?  

Because it seems like Cis women can have that type of orgasm, as well as ""vaginal orgasm"", and other types as far as I know.   

Is there any comparison to cumming post SRS?   The comparison to erection would be the feeling of swelling around the area, and I imagine it would feel wayyyyyyyyyyy better than erection (for me personally), but I don't want to be limited to one type of orgasm.  I mean, I really hate having a penis, and I know I'm going to enjoy PiV from the right side for me (and sorry, anal doesn't do it for me so I can't keep my penis and just use the other hole, just to deter that type of possible comment), but I still feel I'm losing an orgasm ability by getting surgery, and an ability that I'll miss at that.  

I've had ""female"" orgasms based around just pure stimulation, even before starting HRT, by stimulating my nipples and a bit around various parts of my genitals that felt female in every way, taking about 40 minutes to reach climax and it lasting for a good 45 seconds, and the afterglow of contentment was like 15 minutes of walking on clouds.  So wonderful.  But is that the only orgasms that's possible? I'm really not trying to reduce its value, because its amazing, but I also really like the feeling of spasm and ejaculation (but not enough to want to keep my penis, I hate it in every other way besides that few seconds of pleasure) 

So yeah, I hope I make sense, please ask me to clarify if need be!

trapdoordoll,asktransgender,Ever Felt Like You've Made Major Progress And Then Realized How Far Away You Really Are?,"Had a weekend like this. Pushed myself further presenting than I ever have, pretty much full on with the bra, no makeup though but not even trying to hide. I got a major boost from my last laser session that pretty much took out my last remaining facial hairs. I still look like a young boy (8 months HRT) and people don't know what I am but that's kinda where I fizzled out. I had no problems this weekend aside from a couple of looks but I know that no one mistook me for a girl. It sounds dumb because I KNOW no one thought I was a girl but it was still an upsetting realization. No matter how attractive I look gender bending I still want that ultimate goal. Mind you I didn't wear any makeup but still. I'm not delusional, I know I look extremely ambiguous though. So anyway, great weekend until I came to my obvious conclusion that I still don't pass and have a long way to go before I actually get truly gendered correctly in a stealth kinda way. Ho hum. I know 8 months isn't shit and I'm really happy about everything but you ever get that two steps forward one step back once you pop out of fairytale land?

Tldr: feeling great, really pushed myself in public this weekend but had obvious realization of how much further I have to go to pass for real. Not upset, but this shit is just such a marathon though right!!?!"
anonymousfemshep,asktransgender,How to figure out my sexuality as non transitioning trans (NSFW),"So im an 18 year old guy that lands somewhere in the middle of the gender spectrum, and after a lot of thought and some therapy i decided that transition wasn't the right life for me, and that i was perfectly happy living as a man for the rest of my life. This is a decision im perfectly happy with, and i have absolutely no problem being masculine in my day to day life, in fact realizing this about myself has even allowed me to better express the femininity that i was representing for so many years, and i am now basically a normal bisexual man who can be fairly feminine at time but is mostly masculine. However the place where my trans feelings have displayed themselves the most clearly traditionally have been in regards for sex, specifically I've only been able to masturbate to and get fully aroused from the idea of being female. This makes it very difficult for me to determine my sexuality. I'm fairly certain I'm bisexual, and I'm out as bi to a few people, but since I'm a virgin who's only drunkenly been with one woman and no men, its hard to determine my sexuality for sure without being able to really judge off of masturbation/ arrousal like most cis people would. So my question is, is there any real way to discover my sexuality without just going out and experimenting with different people? Id like to avoid leading someone on because i wasn't able to fully discover my sexuality on my own. Also i can tell the story of the open time i was with a woman if that helps."

There's been lulls in my dysphoria over the years but it's always come back. I can't see a future without living as a woman. But there are a few big things that are holding me back - my age (just turned 30, almost pulled the trigger on transitioning when I was 25 but my ex talked me out of it and said we could just have fun with me cross dressing - which made it worse so I just regressed again), my height (6'1""), I have a big head, big hands, big feet (men's 10.5), and my tattoos (a battle ship being attacked by a kraken on my forearm is not very feminine). There are good things too - I have good income and work remote as a software engineer, I live in Brooklyn and have friends that wouldn't turn their backs on me, and I have a moderately androgynous build.

tthrrowwaaaawwaayy,asktransgender,"A slightly different ""what am I?"" post","This is gonna be a long one, but there's quite a bit of a background for it, so hopefully that's forgivable.

So, up until recently, I was extremely certain about how I was non-binary. Including the initial questioning, I ""knew"" that for around 3 or 4 years, so... so I finally thought, alright, time for me to come out, but first, let's show some signs to facilitate the whole process.

Now, a little background: I'm AMAB, and did absolutely no 'experimentation' or whatever with my gender, the whole realisation of me being non-binary was a result of my - rather complicated - mental gymnastics. So, essentially, this was probably the first time I'd done something obviously feminine or androgynous.

Aaaaand that's where problems started to come. I kind of noticed that I really loved all the girly things, way more than I'd expected... and even worse, some of the physical aspects I didn't really care about up until recently (say, I had dysphoria regarding my height, but not, say, regarding broad shoulders; now both make me feel shit). So far, it sounded like a girl who was in denial, but then comes the two points that kind of contradict me:

1. I have absolutely zero genital dysphoria, maybe even quite the opposite

2. although my looks do give me dysphoria, and more than they did before, it's still fairly moderate, and I'd rather call it just a simple bad feeling. Furthermore, it's not regarding everything. I'd say I'm pretty happy with half of the generally-dysphoria-causing things, and unhappy with the other half.

Alright, this puts me back into the non-binary category, I guess, except that: I really wish I'd feel comfortable with identifying as a girl, but I don't, and don't think I ever will, exactly because most of my dysphoria is coming from the social expectations and not from my physique.

I don't think I can ever be convinced that identifying as a transwoman without major dysphoria related to the body is legitimate (sorry, I just can't believe this, I tried to convince myself ever since these thoughts came into my mind, and if I could, my life would be way easier), and as such I'm uncomfortable of being a woman, but, although I have absolutely no problems of saying that I'm a non-binary and I'm completely comfortable with that, I still wish I was a girl. So, what am I:

* a girl in denial, who oppresses the dysphoria just to prove herself as legit non-binary

* or a non-binary who feels marginalised or is secretly scared of coming out, and as such wishes they were something else

* or a non-binary who is still non-binary, but in a slightly different way than they previously thought?

(Also, yeah, I know I should go to a therapist, but I won't. My anxiety is too big for that, so I gotta figure this out myself. I'd rather want hints or pointers.)"

Call_me_Cassius,asktransgender,"My mom never responded to my coming out email, and I feel lost and stuck and I don't know what to do","I posted the coming out letter on this sub, and I got a couple comments on people asking me to update when I got a response. Well, I didn't forget to update... I just never got a response. I poured my heart out in am email. It caused me an unbelievable amount of anxiety and stress to click send (I got three cold sores the next day! Three! At the same time! Stress levels through the roof!), and I even needed to drink and cry a bit before I could do it. But I did. I clicked send. I sent a heartfelt letter about the most personal and distressing aspect of my life to the person who terrifies me the most on this whole earth. I have never felt more exposed, more vulnerable, than in that moment.

And she never responded.

And one of the worst parts is, I don't know if she actually got it. My email said it sent, but after a few days of no response I went into her email (cause I'm a mast0r haxx0r) to see if she'd opened it and couldn't find it. Did it not send? Did she delete it immediately about reading my click-baitey subject line? Did she read it and then delete it? I don't know.

But I do know that I went home for winter break a couple weeks later, and she definitely acted like she hadn't read it. Although I did learn that she learned about the masculine name I've been using. But the entire reason I sent the email a couple weeks before going home was so that she could have time to think about it and process it before we talked in person. And not knowing if she got/read the email, I sure as hell wasn't going to bring it up.

So we never talked about it. 

Which my dad was very happy about I think. I came out to him in person, but I don't have drunken heartfelt conversations with my mom cause she's scary. He's scary too, but he surprised me with the level of support in that moment... and then promptly changed nothing. Even in private text conversations he refused to stop calling me ""girl"" or ""daughter."" I had a very serious *sober*conversation with him about how shitty it made me feel, and he acted like he was going to change, but he didn't. He made a big show about how when I came home for break we'd sit down as a family and talk this all out in person, but it was very clear he didn't actually want to. He wants it to go away. He wants me to just forget about it, so that he can't just forget about it.

But my big point is, emotionally, *I don't know if I can do it again.* I'm starting to get restless again, like I really desperately want to start HRT this summer while I'm back home in big city Atlanta and don't have to drive four hours to get bloodwork done. But I don't feel like I can start medically transitioning until I'm out to my mom, and it was just such an emotionally taxing experience four months ago that I don't know if I can do it again. The thought of it literally makes me feel sick. I want to cry and feel like I'm going to throw up when I think about resending that email, or sending a ""hey did you happen to get my email last semester"" email, let alone do something like call her. *I can't.* I'm too scared of her, and too scared that she did get my first email, and did read it, and did just choose to ignore it. If that's the case I'd rather never bring it up again. If that's what happened I'd be thankful she didn't respond and just ignored me, but what's eating me up is that *I don't know what happened with that damn email.*

She has to know. There's no possible way she doesn't know. I was out to people in my high school; she's heard people call me my brother's brother before. She knows I went/go by Levi. She knows how I present. She knows I used to ""pretend"" to be a guy on the internet. She knows I have always ""pretended"" to be a guy in the games I would play with my friends. MY parents are on the verge of divorce and don't really talk, but come on I feel like my dad must have in passing mentioned it before. How could she not know?

But I can't do it again. I can't. Emotionally I just can't. And I feel stuck. Just absolutely immobile. I can't move forward I can't do anything unless I do this, and I can't do this. I don't know what to do."

pm_me_your_dresses,asktransgender,How was your first time properly going out as yourself?,"Possibly against my better judgement yesterday, despite my original goal of not coming out properly to most of my friends until at least September, I decided to go out for drinks with some friends as myself for the first time. I'm still kind of in awe of just how I built up the confidence to walk all the way to the bar (half an hour's walk!) on my own, but it was such an incredible experience to finally feel comfortable around my friends after waiting for more than two years to psych myself up for it. I got misgendered by everyone, the taxi driver on my way back was incredibly rude, but I can still honestly say that it was one of the best nights of my life. So excited to have made this huge step!

Does anybody else have any stories about their first time going out?"
Tropius-,asktransgender,Cis people telling me to delay hormones - is there any point in listening to them?,"A lot of the people I've come out to recently are warning me not to start hormones straight away, even though I'm certain it's what I want to do (I've wanted HRT since three years ago). None of these people are trans, though one of them is a mother of a FtM son who is now fully transitioned.

On the one hand, they're obviously worried for me, but I can't shake the suspicion that they're secretly wishing I change my mind, and trying to delay me on purpose. I already feel like I've delayed transitioning for far too long. Should I bother listening to them at all?"
Loken_Family,asktransgender,How did you cope with your body pre-transition whilst waiting for the medical process to proceed?,"Hi r/asktransgender (first post here, please forgive any mistakes)

So bit of back story, I told my mum nearly 2 years ago that I'm trans (MtF), then my gran about 6 months after that. With much patience on all our behalves our relationships are pretty good with the idea of being trans and what it means.

After having to drop out of the medical process (the psych appointments and doctors appointment, I'm in the UK.) the first time round due to everything being too hard to balance (I was struggling with dealing with my head, my degree and my family) I decided to focus on Uni, which didn't go too well. I am now back on the waiting list... of 10 months just for a first psych appointment.

My body is not the best to make a female, I'm 6'3, broad shoulders and generally heavy set (I can do a picture tomorrow if that changes peoples information on the subject) with lots of fast growing body hair (the main issue) I get that this is something that will change and sometimes I look in the mirror and see what I might be like in X years time but other times I look in the mirror and it crushes me.

So what things did you do to cope during the difficult period of knowing who you are and who you want to be but having nature against you?"
M995,asktransgender,"I am starting HRT soon. Which method of HRT would you recommend for estrogen and anti-androgen? Pills, Injections or patches?","My initial plan is to go for a monthly anti-androgen injection and I am swaying between patches or injections for estrogen delivery.

godpleasekillmesoon,asktransgender,got approved for legit hrt (was on diy before) questions about progesterone and creams,"So been diy'ing for around 13-15 months, i got a blood work at around 9 month mark incidentally from a random doctor and i learned that my testosterone was in female range and estrogen was in semi low female range as well. 

only thing is that my breast growth could be better , its somewhere between tanner stage 2 and 3, according to [this picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Tanner_scale-female.svg/1000px-Tanner_scale-female.svg.png)

so now as i will be able to go to an endocrinologist and actually ask for various prescriptions for stuff, What should i be looking into to get better breast growth? should i bother with progesterone creams? Are there Estrogen creams? also by creams i mean creams that are applied directly to breasts

is this worth exploring? --&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormonal_breast_enhancement"
Dracowulf,asktransgender,Wondering about identity.,"I have identified as transgender for a few years now, and have come out to a lot of people but I've been thinking about my feelings and I'm not really sure what to consider myself.

I consider myself gender blind, I don't see genders like everyone else, there is very little difference between male and female to me and I feel comfortable around the middle. I hate the idea of being masculine, having a masculine body, etc and so for a while I thought I was a transfemale because this gave me severe dysphoria and I didn't feel right. But I also hate the idea of being feminine, having a very female body (big breasts, hips, voice), yet I prefer the idea of having long hair, a softer lighter androgynous voice more on the feminine side and a more feminine body (small features). I still plan on transitioning because I know at this point I'll have female traits but not too much if I control it.

I'm just confused because I don't really care about gender, I want to be in the middle but more on the female side, but because of this I'm not sure if I should consider myself a transfemale, a demi-girl or agender. What do you think?"
SoonToBeRachel,asktransgender,I feel like I don't look like what my body measurements are?,"I measured myself earlier today, my underbust was 30 inches, bust line 33 inches, waist 27.5, hips 37 inches. On here it looks good, but I feel like I look much broader than this. Is it just in my head?"
AliceRose42,asktransgender,How to survive a psych evaluation,"Hi everyone, 

Mtf, pre-everything. I asked my doctor for HRT yesterday, and he wants me to get a psychiatric evaluation, I guess to make sure I'm trans enough. He says that the endo he wants to refer me to won't take me unless I have the evaluation. 

My concern is that I know there are still some pretty outdated ideas about trans people, and I'm afraid this psychiatrist will have some of these ideas, and that I won't be seen as trans enough because I didn't ask my parents if they cloud make me a girl when I was 2, or I haven't been presenting female for a year or something. 

Has anyone else had to take a psych evaluation to determine if you're trans? Is there anything in particular I should say to make sure they believe me? I don't want to lie to them, but I know without a doubt that I want to transition, and I want to start HRT as soon as possible. I don't know if I can handle a psychiatrist telling me that I'm not trans enough for hormones. Anyone's perspectives and advice would be greatly appreciated."
HipsDontLieGirl,asktransgender,What is the maximum age to get hip bone growth or tilt on HRT MTF?,"I am an 18 year old transgender woman who is pre HRT, and I recently measured my hips and my hips are wider than my rib cage and they are about the same size as my shoulders (if not just an inch smaller) My hips are 36 or 37 inches now, I have alot of fat on them.

Judging from all of this could my hip bone grow or get alot more fat on them and could I have very wide hips at 40 inches or over? "
Eatosmoriarty,asktransgender,[Trigger] Any suggestions or uplifting wisdom that could help???,"Hello everyone!!!

StopLookingBuy,asktransgender,Reddit has really changed my views regarding the trans community. Just want to say thanks.,"I admit I had very ignorant and offensive views on the community before Reddit. 


Growing up in a small southern town,  being a straight white male seemed more of a blessing than anything else considering how you are treated if you are anything else.


I had always been fascinated by the trans community because of the idea of living as another person completely. I watched tv shows on the issues and something always kept my attention. 


But I had always at the bottom of it all classified it as men thinking they were women and etc. I told someone who was trans that they should give up hope for a typical relationship with anyone because a lot of men arent going to look at a penis on a female like they would a ugly mole.



I held a lot of ignorant views and spouted a lot of rude hurtful things about those who couldn't pass. After seeing this community on Reddit I began to realize that it wasn't an act and no one ""was asking for"" anything or treatment received.  I realized that people are just people. They bleed the same way, they want acceptance, the same things everyone wants. I feel some people out there hinder the movement but thats no different in any other culture and you cant generalize a group of people. 


Though  i think this subreddit can be a little oversensative and over aggressive at times, Im grateful to not be an ignorant asshole anymore. 

Thank you!

"
-mousey-,asktransgender,Is it meant to be clear?,"I have seriously, seriously complex feelings regarding gender. I know several things for sure and the rest is a horribly confusing blur.

I know I don't ever ever want to have surgery, I'm okay with my genitalia, of I had the option at birth I would have picked the other option but I didn't have the option. I'm also against surgery for myself for lots of other reasons.

I know I feel horrible about my body and how I look. I'm what would probably be called a femboy in terms of looks, I hardcore shifted gear on this a couple of years ago after having had enough with being what I would describe as a fat greasy nerd. I'm not that anymore but my skin crawls when I imagine gaining weight or cutting my hair or not spending hours cleaning up every day. I can't stand masculine features in myself, they make me feel ill. The places I store fat or build muscle, the fact I have to shave regularly, the places I get hair, if someone calls me handsome or masculine I will politely smile and laugh and then excuse myself to go and fall apart somewhere.

I get confused for a girl a lot now, which is nice. But at the same time it draws attention to the fact that it's a mistake they've made. Something that will embarrass them when I fuck up and walk wrong or say something in a deep voice or laugh or the lighting is different. It used to make me greatful and now makes me feel kind of horrible as well as grateful which isn't pleasant.

I have no idea how to be a girl and what a girl is and what a guy is and what either of those abstract concepts are meant to mean to me and how I'm meant to act like what I want to be and what that even is.

 I'm rude, I like it when fights break out, I like angry music with screaming in it, I like competing and knowing everything, I like to train and be strong and hardy and I like hanging out with guys a lot of the time. I mean they're not traditionally girly traits. I also like the idea of being pretty, being someone's girlfriend, spending time on how I look, buying nice clothes, even the shit parts like getting hit on and let in places when I go out strictly based on how much some dickhead wants to fuck me. Not exactly traditionally masculine traits.

It's not clear at all and I don't think I'll ever be comfortable going I'm a guy now or I'm a woman now because I'm not sure I believe either. I know I don't like being stuck here and I know looking in the mirror literally makes me want to die.

Was it clear to you? Did you know? If so at what point and what did you know? Are you comfortable now or do you have doubts? What in the name of the ever loving fuck am I supposed to do about this shit?"
MichelletheDiva,asktransgender,What was your okay I'm going to transition moment? Was it a person who inspired you or just your dysphoria or both?,"So For example I transitioned before the whole Caitlyn Jenner thing, so I did have someone that inspired me to transition so to speak, her name = ""Carmen Carrera."" I was watching Ru Paul Drag Race and I'm seeing her with her fiery personality tear up the runway and went on to transition and have so much success. That was my breaking point and I was like, ""I can do this."" 

Did you have an inspirational person, or dysphoria, or sheer will?
What was your moment?"
Captain-Nemo,asktransgender,Coming out woes,"So I have a bit of a light hearted story today. &lt;3

I hate coming out to people. It's just a super awkward conversation, and I never know how it will end. So this Saturday I was at a party and I had an alcohol assisted surge of courage and I came out to two close friends. 

Both of them were 100% supportive! Which was awesome! Unfortunately one of them was so drunk he doesn't remember. So now I have to come out to him again! Oh joy. "
HyperFreya,asktransgender,Was I in the wrong?,"So I just need to ask this because I need to get my thoughts out. First let me say that I've not come out to my family yet and today we were celebrating my step grandfathers (if that's a thing) birthday. At the end he started telling us about a order that he's a part of that doesn't accept women and I told him that I thought that was wrong and very outdated thinking. I'll also note that he has invited me to this order and I've politely declined.

He started arguing against me and I got quite upset, I didn't yell or anything, but I used quite harsh words while arguing against him. I've not felt that upset about something like this ever until recently when I started identifying as trans. The problem is that now I feel kind of bad about being so harsh against my 75 year old step grandfather, because he doesn't know anything about my feelings nor does my family.

So my question here is, was I in the wrong here and should I maybe apolagize? It feels like I unleashed about a long times worth of frustrations in that short moment."
UnofficiallyJam,asktransgender,Endless paranoia.,"So today I just came out to mom as mtf, well not in person since I sort came out to a doctor and then told her to tell my mother. Now she honestly toke it pretty well and well I couldn't stop shaking at all, as the doctor named a couple of places I could to get help. The doc even gave me a therapist to go to see to hopefully see of he can get me on hrt. So I feel like I should be happy but instead I am filled with this paranoia that things are just going to go horribly wrong at any moment, and I have until June to said therapist. So I want to happy about this and just wait until then, but I just can't shake the world of paranoia that is being thrusted onto me at the moment. It just won't seem to go away and does anyone have advice or something?"
iwantsrsasap,asktransgender,"Weight loss/calorie counting, and trying to get to an acceptable BMI for SRS","Hi everyone, I am a 24-year-old trans woman.

I've been trying to lose weight, because I'm trying to prepare my body to get to an acceptable BMI before I contact one of the two Thai SRS surgeons to hopefully kickstart this process. I'm trying to get to a BMI of 34-35, and I'm currently at 49... being 6'1 380lbs.

I've had issues with trauma and abuse in my past, parents forcing me to eat a lot, and being on the Autism spectrum and being allergic to a significant number of foods did a number on me on childhood and while I lost about ~75lbs throughout 2013, I quickly regained due to abuse happening again, crap health insurance not covering any mental health services, etc. I've also gone through 3 nutritionists whom gave up after seeing the list of foods I am not allergic to.

What I'm trying to do now is calorie count, and I've compiled a list of the foods I can eat and how many calories I am. Which brings me to...

I want to try to get SRS in about ~10 months. I read a lot of conflicting information about minimum calories needed, made meal plans, but I still don't know how to best go about this. Stuff like Keto &amp; other diets is out due to allergies, otherwise I'd do that in a heartbeat. Some say I need a minimum of 1200 calories, some say I need a minimum of 1800 calories per day.

Does anyone have any advice they can give me for this? (Apologies for laying out my whole life story here, I thought a little more information would be beneficial. :P)"
BlueberryMara,asktransgender,"Should I forego a great opportunity, or delay my transition a year?","Hey everyone, I'm pretty sure that I want to transition, but there's a decision I need to make, and I would like some advice! I'm 21-years old and MtF. 

 I live in a European country where it's required to have a minimum of 6 appointments with a therapist before you're prescribed HRT. This is not an issue, and I'm due for my first appointment next month.

However, I'm currently a university student, and I got the amazing opportunity to study at a foreign university for 6 months starting this September. My problem is that taking this opportunity would mean that I will have to delay HRT for at least 6 months, and possibly even longer (in case I don't finish the 6 appointments in time). 

What mainly worries me is how much of an averse affect this will have on my transition. I already have body hair on basically every part of my body possible, and puberty has done its job on me. However, things like my face, my skin, and body structure (to a certain extent) are not extremely masculine, and this is something I'm very happy about it.

Will I become significantly more masculine by delaying HRT for another year? I realize this is very much a case of YMMV, and maybe worrying about just 6 months is a bit silly, but it's really bothering me. Thanks in advance!"
Hi_im_Lexi,asktransgender,"The best thing about transitioning, in my personal opinion...","Today was horrible for me:
School has me down,
I feel like most of my pre-transition friends are drifting away,
I had family issues,
etc.

Days like this used to set me into a huge depression. Days like this made the world feel like it was caving in around me. Days like this used to make me feel like there is no point to live.

But now, its okay.

The deep depression that had always clouded my life is gone. Bad days are no longer the end of my world. There's always tomorrow, and I'm happy to be alive.

Transitioning won't fix all of the problems in your life. But just being happy in your own skin, regardless of the situation that you are in, is what life is truly about. 

And now I can experience that.

Three weeks and a day into being full time, and though this day was from hell, I've never been happier in my life.

midwestconfusion,asktransgender,About to see a DR,Ok so I have my first Dr. Appointment on May 19th. And I am worried that she may tell me that I am unhealthy to start HRT. Granted I know this to be untrue because for the most part I am healthy. Has anyone had their dr say they can't start HRT?
forty6_and_2,asktransgender,Dating/meeting sites for us trans folks?,"So I've effectively made a total of zero friends in grad school, a feat to which I've credited my self loathing, unending fear of coming out before I ""pass,"" and internalized transphobia. You know, the usual stuff.

I feel romantically empty. There aren't any lesbians/bi girls (that I know of) in my program, and I literally speak to no new people outside of it. I was wondering if there's any website or whateva for connecting LGBT peeps with an emphasis on the T. At this point, I honestly don't see how anyone besides a trans person could be romantically interested in me.

So, enlighten me, friends!

Also, like, thanks... and stuff.

Neosquid,asktransgender,Endocrinologists in Michigan?,"I've been going to this one therapist chick since mid January, and at first she made it sound like getting a job would be the only thing I'd need done first to get into hormone replacement therapy (""m --&gt; f""). Indeed, after I got the job she made it sound like she'd write up the papers. Well, the psych she was working with, at least. Well, that was around like March 12th, and now it's looking like she's gonna have the papers written in like May at best. I wouldn't be so upset about it if that were all, but the thing is, it seems like she is making up reasons to not start me yet. The first new thing I heard was ""improve my anger management"", which is weird since I am not a volatile person when I'm around people. A bit after we started working on that, she brings up how I need a job with more hours (I get 30 hours a week on average, how is that not decent enough). Then she starts bitching about how I needed to be able to move out soon after starting, despite the fact that I said I was okay with living with either of my two sets of (step)/parents (well, I'm not since I like privacy and I dislike all of them, but it's not the end of the world). 

I'm concerned she's going to keep doing this for a long time. I can't really get another therapist either, my parents have to pay for this stuff and asking them to do that would cause problems with them (not trying to imply they hired her knowing she would do this). I have enough money to afford a few appointments with an endo, especially if insurance covers a lot of it. As you already know from the title, I live in michigan. So if any of you know of any endocrinologists in michigan that neither works out of a truck sells drugs slightly better than those on the blackmarket, or requires therapist/psychiatrist letters of approval, informing me of them would make me a very happy grill."

##Some tips for working on your voice:

* Stay out of falsetto! Falsetto is only useful in finding your head voice, it's not a very good place to go for finding a voice to speak in. Falsetto is the vocal range above your normal vocal range, and you should feel a ""break"" in your voice as you transition from your normal vocal range up into falsetto
* Work on your resonance! You should feel no vibrations in your chest when speaking. The target you're looking for is your ""head voice""
* To find your head voice, try pushing your larynx (the thing your adam's apple is attached to) up as far as you can, and attempt to ""throw"" your voice out of the top of your throat instead of your chest. You should feel vibrations in your mouth, teeth, upper throat and maybe even your nose when you're doing it correctly
* Once you get your head voice, take your guy voice up into head voice and you should get something that starts to sound female.
* Talk to yourself in your female voice when no one else is around, so you can build up muscle memory

##How to rate others' voices

If you don't know the vocabulary to describe what someone is doing wrong, feel free to simply state how close you think they are to passing. Please be honest and respectful, and don't tell someone they pass when you know they don't so that they don't end up using the wrong voice techniques. There's nothing worse than building confidence in a non-passing voice and then realizing it doesn't pass later on and you wasted your time.

If you are going to post your own voice clip, please help others with their voices as well! The best way to make this a useful thread is for everyone to pitch in :)

TheClaireProject,asktransgender,What do I look for in a gender therapist/gender counselor?,"I'm not sure on the terminology...all I've ever heard was gender therapist (I feel VERY uninformed on this topic entirely, considering how I feel about wanting it), but I have an appointment on the 21st at an office in Ashland, Kentucky. I'm not sure if I'm seeing someone that's ""specialized"", but the lady said there are people at this place ""going through the same things I am"". I'm not sure if that means there are other people going there for the same reasons or what.

So my question goes to anyone that has sought out a therapist for this. What do I look for? IS there anything to look for? I want to find someone who knows what they're talking about, not someone who will learn with me...I'm afraid of being given false information, too...

Any advice? At all?"
Cocobrien23,asktransgender,Am I Making a Mistake? :(,"I've been on hrt for four months now. When I started, nothing in the world felt better than the idea of transitioning. Now, I feel much less emotional, a little weird, awkward, and like none of it brings me joy anymore. I can't say that it does the opposite, though I do feel a little wrong. Why would that happen? :( I wanted this to be right, but maybe I was cis all along, and I was in denial? I've heard that giving hormones to someone who is Cis will only give them gender dysphoria.

I saw him on Wednesday night at his place because i was in the area. He opened the door and the first thing he did after the door closed was hug me in a way that was *almost* sexual but not quite. As of today, I've noticed that he has a thing of placing his hands on my lower back and pulling up towards him and its a very intimate way of hugging. ""friend"" is the type of guy who knows how to seduce.

So he hugged me in that possesive way and after we broke away i was like ""we never hug feels weird"" and he didn't answer he just led the way to the kitchen.

I noticed that he was looking at me differently, like he was *really*looking at me as we spoke. I won't lie to you it realy turns me on when he looks at me. I wanted to tell him to stop but I thought that would be unromantic so i didnt say anything. He said i looked nice and then he said he had to first finish an essay and if i could spell check it afterwards.

After that in the kitchen we were making burgers and talking and laughing about something else and then he said ""its been two hours and you haven't kissed me"". 


I looked up at him from the stove and he was smirking. I smiled too and looked away, I couldn't help it. I didnt say anything because I didn't know what to say. And then he pulled my arm and said ""you gonna kiss me or not?"" I was facing him directly and I started laughing, like snorting and stuff. And then i was like ""ok"" and then... Yeah.

When we broke apart he was like ""damn girl"". I was like ""what?"" And he was like ""nothing"" and then some more *snogging*. He was pulling me up towards him in that way.

Honestly my jaw was starting to hurt after a while so i had to stop. Oh, he was wearing sweatpants so I could feel his hard ""little friend"" against my stomach. 

He accompanied me all the way to my place afterwards. When he left i gave him a quick one on the mouth.

We didn't text much again until i saw him again on Saturday. I was outside his complex building at 1 pm when i texted him that i was in the area again and if I could come up. He took long to respond and when he called said he was with friends and if i could come back in a few hours. I was like ""why can't i come up"" and he was like ""it's really packed, my friends are drunk and I know you hate drunk people *baby*""(first time he called me ""baby"", he sounded drunk himself too. He was right, drunk people make me uncomfortable.) i said ok and went back to my place. He called around 4:30 and I didn't answer, and he texted that he was coming over and if i was home. I replied and said ""im at home"". When he arrived though he didn't seem drunk.

I've got this feeling that he doesn't want me to meet his friends. Im totally okay with that, I respect his choices, but i wonder how it will affect our relationship longterm.

Anyway we went to his place, no one was there. It was a mess. Beer bottles, food, all over the place. I helped him clean up and i wondered if he'd made out, or even fucked, another girl because there were 5 used condoms in the bin. I mean he's tall and fit and handsome, he could be a model if he wanted, so i imagine sex comes easily his way.

When we were done i didn't feel like talking much and he sensed it so he just put a movie on the TV (the movie was called ""her"". Ugh such a masterpiece""). after the movie my mood had lifted and we started talking about the movie and its romantic theme somehow seeped to us somehow (the ""lovemaking scenes"" had made me blush and may have triggered the following question he asked). After like an eternity of ""snogging"" he asked me ""so when can i make love to you?""putting emphasis on the last three words

I laughed because I thought he was joking, or making a reference from the movie. But he said he was serious. I felt that feeling again of wanting to cry, the same one when he'd told me that he was falling for me Earlier in the week, and my face must've shown it, because he said, ""nevermind then"".

And then i was like, ""no,its just that I don't know if you're serious or not.""

""I'm serious.""

""Why do you want to have sex with me?""

""Because i like you. And I'm attracted to you?""

We were silent for a long time and i went to the bathroom. When i came back i said ""what if you don't like my dick?""

He took his time to reply, maybe a minute. And then he said he'll just ignore my penis. I was like ""ok"" tentatively and we sat in silence for like half an hour.

By the time we realized what time it was it was midnight so  I had to sleep over. Lol we just slept on the couch, but we didn't cuddle.

In the morning today i showered. He showered. We played playstation, kissed a little. There was football in the afternoon, he supports manchester united and they lost, so he was in a bad mood, so i made him some lunch and he felt better. lol it *really* turned me on to see him really enthusiatically eat the food I made, he kept complimenting me. I wanted him there and then on the couch but we needed an enema from the store.

When we got back from the store i cleaned myself out. So this was my first time having sex. I don't think i was mentally prepared for it enough.

So when i was done i went to sit back down next to him on the couch. He continued watching TV for a bit and then he switched it off and apologized for keeping me waiting. Lol the feels.

I was *soooooooooo* nervous as he led me to his bedroom. we were quiet again, nothing like our loud selves.
And then it hit me and i said, my voice hoarse, ""we don't have any lube!""

We started laughing again and it took a while to stop. Then he went to the store again and he took over an hour before he returned. It was now around 5 pm. Then again he took my hand and led me to the bedroom. 

This is where it gets nfsw

He took off all my clothes and started to feel up everything as if he wanted to make sure it all felt natural and womanly. He didn't touch my penis. His hands felt amazing though. he liked my boobs, which are a c cup, but he absolutely loved my ass. He kept spanking it and groaning and said he'd noticed it on the day we met. Lol. I said, ""can we move on please?"" after a while and he laughed. 

Then he took off his clothes, except his boxers, but I could see the bulge, and I thought nothing of it then. He put me on the bed, i felt his strength, and started kissing me, and then my neck, and then he started to suckle, for a while, and his mouth felt *so good* on my nipples guys, like woooowww. . And then he went further down but when he reached a point below my navel, he turned me over and started kissing my bum and spanking it and i was surprised when he started to kiss my asshole. I was breathless and asked him what he was doing and he didn't answer, he just continued with his biz. Gosh, it felt *soooooooo freaking good*. I was moaning, I thought moaning was something fake that people did but nope. Its real. 

Occasionally his tongue would slip to my perineum and scrotum and I'd almost scream. I think he caught on because he then enclosed his mouth fully around my scrotum. For some reason my scrotum is almost unbearably sensitive to sexual touch, years of masturbating had told me this. I can't describe to you how how it felt when he was going down on my scrotum but all I know is i was grabbing the bedsheets and being a bit too loud because he then told me to lower my voice. I almost came but i held it back.

Then it was my turn. He lay on his back and he took off his boxers. My word. I looked at him with my mouth open and he began to laugh and i asked how big it was and he said he didn't know he got a ruler from his desk and measured it. 8.5 inches. oh my goodnessghjhnjhfchdfgbhgh. Why??

Anyway i gave him the best blowjob i could as he lay on his back. all he did was breathe heavily and say my name a couple of times. My jaw hurts right now.

Then he got lube on his fingers and started to finger me, slowly at first, with one finger. Then with two and faster. It hurt with two fingers. 

Anyway then it was time. I lay on my back and he climbed on top of me. He looked more good looking than ever and i told him this and he said ""thats the first time you've given me a compliment.""

We used extra lube for his penis. When the head had entered, it felt so painful. We put more lube and he went in further. He tried to relax me by kissing me and it worked a bit. He couldnt go all the way in, though, at some point, maybe 5 inches in, it felt excrutiating

As he began to thrust, it started to feel good but still painful. He was enjoying though, kept saying how tight and warm i was. We were looking right at each other.

In doggystyle it felt like it was going in deeper but the pain was neither lessened or increased. He was spanking away.

We went back to missionary because me on top felt unbearable. This time it was a lot faster. I felt like i was almost coming but it would just fade away. I told him to go faster because i was close. And then i came and its the best physical feeling ive felt to date. 

He took a bit longer to come though, by the time he came my genitals were on fire.. All in all, we had sex for about forty minutes. 

Afterwards there was cuddling but he was so sleepy. I kept trying to kiss him awake but he'd just lull back to sleep. I thought that was funny. Eventually i fell asleep too. 

After nearly three hours i woke up. He was awake sitting at the edge of the bed. He had ordered pizza. I was starving. when i tried to sit up my butt felt like it was on fire. We ate. He was a little quieter than usual though but maybe it's because he'd just woken up.

I could have slept over but tomorrow was school. At my door at my place, he kissed me and said he was happy i was in his life. Later he texted that his place felt empty and sad without me. 

Its 4:30 am Monday morning and i was just so excited to write this because I think i now have a boyfriend! Lol... He hasnt called me his girlfriend but we'll see. He's turning 22 on the 19th and i have no idea what to get him. Oh and how do i get rid of this *pain in my ass* honestly i can barely walk, it hurts so bad.

Defunct_Drone,asktransgender,On average how much can I expect to pay for facial feminization?,I know it varies from person to person but what are some average ball park figures? I went out as a woman for the first time today and it was so liberating that I can't go back. I know other people can tell I look like a boy but I really want to go the whole nine yards. If anyone can shed any light on this I'll love you forever &lt;3
depressed_goat,asktransgender,"Had ffs, over one and half years on HRT, and im not allowed to present female.. I hate myself right now.","My life is about as good as it gets for a trans girl,

My parents eventually got to support me and paid for everything, I live in one of the most trans friendly area there is, and I look androgynous enough that I pass as cis for either gender, (I got minor ffs for dysphoria, not to look girlier), so its not like things should actually be difficult for me to be this way.

Yet because i have to present male, Im depressed all over again. Its not nearly as bad as the pre transition depression that I've had, but I still feel like a piece of crap. I already have sub zero self esteem, and the fact that nobody outside of who I am out to has ever gendered me female is just grinding that down even more. Im seeing the girl in the mirror less and less, and its terrifying. Most of the time I do a decent job at convincing myself that I am okay with being a feminine boy, but thats not true. I've always wanted to be a tom boy, not the other way around.

At this point, my parents promised me that it would be okay for me to present female full time once my grand parents are done visiting me in Nov, but Im not sure if that would be possible. Since many of our family friends are my dad's business partners, and since the industry he's in is going under, he is not in a good position to alienate any of his friends (he actually had to become a godfather to consolidate his relation to one of them). My mother's social circle is also really conservative, she recently became religious and joined a church, so I would hate for her to lose her social standing too.

They say that they don't care about how their social circles would think, I can tell that its all on me to not screw it for them. They've worked so hard and sacrificed so much their entire life, its not fair that I just do what I want and disregard them, I know they are willing, but I can't allow myself to make them sacrifice more for me. I feel like a fuck up, I've disappointed them enough by being a black sheep up until this point, I just couldn't make myself fit any of the ""good kid molds"".

I grew up with ""the last generation worked hard, the last last generation worked hard, and its all on you to work hard and improve the next generation"", and if I fucked up, I would be throwing all those previous generation's achievements away, and betraying all of them; and it's not like that is not the case, out of all my grand parents, 2 were doctors, and 1 was a pharmacist, and my aunts and uncles are dentist, CEO, .etc, and my dad has a successful retail business. I don't know how much more I can do to improve on that. When I came out as trans, they already way lowered their expectations for me, and it kills me to think that because I'm trans, they'd think I would not live up to them, so I just want to try and live as a cis boy as much as possible.

I don't know, I just hate myself, I cant get over how much of an embarrassment I am to all three generations of my family, the only reason I decided to transition was because I couldn't see myself living pass 25, and being a trans daughter would be being a dead son, and now that the suicidal thoughts are gone, I just want to please my parents more. In the end, the depression and everything, it's killing my transition, and my school performance, and im afraid im just becoming less and less palatable because of that."
Fap_Doctor,asktransgender,Testicle Pain,"I noticed my right one started to hurt after lunch at work. I do stock shelves, move around and lift stuff that could be heavy. I was doing paper goods today.

streetsofpity,asktransgender,Gender affirming videos,"Hi, one thing that has really helped me recently is watching/listening to things like ASMR makeup videos. I find they really relax me not only because of the ASMR-ness, but also the gender affirmation they provide. Does anyone know of any other types of gender affirming videos I/we might watch? Doesn't need to be specifically designed for relaxation, I think anything would naturally have that effect anyway."
AdornedWithLillies,asktransgender,I'm 13 and I need help. Anyone??,"Hi, I'm sorry in advance because I'm sure that y'all have gotten many, many questions like this in the past so that it has become trite. But regardless of that, I'll still make this post because I'd really, really appreciate any help that I can get. 

Background: I was born into a quite conservative family. (i.e. The vast majority of my relatives are traditional, Bible-beltish evangelical Christians.) I was a relatively happy and peaceful kid, and so my family saw me as a model child of some sort. I remember playing with towels/blankets and wrapping them around my body/head (like a dress or pretending that I had long hair) when I was about 4/5, and I also remember that I felt like the prettiest princess in existence when I did that. I would spin round and round and I would love how my ""dress"" flew and wavered. However, those feelings would often soon be crushed 15 minutes later when I took them off and I was back to being a boy. :/ I also recall praying deeply at night, wishing that I would wake up as a girl tomorrow. And I got really, really sad every time I woke up to find out that that didn't happen. I wasn't really able to put a name to what I felt- I knew nothing about transgender issues and such (I was  5 lol) and so I just pushed it off for some couple of years. 

Fast forward to about 18 months ago. Through some circumstances that are irrelevant to the topic at hand, I finally figured out that I was trans. It all finally made sense; why I used to feel ""that way"", why I used to pray that I would wake up as a girl, and also why I would often steal my girl cousin's little heels and prance around like I owned the world. I knew my family would not accept it, and I accepted that fact somehow. I lived in relative peace, lurking on the internet and stuff, basically distracting myself from the reality that was at hand. But fast forward again to about 12 months ago, oh lordy I simply could not bear it any longer. I told my mom. Initially, I was hopeful about her reaction. Something about her phrasing made it seem like she was totally on board; sadly, this was not truly the case. She kept denying what I felt, saying ""No, you're a boy and you're confused"" and basically constantly invalidating me. God, I felt so helpless. Especially because I knew that she genuinely, honestly thought that she was doing the right thing. What was supposedly best for me. I couldn't do anything about it. So I had no choice but to repress it again. I told a couple other people since then: one (he was gay ironically) had an ambiguous-leaning-negative noncommittal reaction, and the other one, oh God bless her, she completely supported me and said that I deserved to have a joyous, fulfilling life and that I could always count on her support. Unfortunately, I think both of them are just as powerless as I am to affect my situation in any significant positive way. I think. 

And finally, fast forward to now. I'm typing this alone. My current situation is.... meh. I haven't reached the point of total, bleak depression, but my happiness is usually only temporary and my apathy is the only thing that is constant. I look at girls my age and I'm conflicted because since I'm a lesbian as well as a trans girl, I both like them (i.e. Crushes and stupid naive adolescent stuff) and want to be like them. Sometimes it can get pretty hard to tell the difference. But there's always some sort of envy present. I think of telling my mom, of reminding her (she seems to have forgotten) but then I also think of how it would ruin and devastate my family to know. I think of my mom, the woman who selflessly loved me and raised me for 13 years, who used to wake up in the middle of the night to feed me when I told her I was hungry, and I think of how she would be so conflicted. I think of my dad, the man who worked long, arduous shifts as a government employee to support out family and I think of how we would often use to watch anime together. I think of how strained our relationship would become. I think of my two grandmothers, those kind old ladies who nurtured me and fed me and spoiled me to no end, and oh God I think of how they would cry. It breaks my heart knowing that I could hurt so many people. Especially since I'm deeply anxious about disappointing anyone. I don't want to force them to deal with this, because it's not their burden to bear. There's a gnawing fear at the back of my mind that they would all shun me, and that would simply devastate me. I wouldn't be able to bear losing them, but neither would I be able to bear to lose myself either. I'm slowly being eaten away at by my dysphoria and it's getting harder and harder for me to love myself. I look in the mirror and the reflection is foreign; it's *not me.* I hear my voice and it sounds so unfamiliar, almost like I'm doing a character voice except not really. I fear for that. I'm considering a career that would require me to heavily use my voice, and I fear  that my prospects in that would become nil because of how testosterone would further affect my voice, and in turn what its effects would be on what I plan to do. I don't want to have to compromise anything, see this dream of mine is a big, big, big part of my life. I would be devastated to have to let go of one of my greatest loves. You see, I'm the type who really and fully gives themselves to something once they decide that it's worth it, and I don't think i would be able to bear it to let it go. I really don't think so. I can't envision myself without it. But neither can I envision myself without a fully realized identity. I certainly don't want to have to come to the point where I would have to choose between those two things, as that would be so heart-wrenching and scarring.

There is one way that I think I could avoid that, though: if I transition now. I know, I know, you might be confused. Last paragraph I was just waxing dramatic about how my family would be affected and how I don't want to be a burden and wah wah wah. But like I said, I'm a deeply conflicted person. There are so many things on my mind right now, and I'm sure that adolescence does play a role in this, but I also feel like it's something much bigger and more urgent. I don't even know what I want out of this. I just really need to vent, because I see nothing else I can do. This is my sole act of agency. 

Anyway, thank you all for humoring me and sticking with me through this entire rant-essay thing. ~~God, I should really get extra credit in English class for this.~~ I don't know what to offer you- hopefully this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HECa3bAFAYk) will suffice. :)

defectiveDemiurge,asktransgender,Is there a name for this?,"Some background: the other day I was discussing my dreams to a friend, and I said something in the range of ""in my dreams I am a woman suffused with green light, and I break all the rules but none can subvert my will"" 

The friend, being accepting but unused to those kinds of statements, went ""wait, you're trans?""

This made me wonder what the proper name for someone like me is. I've always identified with strong female figures, most of my friends have been female, and my self image -is- that of a female. But, the way my body currently is (i.e. male) does not cause me dysphoria, and I don't want to devalue the experiences of those who have suffered because they -can't- stand it. I have thought of transitioning, but the costs made it untenable for me. I just know that if someone were to say offer me a chance to press a button to switch genders instantly and permanently, I'd press the hell out of it. Being addressed with either gender's pronouns doesn't make me all that uncomfortable, but I do prefer feminine/neutral ones to masculine ones.

Apologies if this is in any way disrespectful, I've been wondering for quite a long time."
CYLIG,asktransgender,How Does Gel Estrogen Work?,"I am starting Estrogen soon and I have a few questions about it since I'm considering using Estrogen gel.

2. Where do you apply the gel Estrogen gel on your body?

3. What do you do if you like to go swimming, etc?

4. After you have applied the Estrogen gel, how long do you have to wait before getting dressed, etc?

5. Is this method safe? I have heard some forms of HRT go through the liver and I know this can be VERY dangerous as it weakens the liver ALOT!"
CrystalVivian,asktransgender,Coming out: UPDATE,"Well, I came out today to my mom. It went... okay.

She wasn't mad, more confused. After some explanation, she told me that it was likely a phase. She wanted to take me to counseling in order to find out.

isabellethrow,asktransgender,Has anyone dropped out of study to move and transition? How did that go?,"Hey team,

I had a pretty bad breakdown the other day due to trans stuff + uni stuff + work stuff making me too stressed. I've been more frequently depressed and sometimes suicidal since the beginning of study this year. I feel like I'm struggling much more to focus on uni and get shit done than I usually do, and it's because I feel like I can't do anything until I deal with transition (or at least be well on my way). I know this isn't true, but I still can't convince myself to do any work.

Thing is, I start full hormones in less than 3 weeks (currently just on anti-androgens), and I think that might help me a lot. But a couple I know (one of whom bailed me out of this breakdown with talking, food, and doing my make-up) are moving to another city and said that I would be welcome to come along and live with them and that it might help my long-term wellbeing to take some time and sort shit out.

I've already been seriously considered moving to this city next year once I finish this year's study. If I were to move now I would have to drop two whole year papers without refunds (but no consequence to my grades), but I could finish the semester papers I'm doing. This would put my graduation date back 1 year pretty much, which is already too close to when I'm 30. 

But this couple are awesome! And the city I'd be moving to is a big upgrade in a lot of ways - better night life, easier to live in (you can walk everywhere), and a trans community that actually exists. Also, there may be no point in sticking around if uni becomes so stressful that I have to drop out anyway... and if uni becomes that stressful then I'm more likely to be suicidal, so self-preservation is a consideration.

I'm just wondering whether anyone else has dropped study to moved and how it worked out for them. Did you regret stopping/delaying your study? Was moving worth it for your wellbeing/transition? I know you guys can't make the decision for me, but where would your leaning be (even if you haven't had to make this choice)?"

alexvalewest,asktransgender,"just got kicked out of my house, no idea what to do","I live with my grandparents, have since I was young. Today, long story short, they went through some of my stuff and I have to move out.

I have little savings (~~maybe $1000? if that even~~ about $700), a low-paying job part-time, and I attend college full time (probably going to have to stop attending now). I had plans of starting HRT after this semester but now it looks like I won't even have the money for that (no informed consent within 300 miles). I guess I can scratch that off since I certainly won't be able to now.

I've lost most of my family members—most of them would rather see a person die than be trans and actually transition.

No idea what to do. I feel so lost.

Edit:

Been looking at apartments and stuff all day. I haven't totally moved all my stuff out, they got home, acted like nothing had happened until I told them I was planning on leaving and staying the night at a friend's house. I'd be back tomorrow. They got visibly annoyed and simply said ""no"", being particularly vague. I plan on going anyways just to get out of their atmosphere for a bit.

Thanks, by the way, for all the offers of couches (and futons). I appreciate it a lot. I feel a bit more mentally grounded, now. Temporarily, I think I'm not kicked out (?) but I will be very soon still.

Edit 2:

About to go tell them I'm leaving anyways. I'll try to update as soon as I can after but who knows when that'll be.

Edit3/update

Could not have gone worse. My car is technically in my grandfather's name and they threatened to call the cops. They also found out I smoke (weed) occasionally. I vehemently deny it but they know. They said they're going to try to make me take a drug test. I said I will immediately leave forever if they do. Idk what to do now. I can't fucking believe they'd call the cops on me. "
isleeplikeacat,asktransgender,anybody else with PTSD?,"I have been through some bad things in my life, really bad. And when some other bad stuff starts happening, I find myself mentally regressing to that survival mode.

Its a special mode, where my emotions goes away and I start caring 100% about myself and the immediate present: plotting every single small action that might help me, planning for the worst and also overplanning, trusting nothing and noone, deciding in advance which of my belongings can and will be sacrificed if they cant fit in the bags I can carry, etc.

It kills my soul yet it has allowed me to survive more than once. It seems to me bad stuff happens only when I let my guard down and start trusting people - to do their job or hold their promises. most people have good intentions but cant do shit, so its dangerous to trust them. I can clearly see how things can and do go wrong, and I hate that. I hate being right about bad stuff.

I think its PTSD. Ive never been diagnosed. I always plan to take care of that later. but also Im not sure I should get it treated. I need these survival skills. can you relate to that? how do you get it out of you?"

april_to,asktransgender,Misgendering [rant],"Good Day Guys,

Sorry for the rant but here we go. So for the past few days I have been misgendered twice by two managers at work. I heard one manager referring to me as he and a manager replied to me with a 'yes sir' ugh. I am completely out at work but I am functional stealth outside of the office. I am just disappointed that we make ourselves vulnerable to people we don't even know (i.e. co-workers) and yet they continue to do things that hurt us. I have been FT for more two years and it still hurts when it happens. I honestly just want to walk out but I am keeping my cool and brushing it off..but it cuts like a knife sigh. It is so easy to blame ourselves, looking for reasons why we get misgendered. But sometimes I feel like people are just out to hurt you...

It really doesn't matter how passable you look smh people should stop gender policing.

DoIHaveToThinkOfOne,asktransgender,How to find well-structured information for gender presentation stuff?,"I don't know if this is where to post this stuff, so if there's somewhere more appropriate just let me know.

Basically I'm still questioning stuff a lot, and want to start experimenting with some gender presentation stuff in private. But I'm ADHD, so huge lists of poorly structured resources are overwhelming, and I just don't know where to start with anything. In particular, I'm thinking make-up, skincare (which I should work on whatever I decide), fashion, and voice training. 

I don't really know if I'm being reasonable, or if I should just try to suck it up and filter through all the stuff that's available, but I want to try and move forward with this a little bit and that's been the obstacle the last, like, five times I made that decision and I just want to do something this time. 

Sorry again if this is the wrong place, or if it's an old question, or if I structured it all poorly. "

Now that I'm actually starting to take the first few steps toward transitioning, I don't like how much like a boy they make me smell.

MtFGThrowout,asktransgender,"I'm (17M) starting to be certain that I'm trans, but I don't know where to begin. Can someone help me start?","It's a lot more complicated than the title makes it out to be, so please bare with me. And this is the first time I've ever laid these thoughts out fully, so sorry if they're disorganized. 

I was born male, and up until I was about 11 years old, I was mostly fine with my gender. However, during my early teenage years, about when puberty set on, I started getting confused. I found myself wondering about what it would be like to be female, and would daydream about what I would look like or how I would act. Most people passed my thoughts off as normal, or something most teenage guys go through at some point, so I passed it off too. 

Yet, the years went by and I found myself wanting to be more feminine. I'm bisexual, and have often fantasized about being female and in a relationship with my male friends. I watched girls advance in puberty and found myself wanting to look like them, wanting to wear female clothes, wanting to have boobs, wanting to have curves - I wanted a female body. Before I told anyone, my brother came out as MtF trans.

I've watched her transition for months now, and I've grown envious. I started doing research into all of this a few months back, and found that being trans can apparently be genetic as well? I've been meaning to talk with my sis about all of this, but I just constantly chicken out. I mean, at a glance of my life, you wouldn't be able to tell I've been having this identity crisis. I maintain a shaped beard, a nice undercut, I work out to build a ripped body. I dress completely male. I just went with the flow, emulating my male friends and people I'd see online, but was never really comfortable in my body. I mean, I hear of what my sister though of when she was passing as male; depression, suicidal thoughts, but I've not had any of that. I've never been depressed about being in a male body, nor suicidal. 

Yet since 2016 began, I've begun to really think I'm trans. I like to write stories on my spare time, and often I maintain a balance between writing male and female characters, but I've found myself making exclusively female characters for the lead roles and spending a lot more time developing these characters and molding them into who'd I'd like to be. Recently I found this subreddit and have been lurking for a while, and have been looking at all the posts about MtF people and getting envious. I've been fantasizing on a daily basis about being female, and have completely adopted a female persona online. I just really want to be a girl at this point, but I'm having hangups about the whole thing.

For one thing, the financial strain on my family for just my sister being trans is massive. The medications she takes are horribly expensive, and I just feel like throwing me being trans onto that would be putting an undue burden on my parents. Secondly, I don't know if I'd ever be passable. I'm unmistakably male in appearance, and yes I've tried makeup to see if I could just somewhat seem female, but it just makes me seem like a man with makeup on, which is incredibly discouraging. I've seen the pictures of people and their transitions, but I feel like I'd never be able to pass like they do. 

At this point, I *want* to transition. I *want* to be a girl. I can no longer just deal with thinking that this feeling will pass, since I've been thinking that for years and they've just gotten stronger. I just don't know where to begin. 

Again, sorry if this was disorganized. I just need someone to help me find out where I should start transitioning into who I want to be. "

simongraciela22,asktransgender,Strategies for coping with anxiety while experimenting,"I have identified as queer for most of my life, and suspect that I am non-binary trans. I've started experimenting and making changes to see how it feels and am looking for ways to cope with anxiety of being in public. Despite feeling gender euphoria when not in public -- At times I experience intense anxiety or shame when in public -- sometimes I just want to stop all together and try to act male again - and I have to fight that urge.

Backgound:
I was assigned male at birth - have been out as ""gay"" or queer to my family since I was 16. I came out to my mother because I was severely depressed, started doing terribly in school, got into drugs - weed, meth, acid, whatever I could get my hands on to numb the pain. My mom found my stash and was devastated, so I just spilled the beans. Since I hit puberty, I've experienced bouts of dysphoria, feeling totally outside my body - like it is an object, confused why I don't look like my sister, even very jealous of her. During these times I'm very depressed and anxious, can't talk to people, and cant stop watching youtube videos documenting people's mtf experiences, looking at photos of people's transition progress. But then after a month or so I will stop and I'll think, so strange, I was just depressed about something else, don't know what, and was picking gender as the thing to focus those feelings on -- think to my self, ""oh it could have been about anything.""

Anyways, the thing that has kind of set me off most recently was that my hairline started receding a lot (I'm 27 now). I started feeling very masculine, and seeing myself as more an more masculine - whereas before I could think of myself as more feminine or androgynous and avoid mirrors. Imagining my hairline receding more and looking more masculine, I started imagining that I would start looking more and more like my father! Terrified at the prospect of looking so male I started taking a hair growth supplement with saw palmetto to block testosterone activation, and fo-ti as a source of phytoestrogens. I was taking this supplement with the intention of stopping hair loss, but actually started to experience general feminization - my lips got thicker, more fat on my hips and chest. It was very very subtle, but I would look in the mirror and feel ecstatic! It made me so incredibly happy to see these changes in my shape -- and so I started to really seriously consider that I might be trans.

I was on a high does of these herbs for about 4 months, but this January lowered the dose because I was experiencing nausea and migraines on a regular basis, which I read was a sign that I was overloading my liver. Now on the lower dose, I feel that the changes in my body have stopped. I'm not sure what I will do about that situation, but I am continuing to make other changes that make me happy - wearing nail polish, growing my hair out, wearing lipstick.

The thing that's strange to me, is that when I was on the high dose of herbs, and changes were happening (especially mentally, I didn't have anxiety anymore, felt very calm and focused, content) I felt very sure that it was the right thing to do and happy about it, sure that I was trans. But now that I'm on the lower dose - I feel very unsure again -- and am feeling anxiety when wearing feminine clothing - painted nails, having long hair in public. Very self conscious -- all I want to do is stay home where I feel comfortable. I find myself having to fight that urge, especially since I work from home right now so it's easy!

I'm writing too much :p but I guess I have a couple questions:
Are there other's who've had this experience, of feeling very unsure?
Has anyone had a similar experience with phytoestregens or herbals - feeling nausea and headaches?
How do people cope with anxiety when starting to make changes, and feeling people give you funny looks etc?

MissAtom,asktransgender,is it possible to go though hormones but not surgery ?,the reason i ask is that im 100% sure i want to go on hormpnes but not sure i want to do the surgery
carbonfiber12,asktransgender,OCD is ruining me Im stuck in a bloody loop," I've recently been diagnosed with Pure OCD, and it never occurred to me I even had it until I told my psychologist about washing my hands till they would bleed (it was nasty), check the door if it was locked at least 15 times a night , including all windows on the main level. I would search symptoms of cancer or tumors until I believed i wasn't sick by going to the hospital to be proved wrong...it was the same pattern with everything. I had HOCD, ROCD, HOCD and now TOCD , which is the hardest one to shake all of which my therapist knows about. When I was a little boy,  turning into a girl, wearing girl clothes or makeup when I was younger was probably the BIGGEST FEAR I ever had, I hated girly things, I wouldn't even drink out of a pink cup or wear pink shirts, I loved being a boy. 

I started with HOCD I would search through my past for any signs of being gay, or if I had groin responses, and it felt very very real, very scary due to anxiety and your emotions playing with your head on a daily basis, I never liked guys in my life and I was convinced I was gay. I would watch gay porn to see if i was attracted to men, which just messed with my mind and lead me down masturbating at least 4 times a day because I was checking to see if I still liked straight porn. I literally thought I was gonna have to come out and everything cause I was so consumed with these irrational and intrusive thoughts, when I looked in the mirror the thought would pop up ""you look gay"" such a stupid thought to have, how does one look gay, it makes zero sense. And then it switched just in one day, the whole Caitlyn Jenner thing really triggered a new nightmare from hell.

I started remembering the days where I used certain female clothing items to masturbate as early as 13 (start of puberty) to 16 (not consistently) but it was just the clothes that turned me on, never did I ever think I was a girl or feel that the clothes expressed my inner whatever, or did I want to be a girl in public or wear makeup that stuff creeped me out! The masturbating gave me high sexual pleasure, but I don't think I ever imagined being a girl even when I wore the clothes to masturbate, I always imagined having a penis and imagined I would penetrate a girl I found attractive but I did a lot of weird things which my therapist said is normal for anyone going through puberty. When I was done masturbating I was disgusted, it was like I snapped back to my self, the boy who flexed in the mirror , loved the idea of being a classy womanizer like James Bond. I had a strong sense of the man I wanted to be and I was proud of my muscular body,bulging legs to ripped Abs and biceps from futbol, who I was, my looks, my voice, my stubble beard slowly coming in as I turned into a man, I wasn't fake, I always acted like myself, and knew I wanted to be a man, not a women. 

I always always wanted to grow old and act like my father and uncle and grandfather, I looked up to them so much, I wanted to be the alpha male, the girls protector, this masculine dominant athlete and male sex symbol kinda like Beckham, I wanted to be like so many male actors and athletes, Mark wahlburg, Jason statham, Antonio bandares. I loved playing futbol with the lads and always hung out with my pals, hated playing or talking to girls when I was younger. I was a very typical boy who knew who he wanted to be, I fantasized about growing old as a man, having a wife and kids, buying suits, and cool watches, having tattoos, being buff, those thoughts make me happy. 

Now the fetish stopped when I had access to porn so I left the fetish behind, and when I started talking to girls  and wanted to date and have sex. But the past really tormented me, I tried my best to forget about the past, I hated it sooo much, so much I use to imagine me removing the thoughts from my brain, I wanted to forget my past, just like I wanted to forget the HOCD and the TOCD thoughts, but the intrusive thoughts creep in and torment you till your weak, confused, starring into the mirror seeing if you like your body anymore or if you look gay, the OCD makes you think you look gay, or feminine , it tears your self confidence to shreds, makes you search through your past for the smallest spec of information. It Makes you not want relationships or to trust yourself, it truly is a horror. 

My therapist says the key is to find a medication that can help my OCD die down but it will never fully go away, I can accept I have a fetish for womens clothes and I know 100 percent its only sexual, but my mind will not let the thoughts pass through without testing to see if im trans. I keep seeing my therapist, and im told to refrain from sexual things like porn for a bit, because I notice that porn/the fetish basically is where the ocd targets and pulls out guilt and anxiety, the loop feeds itself constantly. I wake up some days or middle of the night with and without the cycle, when there's no cycle Im feeling great about myself, I feel confident about who I am, love my masculinity and I feel so happy, I feel as though Im ready to conquer my desires as a man and be the man I always wanted. Then the intrusive thought starts, ""your repressing, your lying, your trans, you want her body not her, its not anxiety, its dysphoria, remember this from your past"" then i just loose my mind don't want to do anything but seek reassurance, which I know is the worst thing possible, but as I was told OCD is a sickness and its hard to fight on your own... but sometimes you just feel so down and out!"

helpthrowaway620,asktransgender,Military dependence and health insurance.,"Hello /r/transgender.

I'm the dependent of an active duty army service member. I'm American live in Italy with my parents. I'm  moving with my family to Kansas City shortly after I turn 18, which is in the next few weeks.

Because I'm a military dependent, I have military health insurance (Tricare) for some time. I don't know how long it lasts, I think it ends in my mid 20's unless i join iirc. As of today they don't cover transgender services like HRT, but I hear they're planning on changing that this year.

My family is very unhappy that their ""son"" (me) ""thinks he's gay"" and they're taking away my college fund because it's ""my money my rules"" and LGBT people certainly are not welcome. $21,000 dollars are going to my sister instead of me because I'm trans and I can't be trusted. I'm not allowed to date, use the internet, or transition. Plus I'm pretty sure I'm going to get disowned.

Anyways

I'm trying to get out of here as soon as I can. I'm planning on how I'll be able to support myself financially by looking at bank accounts, insurance, roommates, jobs, etc.

Because of the situation with my parents, can I get my military insurance taken away from me? What health insurance should I look into?

I'm not particularly feminine nor particularly masculine, but most of close friends are women, I'm a member of sorority, and passionate about women's rights, etc. I don't mind being seen as or referred to as a woman. Cis as fuck, right?

On the other hand, I want a male body so badly that sometimes it hurts. I can only get off by imagining that I'm a guy, and I'd go on T just to make my clit more dick-like, because that sounds just amazing. I want a male body shape (fat distribution, etc) to go along with that, and while I don't hate my breasts, if someone offered me a mastectomy today, I'd gladly take it.

Otoh, I think I would be miserable socially as a guy. I've hang around with guys of all types (nerds, jocks, gamers, bros, stereotypical gay men, etc) and while I get along with them well enough, male social interaction seems just too overtly aggressive to me. Adding to this is the fact that I have a severe physical disability (I use very obvious crutches to walk)  and while ""crippled girl"" seems okay, I imagine that I would just be eaten alive as a ""crippled guy."" Adding to this is the fact that most men with similar disabilities that I know tend towards the socially aggressive side even more, ala ""Murderball,"" so I think I would fit in even less.

If I have a body I can stand, I'll be miserable socially. If I'm happy socially, I'll have to deal with a body that's all wrong for my true sex. It feels pretty hopeless, and I'm thinking that I should either give up and live as a cis woman or transition and be a socially miserable man. I've actually considered going on T just for the physical, especially bottom, changes and not saying anything about my gender but that doesn't seem workable at all. If nothing else, I'll soon sound and probably look like a guy and thus be treated as one socially.

Sometimes people seem like completely different people when they're on things.

One has a lot of experience with transgender youth and has a very good reputation, and seems to always be the first recommended, but their wait list is over a year. My second option is somebody newer to the field, less experience, and I know nothing about their reputation. Their wait list, however, is a lot shorter.
I know that the sooner I start, the better the outcome, so I am trying to move quickly. I am not sure what to do, though. I would much rather be with somebody who has experience and is respected than somebody I don't know anything about, but even with that in mind, a year is a long time to wait. Currently, I am easily able to get a referral to both, but I'm not sure which one the best option will be. My parents suggested that we try getting a referral to both of them and then get on the wait list, talk to the unknown, and when the opening is free, move to the one with the good reputation and then have a lot to start off with. I'm not sure how well that would work though.

Hi. I'm a trans male, 20 years old, post top surgery but pre bottom surgery. I definitely did NOT enjoy having attached breast as my chest size was HUGE before, like F or something, I never wore cup bras, just sports bras before I did binding. I don't miss them physically. And I love being accepted/seen as a male and using he/him pronouns. 

However, I'm maybe a bit gender nonconforming/maybe genderqueer at times though. I like wearing dresses sometimes, and ""miss"" having breasts, but wouldn't change having had top surgery for a second. I always got a bit of a kick out of dressing up back ""when I was female"", but it wasn't in a like ""Oh yay I'm a pretty female la de da"" way, it was like ""Damn, I'm sexy and I'm turned on by being pretty"" way. My dilemma is that I'm not female, and if I had to pick a different identity besides (trans) male, I'd be genderqueer, not female 100% or maybe not even like 50% .

I'm wondering if there's any other FtM guys who are into crossdressing or being drag queens or stuff like that, and if I could have someone let me know I'm not alone I'd love that. I want to wear pretty clothes without being seen as a woman, but idk how to do that. Sometimes I wear a dress at home alone and get turned on a bit. Idk. 

Also for the MtF gals, anyone have advice about dressing female with a male-type body? Like when you were pre E or even now maybe. T has made me have broader/thicker shoulders and upper arms/back, that said I still have a bit of chub on my hips and a narrower waist, slightly still hour glass. Any advice on making/buying cheap breast forms and how to buy a bra if you don't have a chest/small chest? And how to pick good clothes? I'm really lost

I just feel really confused and have a hard time fitting in as it is,and never really got to be femme as a kid because while I enjoyed it, it made me very dysphoric, as I felt more like a ""liar"" since people saw me as female but I felt like a boy wearing cute clothes. And I want to be a guy who wears cute clothes dammit haha. 

**TL;DR:** FtM/Maybe genderqueer into crossdressing. Is this normal &amp; advice/help please!

But I'm a bit iffy on it. 

So I come here once more to ask: are there any lgbt friendly specialists - endo, therapists, etc - in San Diego around the downtown area or close to it. It sucks so much that the ones I see listed are in the Los Angeles area. (My healthcare is Molina btw)

genderplexed,asktransgender,"Last night I said f@#k it, and posted the first draft of my coming out letter to Facebook","I was expecting a mixed reaction at best, but the response has been overwhelming and 100% positive. If anyone has a few conflicting thoughts, they aren't sharing them yet. There are still a few of my old friends that I'm still wondering if I will hear from, but I will give them a bit before i get too concerned. 

One friend hadn't talked to in years confessed to me that he is pretty sure he is transgender but has never said anything and my letter hit home with him, and gave him a lot more to think about. I'm going to try to get him on here. 

Another friend I haven't talked to in years is sending me a ton a nice clothes that she wants to get out of her closet anyway, and we're almost the exact same build and size! 

This whole day has just been surreal, awesome and bizarre. I got to what felt like the end of my draft and could not stop myself. It is extremely long but I don't think anyone who knows me would have expected any less. I posted it late last night around 3 in the morning, and after freaking out for a couple of hours, got a few hours sleep then woke up to see the damage. 

I am still in a bit of a state of shock, honestly. I've had this big huge pile of fear called ""what will my friends and family think?"" for so long that I really don't even know what to do with myself at the moment. My unplanned impromptu coming out went so well, it's like I have all this energy that I had stored up to prepare to defend myself, and now I don't know what to do with it. I never prepared for everything to go right?

I suppose I will figure that out in due time. Once I get over the shock of this, I can't wait to see what I might put that energy into. I sincerely hope this doesn't sound like boasting or anything of the sort, it's not my intent. I know a lot of people aren't as blessed with friends as I somehow am, but I wanted to tell my happy story here too. :)

tl;dr
I surprised even myself and said fuck it after a first draft of the coming out letter I has planned to obsess over for weeks and published it to facebook in the middle of the night and it is all been amazing so far somehow!"
katiecakesss,asktransgender,Going to see a chaplain today.,"Hello /r/transgender.

My father has made an appointment for me to see a chaplain about my gender issues, and despite being a firm atheist, I agreed to see them to avoid conflict. Maybe this person can help me somehow. My father said this chaplain seemed to be knowledgeable on the subject.

This will be the 6th person I will have seen about gender issues. I still haven't gotten any help. Most people I've talked to are clueless. The closest thing I've gotten was advice on moving out. I've even tried to run away.

I live on an overseas military base where the psychiatrists at the clinic doesn't deal with minors. My health insurance (Tricare) doesn't provide transgender health services (who's going to pay for this?). On top of that my parents are unsupportive and they said they'd basically disown me if I decided to transition. They can't put up with me.

The last chaplain I talked to to told that getting a girlfriend will fix all of my ""doubts"" and that I'd eventually fall into a degenerate lifestyle/go to hell if I didn't. With him being a chaplain who works for the US Navy I'm not entirely sure that what he did was legal (it *was* ex-gay therapy/counseling) but nobody I talked to saw anything wrong with it. ""Why would that be illegal? Tell me where that's illegal. Who said it doesn't work? It does all the time."". Even today my friend told me he was just doing his job by telling me what the bible says.

My family legitimately believes I'll spend an eternity in hell if I don't get this ""fixed"".

The thing is, nobody in real life knows that I'm an atheist.

I was at two dinners with this person and they weren't like the last chaplain. Maybe things will be better, but until I move out I won't be getting any ""real"" help (hrt).

Wish me luck."

Kenna193,asktransgender,Help me get started? :),"Hey everybody!  25 amab...questioning hard lol

My world has been changing really fast, which is really scary and exciting. I didn't really understand what transgender was until about a year ago. And since have been recognizing so many red flags in retrospect and I'm coming to know what I felt my whole life was really me being born in the wrong body.  I'm not too surprised I didn't really see this sooner since I was raised in a very conservative Catholic family. 

I have been reading and learning so much from this sub lately and identifying a lot with the posts. I just wanted to make a friend or two bc I'm not out to anyone in real life. And I can only really talk to my therapist who I have only been to twice now.  

I do have a few questions...

How hard is it to change your voice? I have a rly deep voice and am terrible at impressions and singing so I feel like that means any fake voice I try won't land... 

People who have conservative parents, how bad was it? Idc if my parents approve, I almost think life is easier the less I see them, but I do love them. I don't think they would disown me or anything but really that's my fear.

I feel like in some of my past relationships I was subconsciously trying to get permission from my girlfriends to be girly and bond in that way. Did any one else get this feeling?

Anyways just saying hi and trying to start this process :)"

major_ballsack,asktransgender,Am I about to make a horrible mistake?,"Sorry about formatting, on my phone. 

So some background. My 18th birthday is less than three weeks from now. For the past 7-8 months I've had a crisis of identity. At first, I just thought I wanted to be a little more feminine, but over time I came to the conclusion that I actually wanted to be a girl. 

I've been going to a psychiatrist with experience in this sort of thing for over a year now (although I didn't know going in; at the time, it was just for social anxiety), and he's helpful and supportive. He and I both agree that for right now, to start my transition, I need to come out to my parents. This is due to the fact that I have no means of transportation on my own, and I'm still covered by their insurance. 

The problem is, I don't know if I can do it. I already have my letter, and now is a perfect time. I'm alone in my house with the rest of my entire family are a plane ride away. Part of my problem is that I don't want to talk to them face to face. I almost feel embarrassed about it all. Or maybe shame would be a better word. 

I have a good idea of how they'd react, but I'm still scared. I feel like they're going to think that they're losing their only son, and they won't support me. I need their support. I have no one else. No friends, no outside relatives, nothing. 

I've taken my emergency anti-anxiety medication today, but I'm still too nervous to hit send on the email. I know that I'm not in any danger or at risk of being kicked out--our family is a pretty progressive/liberal household, and they've told me that they'd be fine if I were gay. 

(That's a whole other thing. I buy asian cosmetics to use, but since that's all stereotypically feminine, I sometimes get jokes at my expense. My mother has said before that she wishes I'd just come out already. Funny thing is, I am gay but not in the way she'd expect.) 

I don't know what to do. I'm afraid that I won't be taken seriously and it'll become something we all ignore. I mean, I'm not going to push hard at all l for anything but the medications I need. I don't even care if they call me a he until I'm physically a she. Or something like that. 

I've got major body image issues. For the longest time, I couldn't figure out why I hated myself so much. This has been going on for years, at least since I was 10. Because of that, I let myself go and I'm massively overweight. I've made progress and lost 30 pounds so far, but I'm still a long way away. 

I don't know if any of this makes sense. I'm not sure if I make sense inside my own head. I just wish it could all be over. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing? What's wrong with me? What if it goes wrong? Am I making a mistake?

Edit: I sent my letter. I feel a little sick right now, and I think the waiting game is going to be the hardest to play. Thank you to everyone here who spent the time to make me feel better. For better or worse, whatever the outcome may be, I'm so thankful for the love and support everyone showed to me here &lt;3

Edit 2: It took a while, but my mom took it extremely well! It seems like I didn't do a very good job hiding since she pretty much already knew and has no problem whatsoever. We didn't get a chance to talk because she's busy taking care of my younger sisters right now, but she promised a chance later. 

I'm honestly blown away right now. I never expected it to turn out like this at all. I was so nervous this morning when I started this process, but you all made me feel so welcome and opened up about yourselves, I don't even know what to say that would adequate. All I can do is say thank you again, and hope that you all can understand just how wonderful you are. "

Patricia_W,asktransgender,"I was thinking about coming out at university, but another MTF girl was faster. Some questions.","A few days ago a friend of me, lets call her Tom (yes, a male name but she still wants to be refered by her old male name) dressed up female and came to class, telling us about how she felt like a girl for almost ten years. I heard of no bad reactions and some nice girls gave her some help cause her makeup and fashionstyle is that of a beginner. While that I'm not out in university and presenting male there.

She was always an outsider, even when she was looking like a cisgender male, but now she seems to find a few friends. Tom also has asperger and therefore no clue of social life and like no social intelligence. I hate to say this but it is just true, as a friend I had and have to explain her things about really basic social education and she just have no *feel* for this. So I think about giving her help in this cause women (at least these ones I know) tend to be even more subtile in social interaction and I fear that Tom won't understand them. Tom has an IQ of like 150 but no clue how society works.

I'm not sure if I should ask her out about the following reactions of others about her transiness. Should I ask some? It would me help to hear how other people react for maybe coming out myself.

Also is it selfish to be thankful that somebody else is testing the ground and maybe taking shit, explaining the whole transgender-issue to others? I already planned to wait until I pass with coming out there (already out everywhere at university, but I was bullied in school so I don't trust people of my age - bad but true). I don't want to let it look like some silly trend to come out as MTF.

Should I speak with Tom about her name? She still looks male from her body and if she introduce herself as Tom everybody (or almost, eycept me) will refer to her with male pronouns and think of her as a male crossdresser cause male name. 

Also if I decide to NOT came out jet, how can I ask her these things without looking like an insider? I fear that I will reveal my transiness with talking much to her.

Sorry for maybe some silly questions, but I'm just unsure about my whole social life there.

Best Regards,
Patricia :)

ZelkyZo,asktransgender,Crisis; need help,"I thought I was seeing my endo today for my 6 month check up.  I verified the date and time so I had everything right.  I arrived only to find out there wasn't even an appointment scheduled.  I don't know how this could've happened but I ended up having to reschedule a month from now which by then I'll run out of refills for my prescriptions.

First I get my spiro dose reduced, then I discover my T is back where it used to be after 3 months of nothing, and now I discover the appointment never even got scheduled unbeknownst to me.

This is fucking stupid.  I feel like life itself is trying to do everything possible to kill me.  I don't know how anyone can live like this.  It's an insult to even call this living.  I was already prepared for the worst case scenario but I never even imagined something like this could happen.  I'm going to run out of hormones while I was supposed to see this endo that keeps me on an incredibly low dose of HRT expecting things to work out nicely while my T just swings back to where it was when I was told no such thing happened.  All of this when I see virtually everyone around me starting at doses twice mine or ending up there after 3 or 6 months.  My guess is that I should find a new endo who won't forget fucking appointments or maybe go DIY or IC (I'd have to take a 2 hr drive to Chicago for that but at this rate I might not have a choice).  This is so much bullshit.  I don't know what to do anymore.

All of this just makes me want to give up.  I've tried every damn thing I could to enjoy life and it *never* works out.  I'm unemployed, I'm disabled so I can't work anyway, I have no true friends, I've never had an intimate relationship with anyone, I can't afford an education, and I certainly can't afford corrective procedures like FFS or BA that would go a long way to resolving my crippling circumstances.  Except at this point I bet that would go wrong too.  My family is dirt broke too so they can't help me with anything and my wealthy relatives probably won't give a damn, not like they should spend their hard earned cash on a worthless shit like me anyway.  At this rate it would just be a fucking waste.  I feel as if I'm being punished for wanting to find even the slightest bit of enjoyment out of life.  I don't even know why I'm still alive.  I should've offed myself years ago.  The only thing I have going for me is that my family doesn't despise me, but that doesn't really mean much when I feel the whole world loathes my very existence.  Not just society but it's as if the very air I breathe, the very water I drink, the very food I eat, and the very body I live in are all screaming at me to die.  This is torture.

Sorry for the rant.  I'm very upset."
SiberianTora,asktransgender,New to living with a person just starting their journey. Any suggestions on how best to live together?,"Moved in with a friend of many years.  Now, 6 months into living here, he comes out as trans (Mid-Thirties MtF) and is going to start expressing around the house.  We're expecting clothes, forms, accessories, make-up, etc in the coming days.

I'm fully supportive of his choices, and plan to adapt as best as I'm able.  I'm also concerned since I have absolutely no clue how any of this works and I have very little perspective I can offer when questions are asked of me.  

It's his lease and he's lived here for years; yet I can't help but feel that the house has been turned on its head and I don't know how to act in my own home anymore.

Alex-is-Alexis,asktransgender,Anyone here have experience with tamoxifen or other SERMs (Breast cancer/gynecomastia drugs)?,"I'm considering attempting to implement this into my HRT regimen, which is currently just estradiol and spironolactone. The feminizing effects are helping me look super androgynous, but I feel like the breasts aren't something I want.

Biologically tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, which means it affects the estrogen receptor differently in various places of the body. Notably it is an antagonist in the breast, blocking the effects of estrogen and thus inhibiting breast growth.

I haven't heard of many people using this for HRT though, but am very curious if it's possible. If you've ever been on it maybe you could tell me about your experience; it's effects on breasts or any side effects you noticed?"

She told me that doing it before i was 18 was not a option because the wait list is so long. Getting your evaluation can take up to about a year. So now i feel this extreme anxiety of not being passable because i can notice myself rapidly becoming more and more male as i mature. 
Turning 18 feels like i kind of lost. Like i cant transition now. Because i wont be happy with the results, not really sure what to do. I feel really depressed. "
trans-ativity,asktransgender,"Confusion, uncertainty, and relationships","I'm 24 years old, and I've identified as male all my life. But I've never been happy. After a lonely, depressed, self-and-world-hating childhood, I've spent the last five years untangling the knotted, layered ball of depression, anxiety, and sexuality that's been inside of me. I started smoking pot and lost my anxiety, I discovered I was bisexual, lost my virginity, explored my sexuality, fell in love with a man. My depression faded. 

But over the past few months I've felt something else that I still haven't resolved. It sat stewing in the back of my mind, but I didn't have time to deal with it, as I was dealing with school, unemployment, potential homelessness, my boyfriend's homophobic family, and other shit. But now that things are stable and I've found my footing I can actually sit down and think it through.

I feel like I want to be a woman.

But I don't know if this makes me trans, or genderqueer, or just confused. I hate my body, but I don't hate being male. I wish I had a pussy instead of a dick, but I don't know if I could ever do SRS. Sometimes I feel like I want to be a woman more than anything, and other times I feel like I'm just making it up, or it's a symptom of some other psychological problem. I look in the mirror and I look OK, but I don't look like me. But I don't know what I want to look like. I imagine myself with a female body, and I'm happier. I guess that's gender euphoria?

The worst is, even though I'm still so unsure of what I want, I ended up coming out to my boyfriend. I'd spent the whole day at work thinking about gender, and my boyfriend could tell something was wrong, and kept asking until I told him about my gender confusion. He wants to be supportive, but he's also freaking out with anxiety about my transition, both HRT and SRS, before I've even figured out what the hell I want to do. And last night he said that he didn't know if he could still be attracted to me if I got bottom surgery, because he felt it would be like sexual cutting--like fucking a wound. That made me freeze up in shock and disgust and... and he immediately apologized profusely and started crying and saying he was worried it would sound transphobic before he said it. And I'm sitting here wondering if I even want to start cross dressing! I'm not mad at him or anything, I'm deeply in love with him and he's a fantastic boyfriend. But it's hard seeing how my confusion affects him.

I'm fortunate enough to have my best friend to talk to. He's an agender trans guy, so he was able to lend some perspective and give advice. He validated that what I feel is real; but still it seems like my experience and my feelings are so different from most trans people, and I don't know anyone gender queer that I can relate to.

I just don't know where I stand or what I want. I'm happier than I've been in a long time, but I still feel like there's something missing, something wrong. Can anyone give me some guidance, or at least some kind words?"

MsPenguinette,asktransgender,I run a support group in the south and the LGBT center wants me to agree to them posting the meeting times on the site... Thoughts?,"Hello.

Im transgender and facilitate a transgender support group in a deep south state (I.e. Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, etc. City of less than 250k. Don't want to be more specific) It is at a LGBT center and is technically their group tho I run it and am in control of it. I run the meetings, unlock and lockup the building, and whatnot. The group use to be it's own thing but then was assimilated on the center, which then I took over. 

So the guy who runs the center started pushing that we should be publishing the groups times. Right now you have to contact the center or get the days/time from someone. There are a lot of ways you can find out, but you can't just Google it and fine out.

His argument is that everything else the place does and all the other groups have their times public and on the website and on their literature and that by not having it public we might be preventing some people from being able to get support. 

Hey is arguing that it makes the group less accessible and since we haven't had any issues of predators showing up to the group since the center took over (we are very open about the group, you literally just have to ask) that it doesn't make sense to keep it as secure. 

Before it was at this place, the person who ran the group required her to meet you before you could find out when and where.

Dude is really nice but gay and not trans, so there's that. I told him what he was saying makes sense but that I disagreed but need time to think it over before letting him know my thoughts.

It makes me uncomfortable. I need help processing this out to myself and need help considering all the different sides of it. Cause right now I'm not anywhere near as conflicted as I think I should be. Right now I'm just feeling, ""no"" but want to be able to give a really thought out opinion. 

Anyone's thought would be appreciated. Thanks!"
megans_alt_account,asktransgender,How can I help my friend?,"So, I have a friend who's transgender. No, this isn't a ""just talking about a friend"" situation here, I know I'm trans myself, but this is an online friend who I've met in an unrelated private community who came out to us all... maybe a month ago? as a transgirl, and felt comfortable doing so because I did. So she's 15 and in the UK therefore still in high school.. and experiences dysphoria much worse than me or the other transwoman in that community combined. She's also got some kind of nasty family history going on... likes her mother a lot but isn't comfortable coming out to her, and the father... not so liked, without going into some personal details about that divorce. But the gist of it is that she tried to come out earlier and they sent her to a therapist which turned out to be 'conversion therapy' basically (IIRC the father is a religious pastor or something), and the father believes it to be some kind of phase caused by watching anime too much or something moronic like that.

Anyway, I'm pretty sensitive and have knee-jerk reactions when it comes to bad parent/child relationships, so I sort of adopted her as my little sister. Not legally or formally, it's just so she has someone to talk to about transgender issues at any time (okay, when we're both online), and I don't believe in any person growing up without a stable family life (probably because I didn't). I figure if nothing else, maybe trying to help out someone in need will help redeem myself for being a piece of shit otherwise, but I am genuinely her friend. It's not creepy! Just caring. I swear. She likes the idea. Maybe a bit too much.

She's come out to her friends in real life as well, apparently they've dressed her up as a maid and did her makeup for her at an anime convention. I don't think they know too much about dysphoria though being cis, so she doesn't talk to them about it I don't think. Or maybe she just likes talking to me more. I dunno. They'll help her with clothes shopping apparently though.

So anyway she's not taking the whole being born with a male body thing too well. Since she's not comfortable transitioning with her parents around, she hasn't attempted to find a way to get HRT or puberty blockers or anything like that at her age, and since apparently the NHS sucks, I don't know if there is a way. But I really hope she does do something. She's recently having suicidal thoughts about trying to be reborn as a cis girl, which worried me a bit. Okay, so it worried me a huge fucking lot, even if she promises she ""won't do it because I don't have the guts"". She gets pretty needy when dysphoria hits, which can be quite often, and I'm not always there to try and calm her down, and I don't even necessarily know how. I'd go so far as to give her a couch to sleep on if she needs to run away, but since I'm in Australia and she's in the UK, that's of course not practical. But I don't know what else to do... this is really bad for her and I really want to help her in any way I can.

But what can I do? What can she do at the moment, living with non-supportive parents and being a minor in the UK?"

fire_of_the_mind,asktransgender,gender and name change procedure has left me feeling powerless and vulnerable.,"i met with my lawyer yesterday, to start the name and gender change process.

it has left me feeling anxious and powerless and vulnerable

The name and gender change process is so invasive and demeaning and leaves me feeling hugely vulnerable. I have to publish notice in a local news paper for THREE WEEKS. it has to include my full male name and my FULL STREET ADDRESS as well as the new female name that i am changing to. this is basically ""HEY WORLD I AM A TRANSSEXUAL YOU HATE TRANSSEXUALS? COME STALK ME OUTSIDE MY APARTMENT AND MURDER ME."" we made a motiont o have the court records sealed and the motion included a stack 1 inch thick of newspaper articles about trans women who have been murdered. 

THEN, as if this wasn't enough, federal law requires that credit report companies keep a list of all previously known aliases. so they will ALWAYS show my male name. so that means that anywhere i work, AT LEAST someone in HR will know my trans status. and i don't trust them not to be gossipy bitches.

you can't ever escape it. they won't let you have dignity. transsexuals don't have a right to privacy. we're exposed for anyone to see.

having my status announced to the world feels really invasive. I hate that. and never being able to escape it is even worse. it is a real danger and can hurt my career and whispers around the office would be awful. the lawyer that is doing my name change is getting clients together that have been victimized in relationships (I fit that criteria with this awful sexual assault that happened 5 years ago) so that she can get the state law change about publishing notice in the local paper. it would delay my name change by at least a year maybe (probably) more. when I didn't want to do this, she heavily implied it was important for the cause and then became terse and hung up immediately after she said goodbye.

the notice thing isn't as important to me (no one reads the paper, and lol who is reading notices for name changes and weddings thank god). and to get this law change, i would have to prostrate in front of the court, airing out my most closely held and personal and vulnerable and stigmatizing secrets (that I'm a transsexual and that I was raped), begging for them to deign to change a law for me. it's an exposing and demeaning process, and it's all public record, with a decent chance of media attention, perhaps even national coverage in some outlets. the process to change the law inflicts the same harm an order of magnitude more powerfully. I'm not going to air the intimate details of my life in court. even if I believed in ""the cause"" and could have my identity withheld from the public record of the proceedings, I still wouldn't do it.

a friend of mine suggested that if someone in HR started revealing confidential information, I could sue. I am doubtful I could sue, and even if I could I wouldn't have many damages to recover. I run into the same problem of revealing myself to the court, plus news that I'm suing the company would spread like wildfire ensuring that those that didn't know now do. and even if that didn't happen, it's not like the court could help me. they can't provide a remedy for the wrong that I would suffer. they can't erase my coworkers memories. any monetary gain is a pittance compared to what I would lose - privacy and dignity (whisper whisper) - and not worth risking losing more of the same. 

it's a double bind, and that's why the situation is so oppressive. Legislation explicitly puts me in a position where I suffer harm. And there's no way to remedy this harm without suffering much more of the same harm. I'm disenfranchised by the letter of the law and the process of the law.

and the mighty out and proud activist transsexual looks down on me for this decision - what an elitist. my private life &gt; politics, and no I don't feel solidarity with you just because we take the same pills.

I don't want to be ""out."" I've had LGB and even T people I know caution me against going ""mostly-stealth"" (?) when I move to either LA or Chicago after graduation. Talking how I will be ""hiding"" and not living ""authentically."" But honestly, if ""trans girl"" was part of my public image, that would feel way worse. I don't want to be differentiated from other females. People gendering me correctly as female is all I need to live ""authentically."" If I was getting clocked left and right, that would just make me feel bad. 

I don't know how the trans girls that don't pass do it. I have so much empathy for them, but if I don't want to use my talents ""for the cause"" or to be ""out"" then that's my business. The judgment from other LGBT ppl I've gotten on this issue just confirm in my mind that I'm doing the right thing by leaving LGBT advocacy groups for the volunteering I've done. I don't even identify as LGBT anymore tbh. 

LGBT legal and advocacy and charity groups made gay marriage the defining queer civil rights issue for the last 10 years. Gay marriage is way more controversial than housing and discrimination protection. So now, all of the LGB people that live in red states can be discriminated against legally. And trans people are actively criminalized with bathroom bills and other things. The religious right has had gay marriage shoved down its throat so they're taking it out on the most vulnerable queer populations: queer people of color and trans women. The white, upper class gays and lesbians that put all of the effort and coordination and marketing and volunteer support into gay marriage have gotten a specific and arbitrary right that benefits them (because theyre wealthy), doesnt do much for lower class LGB people, and trans people are actively being penalized as a result of the political backlash. Their rights came at the expense of everyone else's rights.

I'm coming to the inexorable conclusion that all political movements are a sham, focused on benefiting upper class people more. I'm done with LGBT"
Rorynne,asktransgender,"I think I might be agender but I really dont know, could I be? Or could i just be doing it all for attention?","Okay, so. i recently had a conversation with my boyfriend about gender that basically consisted of ""well no one really feels gender right? they just follow their gender roles right"" ""no i feel like a dude"" which kind of blew my mind, because i dont really understand how that feels, all my life its been kinda of an act.

I really dont know if i experience dysphoria either. All my life i felt like gender was just an act, like your given this gender and you either accept it and play into it or you dont. And playing the act was always extremely exhausting. I always had to toe the line of acting and dressing girly enough, and still looking androgynous enough to feel comfortable with myself. When ever someone misgendered me i would hate myself intensely for failing the act. I always felt like i was a failure, like i was wrong. And my abusers made sure to remind me of that. But on the other hand, i dont care about my body, as long as i LOOK androgynous im comfortable.

But at the same time i always see people saying things like, if you dont feel dysphoria your cis, or agender people do it for attention, or if you are agender that means you dont want to have genitals, etc etc. and i just dont know. ive been calling myself agender for about a month now, and im happier this way, i finally feel like things fit, i finally have a positive self image about myself. When people call my they i feel happy, i dont like being considered a man or a woman. But then i see things like ""female bodied agender people are usually just cis girls that dont want to call themselves girls"" or ""if you never thought of your gender before then that means your cis, and your just trying to call yourself trans for ""oppression points"""" Ive had people call e a transtrender when i talked to them about it as well and i just.... i really dont know what i am. Im so much happier identifying this way, but then people basically say that im lying and wrong and i just feel horrible. i feel like im constantly going to be stuck in the ""girl"" gender box, because thats where people want me to fit. 

Is it really possible that im just subconsciously doing this all for attention? What is it even like to feel or identify as a gender? Am i just being dumb nad over thinking all of this? i legitimately dont know what to do, i finally find something that makes me feel right and not alone and people push back against it saying im not good enough."

She and I also take the same path to our respective next classes, meaning seeing her even more, and it just makes me want to cry. And I don't know what to do and I hate it and I hate this and I should probably talk to my therapist about this but haha lol its like a week until I see her again. It's just, she actually has curves and the type of curves I wish I had along with various other aesthetic stuff (like how she can actually have short hair and still be feminine, whereas if I cut mine I'd look like any other boy, along with how she always wears flower crowns and i fucking love them and i NEED to get one im just ugh).

silverhairharpy,asktransgender,Is TERF mentality not seen as a problem in other subreddits?,"I've followed a certain subreddit for a while. It's a great community. Really great. But there's been a couple of TERF comments there lately.

Someone else put up a post there complaining about these comments and it was removed. Maybe posting about the problem wasn't the best way to handle it.

The moderators of the subreddit in question removed the post complaining about the TERF mentality and any comments there quoting the TERF comments (even if they didn't include links to the comments or person who left them.)  

But they didn't remove the TERF/transphobic comments themselves in another thread. Comments that compared transitioning to putting on blackface (I apologize for the term but that's basically sums up what the TERF comment said.)

MTF26,asktransgender,How to overcome self-esteem/confidence/sexuality issues?,"Hello AskTG!

So I have a problem that is really having a negative impact on my life and I feel like it's related to being trans (and more specifically being hurt growing up for displaying trans typical behavior).

I almost always get very anxious and reserved when I feel like someone is flirting with me unless I actually have no interest or if the circumstances are such that I can leave immediately. However, if I actually do want to have sex with someone and the situation is ideal for having sex I tend to sort of freeze up, feel awkward and break rapport sort of subconsciously. I used to be way worse, and now I'm fairly comfortable with some types of flirting - but I get awkward when things are moving towards actually touching or trying to make a more overt move.

Sometimes I try to be very direct and essentially ask people if they want to have sex with me or cuddle or kiss or whatever - this usually/almost always doesn't end well and leads to more awkwardness.

I've been rejected a lot growing up and I still think I fear rejection to an unhealthy degree and it's subconsciously destroying my ability to have healthy relationships with people.

Even worse, and perhaps ironically, I'm told I'm attractive quite often (and Im slooowly starting to believe it I guess sort of) - so my pattern of reciprocating flirting with someone I like and then ending up not having sex or even cuddling due to anxiety tends to make people resent me over time. I feel really bad about this and it just leads to me feeling even more anxious about trying to connect with someone.

What's really (in my mind at least) shameful is that I even have this problem with my best friend and ex. We had a sexual relationship for over two years and then, years later, she kinda made moves on me like she wanted to hook up and I felt incredibly weird and awkward about it even though I would have liked to do that with her. It's very frustrating since we used to be so intimate and comfortable.

I even have this problem with other trans girls - who logically I should feel the most safe with. It's really frustrating me and definitely lowers my quality of life and my resistance to stressors. 

I am going to a sex therapist in a few weeks who is also a gender therapist. I'm hoping that will help.

I realize this is not a problem that only trans people have, of course, but I thought maybe people here might have insight or advice since I feel like this problem may be partially due to hating my appearance for so long and other life issues that are somewhat common in mtf trans demographics.

If people don't think this is an appropriate question please feel free to delete it and I may post elsewhere - I'm hesitant to post on /r/sex simply because I feel like people might focus too much or in the wrong ways on my gender.

Thanks!"

I'm very new to this feeling and definitely am in need of some help. So if you could read till the end and lend me some advice, I can't thank you enough!!

My name is Michael and I've been having some weird...not necessarily dreams, but definitely feelings that I'm doing something wrong. I'm currently single and know that i'm interested in girls, but I don't fully know how I feel about them. When I'm not at work I am a freelance artist who's still trying to find my art style. For my current project i'm searching up a lot of different style clothed females and make-up and strangely feel very jealous of how they look.

The way girls creatively make use of their Hair and Make-up is absolutely fascinating to me. Unfortunately when I try to grow my hair out it just comes out Thick and Curly so I've never fully experimented before, however I'm honestly tempted to give Make-up a solid go. This is going to sound crazy, but the other day I took a selfie with Snapchat and played with the filters. I came across a goth one that shades around your nose, adds longer/blacker eyelashes and lipstick. I won't lie, I saved the image and have looked at it on and off over the past week. I like it. I genuinely and emotionally really like it, if that even makes sense. Haha...

I've never been manly and I've never really wanted to be. I certainly have some weight on me but while my mates lift and try to build their form, I'm only wanting to slim down with cardio and find the person under the weight to be happy with. I'm still a virgin because I simply have no desire to have any sex so I don't want a relationship... however, at the same time I don't know if it's just my minds' way of saying I'm really not sure what I want and that's why I don't try. I'm really sorry, I really don't know what I'm saying but I hope I can get something from this community :)

Simply put - I want to say I'm a Transgender. I want to believe I've found the side of me I'm actually sure of. It even sounds right. However I'm so shocked by this and have SO MANY QUESTIONS! I'm just scared.

I can't wait to hear back from all of you lovely people :).

Vegetal_Headwear,asktransgender,Have you ever discovered someone wasn't as tolerant or supportive as you originally thought?,"This is sort of long rant post, I'm sorry! I just want to know if anybody else has experienced tolerance and support revoked before, especially by loved ones. 

My best friend was the first person I ever came out to as transgender. She was heavily religious at the time, so she was apphrensive, but soon grew to support me, calling me my preferred pronoun and name. She even told me she was trying to convince her mom to call me by my preferred name! 

While she did have some upsets, (like telling my boyfriend; ""woah! I never would have guessed that you weren't actually a guy!"" or asking for his real name), all seemed good and well. 

That is....until she had some guy (25) move in with her (19) that she had been dating for a week. It started off with her telling me how *hard* it was for her, explaining that I was trans, but luckily her boyfriend had no problem with me being her friend because  I don't have a dick. (Lucky me.)

When I voiced my concerns about her moving in with someone so soon, she blew. Up. She very angrily told me that she was doing all this hard work, supporting me, and was hurt that I couldn't do the same. We stopped talking for a while. 

3 weeks later, she gave me good news! Her boyfriend had proposed to her! Having learned my lesson the first time, I wished her good luck.  I didn't want to lose my friend. 

I thought things were good between us. I had accepted that she's just dumb, and that when she messaged me a picture of the dress she was wearing for the wedding, (A hot topic dress. A short hot topic emo dress.)

From there it escalated. When I made my concerns known about not wanting to be a third wheel, and wanting to hang out with *just* her, she started talking about, (using my real name, no less) ""no silly, you can't be a third wheel, because me and him are *one.""*

She went on to explain that ""when two people make love, they become one."" I told her I was uncomfortable, and she dropped it reluctantly. 
 
This morning I woke up to find she had sent me two pictures, one of her with a ""little"" tattoo, and her boyfriend with a ""daddy"" tattoo. I'm kinky as the next guy, but I was straight up grossed out by the implications of her dependancy, the rushed relationship, and the age difference. I told her that I was VERY uncomfortable by intimate details of their lifestyle, and to not be privy to such details. She proceeded to send [this](https://imgur.com/M2nH4IW) and blocked me. 

I've lost my best friend, and found out she considers my gender identity issues something that can be held over my head. (Not to mention my poly relationship.) 

Sorry this got so long! I'd love to know if anybody else has found someone's tolerance and support revoked before, and what happened/how you dealt with this."
Amelia_ApA,asktransgender,Trying to figure something out,"TL;DR how can I politely ask people to use my name/pronouns outside of talkin to me?

Hey boys and girls just have a quick question for you,

So I've been spending the past week or two comi out to the extended family and friends. While some people were able to make the switch immediately, others are lagging behind. Now I have no problem giving people the time they need to adress, what I'm wondering though is how I might be able to help the process. See I get the feeling is that those who are having trouble making the change are *only using my name and pronouns when talking to me* then just reverting when I'm not around.

Is their anyway to approach this gently, or is it better to be straight up? Just wondering what your guys experience may have been.

Demicorn,asktransgender,So this is what it feels like to accidentally out oneself?,"So I'm working with a professor on a creative writing (my minor in college) project. I've generally limited myself to one work of trans something or another per semester, per class (one trans poem in my poetry class, one short story with a trans protagonist in my fiction workshop, etc.), so as to not make it *too* obvious.

I recently decided to go ahead and write a second story involving a transgender protagonist for this professor (because I couldn't help myself :P), and, just for fun, I chose to sign it using the name I've been considering, with the full intention of changing it back before I sent the story to her.

Guess what I forgot to do.

Maybe she won't notice (her being a teacher who always emphasizes the importance of closely reading and paying attention to every word and the meaning behind it)? ...Yeah, I expect to get a replay email soon or to be pulled aside after my next class with her. On the bright side, she's one of the first people I was thinking of informing anyway.

Still, *facepalm.*

gawsharon,asktransgender,My father-in-law came out as a trans woman yesterday. How do we support him?,"To say the least, I am shocked. My FIL was a very masculine man who loved several sports, cars, fishing, lots of beer, girls...every stereotypical male thing you could think of. He was even a bit bigoted towards the LGBT community in the past - to the point where he has harassed my ex in the past for not being into more masculine hobbies. It is so beyond what I ever expected and I'd really like some insight. It is terrible to say this, but I even feel like I doubt it considering his past actions. 

But nonetheless, I want to go forward by taking his word for it. My ex is taking this very hard in particular. His parents' marriage is definitely over, and he is worried about how our daughter (2.5) will begin to understand all of this. 

How do we, as non-LGBT people, begin to support him? Can we shake the feelings of doubt?

I hope I was not insensitive in any way. I am still not sure how to process this. "

SL33PY_K8,asktransgender,MTF post coming out. Family took it very badly.,"Hey everyone! I'm a 21 yo Mtf trans. I was 18 when I wrote my coming out letter to my mother about feeling transgendered. She took it badly as expected (she's a straight-edge Christian, along with the rest of my family) and said ""i still love you but you're sick, and we need to find the help you need so you can live with this."" I went to a gender psychiatrist but became frustrated with the conversations on my depression because I had already discussed it with another psych for a year prior. But already knowing how my mom felt about having an abomination of an offspring I waited until my psych decided to medicate me for depression instead of talking about my pressing matter then I would stop going and start that bs depression med. I soon started college for my associates in physics, where I met my best female friend who supported me. She dressed me, did my make up, and did my first ear piercings. It was wonderful. I romped around campus with my stiletto heels and the works, but soon became extremely angry with myself and snapped just at the thought of what my family and mother would think of me. I Started drinking and cutting again, but even more destructively, I shunned Kate (my feminine self)... since then I dressed a few times only to feel like I dishonored my mom and family. I started working out and getting extremely strong. I started landscaping and recently began doing mechanic work and keeping my monsterous muscles. Anyways, to date I dress and do my makeup never going out but come out to every single friend, but when I remember my family I break and masculinization myself an any way possible. my disphoria and depression don't always bother me though. But when it does I just loose sight of who I am and find myself in situations I don't like. Like now. I get home from work full of testosterone, grease from head to toe, and overworked muscles and am trying to grow a beard with minoxidil and other supplements (can't grow any facial hair!) so I feel like I'm content making a lot of money and being a manly man. But then I dress up and remember Kate and just utterly breakdown and cry. cut my arms up and Drink myself to sleep. But now I'm so conditioned with this life, I'm not sure i could transition just living my own life away from my family, or just keep losing bits of myself until I breathe my last. (Sounds dramatic, I know but I'm just trying to emphasize the difficuly of the situation I'm in).

 So what I guess I'm asking is are there any similar experiences? Or what do you make of this? I'm just so lost and alone I don't know what to do with myself.

Lizasaurus2,asktransgender,How long do you have to be off HRT to produce sperm again?,"Hey everyone. So even though having kids will probably be something I do in my 30s, I still have to make some decisions now about how that's going to happen.

Unfortunately pre-HRT I was an idiot and didn't bank sperm. I think I just wanted to get on HRT and saw banking as an obstacle. I'm sort of regretting that now. I want to keep my options open. So even though I might not use the sperm and opt for adoption instead I'd like to still have it there.

With that in mind, roughly how long do you have to wait before you start producing viable sperm again? The amount of time it takes will probably help me make up my mind.

On top of that, it'll probably get my dad off my back. He's been really bothering me about being infertile recently...

Thanks in advance.

edit: I'll likely be seeing my endo asap about this as well."
TallAubrey,asktransgender,So many questions...fears,"This will be a wall of text because I have so many things in my head that i could do with discussing with someone, everyone, anyone. also a cross post, was suggested I post this here for some more response.

I've been attracted to transgender girls since my teens..I'm 31 now, I'm 6.8ft tall too. I never asked my self if I wanted to be a girl because I could never see past the guy in the mirror. In the spirits of honesty, I have slept with a nightstand full of Cypro, depo-provera and estrogen, plus fincar for over 5 years now.
I often feel my nature goes against my build, I'd rather be more submissive in bed, I hate being on top, I love being held by the wrists and kissed on the neck. When I shower I look down and wish I had a female body so much. Strangely I'm not too bothered about the D, I could do with loosing it's two little friends, they drive me nuts but the D could stay, I just don't want to use it.

So after 3 years of a friend telling me to go to the GP and get a referral to the GIC (uk), I have, I'm just not happy being a guy anymore. I'm waiting for the referral to the local psychiatrist, I'm not planning on taking the NHS route rather private, tbh I don't think I could ever get past the RLE without being on HRT. I have never dressed as a girl because I don't want to look like a guy in girls clothes, that's now how I feel inside and I want to see the person inside in the mirror, anything else just makes me feel awful.

I'm worried about being the tallest trans girl in the UK, I'm scared about how I'd find clothes, how I'd get shoes, size 14 guys feet is really going to happen. I want to wear louboutins, they make them custom in Paris for 3500, would they do that for guys feet or just say no? Money isn't the big issue, I can afford to do this and do the surgery private, I am really worried this is going to affect my career or ability to get hired as a contractor.
I've sort of resigned my self to you will never pass because you're so tall, I could live with that if I was at least pretty. I went to MAC with my girlfriend the yesterday, it was so busy, It was awful being my height and guy in there, all I could think was how the hell am I going to do this as a girl and I don't think I'm ever going to be able to shop alone again.

In all honesty the only reason I haven't started DIY HRT again is because I need to save some swimmers just In case I decide to have kids. I can feel it when my T is high, it makes me aggressive and angry and I really don't like it when it happens, usually going back to the gym it spikes.

I've already tried the gym route, getting big and lean and it didn't help me feel any better about my self other than healthier, I still wanted to have a girls body. I have days where sometimes I can see a way forward and then moments or days where I just think why am I even considering this, should I just go back the gym and do anything to forget about this like I've been doing since my 20's literally if you are me, any other answer other than being transgender feels often like a better option than being a 6.8ft girl with size 14 feet. :(

Sorry for the wall, thoughts on a post card, be as harsh as you need to I'm a realist not a fantasist, I fully expect to get shouted at across the street by urban youths if I go down this road."
CeciliaMemorabilia,asktransgender,"So I pretty sure my aunts son is transgender, what should I do?","So I have family who live across the country and my mom went to visit them and informed them that I was transgender and was transitioning.

Where she replied yes of course and her son just said ""that's not fair I want to do that"" 

And yea my mom told me that today and idk what to think, like should I inform them about letting him/her explore their interest and gender or should I just like let things run their course? I know she's probably rather open to letting them explore their gender but Im not sure the husband would be as receptive. 

Idk I feel like I should say somthing but we don't talk and it's not really my place to step in and tell them how to raise their children (unless of course I knew they were denying that option of exploration) so yea idk what should I do?"

When did breast growth stop for you ladies? I am so happy with the changes but sad at the same time. This is the best im going to get without spending 20 to 30k on ffs and breast augmentation.

ahugeminecrafter,asktransgender,Should I bank sperm? (NSFW),"Hi everyone, I just started hormones 4/22/2016 and up until now have not banked sperm. My reasons have been:

1. I wanted to start hormones as soon as possible, and didn't want to wait until after banking
2. Now that I have started hormones, I don't want to go off them
3. I don't want to pay what could easily cost in the thousands of dollars

I have been having some doubts though. If I ended up marrying a woman I may regret not banking. I don't know if I will end up marrying a man or woman though. I definitely notice women more than men, but I don't want to have sex with a woman. The only thing that appeals to me sexually is having sex with a woman as a man. I like the idea of living with a man a bit more than living with a woman.

With that said, I currently am more comfortable with the idea of kissing a woman than a man.  I am not sure if this is because I still see myself as a guy or of its just an inherent part of who I am attracted to.

If I ended up marrying a woman, and we wanted to have kids, I kind of would like them to be biologically mine. If I married a man, I am totally ok with adopting if we wanted kids.

I'm just unsure if it is worth spending the money and banking when I don't know if I will even be able to put it to use. Even assuming I marry a woman, she might not be able to have kids, might not want kids, or might already have them, or it might not even work. I also don't want to go off hormones now that I have started. 

So from the details/info I provided, does anyone have any opinions or insight?

Thanks!"

VickyInHiding,asktransgender,How Do I Know I'm a Trans Woman?,"I don't know if any of this makes sense, and I think I maybe just be trying to organize my thoughts and feelings... But I'm 33 years old, married with 3 kids (6yrs, 4yrs, 1yr), and I don't know if I'm a trans woman or just dysfunctional in some way. I've been seriously considering the possibility for a couple of years now, but I can remember having thoughts about wanting to be a girl as far back as grade school. (My being a girl stuck in a man's body is almost a running joke with some of my long-time friends.) I imagine having a feminine body, especially breasts, pretty consistently; I rarely think about my penis (or my beard). In high school I snuck my sister's bikini and modeled myself as a girl in the mirror. When I play D&amp;D or MMO's, I almost exclusively choose a female avatar or persona. I've always gotten along better with girls than with boys. The best sex I can remember is why I told my wife about these feelings and had her call me Vicky while we fucked. I've been in therapy (for depression) and marriage counseling over the last few years and apparently have a lot of preferences and needs that are more typical of women then men.

Does it matter if I'm attracted to women? Does it matter if I don't want to transition? (I don't *think* I want to transition.) Does it matter if I enjoy PIV sex? Does it matter if I have no desire to be penetrated anally?

Sorry, I don't really know what I'm doing."
NickyB8355,asktransgender,So... what next?,"I posted on here at the end of [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4ey7xb/when_to_discuss_with_a_spouse/) , seeking advice on when to tell a spouse that I'd been struggling with gender issues and wanted to speak to a counsellor. Thank you to everyone who nudged me to be up-front and tell her what was going on, even if I didn't understand it myself yet. It was, for me and for my wife, the right thing to do. She has been unbelievably supportive. I don't know for certain where this road will lead for either of us but I will never be able to thank her enough for the love and understanding she has shown me already. 

As the dust begins to settle on that initial reveal, though, I find myself feeling decidedly lost. In the last 24 hours alone, my thoughts have travelled everywhere from 'Gosh, now that's out in the open I don't know if I even still feel any dysphoria at all' through to 'I wish I could start transition today'. Clearly, what I need to do next is speak to the counsellor, which happily I have booked in. 

But how do I manage all these (often conflicting) thoughts until that first session, or even between meetings once they start? I feel like my brain is in constant churn right now, just throwing out ideas and feelings so fast that I don't even know what to ignore and what to hold onto.

S-FrTb,asktransgender,"Better do something, maybe... Suicide?","I don't have anyone to open up, I hope you read it all...

I can't think of anything to do besides crying and typing these lines.

Just not enough... Whatever I do, won't be enough. I don't want to discourage you all but it's the truth.

**I will never be like them.** Never, like a **cis-gender** female.

Some background, 16, MtF. Fetishing and masturbating to the thought of being a woman since alive! Have a female mind, characteristics... Maybe that's why I don't have any male friends. Like the hate between dogs and cats. They just don't like me, but I guess they would like me, If I was ""fully"" female.

So, questioning. I've had a girlfriend, I liked her, even though she didn't know that I was actually female, she helped me killing that female myself. Weird, sometimes I'm %100 sure that I am transsexual... But the truth must be that I am not. I got many erections, from kissing her, touching her, (no more details). I'm hesitant. If I got an erection from a relationship with a girl I really like/maybe loved, doesn't that mean that I'm not transsexual? I remember the first time, finding this term ""Transsexual"", I was like, ""Fuck, this is what I am.."".

I want to be fully sure to start finding solutions. This is where everything gets fucked up. Today, a girl looked at me like I'm the most handsome boy she has ever seen. That was nice, that made me feeling ashamed of my transsexual thoughts, of my inner self. Besides, I still can't take my eyes away when I see a very beatiful girl. To be honest, I don't think, that I would like to have sex with a girl. I'm the girl I guess, when it comes to ""bed"".

I really can't think about marrying a dude. It's like, my ultimate life goal is finding the perfect female and marrying. (Warning: edgy teen here) Maybe, all those thoughts that are imposed upon me by the capitalist world, and my idiotic culture caused this. Find a job, find a mate, reproduce, die, and since I'm a boy, the thoughts that has been imposed on me was find a ""female mate""... How can I get rid of this? I can't think about marrying a dude. I would love to be someone's (that someone is a male) girlfriend... Have romance, love. That would be great, but, If I ever find the perfect female I've been dreaming of, I would be very ashamed of being someone's girlfriend... I actually can masturbate to marrying a dude, that is like, number one arousal for me, being my husband's wife, but that is just arousal. Like all of my transsexual thoughts.

As you can see, I can't identify my ""gender"" somehow. Let's assume that I am %100 transsexual, and will never be regretfull about transitioning. This is the second part, now is where everything gets fucked up. I guess I'm around 5'9"", 180-179 cm. That is not a female high (English is not my native language, I couldn't choose which word I should use.. so, sorry). I have wide shoulders relatively to my hips. I'm not sure my hips are going to widen up enough, like real female's. Even though I have very small feet for my high and relatively to other males that are same age and same high with me. My feet aren't small enough for a real female. Hands, yeah, I think they are kinda okay. What about voice? I've searcing and find no fucking usefull stuff for a female voice, is there a surgery for that? I bet it is expensive... These are main issues. 

I wish I was born a female. Something I say to myself, since I learned to talk/think.

So, fuck all of the above. Let's assume, none of the things above (high, feet, hands, voice) matters. This is the third part where everything gets **REALLY** fucked up. **We don't have the fucking money to do it**. HRT, SRT, shit like that. We don't have the fucking money. Just, fuck this world, I doubt there is a god, but, if so, why? Why me? I don't even know if I am %100 transgender... If I am, I don't have money. Today I try to shave my legs, I have fucking razor bumps, or whatever the fuck they call that litte red things... I have a lot of hair on my body, so let's count in the laser hair removal... Here goes another 10000 TL, 3500 USD (Sounds cheap in your country...). No money, again.

Well, shit. Even if we have the money, I would never come out to my dad (mother's dead). He wouldn't kill me, he would still love me, but he would never let me do it. Because of the fucking culture... He'd be ashamed, so would I. Now that I think of, maybe he would try to kick me out of the house, even worse, kill me.

**What to do to get rid of these terrible dilemmas, that depression?**

Ending it all, would be a lot easier. That really seems like a logical option to me. Think, imagine, jumping from a 20 floor high building, instant death..."

Hey, so, a little background info about me: I'm 24, was 22 when I started hormones, and they've been a massive success. I'm so happy with it and I could not imagine my life any other way. 

When I started hormones I was a LOT different- 190 lbs, pseudo body builder, pack a day newports, timbs, working temp jobs, thuggin it type of deal. Now, I've lost 50 lbs, stopped smoking. started doing skincare- skin has softened immensely, I look younger, my hair's long, waist is like 26 inches and I grew friggin DD's! (which I did not even think was possible!). I also somehow even lost an inch or two of height (from 5'10 or 11 to 5'9 on the dot) and went down from a women's 11 to a women's 10. (magical and impossible sounding 2 years ago but just some background info that's somewhat besides the point)

Here's a couple pics so you can see the change I'm talking about: http://imgur.com/a/7IIGo

So anyways, now that I've accepted that I like feminine sorts of things and I'm almost exclusively attracted to guys (girls are cute in that ""hmm... I wonder"" type of way but nowhere nearly as attractive as before?)... it's started freaking me out. The way they look at me like a cute little thing, dress me up in sexy outfits and fuck me and are all, yaknow, dominant... The fact that I LIKE being submissive like that.. I LOVE being cutesy and girly in bed like that. I can't even ""get it up"" anymore because of how soft in between my legs has become; I rub instead. It's just. SUCH a head trip, to the point that I have panic attacks over it on repeat almost every day. From going from mean mugging bus stop dude in a wifebeater getting in fights and rolling with crews to babetastic adorable girly hipster artist type of vibe... It's like... ""Wait.. wait wait wait.. I'm a girl? And I actually LIKE.. doing... this sorta stuff? What the fuck??!""

No matter how happy I am with my body and my voice and style and how I present myself, I cannot get over how crazy the perspective shift has been no matter how much I talk to my therapist about it. It's always a brick wall and a hamster wheel over and over.

Is there anyone who's had experience with feeling this way or any suggestions for how to handle how overwhelming this is?

newly_me,asktransgender,"Medication reaction, having to quit HRT and praying for things to get better. How can I cope?","Heh, everything is so screwed up for me right now, and if anyone has any tips that have gotten them through awful times, please help. I've never felt so desperate or trapped, but I'll do anything to hang on a bit longer: your words mean the world to me.

 I started HRT and my transition on 3/3/15. Everything was legitimately looking up in my life, I was so happy with all the changes. At the recommendation of my therapist I tried a medication to help with related anxiety, and I've had a terrible reaction. I took the medication for 6 days then quit due to a rash and terrible confusion, but my health is declined steadily and rapidly ever since.

In the past 8 weeks, I've had debilitating arthritis develop, sores on my scalp with losing 3/4 of my hair. My breasts have shrunk back to where they were at the 2-3 month mark, and due to the circulatory &amp; kidney problems that have developed (hands turned blue/numb), I had to quit HRT 2 weeks ago.

I have no fucking idea what to do. I've always been in such great health, and I've had such a rapid decline in my appearance/health/transition all at once, I don't even know where to begin. It feels like someone found the key to break me as a human being. Not only do I not get to be the person I want to be right now, I'm having to fight the medical system not to brush off everything as hormonal too.

I feel so broken in every way now. I've lost, so quickly, so many of the few points of pride I had in myself. Every hope and dream that I have feels threatened or crushed, and I have to deal with the deepest depression and life crisis transposed against how freaking elated I was just two months ago. It's salt in the wounds when my mom and dad say they can't see a difference in appearance, when they couldn't even see a difference when people in public were 'Maam'ing' me. 

Any words that may have helped you through a difficult journey, or just words of support, would mean so much. Thanks :) ~Kayla

Next day I figure out through sheer power of wit that he told other people that I knew through the internet, and people I wasn't ready to tell yet. My roommate is supposed to be a close friend of mine. I also figure out that there was some making fun of me going on.

Again, conservative, bigot male. Trump supporter.

I confronted him on it, and he got upset about the way I found it out. He called me mentally ill. This REALLY hurt, but I didn't act on it. I got really depressed during the day, but I picked up relatively quickly.

We didn't talk for 2 weeks, and then we joked with each other about some stuff over text, and talked in real life about not having problems with each other. I was happy that we were picking up.

I didn't feel comfortable presenting in front of him, and really wanted to make bigger changes. I proposed to cover his part of the rent if he moved out, and proposed a little bit more as incentive to move out, as our lease agreement is a very rare find in our area. He agreed, and moved out last weekend.

I've been becoming more effeminate, and generally, I didn't get any bad results at all. Everyone is mostly friendly. 

Tonight, as I was sitting at Starbucks, looking a LOT like just an effeminate guy with earrings and slightly long hair, I got harassed by a homeless person who was sitting across from me. This happened 2 hours after both of us sitting there. I responded well and didn't back off, but I naturally felt bad for an hour or two, thinking that this had to do with my more femme look. He asked to fight me, reluctantly, but I avoided it.

I got nothing like this from anyone else.

I went home, and got an idea. This was a random thought that came to me

Again, I have to keep in touch with this ""friend"". Our interactions lately have been extremely shallow (just focusing on the business aspects of things), and I'm sorry that I lost a friend. Though now that I look back, he's never been a real friend, and he really struggles with emotional connections in general.

My idea was to look at his posts on an internet site that he frequents, around the time that I've come out to him. It's a rather conservative site... I knew that I'd only find pain, if I ever found anything, but I've always been the kind of person to take the red pill rather than the blue one. 

I've found posts ridiculing me. Saying, again, that he thinks I'm ""mentally ill"" and that he hopes ""he's not on my bang list"". That I'm going to be ugly because I'm ""6'5"""", which I'm not. I'm 6'2"".

There were one or two people telling him to get over it - but the majority was going along and making fun of the whole ordeal, contributing to the ridicule.

I just sat there and couldn't move. I've never had to deal with this before. I've been kind of depressed because I'm in a foreign country and I don't have many friends (mainly because I never fit in cis-male American groups), and because this whole loss of privilege is extremely depressing.

I've been doing very well, otherwise. Most days I'm cheerful. I've come to accept myself, and that's helped a lot. I talk to my mother every day, and have friends back home and in another city that I've lived in the U.S. that I'm in contact with through social media. I have a couple friends in this city (a major US city, red state), and they don't know I'm trans, and I see them once every few days as well.

But this experience completely ruined me. Why do people say these things about me? What have I ever done to them? Why am I labeled ""mentally ill"" when I am so much more capable intellectually than these people? I've felt this way my whole life, and am finally feeling some happiness and alignment with my body. I had my fist IC HRT appointment today after 6 months of therapy, and I felt very encouraged.

But is this what's going to happen? I feel like I'm asking for too much from this primitive society of barely developed monkeys. I will be discriminated against for something that isn't my fault at all.

It doesn't matter if I end up ""passable"" or not. Yes, this is a disorder. NO, I AM NOT MENTALLY ILL BECAUSE I WANT TO GET MY DICK ""CHOPPED OFF"". Why are you hurting me? What the fuck did I ever do to you but be nice and understanding?

I don't want to live in a world that's scattered with these people. 

What makes this whole thing worse is removing this person from my life completely will greatly reduce my standards of life. I can't do it for the next 18 months. We barely see each other, but I can't handle this. What if he tries to take advantage of our business situation? What if he scams me because I am mentally ill?

And, just as a sidenote, we aren't dealing drugs or doing anything illegal. I don't want to disclose it here.

I think he also told other people who know me. Without my consent. I keep this a secret from the DEAERST people to my my ENTIRE LIFE, and this person finds the courage to tell people I KNOW without my consent. 

I am extremely depressed. I haven't felt worse in my entire life, and I was raised by a single mother who, at times, had little to put on the table. I don't want these people around me. I've fought SO hard for everything I have in life, and when I want to be finally myself, people like this are going to try to ruin my life because I'm not an aggressive, dominant male. Because in the first trimester of my mother's pregnancy, there were hormonal fuck ups. Because I've never been as masculine as other people, and feel feminine and like a woman.

Why do these people have to make me cry? WHY? What did I ever do to ANYONE but be there in time of need?! 

Other friends who took it well are helpful, but I can feel that they're also slightly ""weirded out"". They're really trying, though, so that's something.

WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THIS WAY? Why couldn't I just be ""normal"" and live a happy life?

Why don't people accept us the way they do LGB people? Why are WE the ""mentally ill""? 

I hate my life. I don't know what to do. I don't want to be abused anymore. I don't want this person to use leverage against me for financial benefit. I don't want discrimination. I just want to live in a world where people accept me. I want nothing more.

I don't know what to do. Please help."

I have never told my parents that I want to transition, because I always feel weird saying that, because I fully grasp what it means. Still, though, I know I want to transition, and all I have to say to my parents is to set up an appointment so that I can get a referral, then I'm started. But I can't.

I kept it together by the skin of my teeth until I was in the shower, listening to Pandora, when suddenly Jimmy Eat World's ""The Middle"" started playing. I had never associated this song with being trans, but it seemed to apply so well to what I was going through at the moment and be exactly what I needed to hear to just let go. I started laughing and crying and everything was ok for a bit.

I recognised a couple recently after thinking back, some of which should have been blindingly obvious (but at the time I dismissed):

* When I was in the end of term performance in front of literal hundreds of parents in Year 7 (so age 11-ish), I took the role of the 'princess' and loved it a little too much. At the time, instead of thinking about it more, it just made me feel guilty.

* From the age of 12 onwards, I was actively looking for 'gender-swapping' manga. My favourite from around this period was 'No Bra', in which I related to one of the main characters (who comes out as trans by the end of the series) so much that it made me cry. Still, obviously I wasn't *actually* trans...

* This one's a little more obvious to the point of being painful to remember, but I bought women's clothes from a shop with the sole purpose of just wanting to wear them so much. After being disgusted by how validated and incredible they made me feel, of course I decided that it was just a fetish, a decision I'm sure didn't end up coming back to haunt me in any way...

* My chosen name - Laura - is the name I've been using in video-games for years and years now. It's weird to think about just how long I've been doing this because it feels like I started only recently, but by looking through the times of the games I remember doing this for were released, I've been doing this since I was 11, too."
JohnnyisaStar,asktransgender,Has media helped you realize you are Trans?,"Is it common to realize you are transgender through media? Like maybe you watch a show or read a series and suddenly a character makes you realize something about yourself? Is that weird?

The last year and a bit has been a roller coaster as I try to support my wife through her transition. I've been as supportive as I can as I try and navigate through my own depression and anxiety and grief and still it doesn't feel like enough. I've grieved and continue to grieve the loss of my husband of 9yrs and our 10yr anniversary is right around the corner and now I think I'm loosing my wife. She cries alot, I cry alot. We are emotionally exhausted and now. Several months ago I asked if she still loves me. She does but she's not 'in-love' with me. I've become a source of dysphoria for her so we aren't intimate anymore. She has her girlfriends and I have my boyfriend. Which we thought would solve our problem but it's only upped the level of anxiety I think for both of us. 

Can a marriage survive on love alone? Where do we go from here? I don't want to give up, I don't want to walk away but staying hurts because nothing feels like enough.

anceps_singulis,asktransgender,What am I?,"Welp, I'm writing this in the dead of night. All my life I've never really thought much about my gender, it is what it is. Yet in the past few years I've contemplated what life would be like on the other side of the fence as a female. These thoughts tend to come in waves sticking around for a little bit, before receding and coming again later. My life has been far from normal, being as I had a bone marrow transplant when I was ten, wearing hearing aids up until only recently (thanks to surgery,) and so and and so on. With this in mind, I struggle to determine whether or not this is merely a ""phase,"" or if these thoughts and feelings have deeper connotations to them. 

Recently these thoughts have lead me down to contemplating seeing how I'd look if my crotch was concealed (I'm still trying to wrap my head around how gaffs work,) and further thoughts along those lines. I've always enjoyed wearing my hair longer than normal, to the point that my mother jokes about a picture of me when I was younger, calling it a picture of her, ""daughter."" These thoughts have also led me to contemplate seeing how a feminine voice would feel / sound, but I'm more doubtful on that angle due to the fairly strong deaf accent that I possess, (I've been asked if I'm British more times than I care to think.) 

I guess to wrap this long-winded post up; I'm at my wit's end. Chances are regardless of the answers that this may or may not produce, my life will remain unchanged, and I'd probably be okay with that. Yet, I feel like trying to get an outsiders opinion on this would do me some good, and thus I ask, what am I?

imaginaryenemy1,asktransgender,[NSFW] Why can't I orgasm?,"23/MTF/pre-op (probably non-op)/Hormones for a year, just for context. 

So I've recently started having sex again as myself with a new girlfriend and it's been great other than the fact I can't ever seem to cum. I could seriously go for like 3 hours and still not even be close. I'm at a point where it's not necessarily the worst thing in the world if I don't cum during sex because I enjoy everything else about it so much in my new body... but my girlfriend is understandably upset/frustrated that she can't make me cum. 

The problem seems to be that hormones have made my penis quite... desensitized, I guess. It just doesn't feel very good to do stuff like PIV anymore. Oral feels better because she can focus on the more sensitive head, but I want to be able to cum from PIV too. Any idea on what could be preventing me from cumming? It wasn't like this pre-hormones. 

I had a couple of ideas to increase sensitivity and sexual function, just wanted to get some thoughts:

1) I'm going to be getting an apadravya piercing which should drastically increase sensation for me, and be great for her

2) I'm going to make sure my levels are good and my T isn't too low (not sure if that could be the reason?) and also ask my doctor about switching antiandrogens from spiro to bicalutamide since I hear it doesn't impact your sexual function anywhere near to the degree that spiro does, but it's still plenty effective as an AA and has a good safety profile. Plus I'm frankly DONE with the diuretic effect from spiro lol.

NurseAwesome84,asktransgender,Injection dose question.,"So my endocrinologist conceded that in his 15 years of practice he has never seen someone who metabolizes estrogen as quickly as myself.

So I get to be the first person he has ever been willing to prescribe injections too. Started on 10mg every two weeks.


So I have two questions. First, is there some crazy metabolic disorder I don't know about that could be causing my hyper metabolism of estrogen? And second, is that a normal dosage for injection? Sounds low to me :(

TransGirlIcon,asktransgender,"Here's Some Tips for Saving Money on Hormones, Clothes, Makeup, etc","I'm a trans woman so this will focus more on trans women. I'm not wealthy but I do have some money that I was able to build a wardrobe with. I buy most of my makeup from target or sephora and use mainly high end products now but started out with drugstore. 



Cheap places to buy makeup:


Walmart


Target


Kmart


Ulta 


Any drugstore basically


Retailmenot.com for coupons in store and online. This has saved me so much!! Also for Ulta get a membership (free) and you get some birthday freebies and there is a points rewards system. Same for Sephora.





Cheap, fashionable clothing:


Target


Walmart (some stuff)


Forever21


H&amp;M 


Victorias secret (semi annual sale is like 7 panties/$30 or 2 bras/$50) 


Use retailmenot for instore coupons and online





Use ebates to get cashback when shopping online


When buying hormones use GoodRX for a discount. Its AMAZING its saved me $20 on a prescription (vicodin) and finds the lowest price near you. Make sure you show the discount to the pharmacist BEFORE you fill your prescription because I showed it to them when i was getting rung up and they had to refill it. :( lol.

For E, some say 80-150pg/ml is ideal, and others say 100-200 is ideal. Not sure what to think. 

Overall I'm not in a huge hurry, which is why I'm fine with seeing if E alone can knock my T down to Female range. My body changes have been pretty typical based on the timelines I've seen."
Chelseaqix,asktransgender,I fucked up and need advice (dating),"So I met this roommate on craigslist (I know lol) and somehow we started flirting. She sent me some picture of her laying down with her arm over her head that was kind of sexy so I was like ""oh, I see"" and sent her similar back. Eventually, we dropped the BS and started directly hitting on each other.

We went on 2 dates that lasted a total of like *30* hours. We really hit it off... she's great. I've slept over 4 times now. So about 5 dates? (do separate days count as a new date? lol) I can't stop thinking about her and hope she feels the same. I believe she does. Right now she's at work and I'm writing this from her bed. I didn't even go back yesterday and probably won't today (I'm a 2-hour drive away). I'm working on my laptop while she's at work. She'll be home in 5 or so hours. We've slept cuddling up every night.

Here's where I fucked up...

I never told her I was trans. She has no idea. None. She's actually taller than me and we've shared clothes. All my documents are changed and I'm fortunate enough to be very passable. 32 LHR on my face and no surgeries. Very natural look to me but I'm still pre-op. She's definitely bisexual but I don't think she's super open minded. I saw couple posts she put on facebook joking about the bathroom laws in NC and agreeing with them!! ):

Here's when things get bad. She thinks my ex-wife is my ex-husband. She just started assuming this. Most do and I go along with it because I'm stealth and I don't want anyone finding me out. I've gotten very good at just not gendering my ex and letting people believe what they want. This normally isn't a big deal but this is leading towards a romantic relationship.

So that's misleading...

Here's the icing...

I was feeling so bloated (no idea why) and I'm pretty shy about my bowel movements I don't really like being questioned lol... but she asked when my last period was and I looked like a deer in headlights. I just said I don't know and she's like how do you not know and laughs and I go IDKKK then hug her and like ignore that she asked lol

Then...

She asks me randomly how I had my daughter. I blurt out ""natural"" and darted off.

Someone save me from myself.... IDK what to do here... perhaps it's already too late... how do I gently de-escalate this situation? Every time she asks about my ex I feel myself going further into the hole. I have to tell her tonight but I don't know how. I also really wanna cuddle lol ... It's so tempting to give into the temptation of the cuddles and not say something again! Eventually, she's gonna try putting her hand in my pants, though. Then it will be too late. I will be ""the deceiver.""

My friends went out to smoke cigarettes and meet the weed dealer so I stole the bean bag chair that my other friend usally sits in.

I let go and he got up, I smiled at him (he's cute) and he looked really embarrassed. He was really nervous and visibly shaken up by everything. He said he had to go, told me, ""don't tell anyone"" and rushed out as fast as he could.

Also, LOL literally 20 minutes ago he texted my best friend and told her that he didn't want to chill with me anymore because I was coming onto him.

Sveee,asktransgender,How can I get top surgery without my dad physically harming me? (AFAB),"Hello everybody, this is my first post. I'd like to mention that English is not my native language so I apologize in advance if I make any mistakes.



So, from when I was 4 years old up until I was 15 my father was physically abusive to me. Then my parents got divorced and he moved out and that is pretty much the only reason why the abuse stopped. I still see him every once in a while, though (and he doesn't hit me anymore).



The thing is, I'm trans* and I want top surgery and my main, if not only, problem is that I'm scared what my dad will do when/if he finds out. I think that, without a doubt, he will hit me, possibly beat me up, I'm also worried that there is a slight chance of him killing me. As of now he does not know that I am trans* and planning to transition and I want to keep it that way. He doesn't need to know. I'm only out to a couple of close friends and I've hinted to my mom that I might remove my breasts without using the word transgender because I didn't want to freak her out and make her mad. My friends are pretty much supportive, my mom isn't but her opinion doesn't really matter to me, honestly. Anyways, what can I do? I think I have a few options if I want to do this in secret:



1) I could wait until my dad dies. This one sounds kind of horrible and mean and on top of that I would have to wait YEARS, decades even. (I'm 18 right now and I think my dad is 47. He is an alcoholic and a smoker, though. He also loves and participates in all kinds of sports.) I don't know if I can wait that long, my dysphoria is killing me. But I'm going to start binding very soon and I'll see whether that helps in a significant way with my discomfort or not that much. Besides, I still have to save a fuckton of money because it's an expensive procedure and that will most likely take a while.



2) This sounds really stupid and silly but I was thinking that maybe I could have my surgery and then continue to wear a bra and stuff it whenever I have to visit my dad so that it would look as if I still have breasts. Don't know if it would look convincing. I'm quite big-chested. Also, what if I bump into him somewhere unexpectedly? How would I hide my flatness?



3) I could just have the surgery and then when my dad sees me I could say I did it because my chest was causing me too much back pain (which is true, btw and he knows it). Again, this is stupid and I would gladly take your suggestions about what other possible lies I could use. I just feel like this shouldn't be that big of a deal and I want to convince him in that, too. I just have a flat chest now, so what? Let's not dwell on it, haha.



I'll be eagerly awaiting your responses. Any suggestions and ideas about how I can deal with the situation would be very helpful, thank you in advance.

I ask because I, like I'm sure many of you were and are, am in a place where it's not possible for me to transition because of the location and the predominant mindset of the people who live here / those in my day to day life. So I'm faced with the prospect of ""running away"" so to speak to somewhere I can start life anew and begin to transition in surroundings that aren't as harsh and oppressive - looking at the Portland area at this point, since that seems to be where lots of people flock to.

babygirlskunk,asktransgender,Came Out Yesterday To My Manager/Coming Out In General,"Hi everyone. FAABulous, genderqueer (transmasculine) 34 years young. &lt;3

I work in IT on a pretty small team for a Bay Area tech company. My manager and I have a good rapport and have had some pretty deep conversations in the past. Because of everything I've been questioning/going through, I decided maybe I should just say something and get it over with. So um, I did. It was far from my usual eloquence and poise, but I didn't burst out sobbing and when we were wrapping up our conversation, he said he was thankful and honored that I trusted him to talk about this stuff with him, and then asked if there was anything I needed at this point. I said I'm still feeling that out, but thanked him for asking.

I'm simultaneously overjoyed, scared to death, and profoundly grateful that we live in a society which is slowly learning to accept this. I also feel so exhausted. Is it normal to be like, COMPLETELY WIPED OUT when you first start figuring these things out about yourself? I could seriously sleep for days, yet I also feel sort of jittery and almost euphoric and definitely relieved. It's weird as hell. I identified as FTM almost 10 years ago and then got scared and went back in the goddamn closet for pretty much the worst 10 years of my life. I keep worrying that what if this is just a ""phase"" again?

Is it normal to have flashes of, ""maybe/what if I'm wrong?"" to worry about what others will think or how it'll turn out, to worry you won't be the same and that you're changing a part of yourself that isn't ""supposed"" to be changed? Is it normal to be afraid?

Please tell me your Coming Out At Work/To Family stories, especially if you consider yourself non-binary/genderqueer. I'm kinda overwhelmed by how much more real this feels now. And I am TERRIFIED of telling my parents, that's the other thing.

On a positive note, I think I may have finally found a therapist! I just have to call them back.

My question is, did you tend to get MORE depressed after realizing this fact? Or more anxious? It seems recently I'm just constantly stuck in my head just *dreading* the fact I'm transgender. Like I don't want to be, and I wouldn't wish anyone to want to go through the struggle, but I'm pretty sure I am. 

Would this be self-hatred and internalized transphobia?

Ghostwebs,asktransgender,FtM needing guidance with therapy and T,"Hello, I'm needing some help looking for gender therapists located in/around central Oklahoma.

I've known I was transgender since I was young, but my family is not really supportive. I have a couple of close friends online who are supportive, but otherwise I don't feel like I should come out to my family. I've been on my own for a long time, so it doesn't matter too much anyhow.

I am native, so that narrows my options down a lot. I've looked into informed consent but that still needs a therapist referral.

I've been having heated online discussions around the anti-discriminatory bathroom rules with people who ""don't have a problem with the transgender community,"" but don't like that they won't be able to challenge ""someone who looks 100% male"" in a designated female restroom. There's a fear that a male sexual predator can easily take advantage of this new policy. I want to respond by saying ""yes, you will no longer be able to judge a book by its cover,"" but that would sound like on the very rare chance a dangerous person took advantage of the rule, one would have to wait until something bad happened to report the guy. I know this example doesn't consider the fact that male predators can also go into male restrooms and act inappropriately, but the conversation hasn't gone that way yet and I don't want to digress from the example that was posed to me.

visions1,asktransgender,Chest Pain - Can Someone Help me (MtF),"Hi, i've been on hormones for almost 2 months now (50mg spiro twice a day and 1mg of estradiol) and i've noticed that recently (about a month ago) i've been feeling strong chest pains. I first felt it about a month ago and it was the strongest i've felt. The pain is kind of on and off like i dont normally get it but it occurs semi frequently. I've looked at other chest pain threads but my pain feels more like the lung ish area and my heart are. Its a very difficult pain to describe it kinda feels like a strong dull pressure? and when i feel it in the middle of my chest (where i presume its my lungs) the pain seems to radiate up to the bottom of my throat. Some people said if its both sides of my chest then its just growing pains but its usually only my left side or heart and right in the middle or lungs. Can someone please help me?

P.S. I dont know if this has anything to do with it but i'd rather give you more information than wait for you to ask me but I dont usually take my spiro and estradiol at the same time everyday. Also the pains last from 30 minutes to maybe an hour or a little more than that. They also happen during night hours. I dont recall ever feeling them at school or in the morning ( 6 am - 3 pm ). Its also kind of a constant pain where it slowly gets worse then dies down to a low almost not there pain but it never goes away during the session.

Edit - After about 30 minutes it went away for about 15 minutes but its now back. I only add this because its never come back before. I was now able to pinpoint the area where it was strongest this time and it was 1 - 1.5 inches above my belly button. Could it be gas? I'm kind of worried after hearing it could be a blood clot. I know spiro is supposed to be a blood thinner but my endocrinologist also told me not to cut circulation off of any parts of my body like crossing my legs because it could cause blood clots. I've been very conscious about that but maybe my blood is clotting?"

MsCanon,asktransgender,"Wanna know a quick way to end these anti-trans laws regarding restrooms, etc?","LISTEN UP TRANSGENDER MALES!!! If you want these laws enacted against transgender people to go away permanently this is how it's done. EVERY transgender male in EVERY state and city with such a law needs to get together and go from establishment to establishment in GROUPS and enter the ladies rooms and locker rooms dressed as full-man as you can look. Grow the beard. Wear the wife beater T-shirt. Sport some fake tattoos. Look like a rough biker dude or as menacing as you can. Go in 3 at a time to each place maybe multiple times hours apart for each place. Hit the ladies locker room at the gym and 'man it up'. Go everywhere and make noise about being men and how ridiculous it is that you cannot use the men's room. 

Gawk at the ladies a bit and maybe mention it's not so bad since you, being a guy, are into women and this is where the ladies are. How convenient this law might actually BE! As soon as word gets out about all these men (trans men only please let's not break the law) in the ladies rooms and locker rooms and in showers with women (with your full beard and hairiness and all man mannerisms and gawking but maybe wearing a speedo just for that extra (I look no different than a man'ness) and it's pretty much a guarantee that the laws will be overturned pretty immediately. 

Do NOT in any way break the law or harass anyone. LOOK but do NOT touch or say anything beyond 'I am a trans male and by law have to be in here rather than in the men's room where I belong."" Repeat it over and over and tell them they should get the law overturned if they are uncomfortable with men in the ladies room. Say nothing more than that. Must be above board. Make it happen. If their whole point is ladies feeling uncomfortable and unsafe show them just what it looks like to have MEN in the restroom with them-be extra messy just for show. Maybe even mention that now, thanks to the law, ANY man can walk in the door and claim to be trans male and won't even have to shave or dress up to go oggle some women. They are thankful I'm sure. 

Go, Now. Make this happen and this ridiculous law goes away and they will see that a transgender woman is no threat to them at all, but inviting - actually DEMANDING that transgender males use the ladies room certainly would make it EASIER for any man to pretend to be transgender to enter one and the ladies will not know if that man is transgender or not. However, a transgender woman could easily go in, use the facilities and leave and no one in there would even know the difference - because there isn't one. Transgender women are WOMEN and transgender MEN are MEN. Time to go prove that by giving them exactly what they specifically ASKED for. Please - before some beautiful 10 year old transgender girl gets harmed in a mensroom or a trans woman winds up dead. Break no laws and go in groups for safety and maximum impact. Who's IN?"

Hey- I'm a 21 year old trans female, pre-everything. To make a long story short, I've been struggling with my gender identity since I was in middle school- I didn't actually attempt telling my parents until I was 18, and since then I've been fighting what feels like a losing battle to earn their approval, reassure/comfort them since they're not comfortable with the issue in the slightest, and to finally make a start on transitioning; That hasn't worked out once. Every time I make an attempt to talk to them about it, they become very aggressive, to the point where it's better to stop than to continue. I took a side approach to this on the recommendation of my therapist about six months ago, where I promised to work on my depression while my parents talked about the identity issue- when I would turn 21, we'd go back to the therapist and discuss both sides of our agreement; However, when that time actually did come, it became very clear that my parents hadn't talked about it at all, and basically re-hashed the same answer they had given both me and the therapist before... After waiting and failing to receive a true response, I've been feeling absolutely horrible for the last several weeks, even with my medication. My parents seem genuinely concerned about my mental health, but they won't talk any further about my wanting to transition- and at this point, I seriously think that my depression would lessen considerably if I were allowed to at least try. Though, as it stands now, I'd be kicked out of the house if I did start- I don't have enough money to afford my own housing, and there are still unresolved issues between my family and I that I need to fix- though, this has also been unsuccessful, regardless of my approach.

youmeltmyheart,asktransgender,About how much can I (on average) expect to pay for hormones per month?,"This is my first post here, so I hope I'm doing this right! I have a couple more questions than just the title one, but that's the most pressing. I'm a college student who gets about $400 per month to spend on expenses and necessities (through work) and I was wondering about how much I should be setting aside in a savings account for hormones? Also, (I know it varies from person to person) what is the average monthly cost of hormones? Some information about me! I'm 18, FTM, and hoping to see an endocrinologist within a few months, but would obviously like to have money saved up beforehand. (Everything is coming out of pocket as my insurance won't cover, and my parents just don't have the money.)
I also have some passing issues because (despite a fairly masculine facial structure and upper body) my lower body is very feminine! I have a tiny waist, which makes my hips look huge, and because of the discrepancy in my waist to hip ratio, it makes passing nearly impossible? I find that looser pants (like sweatpants and joggers) help to disguise that, but does anyone have any tips on disguising my legs or making them more masculine (whether that's through compression shorts or workouts or anything really).

streetsofpity,asktransgender,"It's me, at last.","I don't know if this is the appropriate place for this, and if it's not I apologise (and please could you direct me to somewhere more fitting!), but I guess I just need a space to say it. I mean, you guys are probably used to hearing this all the time, but I'm not used to saying it. At least not saying it where others (even if you don't know exactly who I am - new account for exactly that reason (a couple of online kind-of friends know my normal one)) but...yeah. Here I am. Wow, this feels massive. I guess I just want to get it off my chest and *admit* that gender is something that I've struggled with for so, so so long. It feels so strange to say that. Just to say the word 'gender' even. Like, people in my family would just laugh at it. I feel so blessed to be able to have access to such amazing online communities, even though I've only been a lurker until now. I have no idea where I would be without you (probably depressed and clueless) so I guess I just want to say thanks, anonymous wonderful people. But I guess in saying all this I'm maybe just avoiding talking about myself. Which is what I'm really here for. Even if it is scary.

So first things first, I was asigned 'male' at birth. And for so long it's something I just took for granted. I mean, I struggled with it, but I just took it for granted. That was me. A boy. I knew that I didn't fit it exactly. I hated sports. I hated just spending time with guys, in that macho culture I guess. It didn't help that I was bullied like hell by them and girls were the only ones to ever be kind to me (though 'kind' was pretty much the limit). But I thought that I had to just keep forcing it. I knew that I hated the idea of joining the military, being violent or aggressive in any way, being the boss in any sort of situation...but I thought I just had to try harder. For my parents. For my siblings. For other girls (haha it's kinda funny how naturally easy it is to say that!). There were other things of course, which I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about. But after I started seeing and then reading about transgender stuff it brought back so many memories. But even more, it made those memories make sense. Everything became clear. That's not to say that it all changed at once. It's definitely not to say that I was comfortable or accepting of it immediately. But slowly it grew stronger and stronger and I knew that I HAD to be. I didn't have a choice. I don't really have any friends in real life to share this with and my family would kind of hate me if they found out, but it's just reached the point where I have to say something. To someone. I need the world to know. So I guess that's the point of this. To say thank you, and to say

JustforAskTransGende,asktransgender,Sexuality or Gender Identity,"I've noticed other posts about this, but I feel like none of them really addressed the question the way that I was thinking of it (unless I have missed one, in which case I wouldn't mind it being linked). 

I'm biologically male, and exclusively have sex with women, but I am sexually aroused by the idea of being a woman who has sex with both men and women. 

This is not the only thing that I am aroused by - I am also aroused by the thought of being myself and having sex with women. 

I also have no interest in transitioning from a practical standpoint. From an internal standpoint, my gender means little to me on a day-to-day basis (I mean... except for the whole benefiting from the cisheteropatriachy, but I mean that it doesn't matter to ME).

Metrics like the Kinsey scale just don't work for me - I have no interest in having sex with men as a man. (aka, as a man, I'm a 0. If I were female I would probably be a 3 or 4). 

Genderfluid is maybe accurate - except that, outside of a sexual context, being male or female is of minimal importance to me. 

I guess I'm struggling with the idea that the only time when my gender identity matters to me is in a sexual context, and yet I don't think that I fit into any of the standard categories for either sexual orientation or gender  identity. 

This leaves me with the other option that 'hey this is just a kink of yours'. I'm reluctant to accept that because there was a point in time where being transgender or homosexual was 'just a kink of yours' - but maybe this is different. 

I don't know. That's why I came to you to ask whats up. 

P.S. I have read about autogynephilia (in this case, Anatomic autogynephilia). I am not convinced. Seems like  an attempt by the psychology community to make trans* a mental illness. Would also appreciate thoughts on this?"

Smapps_,asktransgender,Medical Scare Turned Miracle - A Happy Story,"So my entire life I have had issues with my liver functions being high. It was just something I have dealt with forever. When I went to my endocrinologist to get hormones for the first time, they expressed a TON of concern. The levels were massively high and he said if they went up any more after taking hormones, I'd have to go off them. So I was scared out of my mind that I wouldn't be able to transition.

So I started hormones and I saw a TON of changes. It's been just four months and I am out full time kind of changes. I don't know how things went so well so fast, but I was amazed. So many things growing and changing. I was mindblown. I have a VERY noticeable chest ow, my hair growth is already almost gone (even on my face, almost nothing will grow now. I'm curvier in places... Looking in the mirror... It's incredible.

So I went into my appointment yesterday scared of losing it all. All of the staff gendered me correctly, even those who didn't know. One lady took the time out of her day to inform me my hair was pretty when she went by. A nice gentleman was kind enough to tell me I was incredibly gorgeous (not in a creepy way either, I was happy and blushing, it made my day). I am already doing so well on this journey though, and I was afraid for it to be ending.

**But** I went into the doctor's office and my endo has his mind blown. A call was made to make sure he had the right labs. My liver functions weren't just down, **they were at healthy levels, average levels, for literally the first time in my entire life**. To surprise me further? I had all these results **with testosterone levels still very high**. I'll be upping my hormones and will likely to see even MORE changes. 

I can't say what made this minor miracle happen, but I just wanted to share my happy story when I know so many people have a hard time. Keep positive, maybe you'll have a little miracle happen for you as well."
someguynamedcole,asktransgender,Does anyone else not remember much of their childhood and early adolescence?,"Last night, my therapist asked me (24/questioning FTM) what my first puberty was like (to help contextualize what puberty 2.0 might be like). I don't remember my first puberty very much because I don't have a good recollection of my childhood or early teenage years. My mother was concerned about this so she took me to see a specialist when I was in high school, and he ruled out the possibility that I had incurred brain damage from a bad bike accident when I was 9. 

I have very few memories from 9 and earlier, and some more recollections from years 10 through 17, though it's more in the form of brief vignettes that feel like a fog, like they didn't really happen to me. My strongest memories are from 17 to now (I'm 24), but I also have difficulty conceptualizing that my past happened to me (if that even makes any sense, I can clarify as necessary).

My current therapist thinks I don't remember my early life because I was dissociating to handle my dysphoria. As a kid and teenager I mostly lived in my own world and daydreamed a lot. In addition, I have absolutely no recollection of anything like sexual abuse happening so it's not because of that.

spectrakitten,asktransgender,[NSFW-ish][Vent thread] Medical/Emotional Roller Coaster.,"I just need to vent a bit...

I guess I should start from a little over a year ago, when I decided to start estrogen. Went in to see my endo for 9 months on just spiro (my choice) checkup (late - 12/14) and brought estrogen up again. Endo had me do lab work to get a baseline prolactin level and the results came back super spiked. She figured it was an anomaly and had me retake later that week. The retake came back normal. As part of this though, I had mentioned to her that I had started to experience nipple discharge. She was concerned about that, and when I went in again (early - 1/15) she did a breast exam (growth had started on spiro alone) and found some denser tissue that she wanted to have checked (I guess I should note, I have a mild to moderate family history of breast cancer). Had a sonogram done (mid - 1/15) which came back normal. She discussed the results with a breast specialist, who wanted me to come in to see her (late - 1/15). She did a breast exam, checked the nipple discharge (cleared it (clear, multi-duct, bilateral)), and sent me in for BRCA mutation testing (ended up being early - 3/15). After what felt like fucking forever, results came back negative (early - 4/15), and I had the blessing of the specialist to begin estrogen (4/15). 

Fast forward to a few months ago (1/16), had an appointment with my endo for 9 months on E and brought up the fact that discharge had become red. She had me contact the breast specialist again who punted me to a sonogram (early - 2/16). The radiologist there cleared the sonogram but had me do a mammogram as well as a baseline for future tests (side note: I think a weirded out the tech a little by how tight she could get the plate without me complaining (I'm a bit of a masochist (fine... more then a bit :P ))). After seeing those results, the specialist cleared the discharge again (still bilat, multiduct) and endo increased E dosage (mid 2/16) (also had a dosage increase summer 15).

Just had my 1 year on E checkup. When the nurse was taking my vitals, she commented that my pulse was rather high. Endo checked as well. I asked what it was and endo said, ""Well it's about 120 right now, but the nurse measured it at 140"". Yeah, that's high, even for me (resting for me is 90 - 105 (caused by other meds I'm on)). She sent me over to the lab for blood work (came back normal: T properly suppressed, E levels good, prolactin high but within personal baseline) and an EKG. I got a call back from her a few days later and apparently my EKG is ""mostly normal, but there's an anomaly that I shouldn't be concerned about, but I should go in to see my PCP sooner rather then later"".

*sigh*... I'm so tired of this emotional roller coaster caused by medical shit. Like, IDK, cancer scare last year (calling it as I felt it (positive BRCA mutation means it's not a matter of if but when with breast cancer)), and potential heart scare now. I know I'll live, but it's just fucking stressful.

And I'm lonely. I have awesome, super supportive co-workers and trying to be supportive parents (the type that call themselves allies, and mostly are, but if I try to correct them on certain nuance with trans related language, they don't always take the correction gracefully), but co-workers are all (mostly) cis-het men with children (I'm strongly never children (even as I wish I could experience giving birth)) and outside of them, meat-space friends are essentially non existent. The few others that I've had since forever are super busy and plans consistently fall through, or they live out of town. IDK.... I'm trying to not be socially isolated, but it's hard. 

Used to go to the trans support group at the university I went to/now work at, but it's weird going as staff. They've very much welcomed me as staff, but I guess *I* expect *myself* to be able to be a leader in the group (they don't expect that), but I just not in a place where I feel comfortable with that.

*I have a future now.* 


As long as I can remember, the future was black, bleak. I could only look back on my life, and all I saw were my mistakes. I was clinically depressed, hated myself (without knowing why), and on two antidepressants as well as an anti-anxiety medication. Once I finally admitted to myself that I am transgender after a long period of denial, I started taking steps down the path to relieve my gender dysphoria. Today, the color has come back into my world. I no longer need my depression/anxiety meds. I see the path ahead of me leading to the future I deserve. Now I know what joy feels like, I know what it’s like to appreciate my own body, I know what it’s like to have relief from the tension that caused my neck and shoulder issues. I am still a person, and I still have bad days. It’s not all sunshine and rainbows, but now I have hope. I know the darkness will pass when it envelops me. 


I still have days of doubt, but I feel much more feminine now. When I’m dressed as the girl I really am, the doubt disappears. Although I feel much less feminine when I wake up to see hair growing on my face, when I hear the depth in my voice, and when I don the boy clothes I wear in public (as I am not out publically yet), I still feel like the girl I really am. It’s a lot of work being a girl, trans OR cis, but I’m reminded of Milton’s famed line, “The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.” Sometimes the best tool you can utilize to make yourself feel the way you should is right between your ears. The doubt will probably never completely leave me, but should it? We are all huge, complex human beings. We’re all so much more than our gender, and we shouldn’t get so bogged down by our doubts and insecurities; they only hold us back. I know I’m still in the beginning phase of these changes, this transition, but that’s what’s been swirling around in my head.






**Physical:**


*I have boobs now!* They’re obviously still growing (and painful! Ouch!), but they’re becoming a part of my daily experience. I need to wear a sports bra while in boymode to hide them, and with an underwire bra while in girlmode I’m starting to get some cleavage. Every time I think about them, and their progress, so much adrenaline is released that I get a little light headed and my thought process speeds up as if I’ve had way too much coffee. It’s a mixture of terror of no turning back, and absolute joy in having what I should have had all along. I fill my bra, and am beginning to fit the girl tops I’ve been wearing at home. When I’m lying in bed, falling asleep or waking up, my hands gravitate to them, as if they think my eyes are lying to them. Sometimes tears of joy start to run down my cheeks. 


*I can cry now!* I remember my teenage years, and first puberty (tehe), when I was “emo,” and my emotions were a roller coaster. I didn’t like how all over the place they were, but I sure did love feeling the full range of emotions. After puberty, my emotions deadened. I could feel happy, but rarely smiled. I could feel sad, but never cried. Everything was bottled up, repressed, and hidden deep down inside me somewhere. Now I can’t help but blurt out with laughter sometimes, or can’t help but get all teary. Sometimes back to back. Being able to physically exercise on the outside what I’m feeling on the inside (as well as having stronger feelings) allows me to have a release that I’ve desperately missed. 


*I have soft skin now!* I honestly never would have imagined in a thousand years that my skin could get so soft… I just can’t get over it. I find myself subconsciously rubbing my neck, and my forearms all the time. My boobs, my butt, even my hands have gotten so fabulously soft and perfect that I can keep my hands off them. The skin tone has even lightened slightly, and being a massive fan of pale girls, this makes me giggle with happiness. 


*My face is feminizing.* It’s hard to quantify this one, but it’s just a feeling I have. Sometimes I look in the mirror and actually see a girl looking back at me. It’s a craaazy feeling, and makes me smile ear to ear. My cheeks are filling out, and I am feeling cuter every day. The changes are only slight, barely noticeable, but I’ve always haaated how I looked, and how my face was, so this is a pretty big deal to me, and I notice it. 


*My body odor has completely changed.* I live in Maine, so the last six months I’ve lived in a frozen wasteland. The only times I’ve been able to really get a good idea of how I smell is when I wake up in the middle of the night sweating because I’ve piled a billion blankets on top of myself, or when I smell my pillow, or bed in general. Or sometimes when I smell my old clothes. This might sound super gross, but I love this new smell. I find myself burying my head in my pillow and breathing deep, or giving extra attention to smelling my old clothes while checking if they’re dirty. It smells so good, in a weird way, and I can’t get over it. 


*I can smell smells I’ve never smelled before.* Maybe it’s just me being crazy, but I swear that I have a heightened sense of smell. I can smell it when people are cooking in my house, when before I’d have to be in the same room. Now that the snow has melted, and everything is thawing out and starting to bloom, the smells of spring have come back and it’s been blowing me away. Smell has always meant so much to me, and always brings me back to some rosy part of my past, but this time it’s different; it’s intoxicating. 


*My hips are starting to develop!!* Not just my hips, but also the general shape of everything between my knees and boobs is feminizing. I’ve always wore skinny jeans since my emo days, but now I catch myself checking the area out in the mirror. It’s crazy. Even while in boymode I’m starting to like what I’m seeing. 


It’s so ridiculously crazy to go from loathing your body to starting to appreciate it. I never thought that was possible. I know I’m still really early into my HRT journey, and have a lot to look forward to, but what I’ve seen so far has given me so many reasons TO be excited for the future. I’m a changed person. I’m happy now.

juliagirl1,asktransgender,Mother visiting me with her fake liberal friend,"Hey so since coming out, i have distanced myself from my parents who are trying to understand me but don't. My mom's friend Joyce and her are visiting me (im in college). I want to dress the way I want, but I'm not sure I'm quite comfortable dressing in a dress when we go out for dinner around them, because I still care too much what people will think about me, especially Joyce (mom's friend), who acts like my transition is a phase and sucks. But I have to go see them. I really don't fucking want to and it sucks, but what can I do? ANYWAY, im just wondering what a good option for fancy dress that is ""women's"" but also not a dress. Im really driving myself up the wall here. Thanks so much. "
katiecakesss,asktransgender,"""Gender Monday""","Yesterday was ""Gender Monday"" for my school's senior spirit week. I couldn't participate (unsupportive parents) but It caused a lot of local controversy.

The principal was ""unaware"" of the spirit week (We planned it in the senior council weeks ago) and started unreasonably dress-coding students and sending them home because ""boys were wearing dresses"". What I really learned that day and in the aftermath today was what people really thought about gender.

There was a lot of uproar about it. Students were calling each other slurs. Adults were confused and upset. My mother saw a lot of negative comments/complaints about it on Facebook. I heard the principal was going to revoke the president of the senior council's position over this, and parents were called. He didn't react well to last year's powderpuff game, either.

Parents seem to believe that the school was ""promoting and encouraging homosexuality."" My own parents called the crossdressing ""hideous"" and ""sick"".

Today there was some better talk about it. Senior spirit week was shut down (again, this happened last year) due to it becoming a ""distraction"" and ""encouraging dress code violation"". People were saying it shouldn't have been a problem. Teachers spoke out about it, and classroom discussion moved to transgender topics. Most people were completely ignorant on the subject, but I got to hear what they think.

&gt; ""It shouldn't be a problem. Michael Phelps or whatever, he crossdressed for one year and nobody said anything. As long as it isn't actually violating dress code, it shouldn't be a problem."" - Teacher

&gt; ""It's fun.""

&gt; ""Some of the girls looked better yesterday.""

Others were more hostile.

&gt; ""Now the law says I can use the girl's locker room and they can't do shit. I could just say I'm being discriminated against, I don't have to prove anything. I read this thing that said ['Mommy, why is that man using the girls' restroom?' 'Quiet, you'll get arrested if you say anything.'](https://i.imgur.com/Q1f2GfU.jpg?1)""

&gt; ""I don't want my daughter to be using the same restroom as someone who 'identifies' as a woman because I don't want her getting raped.""

&gt; ""On all levels except physical, I am a woman""

These were my friends. My thoughts about them have changed a bit.

I think the roots of the negativity were in ignorance. Even the supportive ones got it all wrong. People seem to think this is a new thing and they only know parts of it from popular culture, although way off."
KrisEtKris,asktransgender,A sad day for Mississippi LGBT people..,"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/04/06/mississippi-religious-freedom-bill-signed-into-law-newday.cnn

On Tuesday of April 5, 2016 which was yesterday, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant signed a bill that can discriminate LGBTQ+ community as a whole. This bill *legally* allow employers to deny LGBTQ+ people if it's conflicting their religious stand. Not only that, gay people can now be denied for marriage documentation and many other public services that should be easily accessible.

As for the trans issue, doctors can now *DENY* hormonal therapy/gender reassignment surgery if it conflicts with their religious stand.

The signed bill will be in effect on July 1.

This is a pure discrimination. It must be vetoed."

I'm so scared to tell this to a therapist because I'm afraid they will say if your not body dysphoric then why transition, but on the other hand I'm petrified because I don't know how I'll feel if I were to transition.

But this is a lot sooner than I expected. I told my Uncle when I came out to him that I'd try to come out to my parents before I start them but I'm totally not ready for that yet. And I've been very insecure the past couple days about my bald spot and my future ability to pass (yes I know about wigs. I know they are beautiful and dont make me any less of a ""real"" woman. It's just a personal feeling that I would really prefer to keep my own hair). I dont want to be that creepy ""man in a dress"" and feel like everyone is humoring me by agreeing that I'm a woman.

alexvalewest,asktransgender,Very anti-trans guest speaker in my college class next week to discuss the NC bathroom bill. Any input?,"The ""Citizens for Community Values"" organization/group has a guest speaker at my public college class next week, the primary topic of discussion of which is meant to be about the bathroom bill. For anyone unfamiliar with this group, this excerpt from their website may give you an idea (this was posted yesterday):

&gt;Dayton, Cincinnati (maybe), Cuyahoga County including Cleveland has banned travel to North Carolina. Why do you ask? North Carolina passed a common sense law that does not allow men to enter women’s bathrooms, showers, and locker rooms. I cannot believe I am writing this. What are these officials thinking? Is there no end to homosexual activist absurdity? CCV is calling on concerned citizens in Ohio and other states to defend women and children from the sexually dysfunctional by avoiding travel to the City of Dayton, Cuyahoga County including the City of Cleveland, and maybe the City of Cincinnati.  Please forward to friends, family, and churches. Blessings, Phil Burress

The class size is about 15 students. The majority of the class is pretty liberal.

I'm obviously not a fan of this speaker coming to my university, but I plan on at least being prepared.

If anyone has an ideas of things to potentially ask, I'd love to hear them.

In case anyone wanted to read their website (lol), it's http://www.ccv.org/.

Gothymoon,asktransgender,Super anxious right now,I sent my parents the coming out letter this morning. We are going to talk once thier both home. They sent me a reply saying they both love me so it shouldn't be too bad. Im just really anxious and I can't stop shaking. It dosnt help that ive never had to have an awkward situation like this before. I generally avoid this type of thing at all costs. I really nedd some reasurance ive been like this all day.
-maker,asktransgender,I will not be intimidated,"just have to get this off my chest. I was just getting groceries for my grandma. 

Guy who works in my grandmas building (retirement home) gets on the elevator with me in the parkade. Asks me what floor? I say 4. He (like 40yrs+ 5'10 170+lbs) tells me I need to sign in, I say that's great thanks and just ignore him because i'm here all the time and the staff know me etc. at which point he becomes a rage machine and starts giving me this death stare, proceeds to yell some inaudible shit at me and escalates it instantly by throwing a punch at me! like an actual punch, the kind that would have broken my jaw or nose if it connected. i spent all of my time pre hrt working on being able to defend myself so shit like this can't and won't happen the way they think it will. I blocked it and responded with a kick to his chest that stunned him. i'm now thinking I might have to kill this dude in an elevator so I wouldn't get hurt, bringing groceries... to my grandmas... 

Can't believe that's how quick somebody can fly off the handle and threaten another person

I run for my grandmas the moment the door opened.
I don't want to hurt this idiot but he wants me K/O'd I can see it in his eyes. He even tried to attack me a 3rd time right out front her door! then tried banging on her door.. I'm not scared or anything. how seemingly quick it all changed, like I went from standing there safe with groceries to having to fight a guy twice my size in an enclosed space. "
Defunct_Drone,asktransgender,"MtF question: For those in the awkward ""in-between genders"" phase, how do you hide your boobs?","I've been on hrt for about 5.5 months and can't wear regular t-shirts because my boobs are too obvious.

dsm-vi,asktransgender,Does anybody wonder how everybody ISN’T dysphoric?,Obviously I know this isn’t the case but I think most of what kept me from exploring my gender for so long was the thought that everything I was feeling was just ~normal~. I still kind of think this sometimes even though I’m now in the process of transition and know people are cis
Apollo__rising,asktransgender,"Am I getting worked up over nothing, or does this bother you guys too?","Saw a post on Facebook from my uncle last night about the bathroom bills debate. My mother, who's been nothing but supportive, liked it, and I feel a bit disheartened though maybe I'm just over thinking it. What reaction does this give you guys? (bold added by me)

""I have a few thoughts about the current restroom debate. First I will make a bold statement that will hopefully make everyone angry enough to keep on reading. Next I shall opine on the trans-bathroom debate. Then I will back my statement with undeniable fact. And finally I will offer a reasonable solution to the issue.

Statement: There are times when a man needs to be inside a public restroom designated solely for women.

**Opinion: Those who know me know I am a rather conservative person who attempts to view things in context and reach balance... I am a Libra. I have trans friends. We don't spend hours on end discussing public bathroom usage but we have discussed it enough that I can say that my trans friends do everything they can to avoid public restrooms. Even in a certain bar on the west end of ***. They're stigmatized by everybody... straight and gay. If they do have to use a public facility they use the facility that matches they way they appear and they do it discretely. Therefore I am tempted to make the argument that, for a true trans person, this debate is null and void. Now, do I worry that freaks will attempt to use any situation available to them to their advantage? Sure. Back to my statement.**

There are times when a man needs to be able to enter a public restroom designated solely for women. Here is why. I have a life long friend whose wife had a severe stroke several years ago. She continues to be amazing in her recovery but at this point in time she is reliant on a wheelchair. Even though one side of her body does not work properly she has learned how to move from her wheelchair to a commode... but it's an extremely dangerous thing for her to do on her own because if she falls she is completely out of luck. Think about trying to maneuver yourself from one sitting position to another, even with hand rails all around you, without using half of your body. Then pull down your pants. If you don't work for a circus you're kind of screwed.
This couple likes to travel. But 'family' restrooms are few and far between. In order for this couple to travel they now have to take either a family member or close friend or caregiver with them. Not only is that costly, it winds up in a whole list of other logistical nightmares.
So we are stuck. No one wants genuine male persons in women's restrooms. But yet there are situations where, since our restrooms are designated male and female only, people dealing with a life altering medical condition are largely prohibited from engaging in activities that could, in the long run, enhance the recovery process. This couple does everything they can to live their lives as they did before the stroke because it helps with the long term recovery.

Reasonable solution to issue: Perhaps we should consider our bathrooms. I think that we, as a nation, should begin to advocate for 'family' bathrooms in all public facilities and that we should encourage the private sector to take the lead. I noticed today that our local Walmart has a sign between the male and female restrooms at the front of the store that the family restroom is located at the back of the store. That's surely better than not having one at all.
To all of my friends I say this... Think about prevalent 'family' (read gender neutral) single stall restrooms, large enough to accommodate a wheel chair wherever you shop, dine, worship or do community service.

Lots of problems solved for lots of people."""
Spacersyn,asktransgender,question about FtMs on HRT in regards to emotion.,"I am a MtF, when i am not on estrogen my emotions are so barebones and basic, like, happy/sad/angry.. thats it and no real inbetween. when I am on Estrogen and blockers, i have inumerable distinct emotions that cascade and fill me. its like going from a black and white tv show to a fully 3d blockbuster currentday movie. its intense and fascinating.

my question is, when going in to T, did your emotions go away like mine was naturally? do you retain some of your emotional capacity?"

kallmekat,asktransgender,Breastform 3M 77?,"I've seen a few stories of people using 3m 77 adhesive to attach forms, but I don't know how to and can't seem to find anything online. Any tutorials you lovely people know of?"
LarrissaM,asktransgender,I came out at work...,"TL;DR : I started with a few employees at first... and now my boss knows. And he could not possibly be more supportive. Note I'm still pre-everything, so this feels extremely weird to sort out in my brain. If I'm not started, it's too early to tell people, right? Right??? 

We have an annual company work reward trip to a resort in Mexico. I won, and accepted. In the timeframe since I accepted I figured out I was transgendered. This is an all expense paid, very alcohol heavy, party-mode vacation. It was a very interesting thing to win and get to go. (It's a software company, if that matters). I could bring someone with me, and being single I invited one of my co-workers (lets call him C). 

Now, I told a few select people at work about my trans-ness. And a week before, I told C. I came out by asking if he knew any transgender people he could introduce me to, since he's gay. Also because I thought sharing a room with that information not out in public was going to be weird. He was definitely supportive of it. I told two of the girls who I work closely with and one of the other gay guys at work (who I refer affectionately to as the J crew as they all have J names). But that was it, pre-trip.

K was coming along, I've worked closely with her for years.  I came out to her first on the trip. I only had planned to tell her because I adore this woman so much and I wanted to be good friends with her. And I wanted to tell no one else.  That was the plan, anyways. I figured - ok, got it off my chest. She'll understand, and I won't have to worry. She was definitely on my short list for the inner circle. It was a brilliant plan. Alcohol ruins all plans and I'm apparently stupidly open when I'm drunk. :-D

During a swim in the ocean however, probably 5 or 6 drinks in, I was talking to A and J was there. And A said something which made me look over to J and be like - does she know? And well, I came out to A. Because I'm drunk and what's the point. A's cool. SHE WAS SO EXCITED! Like... it was one of the most amazing things to ever happen. I told K next. Also so excited. She called my chosen name a stripper name, and would prefer to call me Brianna, which I think I'm ok with. Six of us partied the night away. It was the greatest night of my life! The fear of coming out as 'flirty' with the girls was gone, I could just be me, without worrying! K and A's husbands - also very very supportive and chill.  

The next day... I came out to my boss. Lets call him Dick, because that's his name, and it's fucking hilarious. You can't use it in a sentence without it feeling weird. I saw him at lunch at the buffet, him and his wife C. I asked to join them, and it was just... just perfect. He's extremely supportive. As he pointed out - we have 5 gay guys with the company, so we're very open to the lgbt community. I was also drunk (hair of the dog, baileys and coffee in the morning.) ;  We had a pool gathering, and I outed myself to the rest of the group. (One by one. It's easier that way. S's husband was apparently jealous of me flirting with S the day before in the pool... I think... I don't remember doing it. So that cleared that up! Yay!!!)

The rest of the weekend was a great bonding experience. I didn't bring up my trans-ness unless they asked. I just let it be out there, and be known. And that was it. After that I could be myself. I didn't dwell on it. I just lived. And danced. And played charades. And blacked out drunk. And it was glorious. It was the best weekend of my life. 

So now... 14 people of my office of 43 know. FOURTEEN. And every single person is supportive, and excited. I'm in such a safe place right now, I could not be happier.  I have friends who love me around me. It is amazing. I cannot stop beaming. I don't have to hide. I know that my transition will go well from a support perspective. I know my job is secure. I know my future is starting here and now. I'm confident for the first time in my 37 years on this planet. 

I'm happy.

Sheepywashere,asktransgender,Why is my head so turbulent.,"So I want to be a female. I have always wanted to be a female.
The only reservations I have left are how it will affect the dynamic at work. I am worried that questioning myself at 26 would be considered a sign of mental weakness and I would be liked less. I mean everybody likes me at work (its the only place in my life where this is so, work is the only place in my life where I actually feel wanted) I don't want that dynamic to change. I have been working there for a year and I give a very good impression of having myself in order (even though I don't). I have even been called wise by my boss... (haha not at fucking all!)

Same rules like in N.C. but with a '$2,500 bond' if a student finds a student in the 'wrong bathroom'. I'm not a student, but it has gotten a lot of companies to speak out on it. With Target's new announcement, people are going insane. Seeing the comments on how people put us in the same spectrum as a sex offender, not even thinking about trans men that have to face the void that is the women's restroom. 

I've been using the men's restroom comfortably for 2 years with no problem, but with this coming to light, I fear going to the bathroom anywhere anymore. Everytime I see people saying how we're all just sex offenders looking for a reason to see people's junks, I want to cry. My father is a sex offender and I get so pissed how people want to put me on the same level as he is without even meeting me. I already have to make sure my sister doesn't see as that since she thinks anyone related to my dad is fucked up (being around her kids is like walking on eggshells).

watchinggodbleed,asktransgender,Outsider Looking for a Better Perspective,"So I'm a cisgendered, white, straight male. Essentially the big old stamp of not being able to relate to anybody in more repressed positions in our society. So I want to gain a perspective on this that I haven't heard. I don't personally know any Trans, or gender dysmorphic people, and would like some help in understanding your situation to the best I can. So far my only insight has been an English professor who was quite impassioned about gender issues being taken legitimately, and people screen grabbing posts off Tumblr who claim they're half squirrel and half dragon soooooooooo I feel the whole thing is quite narrow. 

I can easily relate to the idea of feeling like your gender is not in tune with your personality. And as a guy who likes musicals instead of football, I can see a disconnection, but it's not nearly on the same level. What most confuses me is the point where it becomes uncomfortable to a physical level, where you feel disconnected enough to want to reflect those changes on your body. And where exactly do you decide that these are not simply personality traits that are not typical in society for the gender you are born with, but rather identifying with a whole other gender entirely? 

Also, the animal thing, what uh... What's the deal there? I'm guessing it's not a real thing, but like I said, limited perspective here. Pretty sure this isn't the right place to ask that anyway.

Just wanting to gain a better perspective and broaden my understanding of what you're going through. I know I can't totally understand, but I'd like to get a step closer. I also get it's a big topic, so I'll take book recommendations too if you got em. Thanks.

Edit: Thank you all for your responses. It seems to me I had the same assumptions that others have about gay people, that it's as simple as them liking things more feminine / masculine so now they are attracted to another gender. But I feel I'm a bit better understanding now, it's quite literally, a male brain in a female body, or vice versa. Not just seeing a majority of your interests be considered belonging to the other gender by society. Thanks for helping me out,even though I can't fully empathize, I think I've got some idea. "

shortfallquicksnap,asktransgender,"The ""What The F— Am I Doing"" moment","Hey there :) I'm 28, MTF.

I found out about this whole transgender thing in December. At first I had some resistance but then... Well, last month I got started with the lasering, got an androgynous-ish style haircut, scheduled a medic appointment to see about HRT. I've discussed things with my wife (we have no idea about the future but our hearts are in the right place), I planned my future wardrobe, and picked a female name I like.

But then it hit me: 

* I'll be going from cis-white-guy to the most picked on demographic there is. 

* I'm good looking now and who knows, I might turn out a rather ugly lady on the other side. 

* I'll have a pile of legal issues with regards to the name change (yay third world). 

* There's a good chunk of family I'm sure will write me off as dead after all this.

* As a woman I better brush up on my self defense skills.

* In the future if I'm ever dating or looking for a job... good luck.

I could go on forever. 

All of this got me wondering. Why is it that so much of my well being is tied to whether I look like a man or a woman? Intellectually it makes no sense to me. I've discussed this with both my wife and my therapist, and the best we could come up with was that it's a self-esteem issue. It still makes no sense to me. It sounds so shallow and superficial. It's not who I am to put looks on top of the list so much. (Which I almost did on the list above, I know.) I don't get it.

After (*if?*) I'm 100% passable some of the problems will hopefully disappear and I'll just blend in with the crowd. But I don't know. I'm scared.

Anyway, I don't know where I'm going with this. It feels so radiant to picture myself being who I actually am, but when it comes to dealing with the rest of the world it scares the living daylights out of me."

Eventually-Alexis,asktransgender,I have some complains about this sub. In a good way.,"It's going to be a rant. And I really hope it isn't taken as a insult to the sub since that isn't my intention.

Everyone have been supporting here but I made a post earlier today were in I stated some valid concerns and I didn't do a very good job at getting my entire background out since I were tired and in distress and didn't feel like spending what would feel like hours on end to get all of the reasons I had behind me being transgender and the doubt that I had been fighting out. And I know that not all posts go ""viral"" and get a lot of attention but to my surprise I got a dislike on my post. And it made me feel horrible and it made me feel like what I were going through wasn't valid. And that's a dangerous game to play. And some might say that I'm overreacting and they would be right. But I can take that dislike but some might not. And that's the hole point.

But it also made something clear to me. I started seeing a pattern that I didn't like one bit. The posts that go ""viral"" gets a lot of attention but I also feel like it's important that we together spend some time looking in the new section because a lot of posts go by without much reaction and that is people who have valid feelings and emotions who might not get the help that they need. I think that we as a community needs to pay attention to the new section so that everyone can get the help that they need whatever they might need help with and not only the popular posts.

I would like to again point out that I mean no harm and that it's just the perspective of someone who haven't been here that long.

Edit: I feel like it's important that the reason I made the post wasn't particularly because of the down vote and I know reddit is a mess in that area. What my point is that I feel like it's important to help the ones who need it instead of only focusing on the ""viral"" posts. Just wanted to make that clear ��"

Optilex,asktransgender,Completly lost. Here is my situation.,"Hi.

I just wanted to get help because I feel my whole life unbearable right now.

Recently, I told my parents I think I might be transgender, at the age of 19. They were surprisingly supportive about it, and I am happy about that. So together we spoke, and we decided that the best was to see the local "" team "" about transgender stuff and transitionning in general. I was very excited about this.

But that's where everything went down. I went to see that psychologist. It was the worst meeting of my life. He didn't introduce himself. He simply waited for me to say a word. So I told him my situation but I felt uneasy. He continued saying very very depressive stuff. For example, I told him that I couldn't support my body anymore, and that my aim in life was to be well in my body, and that I wished to be a woman, that it was the only way that I would feel better in my own shoes. To which he replied that I was about to do the contrary: that I was about to destroy my body. He said countless times that I was not saying "" what other trans people said "". The worst part? I have to wait a year of this before getting any kind of treatment, because informed consent is not a thing in my country.


After going out of his office, I felt destroyed. I felt lost. I still feel lost. One day, I took scissors and cut my arms until I decided it was enough. I took my computer and left, and went to the hospital. These 3 last weeks were the worst weeks of my life. I don't even find the power to escape reality with my computer. I lost my sanctuary.

Tomorrow is the day I am supposed to leave the hospital. I don't know what to do or where to go. I don't know how to deal with this whole situation. I feel completly lost. 

What should I do in this kind of situation? I feel close to suicide, honestly. I just don't know where I want to be, or what I want to do in life. My parents are shouting on me all day because they think I lie to them. That all of this (feeling of wanting to be a woman, depressive feelings, suicidal feelings) is just a set up to do nothing and act like a kid. I feel harrassed everywhere I go.

There are just two things I know:

1. I want to be a woman.

2. I want to be hugged.

The rest? I feel completly lost. 

So yeah, I am aware that this post is useless. I just want some kind of help. A feeling of hope. A light. Something. 

Thank you for having read all of this."

livyeah,asktransgender,Needing advice for my younger sibling,"Hello everyone!

My younger sibling (I'll call them Alex) has gender dysphoria, and we were hoping to get some advice about the transitioning process.

Last week Alex was meant to have her first appointment with a gender therapist, but missed it due to having a severe panic attack. When I asked Alex about it, she said that she freaked out and was really scared and nervous about having to see a therapist - Alex has had prior issues with anxiety and is a very timid person. She also had a negative experience with her former high school psychologist. 

Alex felt annoyed with herself as the appointment is something that she really wants and she does't want to throw it all away. I suggested that I would try to find out some information about seeing a gender therapist online to give her an idea of what to expect. She likes the idea of being able to think about her answers before the next appointment, hoping it will calm her nerves.

Does anyone have and advice or insight I can give to Alex? I really want to help ease her mind about the appointment. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but we are from Australia. "

Meanwhile, my parents got sick of my shit and want to kick me out. We get into arguments because they don't like that I blame everything on depression/dysphoria. I can't get a job because I hate meeting new people with the face I have, I avoid people in general because dysphoria is so bad and I'm suicidal.

They believe that it's better for me to move out because THEY will have one mouth less to feed. They're not convinced that when I start HRT, I'll get better mentally. I did DIY for 6 months last year and I felt really good and actually went out a lot, however I had to stop because money was running low.

afewleft,asktransgender,Zukowski FFS consultation experience and quote -- AMA/thoughts?,"I've been looking into FFS this year and I recently had my first consultation with Dr. Zukowski in Chicago. There are a few other posts on here about people's experiences with all of this that I found really helpful, so I thought I'd put mine down for anyone else in the same position. Sorry for the length, but I wanted to be thorough.

**Consultation experience**

I contacted Dr. Zukowski's office using the information on his Web site, and I spoke on the phone with a very friendly sounding woman who set me up with an in-person consultation. The wait time on the consultation was only 2 or 3 weeks, which was considerably better than Spiegel, who apparently didn't have 15 minutes to spare for a Skype chat until *2 months* later (!). Zukowski's consultations are free as well, compared to $100 for Spiegel.

When the day arrived I drove in to the city (I live nearby). His office is actually in Wilmette, which is pretty suburb-y, and it wasn't the most convenient trip in terms of highway accessibility, but I didn't have any issues finding it or parking or anything.

The office is kind of dull-looking on the outside, but it's really fancy-looking inside. The receptionist (a skinny guy, forgot his name) seemed pretty nice, offered me water, etc. He had me do a little paperwork and gave me a folder containing Dr. Zukowski's contact information, his credentials, a few testimonials, etc.

He took me into an exam room, where another nice fellow (Cole) came to talk to me. He asked me a few basic questions about my situation and medical history, then gave me a tour of the facility. He showed me the operating room (Zukowski uses his own surgical facilities instead of a hospital like some other surgeons), which was kind of unsettling for me, but everything looked legit.

After another 15- or 20-minute wait I met with Dr Zukowski in his office. He asked me some more basic questions, asked me what I felt my problem areas were, then gave me his own opinions. Then he went into a presentation where he talked about his credentials and his techniques, and he narrated over a bunch of slides which as far as I can tell were all the same photos from his Web site.

After that, he gave me a preliminary quote, I asked a few questions for clarification, and then I was on my way. He said someone from his office would e-mail me the official quote and a bunch of additional information about post-op care, hotels, financing, etc., which they did a few days later. Our meeting probably lasted between 45 and 60 minutes.

**Thoughts**

Zukowski's staff all seemed really nice. Nobody misgendered me or did anything else like that that hurt my feelings (though I cringed at their occasional use of the word ""transgendered""). However, I already seem to pass, and I know that that fact colors my experience, so I can't speak for how they might treat someone who doesn't.

Zukowski himself was very forceful like everyone says, though (speaking as someone with a lot of anxiety issues) I didn't feel especially pressured or anything. His thoughts on what I needed pretty much aligned with my own.

He was very good with compliments and validating language, referring to me as a ""girl"" several times, telling me how pretty my eyes were, and things like that. From what I've heard that's just kind of part of his pitch, but it made me feel nice even if it was likely disingenuous.

His presentation and pretty much any discussion regarding the procedures seemed very rehearsed; it was clear that he had a script that he wanted to stick to. I can't fault him for that when it comes to the presentation itself, as he surely gives the same one to several people every week, but even when I asked him for clarification about some of the procedures it felt like he was just repeating the same talking points (many of which are also on his Web site).

Most of the results he showed me looked good from what I could see, but I feel like all of his before-and-afters are generally pretty shitty. What I really wanted to see were high-resolution front and side profile photos with no makeup, hair pulled back, and neutral lighting. There were several frontal before photos like that, but none from the side, and almost *all* of the after photos were very obviously selfies taken at flattering angles with hair down and makeup on. I don't know if this is a deliberate deception tactic or what, but it really frustrated me.

Another thing that made me kind of uncomfortable is how catty he was about comparing himself to other surgeons. He seemed to be positioning himself as a superior alternative to Spiegel in particular, and he showed me a CT scan of some brow work Spiegel had done that looked messy. His site is full of the same sort of posturing and passive-aggression, which is honestly kind of surreal to me. That said, a few of the other US surgeons I've looked into (especially Spiegel himself) are the same way, so I'm guessing that this kind of attitude just comes with the territory somehow.

**Quote**

This is the official quote I was provided:

&gt; 1\. Feminizing endoscopic variant biplaner browlift with 3-dimensional frontal bone contouring including the orbital rim, frontal sinus and temporal lines of fusion with disruption of central depressor muscles and forehead height reduction with scalp advancement (minimum ½ inch centrally and ¾ inch in lateral recession) and fat grafting to fill the temporal soft tissue hollowing -- **$6,000.00**

&gt; 2\. Feminizing rhinoplasty and septoplasty -- **$4,000.00**

&gt; 3\. Endoscopic assisted 3-dimensional chin bone contouring with chin soft tissue reshaping and tracheal shave; with a retroauricular variant lower face, neck and jaw skin facelift with corset platysmaplasty and internal suspension of the neck muscles to create a feminine neck concavity -- **$6,000.00**

&gt; 4\. Endoscopic assisted 3-dimensional jaw body and jaw angle bone contouring with masseter muscle reduction thru an intraoral incision -- **$5,000.00**

&gt; 5\. Fat grafting to the red of the lips, soft tissue of the cheeks and nasolabial fold creases -- **$1,500.00**

&gt; ANESTHESIA FEE FOR ALL ABOVE -- **$4,000.00**

&gt; FACILITY FEE FOR ALL ABOVE -- **$4,500.00**

&gt; TOTAL PACKAGE QUOTE -- **$31,000.00**

The other documents they gave me suggest that I can also expect to spend about $800 to stay in a nearby hotel, and $200 to $2000 if I want to hire their nurse for post-operative care (which I'll probably have to do for at least the first day, if not longer).

**Conclusion**

I've really been leaning heavily towards Zukowski, as he seems to provide the best results to cost/convenience ratio out of the surgeons I've looked into so far.

Some of the experience did come across as a little shady to me, but that doesn't seem uncommon with plastic surgeons, so that hasn't scared me away yet. As far as his brow technique, I don't think I'm qualified to decide whether it really is better overall than more invasive methods, but my brow really isn't bad anyway, so I feel like it should be more than sufficient in my case. I'm also not bothered by the common complaint that he pushes a particular ""Barbie"" look -- Barbie works perfectly fine for me.

The other major points in Zukowski's favor are his post-op care (which everything I've read says is excellent) and his policy of free revisions. I've only heard of two bad experiences; in both cases there were surgical complications, which is shitty, but *all* surgeries come with that risk. I can't find any evidence that he's been neglectful or dishonest or anything like that.

With all of that said, the prices he quoted me are a bit higher than I expected, which I'm kind of depressed about. I was hoping I could get this all done by the end of the year, but it feels a little questionable now.

lallen74,asktransgender,Help with transitioning friend,"Hi all! I'd like to start by saying that I've always done my best to be an ally; I've had several personal experiences with both MTF and FTM friends and loved ones, and most of them were positive. My husband and I are having a lot of trouble, though, with a mutual friend who has recently told us (s)he's transitioning.

First off, here's part of the problem: I know perfectly well how to handle pronouns with transfolk, but he hasn't given anyone any indication that he wants to be referred to as ""she"", hasn't given any of us a new name or any overt cues, and keeps sidling around the issue at varying levels of, shall we say, presentation, none of which are actually overt enough to register, especially with my somewhat-oblivious husband. And then he gets name-calling upset when we don't give him the feedback he wants; we're expected to notice, and when we don't, he goes behind his friends' backs to complain. (I can only assume he's doing this to me and to all his friends, since I've been on the receiving end.)

Also, as this relationship has been fast-forward catapulted to closer-and-more-intimate-than-we-asked-for status in a matter of a few short weeks (we've only known him for about two years,) we've encountered a vindictive, selfish, and championship-worthy passive-aggressive side of his personality that we hadn't actually run into before, or at least not in this quantity. He takes absolutely anything anyone says to him in the worst possible way, shoots off snarky emails and then passive-aggressive follow-ups, and constantly nags me to disclose how my husband feels about some matter or other, even after I've told him plainly to talk to my husband about that. I feel like I'm in 8th grade, and not in a good way.

As things progressed, the wall we really struck, I think, was the ""opposite-sex friend"" wall. Like many couples, we limit our besties to same-sex (or non-sexually appropriate, if you get me) friends. We think it's the healthy thing to do for our relationship, and we've always done it that way. Our transitioning friend, who has hung out with my husband alone a handful of times in the past, reacted poorly to the news. He actually took a moralistic, judgmental stance against our policy; that was particularly hurtful to both of us, since we haven't been judgmental toward him at all. He's made it plain in his dealings that the things we value are incomprehensible to him (when, in an honest discussion about women and flirting and expectations, I told him of a friend-flirting-with-my-husband episode which was particularly painful to both of us, he actually laughed. And never once considered either my husband's feelings or mine.) As I've had conversations with him, I've tried to identify the upcoming issues as I see them, as well as talk out my own feelings of being threatened by the change, but he truly does not care. He says he wants to talk this out, but what he actually wants is a one-way conversation in which he says stuff and everybody else just agrees.

And this is just to describe my own dealings with him. He's asked both of us for honesty, and when my husband was actually honest with him about his discomfort at a specific request, the friend sent further snarky emails, and a followup email that blatantly stated: if you're uncomfortable, you must be a giant asshole and I won't be friends with you guys any more. I don't think he's actually considering anyone's viewpoint but his own...or else he's considered them and dismissed them as unimportant.

This friend seems to have no idea what he wants. He gripes because nobody treats him differently, then gripes when people do treat him differently. I think part of the problem is that he's in a very early stage of transitioning and he's trying to do all of it amongst his cis friends; he's got no trans peers to socialize with at all. He expects us to do the heavy lifting, and when we say we're not comfortable doing some part of it, he acts like we're awful people. 

We aren't. But neither are we people who are accustomed to be treated this way; he's being manipulative, selfish, short-sighted, and even abusive in the most transparent of passive-aggressive ways. I know perfectly well that people don't really change who they are when they transition, but I can't help feel that this is all coming out of left field. We're pretty sure that we want to keep him at arm's length from now on-- we hope that maybe some form of the relationship could be salvaged at some later point when he's thinking of someone other than himself, if and when that happens?-- but he just sees it as us being antitrans. 

Any thoughts? I'd appreciate some alternate viewpoints right about now. We honestly think that cutting him off completely may be the only answer, but we do want to try whatever we can first, just in case this is an issue that is exclusive to the transition period itself."
throwaw543210,asktransgender,Help with Doctors [US] &amp; Finastride?,"*I am mtf, as that's semi-relevant here*

I must sound like a broken record by now.

Anyways, I'm looking to find a Doctor to speak to about my transition with HRT and the medicines I'm on. 

I am currently seeing a doctor through my insurance who has prescribed me both Estradiol &amp; Spiro. While very nice, I am starting to get a bit nervous and untrusting. Particularly because the last time I talked to him, he was asking me what the side effects of my medicine was and did not know himself, despite the fact this is an area he specializes in. Something is fishy and I'm looking to get at least a second opinion.

Problem is, I don't know if that's even possible as most doctors don't have a clue about HRT for trans individuals (at least the ones I've spoke with).

I know places around me offer informed consent, but that's just what they offer. I want to see a doctor to help check my dosage and go over the side effects I've been having, just to ensure my current one is doing the correct thing. Importantly one outside of my insurance.

Does anyone know any list of doctors or any way in which to go about this? Like I said, it's a second opinion thing I need, not a prescription which I already have, which is why I haven't tried to schedule an appointment with an informed consent doctor.

Advice for California in particular would be nice.

****

On a related note, I've been having some not so pleasant side effects when I've been taking the Spiro. In particular, leg pain/numbness that goes into my foot. This has been a pretty consistent effect. My current doctor believes it's all in my head, which maybe it is. Anyways, he says Finastride is my alternative but that it's nowhere near as effective and probably wouldn't work on me because I have too much T.

Anyone have experience with Finastride?

****

**PS** In the last week or so am starting to feel the effects of the HRT! So that's cool. Just wanted to brag."
__its_only_me__,asktransgender,Well... I'm out to my parents now...,"I don't know. That was way harder than I thought it would be. Even opening the conversation. I was like ""mom... I'm... Uh.... I don't know how to say this...""
And she's like ""are you telling me you're gay?""
And I respond: ""well, ya, but not in the way you think...""
A few awkward sentences later- ""do you mean... You think you're transgender???"" Hearing her say the word transgender, well, all my confidence went out the window.


Not the greatest way to start an already tough conversation.

It went okay overall. Both my parents know now. My dad's response at hearing was ""okay, what can we do to support you?""  My mom thinks I may just be confused. I told her I'm not, and she said I must be, because I've never talked about this with anyone before.  I've never really shared things (by this I mean my feelings) with my parents... It just feels awkward and unnatural.

My mom said this came as a major surprise for her. She had never even considered... She thought I was gay. She also suggested I might be an overly feminine man.  Don't get the wrong idea though; she was supportive, and wants to help me figure out what's going on.

If anything, I get to see a gender therapist now.

I dunno. That was way harder then I thought it was gonna be. Both my parents said it had never even crossed their minds that I might be trans. Honestly, I thought they would be picked up on *something*.  I kept things to myself for a Long time, but I didn't know I was that good at it. I always wanted to paint my room pink when I was younger... I always wanted long hair. I suppose it was never obvious that I would have loved to wear a dress or anything like that. I see women walking down the street and know that something *isn't right* with me. Not that something is wrong; I think there's a useful distinction between something being not right and being wrong, if that makes sense.

Okay. I just wanted to write something. Not exactly a question, I suppose. If anyone has any thoughts, few free to say something. Okay, I'll stop typing now."
I_hate_naming_things,asktransgender,I think I'm developing some genital dysphoria,"Alright, I finally come to terms that I'm transgender, but I still don't want to be a transgender. Apparently, most trans feels this, after doing a little search in the matter. Anyways, I recently got some women clothing, and since then, everyday when I get back from work I put on the panties and bra. Now comes the problem with tucking, I get extremely aroused when I start the process of tucking or putting the underwear on. The first time I put them on, and I looked at my penis and said ""Why do you have to be there?"" (One of the things that made me finally come to terms) 

I've always been fine with it, it never really bothered me as it does with a lot of MTF. Today, I tried to use the tape method to tuck. I got it to semi work, it still gets semi hard every now and then. I'm absolutely loving the way it looks, there's just one thing that's wrong, it's still there. I'm actually growing to hate my penis now, but when I'm in boy clothes, I'm back to being Ok with it. 

Has anyone else suddenly started to hate their penis after being fine with it for so long? Or is this normal for most MTF to start to hate their penis more after accepting to being transgender?"
teeno731,asktransgender,"""Am I trans?"" post #244089-C137","Hey everyone,

So, I'm pretty new to the idea of being transgender. I've known almost no trans people throughout my life thus far, and I certainly don't know anyone who's been in my situation before, so I've not really got anywhere else to ask for help but places such as this. Here goes...

I'm certain I'm not the first to say any of this, but I've always kind of contemplated the feeling that I'm a female in a male's body. That is no recent thing, I've done it since I was about eight years old, but since then I've really been convincing myself that it's because I grew up with little male influence besides my dad, who I never really bonded much with, and instead with a mother who spent much more time with me, a sister, and two female cousins who we visited frequently. 

My personality today, at the age of 19, is hard to pinpoint as male or female, as I have an annoying case of mild autism and my many feminine traits could be due to my bisexuality. I usually relate more to female characters in fiction, I tend not to develop feelings for someone based on looks, and the idea of being the dominant one in sex is a real turn off. I've also been told that I'm a very sympathetic and caring person, which is only punctuated by the fact that I'm currently studying to be a primary school teacher. I also cry much more than any man I know.

On the other hand, I am much more attracted to women then men, my interests and hobbies are far from feminine (Most of my spare time is spent on Reddit, playing action video games and watching anime), and the vast majority of my friends are straight men and queer women. 

However, the one thing that kind of has me kind of convinced of me being a woman is the fact that I absolutely hate having a male body. I sometimes look into the mirror and just think *why the fuck do I look like that* and even feel best when I notice slightly curvy areas in my body. I've tried on women's clothes on several occasions, and I cringe a little every time I am called masculine or manly. If there were a pill I could swallow that would make my body completely female, I'm about 70% sure I would take it take it. 

Of course, that isn't an option, and the available options are quite daunting, which is the largest part of why I'm so hesitant to think of myself as a woman. I don't have much of a feminine body In any way I can't control. My shoulders are extremely broad, my jaw's width would give John Cena a run for his money, and my hands and feet are pretty gorilla-like. Not to mention that my voice is unmistakably male. 

I'm not awfully worried about being discriminated against (I live in Melbourne, Australia which is a relatively liberal area and go to a university with fantastic LGBT support), but because of my body's masculinity I feel that I'm too far gone from being remotely passable as female, not to mention my already present fear of being judged by my looks. But worst of all is the transition itself. 

I've never been that great at making any commitments or decisions in general, and the process of becoming a woman is far too terrifying to be an easy one. I'll have to have my only chance of having children discarded unless I end up in a lesbian partnership, any sex I have will only be a fraction pleasurable of what it would have been due to an artificial clitoris and presumably no natural lubrication, and my voice will never really be female without some incredibly lucky surgery an constant effort from myself. And did I mention having my penis cut off?

So I guess I should probably get to the part you fantastic people can help me with (specifically the MTF section, sorry lads): 

- What is left to know about being a trans woman? 

- Do I really qualify as one? 

- For those who were once in my position, what did you do and how did it go?

- Is it really possible to appear completely female after male puberty?

- Would transitioning make changes that I might not have thought were possible? 

- At what point during a transition can you really not return to being male in body?

Thank you so much to any replies in advance, and my apologies to any misconceptions I may have stated about being transgender, I am very uninformed about the topic myself."

trahhh,asktransgender,My successful trans friends have supportive partners or/and families. I'm single and my family is trash.,"If someone's made a sub for complaining about trans shit then I apologize for misplacing this thread.

I'm 29, mtf, and have been transitioning for close to five years. I moved to the big city from a cow-country satellite suburb almost three years ago. And, looking back, I kind of rushed things. Rushed them because it was so important that I get away from my shit family, but I could have prepared better. 20/20 hindsight etc.

Lately I've found myself hanging out with my friends and noticing that they're all partnered, while I'm single and struggling to find a job/direction. They regularly visit their families, receive help from them and stuff. It's hard not to get bitter about it.

I'm gonne be, ***fucking*** proud of myself if eventually things work out and I turn my mess of a life into something even a little bit enviable. Until then I wish I had some Possibility Models.

Tortferngatr,asktransgender,(MtF) What qualities would you all recommend I *consider* when looking at my options for GRS?,"Like what aspects of surgery, aftercare, pricing, insurance, location, surgeons themselves, etc. do you all recommend I be thinking about when deciding on who to see for GRS (and when to do so)?

Stuff I wouldn't likely expect to need to consider is especially appreciated, but more typical stuff is good too.

I've been having some genital dysphoria lately and wanted to do something about it, even if it won't have an immediate payoff. I'm vaguely leaning Suporn, but that's without much real action taken towards actively researching his results.

I also know I don't want a non-cavity version of GRS (I'm bi, and lacking a vagina is a dysphoria sore spot for me.) I also know that I want to keep some erectile tissue (since I know that the clitoral bulbs are a thing in cis women.)"
fizzyizzy11,asktransgender,Cis/gay guy wondering: how do you feel about the bathroom situation?,"First of all, I'm very adamant about allowing trans individuals to use the bathroom corresponding to their gender, and I think that a lot of these current issues come from religious people being freaked out by it.

Now, I'm not trans, so I would like to hear from you all: why exactly does it matter? Sorry if that sounds rude, I'm not sure how else to put it. I really do want this change and I'm glad it's occurring, but I want to hear from real individuals.

I'm sorry if I sound ignorant, I don't have many trans friends to ask (if any). I would be happy to share my thoughts, so ask if you like, but I'd prefer to leave it to replying in the comments after I hear your opinions.

Please, enlighten me on your opinions. Thanks!"

I would be ok with not passing at school because it is a really lgbt friendly campus, however I would want to be completely passing at work and in public. So I was considering just going as male at work and female at school until my voice and mannerisms are what I want them to be. I pass pretty well physically already, however my voice and mannerisms are something I'm still working on and I don't think I can pass on those within the 4 months until I move to Portland. I also would start hormones within 6 months of starting Portland state. When I feel I could be passing in public, I would quit my job and find another so I don't have to come out in my workplace.

Refuryyu,asktransgender,Has anyone had a date who initially didnt like that they were trans and warmed up to it?,"Im 20, he is 21.  I met him a month ago and let me take some time to tell you how *fineeeee* he is. Im 5'10 and usually I dont find guys that are taller than me (national average for men is 5'5""). He is 6'1"" and has a great body and his *face* is something else lol i wish I could post a picture but I dont think he'd like that very much. Also he is one of the nicest people Ive ever met, honestly I think he's the type who got hot in their teenage years because, for his looks, he's a really humble guy, not conceited, not obsessed with himself.

 Anyway I met him in a cafe and we hit it off. We texted for like 4 days and then on saturday we went on a date. At some point we walked into a park and I could see that he wanted to kiss me so I stopped him midway and said I was trans. He was confused for a bit, and then he said he wasnt into that kind of thing and that I should have told him earlier. He was really calm though, and he said he'd hail a taxi for me and pay for the taxi fare.

I was broken of course but not for long. He texted me a day later, and said he wanted to remain friends because he liked my ""energetic, comic personality"" and that I made him laugh a lot (which is true). On the next saturday, we went to watch a movie, allegiant, and afterwards at a restaurant we talked about how they could have made it better. *finally i had someone to talk about movies with*. Then he paid for my taxi again and I went home. 

I couldve seen him on sunday but he was with the bros. i saw him on monday night at his place. I played on his playstation whilst he did his university assignment. I helped spell- check, and as i was on the desk, his hands rested on my shoulders and he said, ""How are you so good at finding errors?"". His hands were on my shoulders for longer than id expected them to be but thats when I *knew*.

On the weekend we hung out again. My place, although its a hole. Obviously he said he liked it. Played his playstation throughout the day. What had unsettled me though was that he had called me ""dude"" thrice, and I was now confused again. Like I thought we were making progress? (I later found out he calls everyone dude but still ��)

I didnt see him the weekend before last, but we used the new snapchat video chat feature thing a lot. I saw him this weekend though, yesterday night.

We were both free. No assignments, no other plans with other people. Went for a movie (batman vs superman. ""Meh"" we both thought afterwards). Sat at a table and ate. Went for a walk to the park came back to the place where i got my taxis. I was facing him and I dont know how we had gotten that close to each other but *he* kissed *me*. There was no way I would have initiated that kiss, I didnt want to put our friendship at stake. But he's the one who moved forward. And it was a long kiss, maybe half a minute, only stopping because a taxi had come into view. I hurriedly said ""later"" not looking at him because I felt so awkward ( never kissed a guy before. Never even dated one before. I got hit on all the time by men but I was just too scared).

Anyway, when I got home, where theres wi-fi, my phone exploded with texts.

Him:  I hope I didn't force you to do anything you didn't want to do

Him: You seemed a little tense

Him: ��

I didnt know what to say, really. So i thought and thought and said: 


Me: hey. Hope you got home safe



 and he replied immediately

Him: Hey. You too. What we did back there how did you feel about that?


Me: i liked it. Haha

Him: ��

Him: Me too

Him: You're a good kisser haha

Me: youre being nice��

Him: No I mean it though you're a pro haha. This feels weird though.

Me: youre not gay dont worry haha

He took a while to reply and I thought id said something wrong and then he said

Him: Sorry got a call from home. Where were we? Can I call you?

When He called he kept saying that he felt good about this, that he thought he was maybe falling in love with me, and i dont know, I just began to cry and then he said he'd call me tomorrow, which is today. When I woke up for school, there was a good morning text. With a ��. Lol he had never sent me that before, i was like ""whaaaa"". 

I think this is happening way to fast for me. I mean I really, really like him but my mentality wasnt prepared for something as quick as this, it had settled for friendship, even though I had kind of *known* that it would come to this. Im thinking also that he might want to have sex later on, and then he wont like my penis. And ive never been in a relationship, i have no experience, he's gone out with so many girls, i saw their pictures, gorgeous girls they were, and im afraid I wont be up to their standards. 

Has this happened to someone and how do you deal with it? Gosh this was so long sorry.

lIlIIlIllIlIIlIIIllI,asktransgender,Is my nephew transgendered?,"So, today my sister told me that my nephew intimated to her he wanted to be a girl.

He's 19.  He's always had a tough time growing up, quit school for a reason we didn't know  at the time, has never had a job, sits in his room playing video games all day, etc.

I am ignorant of how this works.  Although I don't have a problem with it, I never suspected it. I thought he might be gay but that's not the same thing and I don't have a problem if that was the case either.

Other than the social awkwardness and him quitting school which would indicate some problem, I've never seen him display any characteristics someone ignorant like me would think were tell-tale signs.

He didn't gravitate toward girly things growing up although I wasn't living with him, so I may missed a lot when I wasn't around. But most likely, I am just pushing my own uneducated assumptions on the situation.

The thing is I don't know if he's telling the truth or not.  He only told my sister in confidence, so I cannot confront him with it.  It needs to happen naturally.  But I don't know if he just said that because something else is bothering him.  I doubt it though.  If so, that confession is a pretty big cover up.

I do know my sister received some lingerie items in the mail and he admitted they were his.

I know that some in my family would have hard time with this, especially my older parents, his grandparents.  Though not hateful people by nature, they are in their upper 60's and set in their ways and have their beliefs about what the world should be like.

Anyways, it hasn't even gotten to that point yet.

What can I do as someone who cares about him to prepare for the day he decides to tell the rest of his family?

I wouldn't even want to tell him 'I accept it', because to me, that seems like I'm giving him my approval for him to be who he is.  I just want him to know it's ok and it doesn't matter to me in the least.  The only thing that matters is that he's happy.

Other than this forum, what else should I be doing? Should I even be doing anything or should I just wait.

That's all I have for now.  I look forward to your responses. "
MaybeAngela,asktransgender,Gender Critical Feminist working as an operator for Trans Lifeline???,"Am I crazy to be concerned about this. Here is the backstory I will try to keep it short. 

I was commenting on a Huffington Post women's article on Facebook about the trans bathroom issue. I got sucked into a long drawn out debate with a TERF, it wasn't the worst experience I've ever had but it was bad enough.

 Like people do, I was looking at her Facebook page and saw that she belonged to a gender critical Facebook group so I went to check it out. It was full of the uncritical kind on nonsense, straw men and circular reasoning I have come to expect from GC folks, nothing new or interesting to be found. Then I found that one of the people heavily commenting on there was a gender critical trans woman.

 She was using the ""Swedish Study"" as proof that transition was harmful and led to high rates of suicide, was using terms like MTT, and had bought in heavily to AGP as a cause for trans fem identities. All of this is fine, I have no problem with a trans person who wants to associate with gender critical feminists. I think it is insanely harmful to their own wellbeing and health but whatever to each their own, she has every right to develop her own personal philosophy.

 Here is were I run into serious difficultly, this trans woman has on her Facebook page many trans positive posts like you would expect an average trans person might have and claims to work as an operator for Trans Lifeline.

 Is this at all appropriate that a gender critical trans woman who rejects that trans people are the gender they identify as, works for an organization serving the most vulnerable and at risk members of the trans community? Am I wrong for thinking that this is a problem?"
abhpro,asktransgender,Did anyone else feel an immense sense of depression after realizing they were trans?,"24 MTF here. I only started to fully realize I might be trans in the last couple weeks. I've had these feelings for the last year, but I always shrugged them off as fantasies until recently. 

A couple days ago, I felt like I had accepted it and even came out to two friends through text. I felt so happy for most of the day and felt like I finally discovered who I really was. I was thinking ""this is it, I've accepted that I'm going to transition into a woman and I don't give a fuck what anyone thinks. I'm going to be so much happier"". 

But today, oh my god... I went right back into denial and could barely speak to anyone at work cause I just constantly felt like I was going to cry. At one point, all my feelings about being trans went away and I was thinking again that I wasn't really wanting to be a woman, and that it'd be a mistake I'd regret if I transitioned. And right now I just feel this horrible depression. I've never really been depressed like this before, and I've never had suicidal thoughts until today. I'm just thinking I don't know what the fuck I am or what I want and maybe I'll never know the rest of my life and just always feel horrible. 

Right now, the idea of me putting on makeup and identifying as a female is fucking ridiculous and embarrassing, but at the same time I *want to want it*, if that makes sense. I want my mental state to go back to a couple days ago, where I just said ""fuck it I'm a girl, and fuck anyone who hates me, I'm happy"". But right now I feel like life is over or something.

I'm trying to get an appointment with a therapist soon, and maybe HRT will help me mentally. And I'm sure plenty of people went through an emotional rollercoaster too. It's like once the idea popped into my head that I might actually be trans, my emotional state has gone both higher and lower than it ever has before. Before, I kinda just felt emotionless and life was grey and monotonous. Hey, for better or for worse, at least I'm feeling something now. "
imstuffed,asktransgender,"I'm pretty sure I'm trans, but I'm destroying myself over it.","When I was in  my mid teens I always had a fascination for transgender transformation erotica and something about it always made me feel comfortable when reading it and it didn't click till many years later that it really did comfort me and I would be much more content being a girl, able to dress pretty, do my hair, paint my nails - and this has continued on now for many years.

For the past 8 years or so I've slowly been sinking into this depression and I don't know why. I've got a great girlfriend that I love, a great job, opportunities people would kill for but instead I've let myself get fat and shaggy, every year I'd go through this weight loss faze and I'd feel good about myself but ultimately I would see the futility in it all and just go back to my old habits.

I was always a very outgoing person and have become such a recluse. Being a social creature, this kills me but I would rather stay at home and jerk off to transgender / straight porn as it gives me relief putting myself in the girls shoes, and it's become such a problem I'm doing this all the time pushing the limits of my time and punctuality by choosing to do this over say meeting someone on time. 

Would I like to have been born a girl over being a boy? Absolutely. I feel as though I have a unnatural aggressiveness as a man but was always seen as the caring and gentle one growing up with a natural resistance to do the 'manly' thing, but this has long faded.  

My biggest problem is that I've led such a sheltered life. I always think will I regret giving up my amazing girlfriend who wants to have kids with me and settle down, what will my family think? Will I lose the remaining friends I have left? Am I going to risk it on something that could just be a fetish? And it tears me apart so much.

I have seen a doctor about it but they couldn't really provide me with any kind of validation or help. I've thought about DIY hormones for a month and see if I have that natural resistance to them or whether it makes me feel better as a test. 

All I know is I'm lost and I'm slowly killing myself."
TeannasaurusRex,asktransgender,Question about coming out at work.,"I had a chance to speak with HR today, and they informed me that as soon as I'm ready to let the rest of the office know I can change my name in our systems, basically go full time. I was told that I can have HR send out a message, I can have my department manager send something out or I can send something out myself. I'm not quite sure I want to send something out myself, the people that know I'm trans, about half my department, I felt comfortable telling them. The remaining people I don't know them that well and don't feel that I could personally come out to them face to face. I have no fear in them knowing, but just cant tell them like I told everyone else. Now, do I ask HR to type something up, they offered that I could take a day or so off and comeback after they tell everyone. Has anyone had HR tell their coworkers that they are transitioning/going full time? I'm just looking for some advice on how I should come out to the rest of my office. I was planning on coming out in the next month, but I thinking about it I want to do it sooner and just wanted to know some other peoples experiences coming out at work and or openly transitioning at work."
fkmylife666,asktransgender,What name do you use in your head?,"So I was at the gym yesterday and had absolutely no motivation, normally when this happens I'll think 'come on *birth name* do you want to look good or nah?!'

What's weird is hardly anyone actually calls me that right now so I don't hear it all that much.

How long does it take to get used to and does it ever feel normal? Or is it always a really awesome feeling lol?"
reindeer_olive,asktransgender,Out at work; what to expect?,"On Tuesday, after careful consideration, talking with my folks, and some phone dialogue with district HR, I came out to my store manager in a private meeting with him and the HR manager (assistant store mgr.). It went delightfully, i'm happy to say!!

While little of substance happened in the half hour meeting, there's not much to do anyway. All I needed anyway is a new nametag, the bathroom flip, and for my direct supervisors to be briefed. The bathroom is tabled until he calls district HR for guidance, for this is his first experience with a trans employee.

~~

That was Tuesday. Tomorrow (Thursday) is my first shift since then. I don't expect a day and a half was enough time for the behind-the-scenes work I mentioned MGMT has to do. Maybe it was though.

I told him that he has my love and support no matter what, and that I would try to help in whatever way I can to help him figure out who he is, but I'm internally a little conflicted. If he says that he wants to be fluid between genders, is does that fall under trans? I know I said I would help him (even though I myself am not exactly a great resource on femininity), but I'm not sure I'm doing everything I can to help him and feel bad not telling him that's I might need a second to get used to it. I love him and want him to be happy in his skin, but I feel bad when he says he wants help, but doesn't talk to me about anything else.

kidikur,asktransgender,Should I come in person or via Email?,"Hey, So I have been seriously considering trying to start my transition/get HRT recently and the main obstacle to that is my dad. I'm still on his insurance/live with him so I have to fully come out to him first. I'm having a hard time deciding the best way to do that.  Here is a summary of our relationship pertaining to my gender so far:

*  I halfway mentioned that ""I am questioning my gender identity"" to him awhile ago and he said he would be supportive but suggested I ""Try socializing more with people from both genders to see where I fit in."" 
* A week or so later I mentioned to him that I was thinking about just trying to ignore gender roles and do my own thing. He told me that I shouldn't wear a dress. Which at the time felt like he just ignored everything I told him and shot me down.
* 
He believes therapy is a scam so I had a hard time getting a therapist. I originally tried to get one with his help and I implied in conversation that the stress of all this was making it hard to focus on my studies. He got frustrated and said ""Oh what is this about your transvestite shit?"". I left the room and he apologized a few minutes later saying he didn't know that I was going through something and that he doesn't know what to do. 

* I need to fully come out to him if I want to start HRT soon. The problem is I seem to care about his opinion more than anyone else and the thought of him rejecting me terrifies me to the point I have trouble articulating my words face to face. Should I woman up and try to do it in person regardless? Or should I just email him? 


Sorry for the length of this post. I just felt like it was important you understood the context of our relationship right now. Any insight or answers you could offer would be greatly appreciated!

NaomiOni,asktransgender,Will being overweight affect my ability to start hrt? (Mtf) also other things. :^l,"Never thought about this until I read online about a transwoman's endocrinologist wouldn't give her hormones because of her weight. I'm  really overweight... I haven't measured myself but I think I'm over 300lbs... though to be fair I'm 6'1. I have a horrible beer belly. :/ Also still confused on if my manfats will move around once I start hrt over a period of time. (I'm 20 years old and I plan to start in the summer).

I feel like I'm too old to pass and that testosterone has messed up my body too much for me to be at least passable. I'm insanely hairy and I have an Adams apple. Though one good thing is that my relatives told me I sort of have my mom's fanny... even though I haven't started any hrt. I've been really depressed lately and having suicidal tendencies though I'm too lazy to act on them. I don't get out of my bed often unless I'm job hunting, at school or doing schoolwork. 

I mean I'll still try and transition now but I'll probably be unpassable. I'm trying to stay positive but my Trans friend told me that being black and being at my current age means I'm pretty much on deadlock when it comes to remotely passing as a woman. She also added that being black exerts more masculinity and that I should try to live as a woman in my private life rather than make my life harder and do what I want. She also stated that if I try to go out as a woman I'm making my fellow Trans people in the community look bad because of my impassability.  I guess I'll try to ignore her because I feel like she's wrong deep down inside. I've been down in the dumps for months after hearing this from her. 

I'll try to hope for the best though. I heard hormones can do amazing things.  ;p 

(ps: does anyone know if injections&gt; pills because I think I'm going to just be really unpassable... I want to do anything I can to boast my chances for passing even if it's 1%)"

literallymagic,asktransgender,Should I go to my family reunion?,"This would be my first time going to one since I realized I was trans a decade ago, let alone since I actually started transitioning. Some of my relatives know, some don't. Some of the ones who know are on my side, some aren't.

More specifically, my 83 year old grandma is 100% on my side, as are my family here in town (my mother, my grand-aunt, my grand-aunt's kids and grandkids). My aunts, uncles, and cousins, however... not so much. They're all extremely conservative of the ""genuinely thinks Sarah Palin would be a great president"" variety. One of my uncles just plain doesn't accept that I'm trans. One of my aunts thinks it's some kind of alter-ego thing. Another uncle doesn't know because I've been advised straight-up to just never come out to him.

I don't think I would be in any actual *danger* by coming out, at least. Not with my grandma there. She and her sons might not agree politically but they all respect her a lot. But I'd run the risk of making the whole thing awkward for everyone, and of course a lot of them would blame me for it.

I don't know why it's at all important to me. I was never close to them, even before I knew I was trans. But then, before I knew I was trans, there was so little doubt in my mind that they accepted me for the shy little nerdboy that they saw me as (and that I thought I was) that it didn't even occur to me to wonder.

Of course, this all hinges on it not being in Tennessee or North Carolina, which, if it is, fuck that noise. I'd rather take another test on logarithms than have to deal with that bullshit."
WhteJoe,asktransgender,"Hey asktransgender! Euro Trans, I need your opinion!","Hey beautiful people,

I'm French and currently working on a research project on the **perception by EU LGBT of their rights situation in their country**. 

Every year, [The Rainbow Index](http://www.ilga-europe.org/resources/rainbow-europe/2015) publishes a report which ranks each EU country based on their handling of LGBT rights and issues. I want to find out whether these results reflect reality. I would love it if you could help me do that.

If you live in **any European country** and you're interested in giving me a hand (hehe) for this project, here are questions you should answer (you can PM me your answers if you'd rather):

You can access the [survey here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/898XBPT)

* 1- How do you **perceive** the state of LGBT rights in your country? (Let me know how you feel on a daily basis at home and **where you are from**)

* 2- How do you **reach this perception**? (What means do you use: personal experiences, social media, news, organisations...)

* 3- Are you **familiar with** the Rainbow Index?

If there is anything else you'd like to add, please feel free to do so! 

I'm also available on Kik for a chat, find me on: JoWhte.

A million thanks and hoping to hear from all of you soon! Don't hesitate to ask questions.

joojooberry,asktransgender,"Any thoughts on curious lab results? (estrogen and testosterone levels, MTF) So, how am I going to suppress that T?","With a physician visit coming up, I just got some labs done 60 days into the following regimen:

* 1mg estradiol oral (not sublingual) x 1 per day (1mg) (one in the morning)
* 50mg spironolactone x 2 per day (100mg) (one with breakfast, one with dinner)

The results were as follows:

* Testosterone total: 284 ng/dL
* Estrogens total: 205 pg/mL

First, when I saw the testosterone, I was a little disappointed that we're not suppressed. Spiro doesn't directly suppress testosterone - fair enough. Not totally surprised because I've not been blown away by any feminization.

Estrogen, however, really surprised me. That's about what we're shooting for right? Could my calculated estrogen levels have been positively influenced by the fact that I got the blood drawn just two hours after taking my 1mg estradiol (note: orally, *not sublingually*)? If so, does that mean it's possibly not in range at other times? Or should I let the fact that it's hitting 200 at all be enough to suggest that I'm in range? I'm also concerned we didn't explicitly check for estradiol - it's possible that high estrone levels are inflating that estrogens figure, right?

So, do you maybe guess that we may double up on the spiro to work harder on suppressing that T? And would it be unthinkable to raise the dosage of estradiol, specifically to *help* with suppressing the T, or am I already at the max? It just seems weird that I got there with 1mg of estradiol per day *orally*.

Let me be the first to express regret that my physician didn't order some labs before I started the prescription, because now I feel we're missing out on some clinically important information. I think knowing the baseline would really come in handy."

I'm curious about cardio specifically, since endurance seems related, but not quite the same. Women have lower run times for races of all kinds, so there's some kind of effect. But is it just speed that's affected? Or is endurance impacted too? I'm thinking those are presumably connected.

A few months ago, I came out to my really close friends. I consider them family. They were super supportive, and have been helping me a ton.Unfortunatly, they live very far away. Ever since then, I've been presenting fully female online, and I it feels great.

I have problems, though. I don't know how to tell my family. I live in a very conservative family deep in Oklahoma, and theres homophobia and transphobia everywhere. My dad is very anti-LGBT, and it reallyscares me. My brother is pretty liberal, but I dont know how to tell him either.. It really scares me that he will think less of me.

I've tried just putting it off, but I can't do that. I've become suicidal, and I hate everything about myself.. My voice, my body, how hairy my legs are..I feel disgusted just looking at myself. I broke down crying from my voice. I just cant deal with it anymore. My only hope is turning 18 and leaving, but I don't know if I can wait that long. I had to do everything I could to stop myself from overdosing myself on pills.

I told my dad, and he seemed.. I dunno. He said he was supportive, but he hinted about being against any form of transition. All he basically said was he would try to get me a therapist to help me sort out my head. After that, hes pretending I never even told him.

I don't know what to do anymore. I live in a small rural town with no LGBT support around, and little freedoms. I cant buy feminine clothing, or anything like that. My school is very anti LGBT. I really need some advice or support.

She asked few questions, coming out to conclusion that I'm just an crossdresser. Some of this questions sounded ridiculoes.
How my sex orientation have anything to do with me wishing to be girl? 
She also asked if I actually feel like a woman or man. This question was really hard
to answer. I said that I dont know. Then she started arguing that I know what it means to be male because I was born as one. In my opinion it's wrong.
I was born in male body but I dont know what it even means to be male so how am I suppose to know if I'm identifying as male or famale?
Now I dont know what am I suppose to do, alot of people recommended this theraphist but I dont think that she undertood me.

tanuki_chau,asktransgender,A question about how I view myself,"A little background on me: I've been on hormones for 19 years. I started when I was 14 and I'm 32. Over the years I've discussed my personal views on how I view myself in terms of my gender. 

For me I see myself as fundamentally male. I believe if you wanted an accurate description it would be my sex is male, my gender is a woman.

I see myself as male but I'm trans and taking hormones makes me happier and off them I feel miserable. While I understand that sex is not strictly binary, I don't fall into that. My chromosomes are XY. I'm not stating I'm some sort of second class citizen, or that I shouldn't use the women's restroom. I simply see it as, I appear as what most would consider female so I'll use the women's bathroom because of that. I just see what I see. Granted I do not view other individuals in this manner, it only applies to myself. My issue comes from the fact that a lot of people have said this view is internalized transphobia. The problem with that is I don't hate myself. I actually like me a lot. I just feel stating I'm female and a woman is denying who I was pre-transition. I guess my question is: Do you think this is transphobic? If this is transphobic then I'd like to know how and why you feel that way.

breawycker,asktransgender,How to deal with cis jealousy?,"For me the hardest Dysphoria to deal with is being jealous of cis girls.

Yes, that is how low I've sunk into my dysphoria. 

What do you guys do to deal with this? (This question is open to non-female identified trans/non-binary people)

Roku6Kaemon,asktransgender,Apologies,"So I'll keep it short and just provide some basic details about me. I'm 16, I've known I wanted to be androgynous or a female for at least years. I've actively pursued HRT and medical help through psychiatric medication and multiple therapists. My parents aren't really supportive but they've taken me to therapy in attempts to help me work out the issues. You see when I was 10 I had severe OCD and was hospitalised when I was 6 for a manic bipolar diagnosis. Both of my prior diagnosis don't really carry any weight in my life and are really just things for my parents to blame things on. My father is a psychiatrist so it comes naturally for him to diagnosis his children. My family consists of myself and 4 younger brothers. We are a very religious home but my parents generally don't actively hate on homosexuals. Outside of that church is a contentious issue because in NW Arkansas there are still some very backward social conservatives that attend church. I haven't been a christian in 6 years and doubted well before that. My extended family on my father's side is all highly religious however. Recently my parents divorced and I got into a physical confrontation with my dad (in which he was the aggresor) so DHS got involved but I still live with him half the time. I don't think I can coexist with most humans and a recent slip of the tongue made my girlfriend temporarily stop speaking with me (we do not call eachother girl and boyfriend but essentially we are). I've reached my stress capacity. There is no more hope of transition. I have a very deep voice and can't get close to passing in any way. My stubble grows back in less than a day. My adam's apple juts out just enough to give me a panic attack when I look at it. I'm so tired I'm not even sure how to freak out or cry. There's no more hope for me. I have a severe peanut allergy and a bridge that's just high enough for me to commit suicide. Maybe I've missed something and there's still hope. I'm likely going to have to becoms emancipated if I want to even try to transition. That would mean I drop out of highschool and have to struggle through minimum wage jobs even though I already score nearly 30 composites on ACT practice tests (done through my school). I'll wait a week but I don't think I could even enjoy trying to go out with a bang involving hookers and cocaine (thanks dysphoria).

Edit: Thank you for all the support, I'm but a lurker on reddit but this has given me some hope to at least keep fighting till I'm independent of my family."

Today has been a really good day for me personally. I don't know if it was the endorphines talking after a 10 kilometer bike ride or if I just woke up on the right side. But after I had showered and dried my hair I looked in the mirror and thought to myself ""My hair is growing, I'm loosing weight and I'm looking pretty cute/good today. Maybe things the future isn't looking so bad after all"" and I couldn't stop smiling for about an hour.

Then my brother and his fiance came over for dinner and we had a really good time hanging out, eating dinner and watching a movie. So yeah, a really good day! :)

Nataliewithasecret,asktransgender,Possibly Gender fluid?,"So my sex is male, and all my life I've gone between a desire to appear female or at least crossdress, and now I'm starting to accept it. 

Is anyone here gender fluid, bigender, and how does one really go about it? Right now I feel kind of trapped in my body because sometimes I want to be male, and then sometimes I have a very strong desire to be female.

modwizcode,asktransgender,Started HRT this past Tuesday,"It's so wonderful, I know it will be a long process but I'm so excited about it. (Maybe just a lot too excited ;)). I've been out for about a month (maybe longer) and I felt like finally making a post under my main account.

The process of informed consent was super quick too, I did all the consent stuff, got some labs taken and then they called in my prescription and I picked it up the same night. Blew me away how quick it happened.

Now if only I can start actively practicing voice out and about, without feeling too embarrassed. Very strange sometimes how talking in a non-deep but distinctly male voice while wearing a skirt can feel less awkward (in some ways) than trying to use a attempt at a female voice.

ricedoodle,asktransgender,Does anyone else miss transitioning?,"This may sound like a weird thing to say or maybe even difficult to explain why I feel this way. It's been awhile since I've came out and for all purposes, I've lived socially as a woman for years now. Now I haven't gotten everything done, but I've already dealt with the brunt of it, (Just SRS left due to financial issues) but sometimes I find myself strangely nostalgic for that period of my life.

Without a single doubt that it was one of the worst moments in my life and I have no real intentions of wanting to go through it all over again. I feel that it might even be terrible for me to even miss parts of it considering that I'm currently in a position that many would find enviable. Life is better than it ever was before, there's nothing like having the freedom to be who you are. As painful as it was, there was just something about it that made me so happy and excited.

I still remember the times I cried as I explained to everyone what I truly wanted to be and how many times my parents shut down the notion of it. I was almost stunned when my mom told me that it was okay for me to be who I am. I thought I'd cry tears of happiness but I couldn't even respond. 

I was so excited and scared the first time I wore a skirt out. There was nothing more I wanted than to wear one of those just like every other girl. I still remember the clinical smell of the doctor's office on my first visit, I could barely speak, there was so much pent-up anxiety that I felt like I was almost going to pass out.

I miss the days where I was slowly counting the days towards my first HRT prescription, my first step into changing myself. There was just so much excitement and fear going on into each day, everything was changing so rapidly. The steps taken towards it was painful and terrifying but it made me so incredibly happy just seeing all these small victories day by day, every single one of them felt like a dream coming true.

Life has been great, but it can be a little dull these days. I wouldn't ask for anything else.

"
EmilyATrans,asktransgender,Doubts,"I talked a little about this in another post, but I kind of want to go deeper. I'm going to ramble.

As far back as I can remember, I've felt like I was a girl. At school, any time they separated us into boys and girls, I would always fantasize about being placed with the girls. When I was 12, I started trying on my sister's clothes any time I was left alone in the house. I didn't know why it felt so right. I thought I was gay.

The gay assumption didn't last long, but I still couldn't figure out why I liked wearing girls clothes so much. Or why I got really jealous sometimes when I saw girls. Or why I would think about how great it would be if I was a girl. It all just didn't make sense to me, so I tried not to think about it.

A few years after that I learned about trans people and I knew that I was a trans woman. But I was so big and hairy and male; transition seemed impossible, so I suppressed those thoughts. Yes, I'm trans, but if I just ignore it, it will go away. Then I got into the kind of pornography that makes confused young trans girls think they just have a fetish (you know the kind). I tried to convince myself that was all that it was, but I knew better.

Then I got the idea that if I could come out as queer (I am into trans women and all that gay questioning made me realize that while I'm not into guys in any kind of significant way, I'm not against the idea of sex with a man either) I could feel like I was living openly as myself. Nevermind the fact that I was actively suppressing trans thoughts about twenty times a day.

That's where I was until two weeks ago. After years of chickening out, I told my two closest friends I was queer. Then an online support group thing I'm in. It felt great. But I instantly knew it wasn't enough. I was trans and that wasn't changing. 

Telling people I was queer was a relief of sorts, but it did nothing to ease the gender dysphoria I was feeling all the time. So I sent a message to the one trans woman I know. We've never met in real life. I told her I thought I was probably trans and we had a long conversation. Then she suggested I read Nevada by Imogen Binnie and sent me a digital copy.

After the conversation and reading the book, it became OVERWHELMINGLY clear that I was trans. Everything that I had ever felt about my gender was spelled out so clearly. I knew with more certainty than I've ever known anything that I needed to transition or I was going to be miserable for the rest of my life.

But in the two weeks since then (or more like a week and a half factoring in how long it took me to read the book), I've found myself prone to moments of doubt. Not all the time, but occasionally. Just this little voice in my head: What if I'm not trans?

This question seems ludicrous to me. I have problems with self doubt. I'd hesitate to tell someone that 2+2=4 without looking it up first. So of course I would doubt something as big as this.

I also think fear is a big part of it. The doubt tends to creep up when I'm around other people. It's really hard for me to imagine presenting female in front of others. Hiding my true self from everyone is something I've tried so hard to maintain for so long.

I've gotten so in the habit of telling myself that I don't need to transition; I think this doubt is just that old instinct trying to reassert itself. And I'm afraid that if I give into this doubt now, I'll spend another five years suppressing and then either have this realization that I need to transition again or kill myself. I tried to kill myself a few years ago because of how hopeless I felt and I can't go back to feeling that way.

There are things that have helped. When I came out to my best friend, I felt as sure as I did two weeks ago. When I talked to a therapist yesterday, I thought for sure I was done doubting. She asked me about my timeline. I said I wanted to be out full time by 30 at the latest. I said this because I have a tremendous fear of sounding stupid (even in therapy, apparently) and I didn't want to sound like I was rushing anything. Then she said, ""So you'd be okay living like this for another six years?"" My immediate reaction was ""Jesus Christ, no!"" 

But today I was hanging out with some friends and found myself doubting again. Even though as I was typing this I looked at my hairy man arms and got grossed out.

I want to start HRT. Everyone tells me I'll know for sure when I start HRT. But I'm on my parents' insurance, they can see when I go to a doctor and what kind of doctor. I can tell them I'm going to the therapist for anxiety. I can't really justify going to an endo.

So to get HRT, I have to come out to them. That's a worry itself, but now these doubts have me worried about telling them I'm trans and then a month later telling them I'm not. Even though I cannot imagine a reality where I'm not a woman.

So how do I get over these doubts? Knowing that it's just my coward brain trying to stop myself from pursuing happiness like it always does doesn't seem to get rid of them and I can't think of what else to do.

TL;DR: Despite a lifetime of evidence and experience supporting the conclusion that I am trans, my brain doesn't want to accept it. What do?

Bonus bit of levity with vague Star Wars spoilers: It's a wildly different struggle and I certainly don't condone what he did about it, but it's crazy how hard I feel for Kylo Ren when he says ""I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it."""

LarrissaM,asktransgender,I can't shake the feeling that I'm just playing a different character now...,"""All the world's a stage, and all the men and women are players"" - Shakespeare

In an effort to embrace the Larrissa part of my personality, I started trying to project that in conversations with others. I've softened my voice, trying to lose the gravelly male sound. I started using that in conversations with others at work. (I've hermitted myself from the general populace for the past two years since my divorce, so I don't have friends outside work-friends; I think primarily because I don't like being male-me. I don't feel like I'm interesting in any real way... massive confidence issues. Bleh.) I like the way it sounds so I kept going with it. I noticed a semi-immediate confidence boost from it. So I continued. 

I then told a few trusted friends at work. I feel like I strengthened my bonds with them by talking about my issues and thoughts. Everyone I've told has been super supportive. One co-worker who I didn't have any relationship with before we started connecting and working more fluidly as a team. And I am a good deal more outgoing with people because I'm enjoying projecting as Larrissa. As the person I want to be. I can definitely feel like my bonds with others is strengthening. 

But I can't help but feel like I'm just acting. I've always said that being an adult is just pretending you know what you're doing and flying by the seat of your pants. 

In being Larrissa, I'm building and strengthening friendships, and I find I'm really quite happy. I'm taking everything one step at a time. I'm enjoying this part of the journey. I look forward to work, where I've got genuine human contact and relationships, something I really haven't felt at any point in my life. I think about the future and the things I want to do. I want to fangirl over seeing Wil Wheaton at a con. I want to dress as Harley Quinn for halloween - and I haven't worn a halloween costume since I was 10. I have ambitions for things I want to do in the future, and I never really had those before...

But despite that, I don't look like the person I want to be. I want to be pretty. I want to wear a dress, and dance, and sing, and ... I don't want to damage what I'm building at what is one of the first few truly joyous moments of my life... I worry that I'll lose the career I worked so hard for if I transition. I still go home every day. I still sit at my computer and I look sadly into hearthstone and other video games and I continue to pretend I'm someone I'm not. I'll never get to be pretty or popular. The phone never rings. I'm just sad... I'm going through life alone and I need support and help or I'll never be able to go anywhere... 

I don't fucking know what I'm doing. I'm confused and lost. The other voice in my head tells me I don't know how to girl. I don't even know what that means. I'm just as fucked up as they say... 

I need to start a fucking blog. Blah. "

BWZA,asktransgender,can you be transgender without body dysphoria? (mild NSFW),"a few events in life have revealed a feeling that I think I've been suppressing for a very long time. I do not like masculinity and am skeptical of men and masculine people I do not know. I've always suffered from a self-hatred partially due to my own masculinity. and so I have, predictably, always been interested in feminine things but I've always been too embarrassed to engage in them. I had a talk with a friend recently and it brought to light my feeling that I would rather be a girl... and it's been something I can't stop thinking about. I don't know how I didn't realize this either -- I even had decided what my name would be if I was born a girl.

but I've never felt any uncomfortableness with my male genitalia. I know now that I want to be a woman and do wish I was born as one, but I have no resentment that I was born a biological male. i also have no plans to alter my genitalia (and in fact i enjoy the sex i have without any major hangups). does this not ""qualify"" me to be transgendered? are there any people here who have gone through HRT without the desire to change sex?"

BogeyOnYourTail,asktransgender,Has anyone decided not to transition? How did that turn out?,"I had my first appointment yesterday with a gender identity therapist, after realizing a few weeks ago that I've identified as a woman for most of my life. I'm glad to be finally taking steps to deal with this, but also want to be careful in making any decisions.

There are two obvious paths forward: transition or don't. And while transitioning would be great in an ideal world, there are obviously trade-offs. So I've been trying to get as much information as I can in order to make an informed choice, but while I can find a lot of research and stories about those who do transition, it's been tough to find information on transgender people who don't.

Does anyone know of any studies on how gender dysphoria evolves over time without transition? Any stories of people who have managed to make that work? I'm honestly not seeing how it can, but I feel like I need to at least research the option.

Also, any other studies that you think are particularly interesting or useful on the general subject would be most welcome! It never hurts to learn more. Thanks!

Drosophila_melanogas,asktransgender,Any of you later on got very disappointed in people you educated who seemed to have initially got the idea?,"I was educating someone from an IRC chat on trans issues, as he seemed genuinely curious and interested. 

I went at lengths into what gender dysphoria can entail and how it manifests/feels to which he seemed to have expressed empathy and concerns and he said he felt really bad people have to feel that way. 

I also told him about the neuroendocrinological theory behind being trans which seemed to have made him understand it's not a choice, and about discrimination statistics (and then hammering it in that even if it was a choice, who in their right mind would choose risking those + actively having the gender dysphoria?!) which made him sad again. 

He said he really felt like he should try to help somehow and he's sad that he can't. I told him he can spread awareness / stand up for trans people whenever the topic comes up online. He said sure, that's the least he can do.

Next time the topic got brought up, he did post, but the only thing he posted was ""I don't know about you guys, but I would never sleep with a transsexual."" Really?!... For context, the topic wasn't even about dating/sleeping with trans women, and it was even in an LGBTQ-accepting place where ""progressive"" (and ""pretending to be progressive"") people were thought of more highly...

I really don't feel mentally or financially ready to have a child within the next couple years, but I also don't want to wait 4 years to start hormones. We've talked about banking sperm, but she keeps saying it's too expensive and doesn't usually work. I guess I'm asking what options do I have. How well does sperm banking actually work?

**2** - **stupid bureaucracy**

**3** - **my mother won't emancipate me**

At least she won't do that until I have graduated. She just doesn't want me to screw up like she did, so I appreciate it. Still it stops me from moving away.

**4**- **transitioning in Germany is a waste of time**

The requirements are inhumane. For HRT only I need to do 1 year of psychotherapy, I need to do 3 years of real life experience, I need to get 2 psychological reports from independent psychiatrists, and I need to know about my gender identity disorder for a consecutive 5 years at the beginning of the psychotherapy.

I honestly don't have a clue how I am supposed to keep my life up. I feel like I'm breaking down any day. I have tried to wait it out for very long now, but I simply can't do it any longer...

**6** - **I can't even do it in private**

My step-dad is a bigot and ignores my privacy. I told him to stop several times, but he doesn't want to stop, and I can't open a lawsuit against him as long as I live in his house. However, I can't practice make-up, I can't practice my voice, I can't wear feminine clothing, and I can't even watch girly TV shows.

Is there any way for me to help put him at ease or make it easier for him to talk about? I wish I could figure out a way to let him know he can trust me and that I'm still very interested in him."

CyborgCity,asktransgender,Intersectionality and gender neutral bathrooms?,"Hey everyone,
my Uni (in the UK) is doing an assessment of things that could be improved for transgender people on campus. I would like to propose making all toilets gender neutral and I think there's a chance that might fly, but first I feel like I need to know a bit more about why people would want gendered toilets in the first place and how best to accommodate everyone. I'm having some trouble seeing beyond my personal excitement about non-gendered toilets and would really like some help thinking it through. 

So what are your thoughts: What kind of intersectional problems might come up if all toilets were gender neutral? Who would be negatively impacted and how?

Thanks!"

nate1000man,asktransgender,Why can't I come to terms with myself,I have always been looking in the mirror at myself even as a child wishing and hoping that i would one day turn into a girl. I remember thinking about wishing on a star and making bogus sex change potions at 12 or 11 looking into magic still blind to the real world and how things work. But after 13 i Attempted self harm with a hot glue gun trying to make breasts and then telling my mom i hurt myself. I remember the pain and hidding after that in the guys locker room  at school  in the bathroom  stall dressing and always being scared about someone finding my scars on my chest on top of feeling uncomfortable in the boys locker room and how comfortable everyone. Else was fine and cared about themselfs . After longer periods hurting of myself down there piercing through. Skin and having to get stitches having my parents yell at me for the expensive medical bills i stopped caring about myself at 16. I have felt like i can barely have any emotional feelings after all that i have been though and finally at 23 im admitting to myself that i am a woman. About two months ago i started hormones but i have not seen much change in my face thats the one thing i hate looking in the mirror and seeing that person you never were and having to shave and deal with all the hate you feel for yourself. I just dont know if my face will change to be as cute as the other girls i see walking the mall or at my work. How can i except myself and deal with this i just feel so lost and lone even with all the the support I am getting for my family and friends.

Today is my birthday. I'm 19 years old from today onwards. I can't let testosterone destroy my body any longer. 

But, I'm scared of not doing this right. 

Do you think I'm doing something wrong by getting hormones myself and using them? Should I not do that? 

I had a full blown blood check just two weeks ago, so I know I'm very safe. I'm a sickle cell carrier, and I have mild-hypothyroidism. But nothing that has anything to do with this. 

If it's not supporting the mafia or human traffickers or whatever else, is it still bad to do it yourself? Or at least start this way, and get my psychiatrist to lead me after a while? Would that be rude? Or in my case, is it an acceptable amount of rude? 

I'm just really scared of the future and society and family...etc. I'm just emotional right now, so I wanted to ask your opinion. 

Tl;DR: I know I need this. My psych won't give it to me not cause I'm not trans, but cause my parents aren't ready. It is safe and I'm not supporting any dangerous people, just a local pharmacy. Reddit, is it ok to self medicate? And if so, what's the best guide you can link me to? "

_lookinginside_,asktransgender,Need help fielding a conversation with my brother,"Here is our text conversation. How would you continue this discussion? Links, evidence, conversation, wording, anything accepted. I'm just really at a loss here.

----

**Me:** I'd really like to discuss this with you if you're willing, because what [this](https://scontent-sjc2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/13010594_625811397570633_5006213900072098277_n.jpg?oh=10c2561c520dcaea6c56f65b8718ea56&amp;oe=5773223C) post means to me is that you believe my huband and folks in his situation should be using the women's restroom and vice versa.

I don't want to assume I know what you think so it would be great if you could share your point of view on that with me.

**Bro:** If some older guy who ""thinks"" he should be a woman and goes to the bathroom with my wife and or daughter there's gonna be a problem. You put girls in a guy's bathroom and no one cares, however you put a guy in a girls bathroom and it's not OK.

It opens up a huge door for some jackass pervert to say ""I feel like a woman, I guess I'll just go to the little girls room""

**Me:** So then do you feel like people who are actually trans and not faking it should have the right to use the restroom of the gender they identify with, rather than the classification of their genitals?

**Bro:** My feeling is, and I know you're not going to like it, if you've got a dick your a guy, if you don't you're a girl. It seems pretty simple to me, but that's my opinion

**Me:** So that, to you, is the only thing that determines gender? Do you make a distinction between gender and sex?

If somebody's dick had to be removed then they are no longer a guy, right?

**Bro:** Depends on the circumstances, choice or life threatening.

----------

How would you respond to this? I don't want to just ignore it, so I'm not looking for that option. I want to continue to discuss this with him, but I just don't know what points to make now and how to word them.

Thanks!

----------

A little update for you all; here is how the conversation has been going, thanks to some advice here:

**Bro:** Depends on the circumstances, choice or life threatening.

**Me:** To me, these answers simplify the situation far too much. It doesn't allow people to be who they actually are and instead forces them to fit into a very small box.

There are legal protections and ramifications for people who enter restrooms and sexually assault people. It is far more dangerous for a person who looks like a woman to be forced to use the men's restroom and vice versa, than It is for trans folks to use the restroom of the gender they identify with. Plus, I feel like your wife would be far less comfortable seeing a person who has male genitalia but looks like a woman in her bathroom (because she would never know) than forcing a person who has female genitalia but looks like a man use the women's restroom. For instance, this person was born with female genetalia but identifies as a man: http://31.media.tumblr.com/79b1a87560961d115178eb05eacb8bfd/tumblr_inline_nl4aipQk0n1s0q1be.png
Genitals do not determine how a person identifies and it has been proven many times. So simplifying one's identity to strictly relate to their genitals is really demeaning and damaging.

If your son wanted to wear a dress sometimes would you deny him that? And if so, what is your reasoning?
It's difficult for me to wrap my head around your understanding of this situation, so I'm trying to get a handle on it.

If you have any resources I can read to help me understand I'll gladly take them. And of course I also have resources I can send you if you'd like.

**Bro:** You're gonna hate this...in my mind, God didn't make any mistakes. If he made you a man, you were meant to be a man and vice versa. If my son wanted to wear a dress I'd be concerned and try very hard to persuade him otherwise. I don't have any resources to back up my research, it's what I believe. It's what I was taught. It's how I feel. There is no amount of research that will make me change my mind because I believe what I believe. I don't hold being different against anyone until they start wanting special treatment because they ""feel"" different than what they were made.

And I'm still not sure why we have these conversations cause neither one of us is apt to change...congratulations by the way!!! Proud of you for getting the new job and happy for the big raise!

----------

I haven't responded to that last part yet - I want to cover how we're still talking about it because it effects my family and my life. I don't want to go see my brother anymore, because I know he doesn't actually support us. I don't really know how to word it though so he might be affected.

However, I do understand I may never affect anything. But I don't mind trying with one last comment. Plus, my brother's kids DO NOT need to grow up with such hateful rhetoric.

4riadn3,asktransgender,How do you all deal with colds?!?!,"I have one and it's killing me!

How do I deal with it or at least like, manage to speak higher without hurting it? I hate my voice "
-Naven-,asktransgender,I'm finally getting Lupron soon! :D,"Hiya, I've posted occasionally over that past year or so. I came out to my mother during April of last year. We went to a gender therapist, who then referred me to another one, who then referred me to an endocrinologist. I took one trip to the endocrinologist, another to get my bone density checked, and another to get my blood taken(which was on Saturday). I heard that the blood takes 4 days or so, and that my endocrinologist has my Lupron ready once the blood tests come in. I don't think I can possibly go much longer while listening to my voice dropping, so I am very glad I can finally get rid of the rest of male puberty. I'm also very thankful for being able to do this at 13! I just wanted to say this somewhere. Anyways, have a good day everyone! **Edit: Just wanted to say thanks to anyone that has replied.

She will read it in front of me, but I do not want to risk f-ing it up. Also, the beginning is just me apologizing for arguing with her (even if she argued with me, it creates a good flow into the trans stuff).

Dear Mom,

I am sorry for arguing with you so much last night. While neither of us we're right, I would just like to apologize for where I was wrong. However, I didn't write a letter just to tell you that I was sorry for fighting with you.

I also wrote a letter to say that I am sorry for how hard this is going to be for you. For about a year I have known that I am transgender, and just now I decided to tell you. Maybe you saw it coming (or you thought I was gay?), maybe not. Either way, I have no doubts that this hard for you to hear. Even when I was ten years old and had not learned what the word meant yet (I found the actual word about a year later). The best way to help me is via support. Maybe you suspected it, maybe you didn't. Either way, I'd be glad to answer any questions you have.

So what do you guys think? Feel free to make any edits and comment with them, it would be much appreciated.

JustSomeDude1687,asktransgender,Terrified of telling my parents,"Basically I've hidden everything that I've done that my parents wouldn't approve of. Everything, always. The habit of secrecy with my parents is so deep in me that the idea of telling them something this big, something so unexpected, is giving me panic attacks.

7775257,asktransgender,I am weirded out by the flood of high-profile support in the wake of HB2/NC,"So, this isn't a question. And it's not the most urgent statement, either. It's just been very strange to see so much support from celebrities, corporations and media outlets in the wake of NC's bathroom bill.   

Don't get me wrong. I'm not about to pen a letter to Bruce Springsteen telling him to withdraw his support, please. I'd rather Stephen Colbert make dumb, shallow jokes *mocking* transphobes than dumb, shallow jokes *reinforcing* transphobia. It's just that I remember the latter. It wasn't that long ago. It wasn't long ago at all that Target were being held up as a symbol of anti-LGBT corporations; now they're being held up as a symbol of pro-trans corporations. It's just strange. This should be a process, not a binary on/off switch.  

I'm skeptical, too, that any of this will actually address many of the systemic issues trans people face. Again, I'll gladly take some help in shooting down anti-trans state legislature as it pops up, and it'd be nice to see federal protections in the US eventually. But I'm so used to no one being on our side, and so many of our new allies are extremely clueless and/or have a history of transphobia themselves. I'm a little uncomfortable that we're just going to move on and never acknowledge that. It's definitely a pattern in US politics, and I think it does a lot of long-term harm. People in majorities internalize not that racism, homophobia, transphobia and misogyny are *wrong, full stop*, but that it's become impolite to *express* them; while people in minorities continue to struggle against systemic oppression, and are expected to just automatically forgive and forget injustices that are still happening to them.   

I guess I'm a little worried, because I feel like in the coming wave of New Trans Rights, I and a lot of other people who lack the adequate privileges will get left behind. Again.   

**tl;dr:** More of a vent than anything; glad to see the mainstream narrative shifting toward reason, but a little weirded out by how everybody's pretending they supported trans rights all along now, when they were all aboard the transphobia train just *last year*."

SO. A'ight. Hear me out. It know that it's bullshit. But is it 100% bullshit? A fear that I've ead is that I'm saying I'm trans for sexual reasons. Like, When I was 12, I liked writing, so I joined online RP groups. This led to ERP. (Yes, I was 12. No, I'm not proud.) But I played a guy a few times, the switched to playing a lesbian because I thought it was hotter and more fun. And, like. That was my first experience (that I can remember) of being girly, or whatever. Idk how to explain it. And like, there's certainly still a part of me that's very excited for a lesbian relationship and lesbian sex. At the same time, though, I'm hoping that that was just the first thing that kind of made me realize ""hey, things aren't congruent,"" because over the summer, I plan to start dressing, get a name change, all that, and hopefully start hormones by winter. But, i dunno, It's just something  I've been thinking about. I guess my main question is, should I be concerned? Does anyone else have any similar experience with this?

son_nequitur,asktransgender,Just wrote down some thoughts on transitioning. What do you think?,"Different body types have different ways they are allowed to move.

They are enforced by norms.

We see people moving in the world and develop triggers.

We don't want to move in ways that trigger us, but we are expected to because of our body type.

While we are allowing our bodies to move in those ways, we dissociate from those parts of our body.

If it happens enough, we get in the habit of dissociating from regions of our body entirely.

People who want to exploit bodies exploit those parts of our bodies, strengthening those triggers.

We become trans by finding new ways to re-associate with those body parts.

We re-associate by finding new ways to use them that don't trigger us.

Those ways sometimes require violating norms.

Living outside of norms around is battle, with other people and with the parts of yourself that are afraid of letting go.

But reappropriating part of your body is amazing."

##Some tips for working on your voice:

* Stay out of falsetto! Falsetto is only useful in finding your head voice, it's not a very good place to go for finding a voice to speak in. Falsetto is the vocal range above your normal vocal range, and you should feel a ""break"" in your voice as you transition from your normal vocal range up into falsetto
* Work on your resonance! You should feel no vibrations in your chest when speaking. The target you're looking for is your ""head voice""
* To find your head voice, try pushing your larynx (the thing your adam's apple is attached to) up as far as you can, and attempt to ""throw"" your voice out of the top of your throat instead of your chest. You should feel vibrations in your mouth, teeth, upper throat and maybe even your nose when you're doing it correctly
* Once you get your head voice, take your guy voice up into head voice and you should get something that starts to sound female.
* Talk to yourself in your female voice when no one else is around, so you can build up muscle memory

##How to rate others' voices

If you don't know the vocabulary to describe what someone is doing wrong, feel free to simply state how close you think they are to passing. Please be honest and respectful, and don't tell someone they pass when you know they don't so that they don't end up using the wrong voice techniques. There's nothing worse than building confidence in a non-passing voice and then realizing it doesn't pass later on and you wasted your time.

If you are going to post your own voice clip, please help others with their voices as well! The best way to make this a useful thread is for everyone to pitch in :)

shorttooth,asktransgender,"Safety for All Women, and How to Express That","First a bit of personal background... When I was a freshman in college (circa 2001) I was targeted by a male in my dorm room. He would come into my room without knocking and climb into my bed, sometimes he would hold me up against a wall, or just stare at me for hours; amongst other things. My roommates were great and we started keeping our room locked at all times to stop this from happening, but in some ways it became even worse. And then there was the bathroom, he would still come in whenever he suspected I was in there, using the toilet or showering. When the administration finally stepped in they asked him why he was in there he just said ""I am allowed to be in there."" Eventually, they had to make the whole building off limits to him to protect me, but it was a very traumatic semester. I rarely talk about what happened and actually have some gaps in my memory of that time because of how bad it became. *flashback ended*

Now fast forward a few years and I started hearing about people who identify as Trans using the bathroom they identify with to promote safety of the Trans community.  Great Idea!! I have first hand experience with how bathrooms/restrooms can be used to help abusers access their victims. No-one should be harrassed or abused when they are in a very vulnerable state.

The problem that I am having now is that I started hearing a lot about how cis-men are going into ladies rooms to have access to women with their pants down (pardon the pun). Although I don't have fear that a trans-woman will use the ladies room for sexual harassment, at least no more than a cis-woman; I keep having flashbacks to what happened to me in college. It was wrong and no woman, cis- or trans- should go through that. Furthermore, there is a huge rape culture on college campuses, I can't be the only one with a story like this. I tried to point out that protecting the Trans community does not mean that we ignore the community of cis-female abuse victims. I'm not even completely sure why this idea is offensive. 

Without sharing my story with the world (erm, attached to my name... on Facebook, with aunties and cousins to see). How can I explain myself without being offensive? Or is it intrinsically offensive? I hope not, I'm not trying to be. I just want all us ladies to be safe and happy. "

SecretOfficerNeko,asktransgender,Is 15% body fat a good place to start HRT?,"Good day to you all,

I've had to wait some time before I've been able to get access to hormones, but I chose to use that time to burn off as much of my fat as possible. You see, I was 243lbs (6'2""), and so I was pretty certain that fat distribution might be hindered by me weight. I committed and applied myself, and through strict diet and exercise regimes have brought down my weight to 185lbs.

I asked a friend of mine, and he estimated, based off appearance, that I'm probably ""a solid 15-16%"" body fat currently. I had hoped to bring myself down to about 10% body fat before I started hormone therapy, but I'm unsure about it. 

Is 15% body fat a good place to start hormone therapy? What (on average) should be the results of starting from this lower weight while on HRT? Should I shoot for a lower target, or should I settle at 15%? Is there a way I can know when I should gain body fat back, in order to bring myself up to healthy female levels (22%-24%), and maximize my fat distribution's feminizing effects?

Thank you, and have a wonderful day!"

I've been told I have some good features, so I mean, I'd like to at least apply and see if I could have any luck. (Not that I believe I would, but attempting would make me feel better.) 

So, anything? There was one site I remember that ELF was using called exploremodeling or something like that for example. I'd personally want to find ""gigs"" in Boston."

AZIRIDINIUM,asktransgender,"Any other ""girly girls"" here who think they'll have or are having an extended teenage girl phase and/or will dress age-inappropriately well into old adulthood?","I'm a trans woman who might at best only be able to transition in her very late 20s - early 30s, and I'm a girly girl, so I have a lot of regrets.

So I will probably overcompensate a lot and will have a very extended ""teenage girl phase"" and won't ever stop wearing miniskirts, etc. because if until now transphobia stopped me from expressing myself, then I won't let ageism continue to do so after I transition. I did hear of trans people even in their 60s-70s dressing age-inappropriately.

And I also heard quite a fair amount of cis people (whom otherwise seemed supporting) and even other trans people saying that trans people should still dress age-appropriately. Fuck that.

I'll only dress age-appropriately at work, since I work in a field that requires one to be taken seriously.

Though I do wonder sometimes if my colleagues or clients will take me less seriously if they recognize me outside of work and they'll see me dressing age-inappropriately. Not like that will stop me, but the thought still pains me sometimes. Ageism against femininity (and ageism in general) really sucks."
[deleted],asktransgender,Does anyone else completely regret everything?,"God, I don't know what to say at all. I want to end it all. There is this lush lust towards completely ending myself. If I could still buy a gun, I would blow my brains out. If financials wasn't a problem, I would carry 100Ls full of gasoline and become the beacon of all of my failed attempts. 

I have seen way to many psychologists, with absolute mixed reviews across the board. I have been fed numerous dumb down narcotics that is used to make you too unmotivated to even try, or others that gives off almost schizophrenic tendencies. Being locked in a psych ward around demented people and having too watch animal youtube videos as a healing process makes me infuriated with such untapped rage. One month, six times. Fucking doctors don't care. 

Ever since I came out, I fucking came out strong. But now all previous employers are trying to starve me out. Everyone knows. No one gave a shit. One year without work. Not a single fucking job. I have been living in my car for 12 months. I cant afford life anymore. I can't afford to eat. EI has been denied 3 times. My last employer mysteriously has a ROE completely disappear. I was flagged as fraudulent. Fuck me. 

I was offered a complete year of free financial help from the hospital, in the promise of seeing a guidance councilor that gave me a diagnosis of ""completely fucked up"" and attend transgender support group meetings. I couldn't do it. I went to one meeting, I went home and wrapped an extension cord around my neck. It sadly gave way. I knew most of these ""girls"". The have gloated about getting a free ride. Yet they cry about how hard it is for them. 

This is in my complete opinion, but I understand why people would hate ones such as myself. There is a big difference between Transgender and fag. I wouldn't take the financial support. I would never want to be labelled as one of the fags I see at these support groups. I am in full awareness at this point in time that it is my fault. That will  probably be why I will drive myself off the road, or any other method that she screams at me.

My family has put a restraining order on me, even after taking all of my belongings from all the work I have put in to get them. My sister let me stay with her for one month just to rub in how great her life is. I had to leave when her bi polar personality goes and uses me as a punching bag then runs to whoever and out right lies, saying I'm abusive after I tell her straight up I can't take her shit. Living on the street is a lot better then that.

No one will ever talk to me like a human anymore. I don't have an opinion that no long holds weight in any conversation. I got sick of being talked to like a fag by my girlfriends. Either I dropped them or they dropped me. 

I have spent the past year, waking up in the morning, dropping off resumes, smoking a few bucks worth of weed and then going to find whatever parking lot I can decide to slumber in. I have moved around dauntlessly. I maybe get to eat about 4 dollars worth of food everyday if I don't have to drive, then maybe it's days before I can decide if it's fiscally safe too eat. I get to bucket shower one a week.
I get one gb of data too play with once a month, but that time is coming to a close. I have made less than 4000$ this year alone, from selling my things, driving around picking up recyclables are selling copper from a place I know. This computer will be the last thing I would be able to sell. The car will maybe scrape 50$ from a pick apart. 

What I am getting at, is no matter what I do, I do not see the end of the spiral. I'm pretty sure this book is coming to a close.

"
NoIdeaWhereToBegin,asktransgender,"I think I might be trans (MtF) -- I have no idea where to even begin, though, and my life is already enough of a mess without the gender confusion.","I have no idea how to even begin, so I'm just going to go ahead and summarize my situation in a list:

- I'm a 23 year-old male. Bisexual. I've always had this nagging ""voice"" in the back of my mind telling me that I'd rather be female, but I've never told anyone about it. I even clearly remember feeling this way as a child, long before puberty or even knowing what sex or gender were. But I don't think I'd really be able to classify this feeling as actual ""dysphoria"", though, because while it's always been there, I've never really felt like it made me unhappy. Like, I feel like I'd be *happier* if I weren't male, but I've never really felt like being male was the *source* of any unhappiness, if that makes sense.

- I am currently struggling with some pretty severe depression, along with social anxiety disorder and attention-deficit disorder (inattentive). Life has been extremely difficult for me, which makes me feel -- and pardon my language -- *fucking pathetic,* because pretty much all of the hardships are caused by me simply not being responsible enough to do what everyone else does on a daily basis. I struggled through school because I constantly chose not to do homework; I'm regularly criticized as being lazy because I choose not to help out around the house; I can't hold down a job because I choose not to get enough sleep to show up on time, or simply don't care about the job or am just too miserable and lethargic to work at all. It feels like all of my problems are my own fault, and I'm aware of this and keep telling myself I'll change it, but I never do, and just keep on making things worse. And I can't use my mental health as an excuse; not only would that make me feel even more pathetic, having to fall back on excuses for being lazy, but what good would it even do? The world isn't going to just stop and coddle me until I feel better, and employers aren't going to pay me to not work no matter what excuse I have.

- I live with my parents, and have since high school. I am entirely too dependent, but am powerless to do anything about it. They are supportive enough to put up with me, but not without constantly reminding me how much of a failure I am -- I know they're not doing it maliciously, they just want to try and motivate me, but am it does is reinforce my social anxiety and depression. I've never held onto a job for more than a few months, which looks awful on my resume. I only have a bit of money saved up that I had hoped to use on college, but I have no idea whatsoever what I'd actually do in college, or what I want to do for a living. Honestly, I just don't want to do anything at all. My adult life should be just beginning, and yet I feel more like a child now than I ever have. Life is just too hard for me to cope with. Nevermind the feeling pathetic about it -- it blows my fucking mind that people are able to handle life at all -- going to the same job every single day, never having enough free time to enjoy anything, the constant barrage of bills... I just don't get it. I recently got a really nicely paying job, which I loved at first, but as the weeks go on the more depressed I'm getting, and the more I'm ending up late to work, or even not showing up at all. My parents are starting to charge rent now, so saving up money is that much slower.

- I don't have any friends. Aside from my immediate family, I'm completely socially isolated. I have been for years. I don't know how to make friends, or interact with them even if I did. I can fake it, but the entire time it's like my mind is just screaming at me because of how uncomfortable I am. Whenever my sibling(s) visit and the family spends time together, I'm usually downstairs alone. Not because I want to be, but because I just never know what to say, so I end up just awkwardly sitting there observing while they're all having a good time, so I just don't even bother trying most of the time.

- I want to see a therapist, but I literally don't have time to. I work 8 hours a day, 6 days a week, and it takes another 2 hours of commute each day on top of that. That's 10 hours a day, 8 to 6, with my only day off being Sunday. As far as I know, there aren't any therapists open during the hours I'm free. My doctor has noticed my depression and seems concerned, but being the idiot I am, I was too uncomfortable to give him a clear answer on whether or not I wanted help.

- And finally, on top of all that -- the reason I'm posting on this subreddit in the first place -- is that the more I think about it, the more I want to ""open up"" to myself as being transgender, which should be an eye-opening, soul-searchy revelation, but all it's doing is adding even more stress. I'm already past puberty, and if I decide I want to transition, I'm stressing that the longer I wait to do so, the less passable I'll look -- I've already got a lot of body hair and my hair has started thinning, not to mention my voice is masculine, (and not just masculine, but monotone, too, from years of repressing emotion around other people). I know that rushing this kind of thing isn't a good idea, and that I should get ask of my other problems sorted out first, but that could take years, and the clock's already been ticking for a while. I'm worried that I'll end up looking like a guy in drag, and will just end up regretting the whole thing. Assuming I can even *afford* to transition. Not to mention the transitioning process itself... I'm already too uncomfortable to function in public as-is -- it feels like everyone's eyes are always on me, judging me, no matter what, and it's torture. I can't even begin to imagine what that would be like if I were to start hormones or crossdressing. And that feeling's even worse with my family -- in public, I can just leave and never see them again. But if I'm awkward around family, they'll know forever. I just want to move out and ""disappear"" until this is all sorted out, then come back and reconnect with them as the person I'm supposed to be -- (not just gender, but general happiness) -- but I'm too dependent to survive on my own. And how would I even handle a job while transitioning? I can't even handle a job now! And even if I could, it'd just be like it is with my family: I see them every day, so the fear of their judgment is exponentially worse.

So... yeah. Kudos if you managed to actually read through all of that. I'm stuck in life and have absolutely no idea how to move forward. Does anyone have any advice? About any of that?"
trantastic,asktransgender,Do you feel that being openly trans is in any way activism?,"I've been out and about for quite a while now, and I was full-time before I started hormones. Not passing in the slightest while wearing a dress or skirt, or whatever clothing fits your gender identity is difficult. It's a constant stream of stares and quizzical looks while people process what's happening in front of them.

I think that in a way this is activism in a guerilla form. Being trans prety much necessitates flaunting your identity and disregarding social norms, and it challenges people's perceptions when they come into contact with you. It's not the traditional picket line or march, but it's a more widespread kind of message to normalise our identities and struggles. 

Do you consider this activism, or am I overthinking this?"

throwawaydontask1,asktransgender,I think I am seriously fucked.,"Hey. 

So I've been on hormones for 5 months now orally. (To put under the tongue to be more specific.) At first, my doctor prescribed me to take 4mg a day. But then later the month, I got really fucking greedy and upped my dose to 6mg. I've been on 6mg for couple months now and I kinda upped it to 8mg.. 

Now I am scared.... well, my blood result came out fine last time and there was no sign of any danger.... But should I be worried...? And do I just go back to 4mg a day just like my doctor prescribed me to? But wouldn't that actually slow down the development I was getting from 6mg dosage??? 

HELP ME!"
acegiak,asktransgender,Help me process these emerging memories?,"Hey sorry for this rant. I'm really struggling with some feelings that I'm having trouble processing. I'm hoping that letting it out and maybe crowdsourcing some wisdom/therapy/comfort will help. Unfortunately I kinda need to tell most of my whole story to make it make sense so if you're not in a rush make yourself comfortable I guess? Also: spoilers for The Danish Girl ahead.

I've been fairly vocal about being somewhere on the transgender spectrum ever since high school. My partner who I've been with struggled with since we were 15 initially struggled a lot with it, but I had friends that were very supportive, one in particular who was a massive comfort to my trans self in high school, always encouraging me to try makeup and clothes and hair and be myself. We were incredibly and intensely close in ways that only teenagers can achieve. As we all grew up my partner became more accepting and my friend group all understood me as some kind of feminine person but there was still tension between my partner and I so when the intense friendship with my girliness encouraging friend started to spiral outside of reasonable boundaries considering we both had partners I went along with it because being desired as a woman was so intoxicating. And then one day I betrayed the most important person in my life. Kissing in moments alone got hit and heavy and she took me into her bed. And had sex with me, like I was a boy, a submissive, feminine boy but a boy. A year or two later I admitted this indiscretion to my partner as it was eating me up inside. I felt so guilty and horrible and fully expected her to end the relationship but she didn't. She valued me and our relationship too much to let this thing tear us apart as much as it hurt her. Soon after my friend's partner ended their relationship because she found out that my friend had found a new effeminate boy to play around with on the side, I admitted to her the previous indiscretion and somehow we helped her through the grieving process and are now great long term friends.

As I progressed through university, my first job and my second job, my public identity became increasingly masculine to fit in with expectations and to be a popular friendly young man. My partner and I got married just before I started my second job and I had a magnificent beard. I was still often feminine withy partner and friends but we assumed I was just a genderqueer person or feminine man.

A few years later I broke down under the strain of it all and lost my job. This was two years ago. In the meantime I've spent two years at home looking for work and working on my own business I've gradually shifted towards the increasingly feminine to the point where in February last year I formally asked everyone to use female pronouns for me and this January I started HRT. One of the things I did with my Mum as exploring our new relationship was to go and see the Danish Girl which was incredibly intense but especially because of one scene. The scene at the climax of Lilli and Henrik's affair where Henrik calls Lilli Einar and Lilli realises that through the whole affair Henrik has been seeing her as a boy in a dress hit me like a sack of bricks. That was me. That was me when I made the greatest mistake of my life. And then when Gerda continues with the relationship and supports Lilli through her transition despite the storms. I know that The Danish Girl is a problematic film for a bunch of reasons but I've never seen a film so similar to my own experience in my life.

The problem is that in the film I saw Lilli as the victim. And now my head won't stop taking me back to that moment in the bed when I realised my friend was sleeping with me because to her I was a boy in a dress. And all these emotions are boiling up inside me and I can't tell if they're just because I want to be a victim rather than the digressor or if they're emotions that have been there the whole time hidden under layers of guilt and presence? I don't know and I don't know if it even matters if these feelings are legitimate. I'm just so manipulated, betrayed, and /Alone/. And all from this event that is over five years ago now. My partner's wounds have long since healed and she can be an ear to listen and a shoulder to cry on but something in me wants something else and I don't know what it is. Do I want clarity? To be told ""you are a victim"" or ""you are not""? Do I want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience and how they've handled it? Do I just want to be comforted? Maybe I just want the attention that comes with the drama. I don't know. It's all so complicated and it hurts because I can't untangle it and I thought... Maybe you could help?"
orangetina,asktransgender,HRT without transition; life as a man with boobs,"I don't want to socially transition because I'm too vain to be non-passable. However people have been telling me to take estrogen without socially transitioning. 

I think this is an awful idea as living as a man with boobs would be awkward and it would make dating impossible as gay men would be put off by the boobs and straight men would not be interested because they like women. So I would be forever single.

I thought my reply was pretty goddamn intelligent and valid but yet it got downvoted and somebody replied with some sill answer that danced around the point claiming that there's no such thing as a man or a woman.

Sophia_Forever,asktransgender,I went out in girl-mode for the first time this weekend! A couple questions about bras and boobs...,"So I went with a 42D bra because right now I'm a kinda fat guy. The bra is a little uncomfortable but I'm not sure if it's because it's too small or if it's because it's just new and I'm not used to it. I've been to /r/ABraThatFits and the wonderful woman at Orlando's Lane Bryant both agreed on that size but the bottom elastic still feels a little tight. Is that how it's supposed to be or should I go up to a 44?

Second question is that the cup size felt too big. It just felt comically large from my perspective but neither of my friends (who were having a wonderful time playing dress up) said anything and from the mirror it looked fine. So maybe it's just that the view is new and takes some getting used to? Did anyone else feel this way?"
Mostly-Waiting,asktransgender,I'm struggling to cope with increased depression and need help. Does anyone have some perspective or advice?,"Hi. I'll try to keep the backstory as brief as possible.

I'm MTF, 25 years old, 5 months HRT. Life has been poor for the last decade and steadily declining into depression for the last 5 years or so to date, and it's currently about as bad as it's ever been.

5 months is early, I know, and I'm very patient. The problem isn't the waiting or changes. 

I'm having a really hard time keeping it together at the moment. I'm struggling to make peace with the things about myself I can't change. I'm a natural problem solver and having so many unsolvable problems is frustrating because I can't stand to feel helpless. I worry that nothing will never be enough to give me a life without so much pain and disappointment. I've promised myself a few years, but am struggling to believe I'm not a suicide statistic waiting to happen.

I came very close to suicide a few years ago. I spent 6 months thinking it over before deciding ""you won't find out if things get better if you're dead."" But things still aren't better, they're worse, and I don't see them getting better, as the light of HRT gets duller all the time.

I haven't been anything but sad or empty in memory. I don't know what happy is. I drag myself through life in between tears and sleep because there's nothing I can turn to that will improve my mood.

I want to talk about this with my therapist, but he's useless. He says his job is to listen and never gives me any feedback or advice, even when I ask for it. I basically go in there to talk to myself. I can't switch because he's the only gender therapist and the only way he'll give me my letter for surgery is with a full 12 months of therapy. Not only that, I am concerned that if I bring up suicidal thoughts, he'll deny me medical help because I'm unstable.

I feel trapped. I don't have an outlet, I'm miserable, and I'm running out of hope to cling to that helps. It's getting so hard to be alive and I am beginning to worry I don't have the strength to give myself those few years. 

Can anyone offer something new I can think about? I have read this sub for a while and I know Reddit is a long shot, but I'm desperate and out of options. "
HyperFreya,asktransgender,Online dating as trans?,"So I joined an online dating site yesterday as trans(MTF) being very clear about being pre everything and the experience has been well, interesting I guess you could call it.

So far three guys have within three messages back and forth asked me about my sexual preferences and if I wanted to meet them later tonight. I politely declined! Finally there is one guy where we got onto the topic of photography and that's basically all we've been talking about so far, which isn't half bad i guess. The only problem is that he is around 20 years my senior...

My point is that online dating has so far been kind of like a train wreck for me so far haha. Does it ever get any better? What are some of your funny or horror stories from online dating?

vBloodbuzz,asktransgender,"At my work I can't have my hair up because I still present as male, how to get around this?","I couldn't think of a good title so sorry about that. 

And also this isn't like a super huge deal, it'd just be nice if it was able to be resolved. 

Basically, I work in a certain office supply store, and as far as rules go, it's very corporate. I'm a trans female but still present as male for now. 

At work men have to have their shirts tucked in, their hair can't be longer than their collar (mines still got a little bit to go), and they can't have their hair up. In the last few weeks I've just been putting my hair up when I'm not at work because right now my hair doesn't really have a style so it doesn't really look good down, and it constantly gets in my eyes and I have to fix it a lot. But at work I can't have it up because of this rule.

I haven't tried talking to a manager yet about it but I don't want to bring up my trans-ness because I'm not comfortable with that being known by anyone yet. 

How would you all recommend me to go about this? It's not the end of the world if am still not able to but it's worth a try I figure."

I've been waiting until I start hormones to tell my family. (I want be super sure) but my mother-in-law just reached out to my aunt to get my grandfather's phone number. He's probably my closest relative, so she'll start with him. 
They outed me to my best friend a month before I came out to him, so there is precedent. 
Right now I feel like my options are: 
1 get in front of it and come out before I'm ready
2 beg the evil hag not to shame me to my family
Or 
3 do nothing and deal with fallout if she decides to out me. 

Anyone have a better option? Personally, I'm leaning towards 3.

imasayit,asktransgender,My boss Ma'am'd me today! Also; I'm scared of the effects hormones might have on my brain.,"I came out to him a while ago just to give him a heads up. He was chill about the whole thing. I came in yesterday with a little makeup and my nails done. Not really trying to pass even, just being me and not giving a fuck. Totally rocking a sort of David Bowie look but a little less flashy. Anyways he comes up to me and says ""Can you please go finish up xxxxx on number 4 S-Ma'am?"" I don't know what he actually thinks of me, but it just made me feel really good. I told my work buddy immediately and he called me a ""giddy school girl"" which didn't exactly dampen my excitement. I just feel so blessed to have such caring people in my life. But I hear so many horror stories. How do I know they will stay supportive? And for how long? I don't want to get attached to people right now because I've heard so many stories of other trans people whose family and friends abandoned and betrayed them. But I really like my boss. Not in romantic way. He's just polite and caring, and he lets us wear headphones and tries to accommodate our schedules for school and volunteering.

About hormones; I was told that at around 9 to 11 months is when a trans girl ""goes temporarily insane"" because hormones rewire our brain to think more like a woman. Right now I'm good at compartmentalization. I'm rational about most things. On the flip side I already cry easily. Are these liable to change? I said I hate bands like one direction and she said ""wait till month twelve honey."" I don't want what I think of as ""me"" to change. I just want my body to match it."

They met with my mother's therapist who, from what I heard after talking with them, gave them somewhat of a crash course on the very basic concepts (gender is a spectrum, there are many ways of transitioning, etc.). As my father puts it ""It hasn't completely registered with them yet."" The older of the two is also somewhat in denial, from what I've been told, because I never exhibited ""signs"".

Eventually-Alexis,asktransgender,Stupid question regarding body temperature at night.,How do you deal with a high body heat? All my life my body temperature has been a few degrees higher then normal and I'm always forced to sleep in my underwear which clearly causes some issues with body dysphoria when I hate my body the way I do. I have often tried cooling the room down so that I can as a minimum wear a t-shirt to cover up my chest and my less wanted lower parts but I always end up either having to take it off again or sleep very uncomfortable because of the heat.

nothingyoucando2,asktransgender,"I wrote this as an op-ed, but no one wants to post it :(, idk maybe it's worth the read.","I’m trying to stay calm, to speak with compassion.

Recently, individuals, communities, and states have been proposing what the internet is now calling, “bathroom bills” as measures to solidify gender congruence in public spaces, to erase transgender identities and limit those who identify as one gender but were assigned another at birth access to public restrooms of their preferred identity. These laws are furthered under the guise of protecting children, specifically young girls, who may be targeted by predators seeking to exploit this change. These laws follow a noticeable shift in the public’s perception of transgender individuals, with more acceptance, visibility, and celebrity endorsement than ever before. The backlash associated with swift and increased visibility aims to reaffirm long held beliefs about what, and who, is valuable in our society. Discriminatory laws and practices ignore the issue of gender dysphoria in entirety and criminalize those who experience pain and discomfort when forced to adhere to gender norms that are incongruent with their internal sense of self.

Cisgender individuals take so for granted their own comfort, they cannot imagine a state of being in which an individual might feel uncomfortable, in their role, in their body, in our society. Rather than make space for these individuals, laws like the ones we’re seeing in North Carolina, Alabama, and proposed all over the country, have the opposite of their supposed intended effect.

Rather than protecting children from transgender women, who are often scapegoated as pedophiles despite no evidence to support such a claim, these laws send the message to gender variant and transgender children that they are less valuable than their cisnormative counterparts. Laws like this layer shame and self-hatred into vulnerable, developing kids about what is an isn’t acceptable. Many of the kids that internalize this sense of wrongness may not even be transgender, because a certain amount of feminine and masculine blending is normal and expected in a service-sector economy and society like our own. These laws enacted by legislators, horrible stereotypes proposed by community leaders, and the subsequent violent threats made by community members on the internet and in public settings sends a message of fear and shame to transgender people and frightens *all* children.

TW: Child abuse.

When I was a child, amidst the backlash of the phrase “Gender Identity” coined late in the previous decade, I internalized very early on that it was not safe to express how I was feeling. Even the slightest hint of femininity as an assigned male individual landed me in the principal’s office, where I was berated and abused, where horrific and disgusting lies about transgender people were retold to me over and over. Once, another kid and I were tied to chairs and interrogated about our bodies, about our identities, by the cisgender, female teachers. At the time, there was no clear distinction in the lament lauded at effeminate gay men and transgender women, and so the typical gay slurs were hurled in our direction because we had dared put too much bounce in our step, because we had expressed interest in feminine clothing.

These teachers would often state that transgender people grew up to become assailants and somehow believed that the obvious remedy to that was to assault us, as children. On hateful forums online, I hear this kind of sentiment repeated over and over again. Transgender women might be violent at some point in the future, it is said, and so somehow violence and harassment against transgender people is acceptable. This is nothing new. Homophobic, racist, and transphobic people have been inadvertantly excusing men for r*ape, making the assertion that all males are innately predatory, and scapegoating those they see as threatening to their own standard of living forever.

Prejudiced people are using, and have used, an imagined threat of violence to condone and perpetuate *actual* physical, economic, emotional, and social violence on LGBTQI folk (and, for that matter, lots of other kinds of folk).

This isn’t the world we live in, or shouldn’t be. We live in an innocent until proven guilty kind of world. We live in a society that, supposedly, centers justice.

Until I have actually harmed someone, I have not harmed anyone. Until I have actually assaulted someone, you cannot label me an assailant.

This is the part where people will call me “crazy” and put the word identity in quotes. So let’s just address that. You don’t really have the right to throw around words like crazy, insane, hysterical (most of which are rooted in misogyny anyway) and then hold me to some standard that you have decided is appropriate. We’re all born here with a variety of physical, emotional, psychological, and even spiritual issues to resolve and manage and how I decide to do so is between me, my doctors, my family, and my therapist. Running up to someone you *think* might be transgender, even though you know nothing about this person, on their way into the bathroom and assaulting them makes *you* the bad guy.

People are not saying I have a “mental illness” because they have some deep compassion for me and want to help me live the best quality life I can. They want me to follow their orders. This archaic post-war imperialist gender system is more schizophrenic than any transgender woman I’ve ever met and these fourteen year old boys and TERFs on the internet that are clearly in a ton of pain (probably from that EXACT SAME GENDER SYSTEM THAT HURTS US) have no right to decide that they’re better than someone and then speak over them about their body or their conditions. What’s actually more “crazy” is any kind of assertion that the most psychologically diverse species in the history of this planet can fit neatly, physically, psychologically, or otherwise, into two categories. Or that someone can’t feel incongruent with their gender or sex because this world is a perfect simulation with no issues? THAT’S IN-SANE.

Gender is a sort of trigger for everyone, transgender or not.

We were all told what colors to like, how to walk, what jobs and skills to work toward.

Others around us herded us into this system by saying, “Ew, girls don’t do thattttt” or, “boys don’t wear thoseeee.”

And we were fed this biological determinism in order to justify it all.

I get that people would rather kill me off than have to face the nuances of this system and maybe change it a little to make space for those it doesn’t work for, but trans people aren’t doing this to  get something. We’re not transitioning to hurt other people, we’re trying to heal ourselves.

While laws and stigmas like these provide obvious practical hurdles to LGBTQI individuals, they also derail and distract members of this community from their larger life goals. If you are forced to spend extra energy battling with those online, battling legislators, battling bigots, battling the inner demons that arise from this kind of permeating societal injustice, you have less energy to heal, less energy at work, less focus at school.

I found that the images and statements online were taking a far greater toll on me than I originally anticipated and when I sat with myself for a moment a deep question arose in me about my value.

Why do I deserve to live, as my authentic self or at all?

Am I not useless? Am I not a burden to this society?

Am I just crazy, whatever that means?

I sat with this a long time, I let it be there. I imagine that I am not the only transgender person, or even LGBTQI person, in this country that is asking themselves this very same thing as we watch this horror film-turned-newsreel unfold.

The lie that has been so devastatingly beaten into us from an early age, a lie that cuts across race, gender, sex, orientation, ability, class, and other facets of one’s person, is that some people are inherently more valuable than others, that some deserve more life and more acceptance than others, that certain modes of being are to be prioritized.

I forgive those people who are genuinely holding onto sincerely held beliefs because it is what they know, they think those beliefs are what keeps them safe.

I even forgive those who are blatantly attacking me, because they believe in a scarcity myth that tells them they must push someone else out to survive.

But I hope that everyone in the transgender community, and even other affected communities, knows within themselves that they do deserve to live, to contribute to and build community, that every experience along the LGBTQI spectrum is valuable and beneficial to its progress. The world is a better place with your inclusion, not a worse one.

You are not a burden, you are a blessing. 
You are not of lesser value.

There’s nothing wrong with you. 


EDIT: (Seriously, if we take a step back from the stress and the conflict, we all know that this will fade. Very soon, we will win our deserved respect and rights and these people on the internet that are in pain will have to face their own inner conflict with embarrassment instead of projecting it onto us blindly.)

You are beautiful. You are worthy. You are loved.

Keep fighting.

What did you think about it?,"Synopsis: *Chii and her husband are like any other happily married couple, except for one thing: Chii was assigned male at birth. Chii details her autobiographical account of growing up with gender dysphoria and ultimately deciding to transition in her early adult years. Shortly after Chii starts transitioning, she meets a man who is instantly enamored by her, and although he is surprised when Chii eventually tells him she used to live as a guy, he still wants to go out with her. As Chii continues to transition, her boyfriend supports her through the process, culminating in their marriage once her transition is complete.*

Personally i found it both heart warming and informative.

todayimagirl,asktransgender,Cynosure Apogee Laser Hair info: no lasting effect?,"Hello,
Last year, I went to a laseraway-chain based on a groupon I got.  The price was $200 for 3 sessions on their cynosure apogee laser, a dual alexandrite and YAG laser.

I did a ton of research before, including asking members on this subreddit(u/MichelletheDiva who has had amazing results with this machine), and reading over this analytical report:
 
http://www.medlasersolutions.com/media/ApogeeElite.pdf(which may be helpful if anyone else is interested in laseraway!

Anyways, the way laseraway does things is start off the laser fluence at 20 j/cm, with a duration of 40 and a spot size of 12.  Everytime you go back they increase the fluence by 5, until probably 35-40, depending on how your skin is handling things.  

The first time I went about %25-30 hair fell out within 10 days, the second time maybe %10-15, and the third time maybe about %20.  I have dark facial hair and fair skin, which is supposedly ideal for laser.

After my 3 lasers I was suppose to get 3 more but because of some sort of groupon-laseraway policy I couldn't get the next 3 on my face, so I stopped.

6 months later, and I feel that the majority of my my facial hair has grown back.  I am pre-hrt, and am a little disappointed that I did not seem to lose much hair from my 3x at laser.  

I guess my questions are: what are other's experience with pre-hrt laser hair removal, and is getting a ton of pimples and inflammation normal from laser hair? Did anyone else feel like laser hair was making your vellus hairs on your face turn into thick real facial hair? Should I slap down the 1200 for 9 sessions at laseraway? I would be so disappointed if after 9 sessions my facial hair was the same.  

For information: I am asian with dark hair and light skin, with a medium amount of facial hair to begin with.  Feel free to pm me with your laser hair recommendations in the Bay Area, CA as well :)  

thank you :)

Fairlady31,asktransgender,What can this subreddit say to convince me out of voice surgery?,"I've been saving up money and i'm getting a settlement in the next few months. I am strongly considering voice surgery. At this point I don't care about the risks, I would rather risk losing my voice or having a weird or raspy one than having the one I have now. So the risks aren't an issue for me.

I'm considering seeing Brassard in Montreal, flights there aren't overly expensive and he offers a reasonable rate. I really don't care anymore about what the results might be. If it helps my voice, great, if not, I can live with whatever the results are. 

What can this sub say to try and convince me out of it? People keep telling me it's really bad and I heard you can lose your voice, get a raspy one or one that sounds like minnie mouse. But seriously, at this point, those all even seem like better options for me. That's what my level of dysphoria is.

BackupUte,asktransgender,Therapist question,"Hi, so I'm looking to see a therapist soon about an issue completely unrelated to being transgender, but I'm thinking I may want to bring that issue up too.

I don't remember a whole lot but what I do is very significant. For some reason it was a few years from now and I had started my transition and gotten quite far. I don't know the circumstances but I was about to be married and I were standing in front of a big mirror next to my younger sister wearing the most fantastic wedding dress (I swear it was taken straight out of a Disney movie) with some of my front hair down while the rest had been beautifully lifted up in a tiara with a bunch of sparkling gemstones in it. Next thing I know I'm walking down the aisle with my dad. Things were absolutely perfect and I almost started crying when noises from the kitchen woke me up....

Note: English is not my native language, ""embarrassment"" I really couldn't choose which word to use, so this embarrassment is like in a bad way as shame.

How can I question what I really am? Is it what I feel inside? When I look inside me, I see a woman and I'm %100 sure of that, but society makes me feel embarrassed because of what I'm and that embarrassment is sometimes so high that I just want to give up on transitioning.

Since my childhood, I did my BEST to become the man they wanted me to become. My parents made me feel embarrassed because of my ""girly"" characteristics. I've tried to hide all my girly traits, like sitting like a manly way, talking and behaving, since childhood. My culture wanted me to do that... I could have never accepted that I'm trans, until now. I accepted it, I started to be who I really am.

I guess I've tried soo hard to become a man, I got actually pretty good at it, so good that made me think I'm not actually a woman inside.

Today, I accidently looked at my penis, and saw how small it is, and that made me feel reaally embarrassed and for one second I thought about giving up... and;

I ask you, why do I feel that way? Do I feel that way because my culture, my parents have taught me that transsexuality is a bad thing and being man is something to be proud of... because, I'm not proud of being transgender, they caused this, this is why I have doubt... Right?

I really think I came a long way, I couldn't even ""came out"" to myself...

**TL; DR** I saw how small my penis is. I felt embarrassed, like I was doing something shameful and I should feel shame because of it. I've tried to become a man, because what I am was something to be embarassed of. I have doubts, I question myself. I'm not sure if I'm %100 MtF-Straight person. How can I find out?"
Awenrising,asktransgender,Questioning if I may be transgender,"I have been reading through this subreddit and the MTF subreddit for many hours this week after having an epiphany or train of thought change concerning my gender identity and I think I finally have the courage to ask this question to the community.

I know this question is probably one of the most commonly asked questions on this forum but I am wanting feedback/opinions from the community that might help with my own internal struggle. This is not the first time I have had thoughts that I might be transgender or not fully male but this is the first time where they have stuck with me to an almost obsessive level for a week.

So without further explanation here is a little back story on me. 

I didn't feel like I was suppose to be a girl from a young age though I have always been a little more feminine than masculine. Identifying more with female roles than with traditionally male roles (ie I would rather be a nurse than a soilder or a nurturer over a fighter).

I tended to get along better with women growing up and have always had a hard time fitting in as one of the guys (though I make it work, usually with one on one relationship building). 

In the past I have cross dressed at parties without feeling ashamed and actually felt liberated by it (this was not full on hair/makeup/dress but more bra with padding/underwear/heels/ shaving off all body hair etc).

I have also had many dreams in the past where I wake up as a women and am ok with it. I guess ok with it is the wrong wording but just feeling normal. In the dreams I go to work, do every days things and when I am asked by co workers where I am (they are looking for a male version of me) my response is always what do you mean, this is me I am right here I always just  a girl.

That is the general past experiences/ thought processes I have had that make me think i may be transgender. I don't know why it hit me again now (except that i am currently away from home and have time to myself for a few days) but any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Also sorry about the ranting, I feel like my thoughts are all over the place and that it would take pages to tell my whole story.

Thank you."
stickerartist,asktransgender,How do you deal with your parents knowing this about you?,"I feel like the private aspects of being trans, your current state of your genitals is super private. 

But like, when your parents find out your trans. They wonder about this very specific private thing. And they know what you want. They know your desires I guess.

I guess what my question is, how do you deal with your parents knowing about your deep dark desires? Your desires? I feel like they shouldn't know about this and its private. Like, they were never supposed to know what I want. But they know and its painful that they know.

I feel like it strains my relationship with them. That they know such a private thing about me. Its like, they know too much what they shouldn't know. They were never supposed to know this, but they do and its painful.

How do you deal with them knowing?"
SaberKOG91,asktransgender,What's wrong with me?,"It's been almost a year now since I figured out that I wasn't happy living as a man anymore. In that time I've had wonderful opportunities to learn more about myself and to get to try things that I never thought I would. But now I just feel horribly stuck.

After all the time I have spent reading posts from others and getting perspective from their own experiences, I just find myself even more anxious over the whole thing. So many others have expressed their feelings of gender dysphoria, but I don't know that I have ever felt that way. Sure, I look in the mirror and wish that there was a beautiful girl staring back at me. But I don't really hate looking like a man either. It seems like my biggest battles are with simply being overweight or having to deal with all of my ridiculous body hair. Emotionally, I know I repress a ton and wish (probably more than anything) that I would just let it all out. Mentally, I'm terrified of all of the what-ifs that might come from transitioning. I know that more than half of my family will not understand and probably condemn me for who I am. I'm scared of the effect it may have on relationships with colleagues at university and that it will have unintended consequences as I go on to start my PhD this Fall. I'm already a difficult person to work with and I can't say that making friends has ever been easy. I already feel alone enough as it is and the last thing I want to do is make it worse.

But the rational side of me knows that I can't keep putting this off, or it will just get worse. It's like I know what could make me happy, but I'm so unhappy right now that I'm afraid it will just make things worse. How the heck am I supposed to do this?

TL;DR anxious as hell, afraid of everything, and petrified of moving forward"
YupYupYup3210,asktransgender,Am I a coward for staying in the closet?,"I had a bit of a coming out/coming-to-terms about a year ago -- was in a somewhat high profile job at the time and got hired for an even more high profile job which I currently have. Nothing huge, but the sort of thing where I have to interact with a lot of diverse and important folk. 

I have considered moving on at the end of the year, moving to a new city and finding a place where I can hedge a new start. I know I want to transition, and it seems like I am trying to fit it in when it might go smoother/easier. 

Still, everyday I wake up, even when I find ways to manage the dysphoria (hooray for psychologists, sobriety and exercise!) I still feel like a coward. I see all those making the changes I want to, see transgender individuals find more acceptance and I can't help but feel like a coward. 

The pain and discomfort of living day-to-day is bad enough, but denying a part of me until I feel I am in an easier and safer place makes me feel like I'm forsaking my happiness and my true self out of fear. My psych tells me I should make steps that I am comfortable with, but I can't help but feel like I'm losing days, even if I am still somewhat young (mid-20's).

bluesquares907,asktransgender,How to get breast augmentation covered by insurance?,"I'm currently a student, and my school's insurance does not cover top surgery (breast augmentation for MTF). The insurance we have covers hormones (which I'm currently on through the plan) and SRS, but nothing for breasts. At this point I have been on hormones for over a year, and there has been a little growth but not much.

I have at least another year or two with school. I am currently deciding my options in moving forward from here. Are there any insurance plans that cover breast augmentation for transgender women? What have been your experiences with this issue? At this point I am considering if it's worth switching over to a different insurance plan for a year or so or if I should expect to pay for this out of pocket. In either case, I would appreciate any advice you might have on this issue.

maxine_stirner,asktransgender,"I was clocked, and I'm not even out or on HRT!","I decided to follow some advice I've read on /r/asktransgender and start changing my public appearance slowly. I mean, even if your hair is long and you start looking more feminine no one is going to assume you're trans, right? Apparently not!

I'm at step 1 of my plan. The only noticeable thing I've done since I started transitioning is growing my hair out. No different clothes, no hormones, no voice. But recently my observant coworker asked me whether I am really cisgender, although they didn't say that exactly. They are a tolerant and understanding person and the only coworker that I am totally OK with being out to at the moment, but I was totally caught off guard so I didn't come out.

Anything similar happen to you?"
IMSOFUCKINGWEIRD,asktransgender,I'm losing complete control of my life,"About 4 days ago I was filling out a form at my study abroad university and I was staring at the form, but more specifically the gender/sex box. For some reason a thought popped into my head that maybe I shouldn't circle the ""Male"" box because there's the chance I'm transgender. At the time I brushed this off and was like meh, that's ridiculous. But over the last 4 days I went from never having gender dysphoria to what seems to be the beginnings of it. I just had a mental break down while walking from the train station to my home stay and my anxiety slowly built up. The day before I felt like I was on cloud nine and I was king of the world. I can't stop thinking about it. I had this same experience with realizing that I'm attracted to men like 3 years ago, and that was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I feel like this is the beginning of another ridiculous shit storm that's slowly destroying my life. Why did everything have to go so god damn wrong. I was totally fine at 16-18, I had no form of obsessions like this and no real problems except how can I talk to the girl that sits next to me in class, but now I can't go a single day without some peace. Constant checking, thinking, questioning my own sanity. Have I been repressing this my entire life? Holy shit maybe that one time back as a kid I wanted to be like Starfire was actually a sign, but then all the other male characters I liked are totally ignored as rational reasoning. My brain feels like it's going to literally implode, I can't do another 3-4 years of this hell hole, I was FINALLY JUST coming out of that. I can't even cry (I tried to when I got home but nothing would come out), everything I do triggers this thought process. It's like a fucking rollercoaster from hell. The worst part is that I'm starting to despise my parents for giving me a defective fucking brain. 

I'm so sad, I don't even know if I'm repressing (my brain wants to tell me I am) or what. I tried to resist searching on the internet anything about being transgender as checking behavior but not doing so causes such massive anxiety I gave in just now."
Vegetal_Headwear,asktransgender,"Does anyone else take advantage of conventions to be out, even for a brief period of time?","I recently got back from a convention! It's the three days of the year where I can walk, talk, and dress like a guy, without a single odd look. 

I even went in the men's restroom the whole weekend! Overall I've found that convention people, at least the ones I hang out with, are a lot more open minded. 

When I went into the restroom the first time, I was so nervous! A man walked in but I assured him that yes, he was in the right bathroom. The look of his confusion on his face was priceless, though! I felt so confident went hotel staff told me that the women's bathroom was the other way, and I replied ""I know."" Or, ""I'm guy."" 

I think my FAVORITE part was when a dude, leaving the restroom said ""have a good say sir, or ma'am,  or whatever you identify as!"" I was beaming for the rest of the day. 

For three whole days a year, I get to be someone entirely new. No one knows me, and I can be whoever I want."

imasayit,asktransgender,First attempt at wearing girl clothes at work did not go very well.,"I wore a top with spaghetti straps. My boss asked me into his office (I expect at the behest of someone else because he is not the type to care about stuff as long as the with gets done) where his boss was waiting and gave me a lecture about the dress code which says ""no sleeveless shirts."" They said they normally don't enforce that part because it gets hot in the plant but I didn't know it was against the dress code because plenty of people of both genders wear tank tops and sleeveless shirts, just not spaghetti straps, which is what their problem was. I'm going go ahead and say here that while I disagree with the concept of the dress code to begin with (you're responsible for your own ability to focus on your work regardless of what I'm wearing) he was adamant about saying he would be having the same talk with a ""woman"" (they know I'm trans but I still look dudely so whatever). So after the talk, which I should have asked for a union rep for to begin with, I went and told my union steward what went down. This dude is the beefiest, beardliest, hairiest Viking man at the plant. And he says ""Okay, give me the shirt."" I take off the shirt underneath my hoodie and give it to him. He takes off his, puts on mine, and proceeds to go about his work. It was fucking amazing. I felt so validated by him putting his own standing at risk just for solidarity. Some of the younger girls at the plant heard about it and suggested coming in tomorrow in similar dress but I said no because my boss really has been great about my transition so far, I don't think he cared about my top to begin with, and I don't want to make more trouble for him than I need to. Anyways; the Union steward came back later after he got a taking to for the same thing. He said that basically I'm allowed to wear whatever I want as far as gendered clothing goes, but the dress code is what it is and if I want to risk sleeveless shirts with thicker shoulder straps he would back me up 100% as nobody says dick to the several people of both genders wearing sleeveless shirts and tank tops. He also says that management is panicking because I'm the first out trans person to be employed at their facility and they want to protect me from harassment.

I just wanted to wear what I like to wear and it turned into a drama circus. I kind of want to go in tomorrow in another less revealing but still feminine top. I'm wondering if that's a good idea. Anybody have any insight on this?"

This is the place for concerns, complaints, and meta discussions. This is the place for saying where folks think the sub should go, or how it should try and develop. It will hopefully be a place where we can hash out rules and enforcement and figure out what works best for all of us.

We are here for you.

We also accept praise, cookies, and/or bitcoin.

Attempts will be made to not censor the content or discussion here. However, personal attacks are still off the table. We will give a warning and then begin nuking the offending comments. Keep the mudslinging to a minimum. Or at least make it artful.

This thread will be stickied for 5 days, after that it closes shop. If things get too out of hand it will be temporarily locked until folks cool down.

We would like to try and help build the kind of place that the community likes and wants. We will endeavor to do our best with what resources we have.

If this works, hopefully we can turn it into a regular thing.

So denizens of AskTransgender, we ask you… what's on your mind?

xerox13ster,asktransgender,What has you feeling good today?,"So since my last flurry of posts mid March, I have had a number of amazing things happen, and I've been too busy to post each one individually.

So, after the, uh, belt snapped, I went to work a week later and told my supervisor that I was transitioning. A week later, I met with HR and they wanted me to wait 2.5 weeks before telling the rest of the team. I emailed the team of my own accord that afternoon to a wonderful and accepting response from everyone. I started going andro that Monday with a bra and girl jeans. Work has been more than supportive and I really couldn't ask for a better environment.

Two weeks ago, I was due to get my employee badge updated (specifically for the name change) so I decided I didn't want a male picture. I went in full fem with makeup and everything and felt great! And I didn't stop. I just didn't want to go back to guy mode so I didn't! At this point I've been full time for about two weeks. The unexpected bit is that apparently I pass. 

People at work that I interact with infrequently thought I was someone else (I was getting a ton of pickles in the caf at work and a caf worker mentioned there was ""a guy around here"" that gets a ton of pickles too.). I get ma'amed all day on the phone, and I get ma'amed in stores.

I get my fair share of odd looks, (more often when in boy mode, counterintuitively, is like they can tell somethings off and are trying to figure me out) but it's far outweighed by the people that don't notice me. 

I also had my first male fail the other day after I had taken my makeup off and I put forward zero effort but had to run to the store. I was in shorts and a tshirt (no bra) and a store associate called me ma'am when I was using self checkout. 

I cleared out all my body hair with my epilator and I'm feeling chic and oh so good wearing a new skirt and new shoes, and I want to share this good feeling so I ask:

I_hate_naming_things,asktransgender,I think I might be transgender,"I made this account a few days ago, but been coming to this sub for a few weeks now, and been here almost everyday since. And I finally got into the mood to make a post. 

I recently had surgery (sport related) and about a couple of weeks before the surgery, I started to get anxiety. At the time, I didn't know it was that because I never felt it before, but after a quick google search led me to anxiety. I was half hoping that it would stop after the surgery but the surgery wasn't the thing that was on my mind when it started, it was thinking about being a woman. At this point, I started to do a lot more research on being transgender and when people realize it. Looked into things that could be treated on and what can't. 

I can't really remember the first time that I wanted to be a woman, it has just kind of always been there. After looking into it when I was younger, I'm 25 now, I put it down as just curiosity of what it would be like as a women, because it was said that it was common for someone to think about being the other gender. It was something that I thought about quite frequent, not quite everyday but at least a few times a week. I even had a realistic dream of being in a lesbian threeway, and when I say realistic, I mean I even felt it all, and it felt amazing! It has only happen once and I wish it would happen again. When I masturbated, it has always been from the woman's point of view, I don't really remember every doing it from a man's point of view. But getting penetrated by a strapon or a toy from another woman has always fascinated me. And since these thoughts were mostly sexual thoughts, I still thought it was just curiosity. Since the anxiety just started to happen, I've started to think it might just be more than curiosity. And made the decision to see a therapist about it, which I had the first appointment a few days ago. And on day the anxiety started, I have never wanted to leave work, go home, and cry my eyes out like that before. When I got home, I couldn't really get any tears out, just watery eyes was about it. It kind of sucks that I couldn't get any tears out because I really could have used it. 

Now I'm fine about being a man, and I'm fine with a penis, yes it gets uncomfortable and it kind of sucks having every once in awhile, but that should be pretty normal for a guy to think of. Yeah sure, I had thoughts of cutting it off when I was younger but I would have never gone through with it, that's probably not normal for a guy to think of. I'm not really depressed and I don't have suicidal thoughts. I have women tell me that I'm cute but I don't really see it and when I look at my face on my camera phone, I just hate looking at it. So I don't really take photos of my face, even on snapchat. But I feel like this is normal for people not to like their face or just feel it's weird looking. 

I've recently started to look into buying some women clothes and makeup, which both are extremely confusing. I didn't want to buy any until after a few weeks after my surgery so that I can have the use of both my arms. I'll be starting physical therapy next week, so both of my arms will be useful again shortly. But when I started looking at women clothes, I started to feel sad because I won't look as good as they do. For example, yoga pants, that is something that I wish I could pull off and to have some cleavage to show off. So when I look at a woman, there's both lust and jealousy.

I worry that if I transition(even though the whole transition terrifies the shit out of me), that I would regret it. I don't know if I would be happier as a woman, even though I've always wondered if I would happier if I was born a woman. And sometimes I wish that I was born a woman, because I've always thought it was unfair for guys to always start up a conversion with a woman. Maybe I just hate our social interaction, as a guy, I'm not very hairy (which I really hate having body hair, so it's a small plus) and when growing up, I was made fun of for shaving my legs even though they just didn't grow in yet. And so now, I'm afraid to even shave them because of it.

I'm confused on what I really want, because there's a side of me that wants to be a woman and a side that wants to stay as a man. I'm not really interested in being something in between, I want to be one or the other. This is really starting to tear me up on the inside. Has anyone else was fine with being a man (or woman) but decided to go to womanhood (or manhood) or just try to deal with these thoughts?"
carefreearchgeek,asktransgender,Shaving and skin care,"I posted a question earlier, and in retrospect it was bloody stupid. Anyway I shaved this morning, kind of an accident actually, but I'd been planning to soon anyway. Regardless of the why of it I have an interesting result, in that I don't like the outcome. I can see my chin and jawline clearly now, and I don't like how they look; I don't have the words to describe it exactly, maybe too boxy or too big, but it's definitely down to how masculine it is. Not exactly a great thing to spot on myself, but it helps lessen anxiety, makes me feel less like I'm completely and ludicrously wrong.

Anyway, onto my actual question. I'm currently wet shaving with disposable razors, and I have no actual skincare routine. Thus far I've gotten moisturize, wash face with gentle cleanser, drink plenty and sleep plenty for skincare, something I'm planning to get on soon. Is there anything else people would recommend? Anything I've missed? Any tips for shaving to minimize damage or irritation to my skin?

MiunaStealthAcc,asktransgender,I'm so lost and don't know what to do. (School or transition),"Heya, this post is probably going to be a little messy since I'm tired and can't sleep (living in EU, 1am here). I'm sorry, this might seem a little out of topic, but I'm so lost and depressed and I could use some insight.


I'm currently a student, in 3rd year of a 5 year graduation in an IT school. I've been struggling with gender for a long time now, and questioning whether i should transition or not since I've learned about it 10 months ago.

I want to start HRT but my 4th year will bring me to South Korea and I'm afraid that won't be easy for me to find an endocrinologist there and get HRT prescriptions. On the other hand, i'm getting more and more demotivated by my school ; the first few years were nice, but it's turning to topics that i'm not so interested in, and I can't really bring myself to keep doing this. Furthermore, they require me to get a 4 month internship to pass this year, and I'm so depressed I can't function enough to get out of my bed ; I don't see how I could get up every morning to work with a bunch of strangers in something I don't like. Now i'm sure I'd like the courses of my 4th year since it's about video game development and it's what i'm passionate about, I just don't see a world where i'm not feeling miserable because of my pre-HRT state. Also I kinda don't want to start transition later, as passing is really important to me and I'd like to have the most chances.


I could also leave school now and start transitioning. Ultimately my goal would be to transition and work on indie video games, and I'm fairly confident I could do that for a living after a few months / one or two years of work. The thing is my parents won't quite support me if I choose to do this ; they think i believe i'm transgender because of childhood trauma or the likes and i'd regret it, which could be true (i don't think it is but who knows). I'm currently living off their money, with close to no income of my own, and they told me they'd stop giving me money if I left school. I guess I could find a job to try to get money, but as I mentioned above for the internship, I'm so depressed I don't think I could keep a job schedule for long.


I'm so lost. I feel like I'm at a crossroad of two impasses (if that makes sense in English, uh i'm tired) and I don't know what to do. Everyone tells me to keep going through my studies and worry afterwards about transition, but I literally can't stop thinking about it ; I'm getting more and more depressed to the point where i'm starting to have suicidal thoughts.


Also I can't take a year off, there's too much preparation for the 4th and 5th years in the 3rd year that I'd have to do it again.


Has anyone ever been stuck in that situation? Or even if not, what would you suggest?


Thank you very much."
imlostinmyhead,asktransgender,Do MtF transgender athletes have an advantage over their cisgender counterparts?,"So, as the title states, my inital thought was no, but I was thinking upon it more and now I'm unsure. This is mostly relevant to MMA as I've stumbled on the ""scandal"" of Fallon Fox, but I'd like to extend the thought to other sports as well.

In regards to MMA, my thoughts were that the lack of T causes their muscle mass to be harder to maintain, just like cis women, and their bone structure may give them a height/reach advantage, but those kind of variations do exist inside of cis women as well, netting out to a wash, but maybe I'm missing something.

I am on a job hunt now, my first time looking for work since coming “out” (not *totally* out, but out to myself and some friends, and defaulting to neutral elsewhere as much as possible… anyway…)

So, as I look into benefits packages… how do I find out if the insurance will cover trans healthcare costs? (mtf, if that makes a difference). Do get a job offer, look for a group or policy number in the benefits package, then call the insurance company &amp; ask them “do you have trans-inclusive healthcare?” Or would there be documentation somewhere that lists out all kinds of specific procedures?

I also may end up taking some freelance work, which means I would look into healthcare.gov… I assume similar answers would apply here as well.

Just wanted to get some insight so I don’t ask the wrong thing at the wrong time…

Brokenchandelure,asktransgender,How do I break up with my girlfriend of 4 years? I'm too much of a pushover.,"I told my girlfriend I was questioning my gender like a year ago, but despite that she is straight we stayed together because I wasn't sure yet, then when I was sure we stayed together because I couldn't start hormones yet. Now I'm on hormones and we're still together, but the day of actually breaking up keeps getting pushed back. 

If she could accept me as a girl and still love me if be happy to be with her, but it's just tearing me apart at this point. It's causing fights making us both sad and stressed. I know it's best that we break up but she can't let go, and even though I may be more equipped to handle letting go  I'm too much of a pushover to hurt her.

Last night I told her I wanted to be publicly out by my birthday this Sunday, and even though she told me over and over that she wants me to be happy and I should be able to spend my birthday as myself, about an hour later she asked me to stay with her, and by extension in the closet for another two weeks. I know it's only two weeks but I want to be myself already, and I can't know for certain that two weeks won't turn into a month or two.

I live in Australia (Perth specifically) and can't find much information about the exact process. I've heard about needing to jump through hoops to get started, from finding a trans-friendly GP, to massive waiting lists and required time for therapy, which frankly I wouldn't even want to pay for or do, I don't need someone else to me what gender I am based on a few months of knowing me.

I've thought about self-medicating but have heard it can be dangerous and cause health problems if not done properly

To make things harder I live with my parents and don't drive (no license) which adds to the complications of doing it in secret and also have no idea on their stance of LGBT people, which makes things harder.

Does anyone have some advice on what I should do? Even just typing this post upsets me thinking that I might not be able to live my life as I want to."

And I feel bad correcting them because I know it's not nearly as important to them as me and they really can't get why it matters to me so much or bothers me to such an extent.

EmilyATrans,asktransgender,"""Who am I kidding""","Is there any way to stop thinking this?

After years and years of fantasizing about transitioning but telling myself that it was impossible or that I'd never have the courage or that if I just ignore it it will go away, I finally decided to do it about a month ago. 

Since then I've started seeing a very good therapist, set up an appointment with my doctor to get a referral for an endo, and come out to my parents, closest friends, and roommates. Externally, everything's been going as smoothly as I could have hoped.

In the first two weeks or so I would have moments of doubt. Like, ""oh shit, what if I'm not trans, though?"" I'm over that. I think about the future. When I imagine myself as a man I'm sad and when I imagine myself as a woman I'm happy. That's not changing.

But now that I'm made it over that hurdle, I find myself plagued more and more by the ""who am I kidding"" thoughts. Like nothing I could do will ever make me look or feel like the woman I know I am.

I'm worried hormones will just turn me into a freak with tits. That the people in my life will say they support me and think of me as female, but really they'll just pity me and think of me as the poor little boy who thinks he's a girl.

Like it's never going to get better and I'm going to be like this for the rest of my life until I can't take it any more and end it. Like I might as well just go back to telling myself I'm a guy because at least then I could exist in society without being harassed.

I've seen very few posts here about Bicalutamide, all of which have only talked about the basics, like how it doesn't block the production of testosterone but blocks androgen receptors from receiving testosterone. Since this renders testing T levels completely useless, my doc and I decided that I would take Bicalutamide by itself for at least a month, simply to ensure that does in fact affect me. I've read here and other places online that it does a wonderful job at reducing body hair, and muscle mass, and I've heard from a few people that they've had good experiences with scalp hair regrowth on Bicalutamide. I'm hoping someone here can tell me roughly what kind of timeline they experienced (as in, noticed body hair loss around x weeks, or noticed muscle mass loss at x weeks).

I'm a heterosexual male from NYC, artist and supporter of the LGBT community. The last few months I've been spending it thinking about doing my next art project about transgender people, let's call it (by now) ""The Transtitled"" (wow, what a bad name... Any suggestion?) The Transtitled is a series of portraits shot on B&amp;W 35mm and integral film (instant film) with small interviews with all kind of stories from the transgender community.

Now, you might be asking why I want to do this project?
Well, it's 2016 and I've notice that even thought a lot of people still DON'T accept the LGBT community, the trans seem to suffer the most because of those kind of people. Example, a gay man can ""hide"" the fact that he's gay if no one ask him directly. But for a Trans man, it's more difficult, he would get a lot of bad looks, insults, ""You're a woman!"" Etc.

And what's the reason behind it?
Simple: to tell the stories.
Also, at the end of the project, all the pictures are going to be on an art gallery where a percent of the sells of the pictures will go to a chosen trans center.

So, if you're still reading, is because you're interested.
And this is when I need your help (two ways):
I need to gather a series of questions for the interview.
I already have some (from the point of view of a heterosexual man) but I want more questions to ask but from the point of view of a transgender. That is one way of helping.

The second way is for people living in New York City: if you're a trans man/woman and want to physically help me with this project (meaning interviewing more trans people with me) PM me

Thanks for reading all this, hope to hear from all of you soon and have a good day!

MaybeJustGrace,asktransgender,I'm MTF currently transitioning. How do I save my marriage? [Long text],"reposted from /r/mypartneristrans as I'm really in need personal help/advise on my situation this time around. Long text warning.


I'm MtF currently transitioning and is married to cis female partner (hereinafter referred as ""she""). For the most parts, she says she supported for who I am (a mtf transgender). 

However, occasionally always resented and said things like
* ""you never cared about others' feeling and just decided to transition anyway""
* ""why not delay transition after having kids, and have them all grown up"" (i.e. delay about up to 15+ years?)
* ""but there's social stigma for the children if we raise them as 2 moms""
* ""you only cared about your mental health but not others""
* ""you're the one suffering but you drag everyone along""
* etc. in similar messages related to transitioning.

To be very frank, I know my transitioning really did hurt her, but everytime when she brought up messages similar like above (either in real life or text messages), my heart shatters and sometimes it even makes me feel angry - angry that she does not seem to understand what i am going through. 

Today, after almost ~2 months, I finally understood what she meant when she said those. She was just feeling insecure and felt betrayed that I've lied to her and just needed reassurances from me. But I took it the wrong way and think that she is not being supportive, which things seems to have took a wrong turn and she now wants a divorce.

The problem is I'm always bad with words, especially guessing ambiguous meanings. Where as for her personality she's usually not the straightforward type - which is why during our relationship (before my self denial of trans ended), everytime when we argue, we both decided that we'll just give each other time (basically leave us alone) to sort things out and it'll resolve. So for the transitioning issue I took the similar approach (which was what we agreed in the past) and seems like this time around it's a huge mistake.


I'm sorry for the messy messages, I'm really at loss now... any help is really really appreciated. All the negative suicidal thoughts are just flooding my mind now but I'm holding it all back. I really want to solve this.


**TL;DR** Marriage on brink of breaking. I'm at loss. Partner usually don't speak out in straightforward way and I have to guess, and I always make the wrong guess. Took wrong approach and things turned sour now. HELP!"
FrientCoder,asktransgender,"Anyone else ""suddenly"" discover they were trans purely because they just hadn't seriously thought about it before?","I've never been comfortable in my own skin, even when I was in decent shape. The mirror was never really my friend, but I had no idea I was feeling dysphoria. I knew *of* transgender women and I knew *of* lesbians, but never once did it cross my mind that I might identify more as a lesbian transwoman. When for whatever reason I finally thought about it seriously it was like a lightbulb turned on.

I've never been so dysphoric that I wanted to kill myself, but I had a bout of depression for a couple years that ended in me reading loads and loads of self-help books and listening to motivational podcasts. Not once during that process did transgender even cross my mind. In the end I was able to at least accept that I'd just have to settle for what I am. I mean, I didn't even know why I didn't identify with myself much. I just thought I was weird.

I'm just curious because I see so many posts about how transwomen spent their whole life wishing they were the other gender and contemplating suicide it was so bad. I've never been that depressed. I think I just found happiness in things outside myself like my work, games, and my small circle of friends and that was enough to keep my mind off of it.

Am I not a very common case or are there more like me who kind of just had an epiphany one day and realized they could be happier than they were?"
DArkingMan,asktransgender,I have some questions about transgenderism.,"I've done some researching with searching trans 101 on Google and whatnot, but there is still a fundamental concept that I don't understand. I just don't get how gender can be part of someone's identity.

If a trans female told me ""I identify myself as a female,"" what exactly does she mean by that? Does she mean that she fits the female stereotype? Or does she mean she will feel more comfortable with a female body? And if it is about the body, is it out of mere preference? Or does she have a ""female brain"" that somehow doesn't fit a male body?

I still have some questions depending on the answers I receive. Thanks in advance.



**EDIT** Thanks again for everyone who've taken their time to better my understanding. I appreciate your help greatly."
gninoitseuq,asktransgender,Bad / wrong reasons to transition?,"So I've been questioning for about 2 months now and part of me thinks I would be a lot happier living as a girl.

I also have this gut feeling that transitioning would be a big mistake for me and won't actually do anything to improve my condition.

I know there are lots of bad reasons to not transition, but are there bad reasons to transition? Like, just feeling you would be a lot happier with a gender other than the one you were assigned?"

[deleted],asktransgender,Is my denial back?,"I found out that I'm trans in 2013. After that I've been in denial until late 2014. During that time I was very depressive and suicidal. For some time I even went so far and created another personality to avoid my true self.

Ever since it was getting better and better. I started to see more opportunities, got hope again, and so on.

For a few days I feel like I'm going back again, though. There are for example those thoughts like *""what if I just made this up?""*, *""what if it's just a phase?""*, *""if I transition, I'll regret it afterwards""*. Also my dysphoria hasn't been present 24/7, like it used to. It's still there a lot, but not all the time. Why would it start to disappear, if nothing changes?

I'm not transitioning yet *(inhumane requirements, not able to relocate)*, so I still have about 1.5 to 2 years to think about all that. It's still confusing me a lot right now...

I went to the beach with my girlfriend and just pulled off my shirt and splashed into the water in just my trunks. I was so glad she was there to share it with me, as she has been wonderful. (We met after my HRT was about two years along but just before my surgery, so she fell in love with me as a man. That's a victory too!)

And it's one of the only two places I have yet to come out (the only one where I truly feel uncomfortable). It seems like it's so much harder to pass without radical HRT effects. Makeup is out of place, gendering of clothing is less obvious, sweat is unflattering for your hair (and wigs are impossible), and it's hard to keep your voice right when you're out of breath.

And then there's change rooms. My gym is fortunately a small one with single room change rooms, so non-issue there, but most gyms aren't like that. Change rooms are more exposing than bathrooms.

So what have you guys done? Did you wait an especially long time before trying to pass at a gym?

Drosophila_melanogas,asktransgender,Anyone else glad they're not a cis version of their identified gender?,"Although, being a feminine trans woman, I have a lot of regrets about so many years lost not having been able to express myself as a feminine girl/woman, other than that, I came to realise that I wouldn't have it any other way than being trans.

1) For all I know, growing up as a cis girl in the same circumstances, I'd most likely have been a brainwashed, homophobic, transphobic woman with internalized misogyny.

I'd have had no reason to overcome the brainwashing and to become more tolerant of others. My hobbies, interests and general knowledge would also most likely be less diverse due to most likely having been discouraged to pursue non-ladylike stuff.

Simply put, if I was a cis girl from birth, I would simply not be *me* anymore.

I also don't have to wonder all my life who I am and then still not find an answer for it like a lot of cis people.

2) I'd also have taken things for granted. As a trans woman, however, I can cherish every time I get gendered correctly, every time I get to wear the clothes I want, and so on. 

I will never take any of those for granted, so it's like free amphetamines in a way, due to the dopamine surges that come from them. (I like this double-edged sword aspect of gender dysphoria at least - the lows may be low, but the highs are high too.)

3) And while some people might argue that therefore being reborn as cis with trans knowledge/memories would be the best thing possible if it existed, personally, I am not so sure about that.

**TW for people with reproductive dysphoria:**

As someone who doesn't have reproductive dysphoria herself, I sure as hell am glad I don't have to deal with extremely unpredictable and/or annoying periods, the possibility of getting ovarian cysts, endometriosis, uterine/ovarian/cervical cancers, the negative aspects of pregnancy (not just the pain, but nausea, constipation, gestational diabetes, etc., and also life-threatening complications, problems regarding abortion legality and availability, unwanted pregnancies, etc.) and the list goes on.

Compounded with this, is that it's not like I'm not putting myself out there, not trying to date. I'm on OKCupid, and pretty aggressive at it. I'm mostly into queer lesbian or bi women. But I never get far with anything. Not much, lately anyways.
 In a shallow sense, I don't find myself to be all that unattractive. 

I get the sense that I scare folks off because I'm trans. And that really hurts. And that feeds into my sense of loneliness. I get so deeply lonely that I cry, because it hurts.

I feel I have many things in my life together but I still feel like shit at the end of the day sometimes. How have you dealt with these feelings?

* I've wanted to become a girl since I was about 11 or 12.
* Never told anyone, but bottling up my emotions has  affected me mentally and emotionally significantly for the past 4 years. (Due to moving before 9th grade)
* About 2 months ago I came out to my best friend and she was awesome about it! (Bought me makeup as a birthday gift!)
* Told my mother I was Bi-sexual and she wasn't shocked about it and was fine with it. (Left out being trans)
* Started going to a psychologist/therapist 2 weeks ago. (Not much has happened there yet)
* My grades are mediocre but are decent enough to net a few scholarships.
* I want to wait a year to go to college so I can transition.

I plan on working a full time job for a few months after school to save up a couple thousand dollars. (While living with my mother and step-dad) I don't feel particularly close to my family and despise where I've lived (flat &amp; boring) for the past 4-5 years. With that being said I plan to move a few hundred miles to a mountainous place where I can really enjoy nature and being me. (I love the jogging, hiking, skiing and the outdoors in general.) I defiantly plan on transitioning once I move away. Also this isn't something I plan to do in secrecy, I will tell family eventually but I just don't want to have to depend on anyone while I'm busy being me.

Why move away and make the transition harder?
I don't believe I could possibly be happy where I live even if I weren't transgender (Living in a fairly conservative community also)  and my step-dad has stated that he's disgusted by transgender people.

So where should I be going in life? Is this the absolute worst way I could be going about this? I probably left some important details so I'll try to include that as questions come up.

liwyp,asktransgender,"Is it possible for a ""full-time"" transition without transition in workplace? Have anyone similar experience?","I am 27, mtf, currently in a junior-middle management post which main duties are in-house administration with occasional contacts with clients.

I have been on female hormones for 18 months and am living ""full-time"" save as in workplace for 6 months.  At about the same time when I went ""full-time"" I began to talk with the HR about the possibility of transition in workplace.  However, they are not very supportive and said that there will be a lot of problems including the bathroom and legal issues (in my country I can only legally be identified as female only after the SRS).  In turn, they said that everything will be much easier and they will support my ""transition"" after all the surgeries are completed.  Their view is that there is no problem even I get long hair and look more and more ""feminine"" so far as I am still wearing man suit and every other things being unchanged. 

I know that is reality and my therapist also propose the same. I also afraid my colleagues will not accept my coming out in workplace and that would ruin my work.  But, if that work?"
roundabout25,asktransgender,NY orchiectomy? And other questioms,"So, I'm 14 months HRT and at the point where I'm a long way away from being able to schedule SRS, but tired of dealing with spironolactone. Besides the side effects being pretty harsh on me, I've read pretty often that estrogen is more effective when testosterone is absent as opposed to suppressed. 

I'd like to get an orchi that doesn't interfere with future SRS. Ideally, I think that means I'd want inguinal? But I'm concerned about the scarring, and I haven't been able to find much info on what orchi scarring looks like further down the line, especially inguinal scarring. 

So, questions:

* should I get an inguinal or scrotal (w/o scrotum removal) orchi?

* how bad is the scarring over time, assuming a competent doctor?

* are there any good doctors for this in NY? My insurance should cover it at this point. I'm educated on most surgeons for everything else, but I'm comparatively very ignorant about orchi doctors

* how much will it impact future SRS? Should I just deal with spiro for a few more years?

Any suggestions."
tqxw,asktransgender,"""Not trans enough"" bullshit","OK, so, I'm 99.5% sure I'm transgender (pre-everything MtF), but there are some things that make me feel like I would be out of place with other trans people.

I experience gender dysphoria very differently. Like, I enjoy looking at the mirror, taking selfies (mostly looking for angles that make me look more feminine), etc. I don't feel particularly bad about my facial hair and I've gotten used to my body hair.

What I do feel is something very indirect. I have almost no motivation to do anything productive at all. Whenever I HAVE to do something, I pretty quickly end up feeling suicidal. It seems for me like my life has negative value itself and working to continue it seems absurd since ending it is easier. (note: I'm OK at the moment, no need to worry)

When I was younger I felt some more common symptoms, like being uncomfortable naked near men, ashamed of male features of my body (particularly hair on my legs and chest) but it seems like I've learned to cope with this stuff. 

I experience gender euphoria a lot. Just looking in the mirror and seeing myself at least a bit ""feminine"" makes me really happy. Same with being called by correct pronouns. 

So the problem is, I guess, that when transition is life-or-death thing (at least in country as transphobic as mine) for most trans people, it may seem like I just want transition for enjoyment, by choice. And I know that isn't 100% true but, let's face it, I probably could live (a pretty shitty) life as a dude.

I can't even find strength to come out to my FtM boyfriend. He barely manages to deal with his day-to-day life and has extremely strong dysphoria. I would feel like a total asshole appropriating his suffering if I ever told him. And don't get me started on joining a transgender support group, where I would probably be a single person whose life is not completely miserable. 

I just feel like I'm not ""trans enough"" to deserve support, I guess. How can I deal with these feelings?

Really sorry for this rant-y messy post."
Heterogenic,asktransgender,"Hypothetically, how would a successful stealth trans woman ""give back""?","I'm long past transition and stealth, and life has gone pretty well since.  I've had a few successful startups, tried strategic consulting at McKinsey, done a Harvard MBA, have a great C-level position at a Fortune-1000 (all after transition) and am generally pretty happy with things.  
  
Every once in a while I come out to someone, usually in an LGBT-org context, and I get shit for ""hiding,"" ""not supporting the community"" or ""abusing passing privilege"".  This really gets under my skin.  I give a lot of financial support to trans causes and paid my activist dues when I was younger, so being called a "" trans traitor"" by a freshly out college student drives me bonkers.  
  
I don't want to debate the morality/authenticity of stealth now, but I do have a completely serious question for the more active edge of the community:  
  
*What does ""being an advocate/role model"" mean in 2016?*  
  
I'm not a media personality, I don't have a platform or soapbox, I have no means to ""come out"" beyond my immediate circle of friends and employees.  That wouldn't make much of difference, and would really suck for me socially.  I don't get the feeling that just being trans is (or should be) newsworthy in and of itself.  I've considered taking a board seat with an LGBT charity, but that's usually purely ceremonial.  
  
I want to help those people who are now where I was twenty years ago, but I don't even know how to start.  "
-Valtyra-,asktransgender,Voice Training help!,"Hey all! 

As the title suggests, I've been trying to train my voice for a couple of days now, (not long, I know), and I've run into a problem. Sore throat :(

Will it subside if I continue? I've been using [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1ske7b/mtf_voice_training_regimen/) for my training and I honestly don't know if I've been following it correctly.

Help! :("
Winter-leaves,asktransgender,Anyone else ever think of de-transitioning because they don't think they would pass?,"Sorry if this might be considered a trigger warning for some.

I still present 100% male, I'm in my mid 30's (Yeah, I know, I've heard the older = less changes +/- YMMV) and have been on HRT for about 10 months now.  I feel like very little has changed for me other than some loss of strength and fat redistribution.  I wasn't super masculine looking but I was definitely on the macho/muscular side of the spectrum prior to HRT.  Prior to HRT, I told my therapist and doc that one of my biggest fears were that I would end up always looking male and not even close to passing.

Well, after facial hair removal and growing out my hair a bit, I've been told I looked much younger and even got carded!  I also had my therapist, doc, and friends tell me that I would have no problems passing and I would only need minor ffs if I really wanted it.  The thing is, I wish I believed them but I think they're just being nice.  I'll see myself in the mirror, depending on the lighting, time of day, how puffy I am, or which mirror I'm looking at, I feel like I either look awesome or hideous.  So much in fact that I have no real idea of how I'm perceived by others.

At this point, I feel like even after ffs (tentatively scheduled next May), I'll probably live as a guy because I feel like it would make life easier and stopping HRT will probably make me miserable so that's not in the cards right now.

Anyway, this has been bothering me for a while and was wondering how others felt or coped."
Androjin,asktransgender,Should I be more open with my therapist?,So I've been getting closer and closer to my breaking point on suicide and my friend keeps insisting I talk to my therapist about this. I feel like I should talk about it but I'm worried I'll either be locked up or barred from HRT in the future because of being suicidal. Is this a legitimate fear or am I just being paranoid?
BlissfulSomeone,asktransgender,What would you consider fulltime?,"Heyhey! Me again!  
So since I started to present myself my authentically I'd definitely say that I have moved onto being part time, I just figured that out. Then I continued thinking. What is left until I would be considered fulltime? Do I really need to practice my voice? Do I need laser done? Do I need to bend over for the social built gender roles? I don't know. Do I need to... Pass!? (that word, NO!)  
Some days I wear tights and dresses, other days I wear just jeans and some button shirt, from the women section ofc. I wear a bra everyday because, well, I kinda need to after four months on estrogen. But still. Without being all too girly I don't know if I'm already fulltime without really knowing it or.. uh. It's really hard to word out my thoughts sometime.  

My point is, I guess, that I never really switched from full guy mode to full gal mode. I've had a long phase of presenting as andro as I can and slowly turned one piece of my presentation more girly so to speak. So to me, the line between not presenting, part time and full time is very blurry.  

Any thoughts on this?"
funvancouverman,asktransgender,normal for her to cum without touching her?,"First off I don't have a lot of experience with trans women.
 
A girl I've played with several times always seems satisfied even though I've never touched her ""clit"". Can a girl cum just from being penetrated? The last time we did it she said her panties were so wet. I'm not sure whether to touch her or not. She keeps her panties on when we fuck so I kind of get the impression she's not into it  and I feel odd about asking.

Recently with another girl I had a feeling she might like to be played with, I asked and she was ok with it. Her panties came right off when we were getting into it, and we went down on each other, then I fucked her but didn't touch her clit,  but she still came and squirted everywhere. With a cis-girl my hands would need to be working full time for her to cum like that.

Just wondering how normal this is and if I'm doing it right"
continuityOfficer,asktransgender,"My mum thinks I may just be gay or it may be ""caused by trauma"".","My mum just told me that she thinks that I may not be transsexual and that I may just be gay. She says I want to be trans out of some traphobia because she's convinced that somehow its easier to be trans then gay. She says that due to some trauma I used to have she thinks I decided that I was trans instead of gay. 

She refuses to believe that I could possibly know more then her on the subject despite actively researching this everynight for more then a year.

IDK, she was being really supportive, but then she said this and I feel crushed, like, she doesn't believe me. She says that she's not saying anything about whether I am or not, but I just feel naturally insulted by it.

I feel hurt and insulted and like I lost the one person I thought I could kind of trust to help me.

She says that because im not entirely sure on my sexuality, and because i've had trauma that I cant  know that I want this, and says that a therapist would be the same about it.

I hate my body as it is now, I hate how people see me as it is now, I hate that I was so unlucky that I couldn't simply have been born as a girl and not have to deal with this mess. I hate that even in spite of us unlucky as I was, that someone closest to me wont even trust me on that... that she would even suggest that I, someone who is well known for taking forever to make decisions, would decide something im unsure of. And I feel insulted for all trans people frankly, to insinuate that being trans is somehow easier then being gay.

ZelkyZo,asktransgender,Has anyone else experienced spikes in testosterone before it finally dropped off? What changed?,"Looking for some hope.  My T started at 393 ng/dL, dropped to 200 at 3 months, and shot back up to 345 this past Friday at 6 months.  Similarly I was started on 25mg spiro twice daily, upped to 25mg thrice daily, and finally 50mg twice daily for my 3rd month.  At my 3rd month checkup I had low blood pressure so my endo knocked me back down to 25mg twice daily spiro.

In case it matters, my E started at 23 pg/mL, jumped to 375 at 3 months, and dived to 169 last Friday at 6 months.  I take sublingual estradiol 1mg twice daily which hasn't changed since I started.

If anyone else has had similar experiences but eventually got their levels corrected, please share your stories if you don't mind.  I've got little hope left right now.  :("

kallmekat,asktransgender,"Not a question, but a happy story from a past question","So I posted a little while back about looking for some way to get things shipped from Amazon with unsupportive parents and stuff. Well, I finally thought of a way to do it and received my items happily today. It may seem sketchy, but I posted on Craigslist that I was willing to pay someone to deliver stuff to their place and have them drive it out to me. 

Here's where it gets kinda interesting. I had a few people respond saying I was asking way too low, but I just ignored it. I ended up with a selection of 3 people, and choose to go with the closest one. He turned out to be a very interesting fellow...

He is a chaser. Of course. I made it clear in the post that the person must be LGBT+ friendly, but never thought that a person would be that friendly. I was wrong. He sent me a few disturbing pictures, and I actually thought about spending some time with him, but I would've been breaking my number 1 rule. He was into me. And I mean, really into me. He had recently separated from his wife and didn't want anyone to know of his ""tendencies."" I let it go and just said I'd deal with his advances when they came. This was way easier than I thought, and he stopped saying stuff like that as soon as I asked him to.

Anyways, got all of my items today very happily. Was able to meet at a village centre outside of my parents knowledge, bless. As for the items, my most important thing was my first pair of actual breast forms!!! I don't think I've ever been happier. They match my skin tone exactly, it's great. Anyone know of any good tutorials for how to apply adhesive and wear them? I have 3M 77 for those who know anything about anything. I also got my prom dress and a nice pair of heels. I love this man now (not more than my girlfriend though!!!). 

I don't think I could ever be happier in the foreseeable future, and I just wanted to share a little bit of positivity and thankfulness for this community, you people are life savers."
Hunter-Hunted,asktransgender,"I can't think of many Pros, just lots of Cons","Hi, /r/asktransgender 

I'm 18, male, and living with my parents. It's an Asian household, but it's not as strict as a traditional Asian household. But like most Asian families, the opinions of relatives and especially grandparents or great grandparents are important. I have more relatives than I can count or remember that we keep in touch with and are important to me and my parents.

&amp;nbsp;

My dad's side of the family is more traditional, while my mom's side of the family is more white-washed. My dad had a cousin who had a daughter born out of wedlock. The daughter is only in elementary, or even younger than that. The daughter wanted to genuinely be a boy, and her mother approved of that. The grandparents on my dad's side of the family didn't, so they disowned the cousin. 

&amp;nbsp;

My life is going extremely smoothly at the moment. Financial Aid to fund college, a house that I know I can live in for as long as I want as like I don't do anything stupid or get lazy, plenty of friends and relatives I like, no enemies, no drama, nothing more that I could really ask for, and I'm enjoying my hobbies (art and league of legends). I've thought about transitioning since I was around 8 though. Maybe it was fascination, maybe I thought if I transition I'll be happier because I'd enjoy looking at my body and making friends would be easier online. I usually only think about transitioning when I get depressed, because my life is otherwise completely fine. 

&amp;nbsp;

I bought my first wig and learned about make up 9 months ago spontaneously at a convention I was attending. I tried it all on, was excited with the results. Went out in public the next day, to buy eyeliner and other stuff from CVS and I was even given the keys to the women's bathroom without a second thought at BK. Months later, I bought more clothes, more make up, and I've gone to the mall and to school dressed as a girl on multiple occasions. I've already told and shown all of my friends. I've passed visually with a wig+makeup since day1 and vocally recently. I don't have any problem with my gender or genitals. *If I had the choice though, I'd be a girl.* I feel like HRT would be successful for me, that's the only transition cost I think I'll have to pay. From what I read, HRT isn't that expensive and I definitely have a lump sum to keep paying for it if I never have to pay rent.
&amp;nbsp;

People usually transition because they have some trouble with their body, but that doesn't apply to me. So ... I don't really know why I would transition other than being more in love with my body, even though I don't have any problems with my body as is now. 

&amp;nbsp;

Pros: Spend more time on my appearance (extreme minimal effort as a guy), wearing cute clothes (especially those leggings with the cat/bears on them), and having my online personality matching how I look in real life permanently. Lying feels bad.
&amp;nbsp;

Cons: Getting kicked out, disowned by family, estranged. I kind of like my relatives, and I'm not sure how I'd interact with my parents or siblings if I transitioned. It just seems awkward trying to imagine it. 

&amp;nbsp;

My pros feel kind of ... materialistic compared to how bad my cons are. I feel like I have a lot of familial responsibility, and I like to think that this quote from [Barbie's Princess and the Pauper](https://youtu.be/cO5-esiH_WM?t=3m35s) applies here. ""Duty means doing the things your heart may well regret."" This is a decision I've been contemplating for over 10 years and my only fear back then was that I wouldn't look good as a girl. I've confirmed I would pass but ... getting kicked out and ex-communicated would be a major roadblock in my life. I don't really want to make my parents feel bad by being forced to kick me out of the house.

&amp;nbsp;

tl;dr: no gender dysphoria, no problem with body, will get kicked out almost indefinitely if I transition."

The only feminine part I remember is using girl clothes at puberty (systematically wore pantyhose when waxing the shaft, stealing mom's bras, etc...). I never ever wanted to be a girl. I also remember looking not manly enough to my taste (small frame, etc....) as a teen.

Later (around 20) came the day when I inadvertently pictured myself as a girl with a man in bed, waiting to be penetrated (while I was actually picturing being the man right before when waxing the shaft), and it shook my core (incredible feeling at the core of my chest). The same kind of feeling came while I randomly chose a woman attitude when walking in the street, ... but I did not pay attention...  Then various fetishes occurred, crossdressing (compulsively buying fem clothes wtf), makeup, shaving legs, painting nails... ALL WITHOUT any f*cking help from the internet or anything. I was doing crazy things, or so I thought.

Then I stumbled upon reddit ... Then came euphoria first, and then dysphoria, including genitals. 

I know this is a spectrum, but is my story atypical ?
Can anyone relate a bit to that ? 
Am I less authentic than those who knew very young ?

Psychogre,asktransgender,"Youtube, art, and life?","mmm some of you might remember my more depressing ""cry for help"" a few weeks ago. Ah was having a rough time of it sorry about that. 

Anyways I'm just trying to focus on moving forward and in that spirit I guess I'd like to discuss these thing with y'all since you know, you guys get it. :P That said I've always been interested in doing youtube content but I know that would open up a huge hellish portal of negativity into my life and that youtube comments are insanely transphobic. I also have the added problem of being completely male bodied and male voiced right now and have no idea how I'd go about presenting myself or trying to find a none cringy voice to talk in or how to even find my female voice since I'm limited greatly by money and resources where I am at in life and such. That said I have seen a lot about how talking to people can break down walls and erode hatred even if it is hard and the idea of maybe being able to dispel some transphobia make me happy but I don't know. What do you think?

Additionally my life is in a bit of shambles right now. I'm failing out of college atm because I have no interest in what I'm studying and the added burden of disphoria is really hard to cope with. I really want to start transitioning but I'm heavier and have a history of diabetes in my family and worry about the health effects of hormones as well as the high blood pressure and extreme migraines I got when I attempted it briefly three years ago, should I just focus on my weight for now? I feel like this male body is slowly killing me anyways. 

Aside from that I know the only thing I'm passionate about is art and illustration but going to school for that is hella expensive and I already have some debt do to my mom bullying me into college for comp sci despite my reservations. I could just self teach myself and become some brilliant illustrator while working a shit job somewhere I'm sure &lt;__&lt; but what other options could I have? Any Ideas? I mean I do enjoy programing as a hobby and have an AS in it but I felt like if I kept pursuing it I'd never become an artist and I can't imagine myself giving up on that dream, as ridiculous as it might sound. Anyways cheers and look forward to any advice anyone can give me. Sorry for the text wall!!!"

Seeing as Outlink folded last year and I assume some things have presumably changed in the transition landscape here, I was wondering if any of the Alberta/Calgary/Canada trans peeps here have any suggestions as to psychs or even any new doctors providing informed consent as far as hormones are concerned (or health care in general as my GP basically told me to find a new doctor after I asked her about trans stuff). I tend to find you need a pretty good sense of humour to survive in Alberta but I'm pretty much on my last legs here.

My parents asked me to go through his computer to see if there was anything in his history that might give us some closure. 

Lo and behold there were several transgender sites listed in his browsing history, including this very subreddit.

I'm still trying to process my own thoughts and feelings about this, but I'm uncertain whether or not to tell my folks.

Basically I think I need to lose about 70lbs, and I've been trying to do that through calorie intake control. So I limit myself to 1750 calories a day. In addition to burning 200-300 cals through walking/jogging. I also fast once a week for cultural reasons. 

I should be losing 1-1.5 lbs per week.

Is my calorie intake too little? 

Will I stunt my growth or any effects of HRT because I'm not getting all the food I need? Because this is basically second puberty right?

I really want to lose all this year in about 15 months. 

Is this plan healthy and/or feasible?

Because I would really be upset if my beasts/hips/etc didn't grow properly because of this.

ITriedIPromise,asktransgender,"I feel like I should just end it... but if I tell anyone, I'll just end up in a hospital.","And then I will definitely kill myself. I can't stand hospitals.

I just kind of fail at everything. I managed to somewhat successfully come out to my parents, but I feel like my father's support was more, ""oh you can change those feelings."" My mother is an abusive narcissistic freak who will never support me.

I know there are many kind people on the internet whom I can talk to... but that's just not the same as a face to face conversation with friends or family. And ultimately, any friends/family that I actually trust will simply call the authorities, regardless of what I tell them, should I try talking to them.

Transition is... possible? Maybe? I don't want to be a trans woman. I want to be a woman. I want dysphoria to leave me alone, and go away. I do not want to want to be a cis guy, however. I want the voices in my head to stop. The dissociative voices that my parents don't believe, that psychologists have no answer for. Every time I turn around, I see these idiots, these stupid white male politicians who have never faced a lick of discrimination in their lives, trying to pass laws to make my life miserable. I'm a girl, I've known it since I was three, and none of these idiots are going to change that.

I just want it to end... I want to call a suicide hotline, just to talk to a real person, but I don't want them to try and get me to call the police on myself, which I know they will, especially when they find out I'm all ready to end it... I've spent the past half hour with just me and a razor blade, and I think maybe, this is what I want.

I don't think I believe this. My therapist has been trying to convince me that she knows lots of trans people who are living happy lives, but I don't know if I trust her. In my mind, the life of a trans person, no matter how great it is, is never going to be as good as the life of a cis person in the same scenario. 

I can't image my friends wanting to be around me once I tell them. Every time they think of inviting me to do something, they'll pause for a minute and think ""do I really want to be around *that*?"" 

I can't imagine my family being proud of me, no matter what I accomplish. It'll always be ""yeah, he did this thing, *but*...""

I can't imagine anyone being able to love someone who's as broken as I am. I couldn't handle dating as a straight cis male. What chance do I have now?

Well transitioning is the thing that saved my life and is the reason that I am still alive today. Clearly I am very happily transitioning and so content with life. 



As a child, my parents were everything, I looked up to them so much and loved them so much. Slowly things started to unravel, the older I got the more emotional abuse and neglect there was. It was a very big issue added on top of my gender dysphoria. I've essentially emotionally cut them off (while still living with them, which is changing soon) and plan to go no contact. I know this is the right decision for myself and I cant grow as a person with such toxic people in my life. But sometimes I lay awake at night wishing I had parents who unconditionally loved and supported me. My parents rejecting the most important, positive thing in my life makes me feel very alone in the world at times.

shonkshonk,asktransgender,Changing from Spiro to Cyrpo,"TL;DR: Hormone levels reverted back to (male) normal. Doc is considering what to do.
- Differences between Cypro and Spiro (esp. breast growth and libido)
- Is there stronger estrogen patches than 100micrograms?

/////

Hey folks, just hoping I can get a little advice on my HRT. My doc is pretty good, he is still learning, he's a GP not an endo, but he works at a practice with some doctors very experienced in HRT.

I have been on HRT (I'm a trans woman) since November. Started out with just Estradot patches, they didn't do much, then moved on to Climara and Spiro. My estrogen quickly moved to close to female range, my testosterone was still low male but 'coming down'. (From memory, which is spotty at best, it was 4 point something... something?).

Since things have been moving in the right direction, I haven't had a blood test in three months. I got the test this week and my Estrogen levels are way down (like 60 pmol I think??) And my testosterone went back up to normal male range.

Doc says he is thinking of putting me on Cypro instead of Spiro. He is currently confirming with a colleague. He says that I *might* also have better breast growth as well.

Can anyone let me know about the differences between the two? He was a bit fuzzy himself to be honest... I'd love some more breast growth but tbh I'm worried about libido going down and it has been great on Spiro so far (though I would be doubling my dose if I stayed on Spiro).

Also I would love not to have to put two patches on (his recommendation is to at least for know stagger patches but have two on at all times). I'm already sick of cleaning the adhesive off and having red marks all over my thighs. Currently taking Climara 100 micrograms patches and Spiractin 100 micrograms. 

Does anyone know if there is a stronger patch so I only need one? Can't take oral coz blood reasons.

Thanks everyone for your input and help. I also had my first laser the other day (chest and stomach) so yay for progress!"

bluekorra19,asktransgender,"I think I want to try DIY hormones, but I have no idea what to do","I've been thinking about it a lot lately and, nearly every trans persons' story I've read here starts with them taking hormones and knowing that they are (or aren't) trans based on their experience on T or E. 

I think I'd be interested just in trying out E to see how I react to it. How would one (theoretically) go about it? I have no interest in going to a therapist at all at this point because it's just not working out at all. I've tried with two different therapists and it just makes me sadder that I couldn't tell them I really think I'm transgender. I've thought of it, and I suppose I could open up a PO box to get it mailed to which would make it separate from my family (No one knows that I suspect I'm trans). 

Anyway, I do have a job, I'm not in school, so money isn't a huge issue right now because I have a couple thousand saved up.

TheClaireProject,asktransgender,"For any that are scared of coming out, I wish to share my experience with you.","&lt;3 Hello to this wonderful community. I'd like to start off by thanking anyone that reads this who has posted before. Because of the questions being answered (and a specific someone, you know who you are &lt;3), I've decided to fully pursue this to bring Claire into the physical world from my mental one. 

Now onto the point of this post; I made a post when I first came here, unintentionally explaining my life story (which can be annoying sometimes, and I apologize if I did bother anyone). I started having transgender thoughts at 18, you know, wondering if my feminine behavior maybe meant something more than being just a submissive boy and other questions like that. I had talked to a close friend of mine about it, explaining when I was little I did want to be a girl and things I could remember that supported this. That was my first time telling anyone about it, and reasonably as I'm sure everyone can relate, I was scared of it being taken negatively. My friend had told me he ""knew who I was and this wasn't it"", and to think it over carefully...something that irritated me, but not that he could help it. I grew up with people being able to so easily change my mind by saying they knew who I was or, for example, when I told my mother as a child I thought about wanting to be a girl, she angrily told me that I shouldn't think like that because it was gay. Of course, being a child, I immediately stopped. Clearly if it upset my mom I shouldn't think that way, right?

Anyway, more to the point. After 3 years of hiding these thoughts from anyone offline, I finally told my closest cousin this past February. I had been afraid of telling him the most, because regardless of how often we argue or fight, he is probably the only person I truly **trust with anything** in this world. And when I told him, I told him **everything**, which was 3 years of stuff I'd hidden. Being bisexual, losing my previous job (cashier at a Sam's Club) after not showing up for 3 full weeks due to some serious depression, and then finally my wanting to become Claire. 

Telling him this went from horrifying to pretty funny, because he thought the extent of my problems was being bisexual. ""I've known for awhile, I didn't want you to be uncomfortable but I knew you'd tell me eventually"", was his response, up until I spoke of changing genders, to which he stopped dead and just kind of stared at me with his mouth halfway open. In short, he didn't see that coming. We talked for a good...I dunno, 4 hours, after that? This was late at night, too. So, where I was expecting him to resent me for wanting to change, he did a complete 180 and started calling me by Claire **that same night**. 

After that, about a month went by...in that time, my parents found out about my therapy, though I didn't say why I was going. I told them I'd tell them when I was ready...and I didn't think I would tell, honestly. My cousin and I both agreed, after the display my parents pulled finding I was bisexual (almost got kicked out by mom, dad said I was selfish for not taking the family into consideration, which you know makes all the sense in the world *sarcasm*), that they would NOT take this well. So, around the end of March when I'd gotten my new job (selling Comcast services with a third party company, pretty nice job actually), I had my talk with mom. First being, you know, why did you freak the fuck out on me for telling you I was into men, which she responded with ""I just wanted you to be sure you were before you came out like that"" which I find a little...untrue. I firstly believe it was shock, and I know several instances down the road from that she made little comments to my 'gay jokes' like ""I raised you better"" and ""Don't make those jokes they aren't funny"". Anyway, so she said she didn't have a problem with that telling me she'd always love me and what not...and I asked about what if it was worse than that now. She then immediately guessed about my wanting to change, and again I experienced a complete 180 from a family member. Not only did I now have insurance support, but she told dad, who STILL thinks I'm being selfish, not thinking of how my family will be effected socially by my transformation, that he needed to get over it because she'll be at my side no matter what I choose, **with or without him**. 

I promise I'm getting to the point, this is all part of it, and I appreciate you reading this far. &lt;3 

My friends were next...all but one is fully supportive (which I completely understand, she's pretty religious and I wasn't expecting her to be happy about it), and on top of this, just a few nights ago I told some fellow coworkers, who all took it amazingly well...asking questions, saying they support it and will still be friends with me, telling me the ""pretty name I chose""...and on top of all this, the company is pretty liberal in thinking, and there is someone who is already on hormones who may be able to help me, because at this point my only option from what I can tell is driving 2 hours to Columbus Ohio to see a doctor. In the Bible Belt (I live just 10 minutes from Huntington, West Virginia, in Ohio), this was something I didn't think I'd find, so it's fantastic news.

So! **TL;DR:** It is perfectly normal to be afraid and depressed to come out as we all know, and every situation is different. Not everyone is near those who are supportive or friendly...but when you do find the courage to tell someone, even if they don't take it well, please, PLEASE, do not give up, because there will be a light somewhere, someone who is supportive, happy for you, an outlet for you to rant to, SOMETHING. I know when I received talks like this I thought *Yeah ok, sure, I highly doubt this applies to me*, but I'm serious...don't give up. &lt;3

I hope this helps anyone in a rough patch...I was like many who didn't think there was an upside to things, that I would have to go to the ends of the earth to find acceptance, and I found it literally under my feet. 

Again, thank you all for the support and such...though I haven't asked much, the questions of others that have been answered have helped me as well. &lt;3"

Then I came out as trans and the desire kind of went away. fast forward about a month, and I've been waking up in the middle of the night with erections that really annoy me, but go away. Last night, however, I had a dream that I was dressed as a super sexualised girl and tied up. This brought me a lot of joy, but also a ton of stress, because even though I really loved it, I'm afraid it invalidates me.

2) (This one's the stupid one)  She forwarded me an email for a 40% off Lane Bryant coupon and asked me to go through and see if there's anything i like so she can add it to her order.

I wanted to see if anyone had advice on coming out to HR at work?

I'm planning to talk to the HR person on the phone soon, she is rarely actually in the office. I work at a global law firm as a legal assistant in California. They are super queer friendly and there a plenty of queer people in high positions in my office, but I'm unlucky that for some reason the health insurance company is not willing to provide coverage for hormones because the plan they have is, by some arcane legal loophole, exempt from the CA law that recently required most plans to cover them. 

I haven't started hormones yet but I plan to in the next couple weeks without insurance. I'm out to 2 people at the firm, a manager and a coworker, both super supportive. 

I just wanted to know if anyone knows what topics I should definitely discuss, i.e. Timeline, full time, insurance, name, etc. I also am trying to approach the insurance issue in a non-confrontational way and hopefully maybe get them to add coverage to the plan for next year.

Any bit of advice experience helps!!!

But that was the case for my chest as well and they said no problem and it's working great. 

For my face I understand the grey hair won't be lasered away but if I'm able to diminish the amount of hair I need to shave (has been reduced somewhat thanks to HRT) and it would look better then sign me up!!!

But - I've also read a few posts about bad side effects from laser like dark splotches and other bad things.

Throwaway39292694028,asktransgender,How can I support my student who is transitioning in a very hostile environment?,"Hello! I am a cisgender woman who teaches at a religious high school in the Deep South part of the USA. I would like to think that I am an ally, but I don't like using that term because I don't think I deserve a cookie or something just for not being a jerk to other people. I don't want to give away too much info here, because even though I strongly disagree with the way my school is handling things and do plan to leave at some point, I cannot afford to lose my job. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have been lurking around for a bit trying to educate myself. I have made it a point to do some research, so I hope everything I say comes out right. If I do somehow mess up, please let me know and I will edit my post. The last thing I want to do is harm anyone. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have a senior student who was assigned male at birth. She approached me this week and introduced herself with her awesome new name and informed me of her preference that she be referred to with feminine pronouns. 

&amp;nbsp;

My students seem to know that I aim to make sure my classroom is a safe space for everyone. Unfortunately, most of the rest of the school is not. The administration and our guidance counsellors have informed me (and I am assuming other teachers) that ""we"" are choosing not to acknowledge what they believe is a ""phase"" or a ploy for attention. They and the students are choosing to refer to my student using the wrong name and pronouns, and I am expected to do the same. Obviously, I'm not going to do that. I probably do have to leave her old name in official school documents. :(

&amp;nbsp;

Apart from using the correct name and pronouns and reinforcing zero tolerance for bullying, what else can I do to help my student feel supported and safe? She doesn't appear to have a very supportive home life. Like most teachers, I can't do much overt discussion of sex and gender in my classroom, but I don't want this awesome young lady to feel alone in her last few weeks of school. I guess my real question is... For Trans* people who had a rough time in high school, what do you wish your teachers had done to support you? I want to do that.

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you in advance to anyone who can help. 

&amp;nbsp;

tl;dr: How can I support my student as she transitions at a very religious high school in a very hostile part of the US?

**EDIT:** Thank you all so much for your input and ideas. You have no idea how helpful your answers are. I'll keep checking back for a while, but I am definitely going to make sure she knows my door is always open and do some learning about local resources that may be of assistance to her. I am also going to continue listening and learning. You are all wonderful! &lt;3"

Diotima245,asktransgender,I'm conservative yet find transgender females sexually attractive... porn distortion perhaps?,"Greetings, all the recent transgender news regarding bathrooms is amusing. I harbor something I hide because it would be shameful to many people around me. I find pre-op  transgender females sexually attractive based on numerous factors which I won't elaborate on. Yet I am a gun nut, and lean hard right on a lot of issues. I don't think of myself as ""gay"" as I do not find myself sexually attracted to the male form at all. However I am very titillated by transgender porn stars and its pretty much all I watch nowadays if I am feeling in the mood. Is this strange? Yet I feel I am  not understanding transgenders dilemma.. as I have heard they do porn to  pay for future sex transition surgery and really are ""unhappy"" doing porn... and do not like the attention from men who like them because of their porn personality. So I don't want to be exploitative.. but I do really appreciate them!

I don't like how transgenders are portrayed as sexual deviants, mentally ill, or grotesque monsters looking to prey on young daughters in bathrooms. Anyways just thought I'd vent... we're out there.. we live in secrecy.. the stigma of revealing this about myself is to much to bear! So I admire the bravery to ""show your true self""... so you think of yourself as a heterosexual female after transitioning or does the shadow of ""maleness"" hang over you?

I saw a video that said a man could never really transition fully into a woman, but they could only do so on a cosmetic level. 

Well what the fuck does that mean? It's not like the doctor takes DNA samples of newborns to determine someone's birth sex.  Bottom line is, if your body looks and functions a certain way, then it is that way. Chromosomes don't make you. You, make you. Anyone who disagrees with that can fuck off. "

That's not the way to live. 

While transitioning, we can't just slide through life while we wait for changes to occur. This is an exciting time, and with each passing day I am happier than I have ever been before.

So, stop and smell the roses. Live a little. This is the time where you are finally becoming who you have secretly been all along and who you will be for the rest of your life.  Don't sit and wait for some future time... just enjoy every minute of its passing.

Enjoy your transition. Have fun with it. Tomorrow will always be a better day, but don't just sit and wait for that day to come.

I'll spend so much time pondering the consequences of this and trying to gauge my own emotions about the whole situation that I forget to consider what I actually feel about being transgender and the idea of transition. When I really think about it, I'm pretty certain, but I still find the most ridiculous excuses and there's always a lot of doubt with...no real basis, as far as I can tell.

This doubt is horrible, and the apparent lack of dysphoria is just as bad - I keep wishing for more pain and discomfort, which is kind of funny to me.

I guess that's a sort of meta-dysphoria or something like that.

From what I can tell, I'm afraid of not being transgender for some unknown reason...

Texas-Kangaroo-Rat,asktransgender,I don't know how to life [Ramble bamble],"I moved in with mom because nana has this tendency to randomly blame me for everything, get upset when I buy food, and gets really pissed when I'm depressed, especially if she needs something.

After a few weeks of mom making fun of and generally putting me down for being a girl and having anxiety problems I came back.

I was really hoping maybe I could get a job and get my own place, but doing the math you either need two or more jobs or a job at around 13$ an hour to scrape by.

At the same time I realized that no matter how much effort or how good my art is, I'll never get comments because people just don't comment as much anymore.

So I've just been lying in bed indulging in my self-defeat. I need to go back to mom's to get more clothes, my grooming shit, and probably my desktop since my laptop's hard drive is melting. Though the hairier I'm getting the more I just wanna lie down and die.

Food isn't worth it.

Even though I've gone through a lot of changes for two months of HRT (At least I'm assuming butt inflation and constantly accidentally swatting your tits doing everyday things and wanting to suplex an elephant in rage afterwards isn't common) it still feels hopeless like I'll just be Mr. Wookie and no one will like me ever forever.

Also if I did get a job, I'd lose the insurance and if it's part time like pizza delivery, the easiest job to get, then it'd all go into drugs and clinic.

Not to mention I ALWAYS have nervous breakdowns and quit if not just outright fired... or just have time cut to two hours a week.

I really hoped I could make money on comics, but holy shit I am just so horrible at it. I'll never be able to support myself.

Like either I can stay with a grandma that gets offended with depression or sleep problems and randomly explodes, but has internet, food, and is financially supporting my transition... or stay with mom that gets pissed off at anxiety, hates that I'm a girl, can't afford me, but I get along with fine otherwise.

I dunno, for the first time in years I don't want to kill myself, but it all just seems impossible. Like, I need a miracle."

I went on a subreddit not long ago, /r/unpopularopinions and a decent amount of the top posts of all time had to do with transgender issues. And it got me thinking on if this is the way I want to live my life. I understand the concept of being true to yourself and not letting other people have that much control over you, but that’s complete bullshit. There’s lots of things that are true about myself, and sometimes these ideals clash. Why is it more appropriate to live up to just one part of myself, potentially at the cost of other aspects of me? 

It’s all well and good to say I’m independent and I don’t care what people think of me, but I don’t think I really believe that. I’m not a fictional character who can thrive on conflict and overcoming insurmountable odds to triumph and be the best and win the title or what the fuck ever. I don’t want people to stare at me because I stand out and don’t belong. I want to blend in. I want to just feel comfortable.

Would I feel more comfortable if everything about my personality was the same but my gender was different? Without question. I’m beyond confident in that fact, but that’s not life. It wouldn’t be a simple thing. It would be a long, arduous process that would be incredibly taxing, both physically and mentally. As of now I don’t think I could really handle that, or at least want to attempt it. Hell, look at Kate von Roeder. I’m no where near well adjusted enough to handle that.

And I know lots of trans people don’t go through with a transition. And that’s great for them, but that’s not for me. I don’t want to make myself stand out and force people to think a way that is counter intuitive when nothing is actually going to change. Maybe that’d be better for the world to shape society or what the fuck ever but I can’t do that. Not to mention I used to vehemently despise my body and how I looked, so the idea of a great perhaps where that could change was enough to get me through some really bad days. Again I think I’d be happier with a different body, but could I survive getting there? Would I be happy with what happens after everything's said and done, and there’s no more fantasies left to hide behind?

And now I’m starting to get annoyed by the name Ally. I love it, I really do. And I love Allison, and I love how it used to be a more masculine name. I thought about legally changing my name to Allison with those justifications in mind, but I feel like I’d be forcing a backstory and prominent memories to something that would just satiate my own ego, and that feels weird and wrong."

My name is Veronica, I have just turned 18 this monday and i am a girl who happens to be trans. i transitioned at the age of 13 with full support of my family, although i'm very encouraged to keep this fact about me in secrecy, and honestly, this helps me with anxiety. i look alot like a cis-girl, not that that is a good thing, but it helps avoiding people asking dumb questions and invading your privacy, since there isn't anything indicating you're trans. although there are setbacks... i never know if i should tell i'm trans, if it's appropiate, if the reaction will be pleasent, if i will have to answer questions i don't like, if i will become an experience project, and the list goes on and on... so most of the time i just keep quiet about it and that's how i live. none of my friends from none of my social circles know about it and although i may consider opening up, i never do. and i think it's for the best.
I am approached by many men on a constant basis, whether at bars, hanging out, at parties, mall, you girls know the deal. sometimes i give into it and every so often it blossoms into something and i am left with this big pandora box. often i carry the romance on for as long as i can, many times even too long, even risking getting exposed if i accidently let a hand slip while making out (hard).
So i'm seeing this guy, and he is so, so sweet! he is like a prince charming and he is brightening my days so much! he makes me so happy and i know he is feeling the same way about me, but i feel so guilty because i know he might not feel the same after knowing this about me... but i just want to enjoy the most of it, you know...
my family and best friend tell me i should only tell him in some time, after he's fallen in love even more deeply with me... but i think that's wrong... tell me guys (and girls), what do you think?

Ever since I was really young (like 5 or 6), I've loved so much about females and I could never identify with the boys in our neighborhood. I preferred the company of the girls next door, and I loved to play Polly Pockets with them. My brother always wanted to play sports and get dirty and things, whereas I helped my mom plant things in our garden and stayed clean whenever possible. I was (and still am) fascinated by the idea of dressing as a woman. I loved the feeling I got when I had one of my mom's shirts or pairs of shoes on. In fact, I *apparently* went through a phase when I was young (as recent viewings of old home movies would suggest) during which I insisted on being called Louisa. (I couldn't have been more than 8.) My mom says tha was ""just a phase"" and that my cousin had the same one. Over the last few pubescently prosperous years, a certain sexual element has been introduced. I find the idea of first of all transforming into a female form attractive but then the thought of being one also enticing. It should be noted that I am not attracted to make genitalia in the slightest.

That aside, the idea of being female just sounds…pleasant, I guess. I love the way girls always seem to be there for each other. At my *SMALL* school, they always sit together at lunch and share personal conversations. My male companions find topics of video games, sports, and Star Wars MUCH more interesting. I want no part of them! People tell me I'm good at listening to and understanding feelings—this is a trait most guys I've seen don't seem to have, except perhaps gay men. But I'm not gay. What does that make me? I can't emotionally open up to guys like girls can with each other.

People have asked each other on the Internet, ""What would you do if you were a girl for a day?"" So many people answer, ""I'd masturbate, obviously."" I feel like my answer would be just be ""experience it"". I can't even explain why. I can remember, years ago, asking my mom and younger brother (who is much more ""masculine""), ""Haven't you ever thought about what it would be like to be the opposite sex?"" Neither of them had ever even thought it might be interesting. (My mom had the distinct privilege of telling me that I should like being a guy because she didn't think I'd make a good girl. Obviously. Tongue-in-cheek with a Catholic-principle-asserting time.) So I never brought it up again.

Whenever I play Minecraft on servers, I pretend to be female so I can just be like the female people, who are a) treated more kindly and b) much closer and more interesting people.

WHY CAN'T I BE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE WITHOUT HIDING BEHIND A GIRL SKIN? These people really like me as a girl. They appreciate me. I fit the bill perfectly for being one of these people and I can only wonder if it's because my mind is, in that sense, already wired for it? I don't want to look like I'm catfishing EVER because I'm not. Catfishing is to trick guys in to having relationships with you and other weird things. It's for ""nefarious"" purposes. I just like being happy. I'm currently, when no one's home or when I'm out walking, practicing a female voice so I can start interacting with these people on TeamSpeak and Skype, too. I've been able to convince people on BlahTherapy who will listen that I'm female just by their hearing my voice (which is very low in its natural state—I have to raise the pitch significantly).

I'll be at what I think is a really good college next year (9% regular decision acceptance rate, I'm told) and I'm worried about what it's going to be like these next few years because I've got this reputation now. I'm ____ ________, and I'm a guy. I just don't understand who I am well enough yet to make an informed judgment. I wish I liked shopping. Guys' clothing is so horrid and stupid. I feel like I'd love shopping for my own feminine clothing.

But I can't stop thinking: am I just doing this because I'm sexually attracted to the thought of crossdressing/being female? Like, I don't know if I actually wish I were female. I'm not sure if I feel female or anything. I just feel that maybe I have more tendencies than most people I've encountered. Or is it something I haven't come to understand yet? Hopefully you can shed some light on this. I'm just so confused. ""Transgender/transsexual""—buzzwords in society. I don't want to jump to conclusions either, you know?

Gender roles suck. I hate killing bugs.

Thanks for anyone who can help me sort this out."

HypotheticalConfuse,asktransgender,How do you find doctors you trust?,"So, I was watching an episode of Botched, and one of the storylines is about a girl looking for a correction of her breast augmentation. The plastic surgeon who performed the original procedure used implants *twice* *the* *size* of what was agreed upon, the end result of which was a symmastia (uniboob formed from disruption the attachments to the sternum).

I wish I could get the full episode if need be, but here's a [clip](http://youtu.be/RuXCYwO-ITY). (Warning: the clip was added to cite/add context, but if you don't need something that will increase doubts or anxiety, skip it.)

Watching that made me worried about two things. First, how do you find a plastic surgeon who won't be blatantly transphobic to the point of committing malpractice on your body? I was thinking about getting plastic surgery done down the road but that horror story has me so scared to trust some surgeon now.

And second, how do find a good plastic surgeon who gets it? Maybe I'm making too much a deal out of language, though when I saw I saw one of the surgeons who was doing the correction refer to her as male, it raised my hackles.

And more broadly, good people of this sub, how have you found doctors (primary care, endo, any other specialties) who you can work with?"
maybe_trans_I_guess,asktransgender,"What are your experiences with the ""mental effects"" of HRT?","I think that the main reason I wanted to get on estrogen was not for the physical effects, but because so many people have described it as having hugely positive effects on their mental health- such as [Zinnia Jones describing how it cleared up her depression/gender dysphoria](http://freethoughtblogs.com/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/) (albeit temporarily). I want to stop feeling so listless and low-energy, and even more than the physical effects I am hoping HRT will being me some degree of mental peace. 

   That being said, I was shocked when I read the informational packet I was given on HRT and it listed depression as one possible side effect! I am basically already depressed, I seriously don't want to make it any worse. I know that they could just be sticking things on there to try and curb potential lawsuits, but as far as I know depression could very well result from HRT semi-rarely.

I know that ultimately, YMMV and the effects will differ for different people. However, I am worried that I could be hyping it up to be something it is not in my head. What are your experiences with HRT- did it feel positive or negative or no change, and how did your mental health change pre- and post-HRT? What should I expect it to do?"

[deleted],asktransgender,"questioning, and the more i learn the less i know.","so im amab, and the closest i can get to something that feels right is non-binary, but i just dont know.

basically i have been questioning my whole identity, recently some things have happened which have made me open up to the idea that maybe i am actually a woman, and this is the reason i have been depressed, shy, introverted. masculine stuff has never really felt comfortable, even throwaway comments about manliness etc, throw me off to the point i have to take a few seconds to get myself together again. i cant remember when i didnt get warm and fuzzys when thinking of myself feminine or neutral.  and crossdressing, well i've always hated that word. recently too playing around with expression, clothes are clothes, and certain ones (skirts) make me feel good...confident...in a way male fashion just dosent. if only my body shape was right to fit some of the tops...little things always throw me off. like being topless, body shape is a world of confusion, i cant tell if i am uncomfortable because my body is too manly, or weather its social discomfort for having a naturally androgynous body for someone amab. alot of the time i think its both.

i've started reading some experiences some transwomen have put out online and while i relate alot i have this nagging feeling that maybe im misinterpreting things, trying to relate when theres no relation to be had.

i have considered seeing a psych or soemthing to work this out, but not only do i have a shaky history with docs and psychs, i am also afraid that i would know more about trans issues then they will. i have a history of depression which has never really been dealt with, only had medication thrown at it which has either caused other issues, or completely failed to solve what i was meant to. 

im sorry for the bit of a ranty post...i appreciate any responses but dont really have any expectations. i guess im asking for resources? how do people navigate this? how do i get to the point where i am ok with my identity, whatever that happens to be, cause i have NFI right now."
tempacc422,asktransgender,I'm out.. But unsure how to progress.,"Hi there!
The backstory:
So, I'm MTF &amp; 14. I came out in October 2015 to my mother. However, the issue is I've only really given her the general idea of ""wanting to be a girl.""  I have anxiety, and am on medication, but that still makes me feel extremely scared to come out fully. For no real reason I feel worried to talk to her about letting me dress like a girl, and present myself as one. (And I know my mother would be supportive towards me.)

That's why I'm here, asking ways to come out that may at least slightly lessen my anxiety towards coming out.

Thanks!"
skuitarist,asktransgender,A humble question about traditional gender roles and being transgender,"Before I ask, I'll first say I'm not transgender myself. This was just something I'd been thinking about recently, and I wanted to ask actual transgender people to hear what they think.  
  
I ask this question because, as a male who a lot of people consider ""feminine"" and have been criticized for such, I've always been bothered by that sentiment. I don't conform to traditional gender roles, and I encourage others not to as well. Whether I want to wear a dress, put bobby-pins in my hair to keep it out of my face, or be the stay-at-home partner while my SO is the breadwinner, shouldn't I still be able to do all of that as a physical male? If we aren't going to allow our genders define our roles and personalities, shouldn't we be able to be however we please regardless of whether we're anatomically male, female, or both? And if we should be able to, shouldn't then our gender only be used to describe our physical bits, and not our personalities or how we express ourselves?  
  
And if this is the case, doesn't that eliminate the need to ""identify"" as one gender or another? Seeing as how each gender **should** be able to do anything the other gender can, shouldn't gender just not come into our identity at all? Allowing us to be boys who are what our society considers ""feminine"", and allowing us to be girls who are what our society considers ""masculine""..  
  
Bringing me to my last question. Is the need to identify as a gender (and change physical gender to match) part of the need to blend into our society? Obviously most places aren't going to consider hiring you if you're a male who shows up in women's clothing or express yourself as a ""woman"" would. So is that what this boils down to? Being able to thrive in a society that still has these gender roles and standards?  
  
I hope I'm making sense in my wording of all of this. Again, I only ask because I as a male feel like I've been criticized for being too ""feminine"" while being perfectly comfortable and secure with myself. I personally don't feel like I need to change my bits to feel more like myself.  
  
Or maybe there's an entirely different angle about this issue that I'm not thinking about, or am simply ignorant. If that's the case, I'm more than open to hearing anyone else's thoughts. I just wanted to hear if anyone else had thought something similar to what I just tried to word out above. Thank you!  
  
**Edit:** Thank you to everyone for helping me understand. I had a feeling there was just something I was missing. I hadn't previously considered the separation between gender roles and gender identity, and I also hadn't considered that people simply would rather have the other sex's genitals. It's a bit embarrassing to admit, but that was a foreign concept to me. I know others' ignorance can be trying sometimes, even when they don't come from a place of maliciousness or trying to devalue others for being different, but it really means a lot from a human perspective to be educated without being attacked for simply being ignorant. Thank you."
mylifetrans,asktransgender,Can you guys look over my coming out announcement post?,"I plan on coming out tomorrow on facebook, and this is what I have written up, and I was hoping I could get some feedback on it first, thanks! 

&gt; Hey everyone,
For most of my life, I felt like I never really fit in. I always felt different, like I wasn’t myself, and for the longest time I never knew why. This led to depression and anxiety for me, which I’ve been dealing with for years now. Over the past several years, I started to get a sense of what was causing me to be unhappy with myself, and started working to making myself happy. With the help of some amazing friends and counselors, I found who I am. I am transgender. Basically, for those of you who do not know, that means I never felt like a “guy”. I woke up each morning, and looked at myself in the mirror, and hated what I saw. I’m a girl, and always have felt like one. Now, it’s time I did something about it and start to love myself, and be who I really am.

&gt; So what does this mean for you? Nothing really. I know I’ll get a variety of reactions to this, and I am prepared for it. I will still be me. The person you’ve known for as long as you’ve known me will still be here. I hope that I am able still be close friends with all of you, and that I can still be a part of your life, as much as I want you to be a part of mine. 

&gt; This will not be an overnight change though. This is something that I plan to do and achieve over a few months. I’ve started hormone replacement therapy, one of the first and major steps on my journey, and I couldn’t be happier. This journey won’t be an easy one. I’ll lose friends, get judged, ridiculed, hate, and more, but being able to be happy at who I am and being able to love and appreciate myself is worth it. I hope that I have your support as I start my journey.

3ncrypted,asktransgender,How do I get started?,"Hey all. Found this subreddit a few days ago, and I've been lurking and reading posts here lately trying to work up the courage to post something myself. Long story short, I've been struggling with gender dysphoria for about four years now, but recently I've come to the conclusion that I need to take action. I've been wanting to find help, a psychiatrist or someone who can help me get on HRT, for around a year or so, but I just don't know where to start. Even thinking about talking to my doctor is really gut wrenching and fills me with anxiety, not only because I'm not entirely comfortable discussing this matter out loud with my hopeless manly voice, but also because it's a hospital on a military base, and I fear some of their views may be biased (which may be an unwarranted fear, but I don't really have enough experience with the matter to know). On top of that I'm 19 and still living with my parents (who don't know), and I've been unemployed for a while because the idea of going to work while dealing with this scenario at the same time is absolutely terrifying. I don't know what to do about insurance, if I getting mental help or HRT will out me when I try and provide the insurance I have with my parents, or what's going to happen. I really don't want them to find out since they're extreme bible thumpers that are almost guaranteed to try ""praying the gay away."" I live in Alaska and I tried looking up some resources like nearby Informed Consent Clinics but nothing popped up. I think it'd be best if I get out of here and move to Vancouver at my earliest convenience since I have a number of supportive friends there in addition to wanting to start fresh in a new city with a school that seems to be what I'm looking for. As things stand now I only have one friend in this state that's aware of my situation, and as thankful as I am for her support (honestly she means the world to me and is probably one of my most invaluable friends), I feel it would be smarter for me to leave. But it's really hard to move to another country, let alone without worrying about setting up new prescriptions and everything, so I just don't know what to do. I'd definitely want to get started and established with HRT before I did anything drastic like moving thought. It's really frustrating because I want to transition so badly but I just don't know what to do.
Help. Please."
JaneTheTran,asktransgender,How much will my life be ruined actually?,"So, context...

I recently told my mother and father that I had been having feelings gender questioning for a long time. My mother was not really that excited to hear me say that. My father was a little more curious, asking questions about my sexuality, and other things that made it obvious he wasn't clear on the subject. They are both kinda not sure if I'm actually trans, but they both have agreed to send me to a therapist, because they want me to be happy.

My father had another talk with me however, and he is really concerned for my well being. He said that if I wanted to be a ""public crossdresser"" (he doesn't know any better) then my life would be ruined. Hormone therapy is too expensive, I would be ridiculed, and be miserable. I also, in the future would like to get a job in the sciences, specifically chem. But my father said that being trans may not make me very marketable. He said that maybe I might just have to keep this private forever,  because life sucks, and everyone has problems.

So am I fucked? I'm not the kinda person to really take peoples insults or malicious comments seriously but he insists that i will in the future. Will this ruin my chances of getting a job? Will I really be hated by so many people? Is it just downhill from here? Will I not be able to afford transition after college?

Also, as a side question, how connected are sexuality and gender? My dad was asking some semi intrusive questions about my sexuality, and he said that he was using it as an identifier. I tried explaining that gender and  sexuality are different, be he insisted that they are somehow connected. He said that if i wanted to have sex with a man, then I might be trans, but if I wanted to have sex with a woman, then he might think other wise. So how connected are the two?"

My gut says medicine, because that's where I'd say I personally find the most severe discrimination against myself.  With a medical degree and a Master's or PhD, there is a possibility to do research as well.  And I think we already have a good number of trans lawyers and legal organizations.  (There is actually an oversupply of lawyers in general).  I am not sure if doing research in psychology would have the impact I would hope for, as so much of the science gets ignored.  I am not interested in providing therapy either, so pursuing a career in some kind of psychological research would be rather limiting for me personally.  (Not to mention it is hard making a career in academia).  Nonetheless, these are the three things I lean toward.

What does everyone here think?  **Where would having more trans people make the most difference?**  And if you have any suggestions I haven't thought of, please feel free to chime in.

So I just hooked up with this guy from tinder. He was really sweet and really good in bed - he spent a lot of time on me, if you know what I mean. After, as he was getting dressed, as he mentioned that he sometimes wears girls clothes and that he's trans, but ""not planning on doing anything about it any time soon."" I asked about pronouns, and he said that he/him was fine (so I'm going to keep using them for this post), and that he doesn't want to ""bother anyone with that shit.""

I'm interested in seeing him again, for the sex but also because he's nice and interesting and we run in similar circles. I also want to respect him and honor him the best I can, even if he's not outwardly transitioning yet. This is where I could use some help.

Sexually it's a little strange for me - I really like dicks and dudes in general. I've always ID'd as mostly straight, though recently have been warming to the idea of a relationship with a girl. I'm not against the idea of being with a trans person, I just don't want to make him uncomfortable. He's self conscious about his body, which I understand now. Should I tell him that I think he's attractive right now?  Should I pay less attention to his dick, more to the rest of his body? 

And socially... Idk it feels weird to know his true gender but intentionally use the wrong pronouns. I want to respect his wishes, but should I make it more clear that using feminine pronouns isn't a bother to me? I have no idea how out he is, that might be part of it. 

I'm not really sure what I'm getting at here, I'd just like advice. What would you like someone to do/have done in my situation? "

It may be my own anxiety speaking, so it may not be as wide of an issue as I'd have thought, but in my experience I find that I'm constantly in a state of ""Oh gosh, are they going to find out?"" and ""They referred to me as my preferred gender? Oh, hah, right, we're doing that now, we kind of dedicated to that"" or ""You used a [relevant pronoun]! Hah! I'm in! Take that, nonbelievers"". And while yeah, it is super nice to not have had taken any hormones but still be in a state where I pass 95% of the time, but the feeling of it still not being quite. . .right, is a thing for me.

So, the thing is: I'm going to start a new school in September (for Baccalaureate, Spanish version of 11th and 12th American grades according to Wikipedia). But I'm only going to have 2 or so months of HRT until then. When I started the process, I hoped I would have enough time to go stealth, but now that seems impossible (again, shit).

So, my question is:
Should I go girlmode (feeling well and being myself, but probably being teased and with anyone wanting to be with me) or should I go boymode (feeling like shit everyday, but being better socially).

I'm curious what the community's perspective on the topic is, as in some ways it seems like two sides of the same coin but then there's a vibe of ""your doing it for fun might detract from the legitimacy of why we transition"" (Having personally gotten the 'why do you have to transition permanently, why can't you just crossdress sometimes or something' argument before I kinda understand that vibe)"

samuelmouse,asktransgender,New York/NJ/PA Health Insurance experience,"Hello everyone! 

Does anyone have experience with insurance plans in NY, NJ, or PA that cover transition? I'm specifically looking at ftm bottom surgery. I would consider purchasing an individual plan in NJ if I knew of one that covered this. 

NY seems to be the only state around here where it's illegal to deny insurance coverage, is that right? Even if NY insurances need to cover transition, do they always do it, or is it still a battle with the company to make it happen? 

I'm looking at potentially going back to school (for illustration? Maybe FIT?). The schools I'm seeing that [offer trans coverage](https://www.campuspride.org/tpc/student-health-insurance/) in the area generally have United Healthcare. 

Is it safe to assume that any school that offers UHC in NY will have a plan that covers surgery, because of the NY insurance law? Or is any insurance company in a state that has one of those laws going to cover it? 

Also, does anyone know of any local resources for people trying to work out all this insurance bullshit? Lawyers or advisors of some kind who work with the trans community? Would the Mazzoni center or Callen lorde possibly be able to direct me to resources? 

I currently have a commercial Aetna plan in NJ from my employer but they don't cover transition in their commercial plans in this state. Only federal plans, I believe. So it's looking like moving states may be the best option for me to get insurance coverage. 

IDK, it's all very up in the air right now, so any and all experience you have in these states or insurance companies, or college health plans would be much appreciated!"
transthrowaway22089,asktransgender,[TW] my gf has expressed suicidal thoughts before because she is not cis,"I am in a LDR relationship with her so I cannot be there physically with her all too often for the foreseeable future.

She's had SRS over a year ago and had great results, no complications, but it did not get rid of her gender dysphoria as she hoped it would.

Simply put, she cannot accept not being cis. She hates being trans, she cannot see herself as a woman no matter what I tell her (she passes flawlessly), she thinks she is 'fake' and will never/can never be a 'real' woman because she was not born cis (she ignores all counterarguments), and she cannot get over her reproductive dysphoria.

No matter how much I tell her how beautiful she is, she won't listen. 

She sees herself completely differently and obsesses over these thoughts all day long every day.

She's been refusing to get on antidepressants (which I think would also help with the obsessive thoughts) because she fears those could give her the energy to actually end her life. But lately she could not promise me anymore that she won't end her life.

I really fear for her. I really wish I could permanently move in with her sooner or at least to be able to visit her much more often (although I don't know how much the latter would help compared to permanently moving in), but it is just not feasible just quite yet due to the financial and work situation.

Do you know anything else other than antidepressants that could help? And could antidepressants theoretically actually solve this situation, more or less, assuming she had luck with finding one that actually works for her?"
Ijustdontknow93,asktransgender,Update to last post.,"Last post I basically said, in a very ramblely manner, how distrot I was because I was not sure I could continue because of my family.

Well I think there may be some hope! My sister, who knows, told me this. Apparently they, they being my father, were watching TV together. I'm not sure on the show but, there was a little girl on said show. This little girl played football with the boys and sometimes identified as a boy. My father in the beginning stated how strange that was. My sister must of felt like she had to defend me because she piped in. 

""What if I wanted to be a boy, how would you feel about that"" she retorted.

He responded by saying ""it would be different, but I would love you no matter what even if you were my daughter or my son.""

That makes me feel much better. Honestly this isn't completety indicative that things will go completely smooth. But it's encouraging! Thanks for he support, especially in my last post. A lot of you really helped in which was probably my darkest time. &lt;3"

Zireae1,asktransgender,I dont know who I am anymore,"Hello, I am 24/25yo male. I am writing here in hopes that I can figure some stuff about who I am. I am so confused right now and dont really know what to do, people here seem so nice and it may help to put my thoughts into written words.

Last few months I have been questioning myself, but did not really talked to anyone about it, I have been so afraid of reactions. I have never been very manly. My mum and dad got divorced when I was like 9 and I lived with mum from that point on. Never really had male example, only the opposite of example. Until divorce dad beat me a lot, to assure I was manly enough, I dont have much memories from that time, I am not really sure if I did some ""unmanly"" stuff back than... When growing up I preferred company of my female friends, but you know I was not really part of them (when girls only stuff happened) and that often made me sad, like cry in the corner sad (i felt like i was not welcome and did not understand why at the time). I did not like stuff I was supposed to like - soccer, cars and so on. But it never really occurred to me why until I started questioning myself recently. I did not grow tall - 1m71cm which is i believe about 5'8''? and at 24 am still not very hairy which is fortunate because I hate how hairy I am now even though it is very very little compared to friends around my age(i suspect I have lower than normal level of testosterone but i am not sure, never got tested for that, and when I had my blood tested they either did not test for that or I am wrong with my hunch).

Thing is I am spectaculary bad at being male (at least i think so). When somebody offends girls (like sexist remarks) I legit feel offended myself which is weird but i cant help it. I cry at sad stuff - movies, series, games (if you played life is strange - i had to be alone to play that game xD). Last few years I have been very unhappy and mby depressed even(never went to therapy and ppl around me kinda did not care enough/I was able to fake a lot) and I have problem concentrating on tasks which caused me some problems at university. I battled with self-hatred and never really took good care of myself. I started taking care of my body. I lost a lots of weight, started growing my hair,  taking care of my skin,nails and stuff like that and I felt a bit better for the time being. But still when I look in mirror I would like to break it. 4 weeks ago I had my darkest moment in my life. I attempted stupid stupid thing, but did not went through with that in the end and ended up crying for 2 days. I am glad now that i came to my senses literally last seconds before too late... But I still feel like I belong nowhere - like I am nothing. I just cant pretend anymore its so tiring and probably I am getting really terrible at pretending - 3 days ago mum said she would me okay if I was gay after we had few beers (at least that is what i think, i got kinda caught trying some hairstyles on myself and came up with only terrible excuse xD)...but I dont know what she would said to me if I unload my emotional crap on her. 

When I read lines I wrote it seems kinda unreal to me to be honest. Like it is not even about me. Like I have been blind up to this point and have been lying to myself all this time... But still I am not sure about anything, who or what I am. My main motivation for just keep ignoring my unhappiness and feelings is that I dont want to be called freak, dont want people pointing fingers on me, I dont want people I care about think less of me, so I feel kinda trapped. And even if i wanted to act on it, I really have no idea what to do...and if it is not too late for me...so yay me...but on the other hand I am afraid I might get stupid again which I dont want to, at least not really...

Anyway, thanks anybody who could bare with me and took they time to read this and I do apologize for some randomness of thoughts and my English as it is not my native language."
Reicxel,asktransgender,Do you think hip pads seem crossdresser-like?,"A lot of the marketing out there for hip pads tends to be geared more toward the crossdressing community than the transgender community. Obviously that doesn't mean trans women don't wear them though.

And girls neg me, too. Every time I let go and try to just feel good, I feel like some girl is snarling at me (cis or trans) and idk if this is a ""you're too ugly to be feeling that good"" kind of thing or a ""youre actually cute in a trans way which threatens all of us"" kind of thing. It's overwhelming, though. 

aside from other people's bullshit, HRT after puberty and these shotty surgeries really aren't adequate. I'm in no way saying that detransition works or that trans people aren't real or that I'm not a woman.. I'm just disappointed with the current methods after surgery. Like, it sucks bad enough that I can't get pregnant but then to not even really be able to enjoy the other things in life like relationships and clothing and dancing at the club and pretty much anything bc my dysphoria sucks so bad just puts me over the top.

I think I'm going to kill myself. Like, for real. When I started transition I said that I was going to do it if I didn't feel better in two years.
Welp, here I am and it still sucks.

Hi_im_Lexi,asktransgender,The Birth of Lexi: A Bedtime Story,"Hi everyone!

I know that from time to time, there can be a lot of very early-transition people who come to this subreddit, looking for help, advice, or for confirmation of themselves. 

I'm not sure what use anyone will find of this, but if it gives confidence to one single person, then I'll be happy. 

So here it is, the story of how I found myself. Enjoy :D

My parents were conservative. Mostly my dad's doing, really. He didn't want me to grow up to be a ""fag"", and so I could never wear pink. I could never come within a mile of a dress. I was taught to only like ""guy"" things.

I cooperated rather well, at first. I started having naturally feminine mannerisms at about age 7, which I was quickly feared out of doing. The fear of not being normal (my parents' greatest fear, I swear) caused me to stop placing my hands on my hips, etc.

This was fine. Whatever. It didn't really catch up with me until the age of 9. During a summer's night, I realized that I WOULD NEVER BE A GIRL. EVER. 

I cried. I cried so much. But I never told anyone about it.

Years pass until I'm 13. I still hadn't discovered that transgender people even existed. That all changed when I was skimming through the Guinness book of world records   and saw the record for the most ""sex change surgeries performed"". Curious, I google such a term, and was quickly horrified by the results of the search, as many were either very transphobic, degrading, or simply not of true transgender people.

A few years pass, and a crossdressing habit develops. Whenever my family would leave home, I would rush over to my sister's room and try on he clothes. I never tried on makeup, but I would become aroused while crossdressing. That wasn't necessarily my purpose for crossdressing, I just liked how I felt.

I never decided to transition though, as puberty had already taken a role on my body, and my XY chromosome would never let me be an actual girl. I was afraid that I would never truly be accepted as a woman or happy with my own body. So I trudged on.

Some more time passes and I was 17. I got a job in retail (specifically Hollister), and I would find myself really liking some of the clothes, particularly the girl's clothes. Occasionally I would try on girl's clothes on my break, a secret that is only now being told for the first time. I never did anything in the clothes, but it was nice to try on different styles of clothes without being judged. 

At this point I was convinced that I had a fetish, and that I was not actually a transsexual. There was no way!

A few more years go by, and I realize that relationships just don't seem to work out for me. All of my friends would just tell me ""Just be yourself!"" It just never worked out. I felt that I had to be somebody that I'm not to make them happy. 

So by this point I was 20. A virgin. I joined a fraternity upon coming to college, as an attempt at just being a normal guy. I was depressed but oddly there didn't seem to be a cause. I had great grades in school, I had a lot of friends, and money was okay. WHY WAS I DEPRESSED?

But one day, it happened. I lost my virginity. 

It felt okay, but something just wan't right.

In the weeks that followed, my depression got the worst it has ever been in my entire life. There was no purpose to my life. I wasn't living for anything. I wasn't happy. I wanted to just die.

During my depression, these thoughts of me wanting to be a woman became stronger than ever before. BUT IT WAS A FETISH THOUGH, RIGHT? This is what I told myself.

I told myself that I had to end it. I had to end these thoughts. So from then on, I tried to actively suppress those thoughts and feelings. 

I couldn't.

They came back.

Again.

And Again.

I knew I had to do something.

I knew that these feelings would never go away.

I knew I had to actively change my life in order to finally be happy with my life. I was suffering from severe depression and I felt like I had no reason to live.

And so I did it.

I admitted to myself that I AM a woman.

I told myself that every day, and I knew it true to my heart. I just had to accept it.

After countless days of searching the internet for ""Am I transgender"" or ""How to tell if you're transgender"" and the like, I finally ordered clothes online from American Eagle. 

One night, soon after, I texted my ""big"" (fraternity big brother - I should mention that I was long inactive by this point). I told him that I had to tell him something. After a few minutes of begging me to tell him, I did it.

I came out.

It was the scariest and most difficult thing I've ever done in my life.

A few days later, I tell my ""twin"" (fraternity twin, that is - even though I had gone inactive, the three of us were still very close). 

They accepted me with open arms!

It was so difficult because coming out to them forced me to accept it for myself. 

BUT IT FELT SO RIGHT!

So from that point on, I came out to others, and it became easier and more natural each time. And that was the beginning of my transition!

That was December of 2015. I'm out to everyone, almost three months into hormones, and Saturday will be one month of being full time.

I don't have the perfect female body, but at least I'm happy in my own skin. I'm happy with who I am and who I'm going to be.

Transitioning won't fix all of your problems, but it may make you finally be happy with who you are and the skin that you're in. And really, that's all that matters.

I didn't transition for years because of my fear of not being a real girl or not having an XX genes. I didn't transition because I thought that it was a fetish. But all my fears were misguided. I'm happy as a girl and love who I am! My depression is gone and I can finally live my life!

If you ever have any of the feelings I had, please just search your heart and do what it tells you. 

I'm not here to convince you to transition. I just want everyone to be happy with who they are, guy or girl, cis or trans.

So please, just be yourself, and don't be afraid. I'll always be here for you&lt;3

Here's an updated picture of me from yesterday, for those of you who would like to put a face to the story:

http://imgur.com/VnKkJiF

I'm just so happy to be alive. 

I just hope you can be, too!

And if you ever need advice or have questions, I'm here for you&lt;3

anothertboy,asktransgender,Ashkenazi Hormone Question,"Hey Everyone, 

I'm ftm, four years on hormones, and (ethnically) an Ashkenazi jew. Ashkenazi are at a higher risk for genetic differences/disorders than the rest of the population and (apparently) one of those differences can be in the metabolism of alcohol and medications. 

I've always had an insanely high alcohol tolerance. When I still drank, before I transitioned, I weighed 120lbs and could easily drink my (alcohol-loving) 230lb friend under the table. I acclimate to medications (particularly antidepressants and painkillers) so quickly that they're not even worth using--and it seems that I'm starting to hyper-metabolize my T. The dose that used to work fine is now dropping off too quickly. 

Has anyone else had this issue? Are there other Ashkenzai here on hormones? Anyone else who hyper-metabolizes medication? How have you dealt with it? Do you know of a trans jewish community I could xpost this with?

Thank you!

P.S. 
Here's an abstract about the genetic aspect that my doctor sent: http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/abs/10.2217/14622416.8.7.721

JaclynShit,asktransgender,I just shaved!,"For the first time, I shaved my legs. I cut my foot, but other than that I'm feeling pretty rockin'. How are you guys today?"
transthrowaway1065,asktransgender,I've never talked to anyone about the way I feel before,"I grew up playing hockey for over a decade. I grew up playing, and still do play, guitar to this day (mostly progressive metal). I've been gigging with bands under the guise of being a stud for many years. I'm an engineer. I like lifting weights and video games. I'm currently 5' 9'' and 185 lbs of mostly 
muscle. Everything about me is so stereotypically male (not that women can't or shouldn't do these things), everyone in my life would be surprised to know I have doubts. If I were to transition, I don;t even know if I could pass. My biggest fear is that someone finds out my thoughts and secrets that I've had for a very long time, such as that I have hidden bottles of nail polish in the enclosure of my halfstack, with it's screwed in back keeping the secret safe. I've never talked to anyone about this, and that in itself is one of the biggest things stressing me out. I, like many trans people, battle serious depression (although I have had suicidal ideation in the past, I haven't been in that dark of state for years); however, I'm not sure that this is the main cause of it. Honestly, it probably is major a factor, however. A big fear of mine is that it plays a much bigger than I think it does, and that I am in just too much denial to realize it.

It's not that I hate being a dude; it's more as if the grass would appear to be greener on the other side. I've had a ton of fun in the past, and a lot of great memories and relationships that most likely materialized due my gender and many of the opportunities associtated with it. I don't look upon my past in revulsion, feeling as though I have been dealt some major injustice. I'm not completely broken in my current gender. I do feel like, though, that I would have been much more happier had I been born a female. Then again, I have no clue what it is like to be female. Whatever my mind's representation of what living as a girl would be like is probably wrong. Not by lack of empathy, or research. Rather it is a lack of experience. How would it even be possible to cross such a threshold when you aren't even sure what is on the other side?

I also worry about the strains that would be put on current relationships. People I care about have not been as accepting of trans issues that I hear in the news as I would like. As much as it sucks, everyone has their faults. Furthermore, one of my largest problems as it relates to my depression is that I have little to know confidence when it comes to dating and approaching women romantically. If I ever were to transition, how would this aspect of my life be affected? I already ride the struggle bus extremely hard. Factor in that trans people face so much discrimination, how can I even make a clear decision on what would be the best for me, when there are so many negative environmental aspects that might taint my thought process? I know one should do what makes them happy, and to not care what people think. But how can I not, given that people are what make me happy?I don't know. I guess this part might be a tldr. I'm stressed, feeling as though I have no one to talk to about this. I can't help but feel that breaking down and requiring help is a sign of weakness. My logic knows it isn't, but the mere fact of talking to someone about this in real life makes me race and feel light headed. My emotional side does nothing but tell me I'm pathetic. Hell, I don't think anyone I know even knows my reddit account, yet I'm compelled to make a throwaway. I once made an alternate email address to try to get in touch with a college counselor last year, but I was too soft to hit send, and ended up deleting the draft and the account the day after. And I know I have people in my life that would be very accepting about. One of my best friends just had a highschool friend come out as trans, and she has been nothing but supportive. I would never be able to talk about it though due to my fear and paranoia, and my unwavering obsession of trying to keep a masculine appearance. This obsession of keeping it hidden. The mere thought of changing an image as large as this is so intimidating. Talking to no one about, even though it aint anyones fault but my own, makes it down right downright terrifying.

I don't really know why I'm writing this. I don't know if I'm looking for advice, or if I just need to vent. If anyone takes the time to read this, thank you so much. It honestly makes me feel better even if random people on the internet can lend an ear."
cheerbear02,asktransgender,Odd fascination with the mirror question,"I've read a lot of trans narratives regarding dysphoria related to the reflection in the mirror.  For myself, I often find photos of myself jarring or awkward, but i've accepted the mirror reflection at face value of being me.  However, since coming to terms with being transgender, occasionally I catch glimpses of girl me looking back at me.  I've had a couple of euphoria moments with this (not with any major makeup or attempts to find myself or anything like that), just more catching myself at the right moment with the right lighting.
Since then, I mostly just find myself looking at myself in the mirror with an odd fascination thinking ""Where are you?"" or ""that beard shadow looks awkward"".  I also came across this blog post (http://www.amydentata.com/2012/03/06/the-difference-between-dysphoria-and-negative-body-image/) that I found very relevant.

that's a long rambling way to ask my question, but here it goes:  Does anyone else have this kind of experience?  Is it extremely distressing or do you find it more of a curiosity?  Do you find yourself compulsively trying to find yourself in the mirror?  Do you find yourself trying to avoid it?  What do you notice with this?"
requiem1994,asktransgender,waiting 3 months before making a decision,"My psychiatrist and LCSW want me to wait 3 months before making a decision. My LCSW, who I saw for the first time yesterday, told me that whenever a client of hers is facing a big decision, she asks them what they feel is an appropriate amount of time to wait. In my head I heard ""3 months"" and ""no way! I can't wait that long"". But I said 3 months, and she smiled. That was exactly what she was thinking. I only recently began discussing this with my psychiatrist, who also serves as a therapist (he's a rare breed). And his thoughts on 3 months was that it's too short, and that I should consider waiting 6 months or a year.

I feel so strongly at the moment that I am a woman. And when my nails are painted, and I picture myself with breasts and a vagina, and carrying a baby (I know this is a dream, at the moment, medical miracle pending), I feel happy. I tried on a dress for the first time today and loved what I saw. I was terrified as I was putting it on that I would find myself ugly. I've just never been comfortable with the label of being a ""gay man"", not because I felt there was something wrong with being gay. I just always loved straight men and saw myself dating them. My question is this...

Do people ever feel this strongly, only to find the desire/urgency goes away? I've looked for things in the past that I thought would fix me (i.e., a puppy, or getting muscles), but deep down I've always felt gross and disease with myself. I don't hate my body so much as just don't feel that it's me. Could this really just be a phase?

Opening myself up here. Looking forward to the feedback.

clovercoon,asktransgender,just came out,"I came out to my mom as transgender over the phone a few days ago. It wasn't planned--my sister had inadvertently outed me by telling my mom I was seeing a gender therapist and then my mom called to ask about it. 

""It's a therapist for transgender people. And I'm trans""

that was it. She reacted as expected--saying things like ""you're really a girl"", ""why can't you just be happy as you are"", etc. I'm not disappointed, I'm actually surprised she didn't react worse. 

But still, there's a part of me that longs for acceptance from my parents even though they've treated me like shit. I was emotionally and verbally abused and I wish I didn't care what they thought, but I'm still seeking their approval. has anyone else had a similar experience? how do you deal with your family not being understanding or accepting?"

I have no idea on their thoughts on transgender people, but I'm not expecting a strong negative reaction (a la evangelicals decrying you as evil) but I don't know how they'll react. Ignorance is the one thing I'd expect, and so I'll probably need to answer a fair few questions.

My main worry is broad strokes of how they'll react; supportive, not supportive or outright obstructive? I'm autistic so I'm concerned my parents, especially my mother, will come up with some flavour of ""you must be wrong"" or ""being trans is trendy right now, you must've latched onto that"" rather than accepting that I've thought about this and I'm sure as I can be. I've been fantasising about being a woman for six years (and it took me a long time to realise that that might mean I was trans) so I think I've got an answer for that. I'm probably being paranoid about that, I'm not a child and my parents generally trust me and my judgement.

Is there anything I should consider? Questions I should expect to field? This will definitely surprise my parents. Any fallout from this I might face?"
LoftySteve,asktransgender,What to do if you accidentally misgender someone?,"I had a FtM trans friend earlier this year, and he was super cool. We weren't super close but we were still friends. A few months ago I meant to call him ""mister bossy pants"" or something jokingly, but i said ""missy"" instead. He said ""you mean mister"" and i said ""Oh my God I'm so sorry!"" And he said it was okay and that he didn't really care. I figured everything was okay, but he pretty much stopped talking to me all together after that and I felt terrible. So I'm wondering what I should have done in that situation. If someone misgenders you, how should they react?"

I read from an old post that the post op vagina looks weord when the legs are far spread apart and now im a bit curious and worried about how and why and what it looks like im that scenario.  It got me thinking about activities like yoga, biking, running, and specifically stretching to the limit of what the human body can do. Will it be a problem?  Also, nsfw ahead, a question on the post arose abiut rough sex that wasnt adequately answered unfrounately. So thats another question of mine, is a post op vagina more fragile than the old genitals, and more fragile tyan a cis womans genetic one?

Supposedly the nose isnt more fragile after rhinoplasty so i hope this is similar.

LareaMartell,asktransgender,Questions about portraying a trans character in fiction.,"Hi everyone. I'm an aspiring writer writing fantasy novels. I'm gay myself and I find it really important to have broad representation in *any* genre of novels. 

So, my character is mtf transgender, and she's a magician. The thing is, there are six powers in my novel, and you can only have one (you're born with whatever power you have) and this particular character has the power to change her face (face only). 

These are my questions:

1. she obviously changes her face to be female, but does this feel like a cheat to you?

2. Since she can only change her face, would this pose problems with gender dysphoria? 

3. She's also a conman, and it would be very convenient for her to switch between a female and male face - is this offensive or would this pose other problems? 

thank you for reading and (if you're willing) answering :) "
InAYellowWood,asktransgender,Gender dysphoria or normal cisgender thoughts?,"I've recently come to question my own identity somewhat in a lot of ways, one of which has been wondering about gender dysphoria. I (a man) have always fantasized about being a woman- not constantly, just every now and then- but when I do there's usually a sexual element to it, so I just dismissed it as a fetish. Recently, though, I've begun to notice that some of the things I do or feel might have more behind them than I first thought:

- I feel more comfortable in the gender neutral bathrooms but don't truly know why.

- When my female friends talk about a girl's night out I feel upset that I'm excluded from it. When other people point out that I was excluded because I'm male my reaction tends to be either indignant and hurt (""So?!"") or resignation and depression (""Oh yeah...""). Either way I'm upset and tend to dwell on it.

- When my male friends talk about a guy's night out, though, I don't really care, and would actually feel awkward and out of place if I went.

- The aforementioned fantasies about being a woman and having sexual encounters with men and women alike.

- I know it's a silly one, but when I talk in forums, online games or instant messaging services with people I haven't met in real life, they often assume I'm a woman until they find out otherwise. Something about the way I speak, maybe? I don't know.

- In a recent conversation with my GF we were speculating on curiosity about being the opposite gender and she posed the question: ""If you were given a one-way magic wish to turn into a woman, would you do it?"" with my answer of ""Probably, yeah"", prompting a very surprised and concerned reaction from her.

I know all (or at least most) of these can be completely normal for cis people to experience, but I wanted to ask what other people's experiences of gender dysphoria were like and whether I should start to look deeper into my own gender identity.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for all the replies! Sorry I couldn't get back to some of you sooner, but this is a throwaway account and I lost private access to my computer for a while and didn't want to log-in elsewhere.

tom_boy_princess,asktransgender,I don't even know what to say...,"So I came out to my family last Friday, and posted the [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4f7lwb/ill_be_coming_out_to_my_parents_tonight_update/) a few days after where I mentioned that despite caution, my father seemed supportive.

Turns out, it's not the case. Yesterday, I was informed that my mom was told about me being transgender behind my back (she didn't read my letter, as mentioned in the linked post above, due to my dad not wanting her to know). My brother then informed me that my dad is getting more and more upset about the entire thing. 

My dad on Monday basically asked me to not transition. He asked me if I was going to get bottom surgery. I told him that I had not decided for sure (a white lie. I want it very much, but I didn't want to drop too much on him at once) but that I had studied it a bit. He proceeded to tell me that ""everyone who gets it regrets their decision later on” and that I'd be permanently maiming myself. He then said he firmly believes in ""playing the cards you were dealt"" and that I really shouldn't transition at all.

This evening, I came by to do my laundry. After I had started, my dad asked me to come upstairs for a minute. He had an article open on his computer for me to read, and asked me to please read it. 

http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2015/04/14905/

If you’re not in a great place mentally/emotionally, I don’t recommend reading the article. It seems to be poorly cited drivel, basically trying to scare off anyone from transitioning or pursuing surgery. I read the article, and simply went back to the laundry room where I stayed, hurt and offended, until my clothing was done. 

As I was leaving, my dad asked if I read it. I told him yes, but that I don’t care what the article said, becoming more feminine and taking hormones has made my life infinitely better, better in ways past therapy and anti-depressants couldn’t even compare to. He said he doesn’t know much about hormones, but that it was fine, but that I shouldn’t go past hormones in any way. It then took a nasty turn for the worst.

He proceeded to tell me that my family’s love for me is unconditional, and that will never change, but… If I got bottom surgery, it would be an insult to my family. That it would be against god. Against nature. Against all that’s “good” in this world. That it’s something they can’t support, and that I wouldn’t be welcome in their home anymore.

He then tried to say that he’ll help me find a therapist and get me “help” that I need.

I was floored. It felt like a fucking slap to the face.

I told him I don’t need his help and that I already have a therapist. I reiterated that once more as he walked me out to my car. 

I drove home crying and disgusted, and now I’m lying in my bed feeling sick to my stomach. I will not be going home to my parent’s house again, unless they can abandon such blind fucking ignorance and hatred. I tried my best to be open and honest with them, taking a chance by telling them this.

I feel crushed. "
abhpro,asktransgender,Does this mean my insurance might cover FFS?,"In my health insurance policy, it says this is covered:

""Gender Identity Disorder (GID) treatments, based on the standard of care issued by the World Professional Associates for Transgender Health (WPATH), except as described under “What’s Not Covered”""

And under ""What's Not Covered"" it says: 

""Any treatments or procedures that do not fall within the treatment protocols of the World Professional Associates for Transgender Health (WPATH) standards, except when the services are unrelated to gender-specific conditions, such as facial bone reconstruction.""

Is this saying that facial bone reconstruction specifically isn't covered? Because, under WPATH, FFS is deemed medically necessary in some cases: 

""Medically necessary sex reassignment procedures also include...certain facial plastic reconstruction as appropriate to the patient. Non-genital surgical procedures are routinely performed...facial feminization surgery, and/or breast augmentation in male-to-female transsexuals. These surgical interventions are often of greater practical significance in the patient's daily life than reconstruction of the genitals.""  

It seems like my insurance says it follows the WPATH guidelines, and FFS is included as being medically necessary in certain patients. I just can't tell if the ""unrelated to gender-specific conditions, such as facial bone reconstruction"" part under ""What's Not Covered""
is stating that FFS isn't covered.

kallmekat,asktransgender,Ordering online with a trans-phobic family,"Man, I guess posting here gas become an addiction, 3rd time this week :(

Anyways, so the worst dysphoria I have is about my chest, or lack there of, and wanted to order breastforms for when I'm presenting. Yeah, I gerryrigged some beads and Ziploc bags which haven't held up to well. Suggestions of rice worked, but were more of a mess when they broke. The issue is getting things past my extremely trans-phobic family. I ordered a pen, an actual pen, a few weeks back, and they had no issue as long as I told them what it was. I thought I could come up with something that isn't something they would want to see that would come in about a shoebox sized box, but I couldn't think of anything. I'd also have to come up with something for a smaller box (adhesive), but for that I could just say pen ink, it's about the same size. I've also attempted to get information on a mailbox from the UPS store near me, but I give up with them. Now I'm stuck with either dealing with their reaction when I order them, or suffering through and not ordering them. 

Yeah, what a dilemma, I know. I've run into issues with getting clothes out of the house before, but not recently. This wouldn't be hard to get out, but getting in is an issue. I may just face it with them, I have done so about some stuff before, but nothing related to gender identity which they would have a much worse reaction to. Anyone have similar stories of getting something for your journey and people in your life finding out, that is when you didn't want them to? I know it may be a somewhat common thing, but I'm trying to bring myself to actually do it and give them a metaphorical middle finger to the face."

__its_only_me__,asktransgender,I don't know what to do...,"Hi. I recently realized that I'm trans (mtf); now that I realized it, I see that I've felt this way my whole life--I've just never been able to describe my feelings before. At first I assumed it was just normal to feel like I felt. Then I thought maybe I was just wierd. And then I saw someone on another sub mention r/crossdreaming, and after some exploration I began to realize that I was trans.

 if I remember correctly, you can't even start hormones until 16(?).  Basically, as stated in the title, I don't know what to do. I haven't told anyone (except this sub, now). I'm not sure if I even have the courage to socially transition right now. It seems the most logistically reasonable to transition at 17 or 18--but I don't know if I really want to wait three years. That feels like an awful log time to spend the way I am now (both physically and mentally).

Most people in my life would be pretty accepting if I were to come out. I'm pretty certain my parents would be fine, as would the rest of my family. Most of my friends are very accepting, and I'm certain they would be fine with me transitioning. There are a few people who I know I would lose. A few friends I have known for a longer time are pretty transphobic. Especially disheartening is the fact that my long time best friend would probably stop associating with me at all. I brought up the subject of trans people casually, and it turns out he's extremely transphobic.

I suppose my biggest worry about waiting is that I could be screwing myself over. That's my main question--how many times will I be shooting myself in the foot of I wait to come out, and wait to make any move towards transitioning? Any advice or thoughts are greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance. Dang, it just feels good to type out my thoughts instead of bundling them up."

lisa_2pink,asktransgender,MTF misgendered/genderfluid in public?,"Hello I'm a male slim tall 6'1 who gets carded %80-90, I'm okay with that. In school/high school I would get picked on because of my voice, I didn't sound gay or weird. This one time a bully questions about my voice in weird way. That my voice sounded feminine to him, he was a trouble maker and a bully. I think I started to crossdress a little in high school years, but only in my home privately. No one knew I was a crossdresser or had feminine features. Sometimes I wished I was a girl instead of boy being picked on. I'm in late 20s I get carded easily at bars.

Nowadays when I go out I get misgendered publicly by accident mostly women. Sure women don't mean it on purpose. It becomes a big laugh/ice breaker towards my friends cause I was fully boymode.  I get that surprise look cause I was not expecting that to happen to me in my late 20's. I do have long hair up to my shoulders or neck. No one knows I'm a crossdresser at all or wear makeup in boymode. One weird thing is happening (no hormones or medicine) to me is that my breast look like female boobs well sort of. I guess I got Gynecomastia and I don't mind, eventhough I have little of belly fat/chest. No one questions about my chest/weight or has seen them publicly.

I have been wanting to crossdress all the way publicly, will do so for fun and cautiously in NY this year. I just need to do it the right way. But I don't know if my voice sounds feminine to me. 

Does this happens to anyone being misgendered as a girl in full boy? I just wanted to open up here in Reddit."
Silent_One42,asktransgender,"Brother-in-law (minor) may be trans, parents supportive but...","So, my future brother-in-law (who is in high school) may be trans. I had met him a few times before I came out, and last week we hung out for the first time after I've come out, and I was presenting female (for the second time in public, yay!). Anyway, when I told his parents I was trans, they were supportive and said that they think their daughter (at the time) might be too, that ""She's going through a trans thing"". They also never told him I was trans, so he found out that day. We went to the mall just him, me, and my fiance (his sister), and we noticed his hair was super, super short and boy like. When I told him I'm trans, he said he may be too, and we asked what pronouns he preferred. He asked to be called by masculine pronouns and what his preferred name was, and so we did for the rest of the day. After we dropped him back off at home, his mom called my fiance and said they haven't gotten him to see a therapist yet (it had been scheduled though) and it was highly inappropriate for us to ask what pronouns he liked before an expert diagnosed him.

It is important to note his parents are very open, accepting people. As soon as they knew they started using my correct name and pronouns and made me feel welcome in their home.

Now, I wasn't on the call so I didn't get to say anything, but I feel it's important for this process, whether he's trans or not, to get people using masculine pronouns if he's comfortable with it so he can explore what his gender identity might be (which is why I continue to do so). What do you guys/gals think? Was it inappropriate? He is fairly young, he's under 16, but even so, should I follow his wishes or his parents? "
Kittani77,asktransgender,Curious about the process in Colorado via Kaiser,"As far as getting the endocrinologist, surgeon, etc, etc.  Am I going to have to move to Arizona for surgery at some point or am I just not going to have that option available to me?  Anyone been through it all here?

So update.  My PCP is already on-board and Kaiser has teams that will assist getting the therapist stuff coordinated and the needed info collated.  Apparently she also has an Endo in house at that office who is also experienced with HRT and is more than happy to start treating me when the therapist gives the green light.  She even asked my female name and if I wanted her and the staff to start using proper pronouns, even though I haven't begun to socially transition at all yet.  She was also very engaging with my wife and was going to investigate if they could get my wife in on the sessions so she could get some support too, without me even mentioning it as something I wanted.  It was awesome and a very affirming experience.  I was giddy as a schoolgirl after leaving there and I still can't wipe the smile off my face.  :):)  Kaiser, you rock!"
StaccatoChess,asktransgender,"I wish I was born female, but I don't mind being a guy","So yeah, I wish I was born female, but I'm not sure I'd actually want to transition now as a guy because I don't mind being a guy. Sure, I know you'll say that just because I don't mind it doesn't mean I should have to stick with it, but the thing is I'm not so sure transitioning would help.   

See, I doubt I'd ever be able to feel completely comfortable with myself transitioning, and the thing is making my body more feminine only makes the dysphoria worse. Now that I have long hair and shave my body I just feel worse because I see that I can never have exactly what I truly want.  

So in that sense, my dyphoria is more relieved when I just embrace masculinity.  

Also, I think a lot of this stems from the fact that I was the only male in a family of mostly females growing up. I think I envied their lives a lot growing up, and wanted to be able to join in with the things they did. And to a certain extent I did, as a child I did ""girly"" things like dress up and paint my nails and whatnot. And as I grew older I hated the clothes I had to wear and the body I was becoming to have.  

So yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm transgender, that's not what this is really about, but I just think transitioning would make my dyphoria worse."

Tiffany97,asktransgender,"[serious mtf question] ""Just a fetish"" or a lifestyle?","Hey so I've had this question on my mind pretty much since the day I realized I am transgender.

Since I first started crossdressing, I'd always gotten extremely turned on by it more than anything and loved dressing up. I'd easily masturbate to it all the time, including transgender porn the more I learned about it in my younger teens.

Overtime however, I slowly realized that I wanted the body of a female so I can live like a woman forever, rather than just when I was horny. So sometimes I would force myself to stay dressed up after I jacked off just to live as a girl for a little longer without having a boner.

It worked, but the feeling you get after masturbating of guilt stayed. Sometimes when I walk around now was a man, with no one having any idea or guessing that I'm trans, I feel normal and without a care in the world. But come night time... I'm horny and wanna be a girl.

More and more throughout the day I slowly wish I was a girl and wonder what it would be like to be a girl without having a boner. It's just a simple desire that I don't need to masturbate about. 

I guess what I'm asking is if any of you mtf's had this same issue and if it started out just being a fetish then growing into something more.

Is it bad to be like this? Or is it being a fetish more than an actual priority an alarming factor that I should consider before taking HRT?

I bet you can start seing the problem. Thirteen year old me didn't know anything about gender, except boys have these parts, girls have those parts. Boy-Girl relations = Straight.

Bisexual wasn't the answer that fit either. I mean, I like women, but I also want to be a woman. I like some men, but I also want to be a man. I mean. A male body is so useful, strong, fast, and nobody cares about scars. 

But somedays it just feels so wrong, I want it to be a female body. But it feels wrong everyday too, like it's sombody elses body. Even when I feel more male like. 

So I have been feeling like this since I had the mental capacity to process these thoughts. Puberty was a catalyst, like blowing pure O2 onto a fire while pouring jet fuel and thermite out onto it.

Now, my problem is that I still can't identify what I am. Do you know how psychotherapy works ? See, your problem causes about 40% of your symptoms. The other 60% of the symptoms is you not knowing what is wrong with you. Being able to say: ""Yes I have depression. I know my depressive cycle, and eventually it will go away again."" It gives you comfort. It doesn't mean you'll never get depressed again, it just means you know what it is. 

I have always embraced my stereotypes. Been in a mental hospital ? Yup I am psycho. Hide your kids, grab your wife, better get out of sight. Work in IT ? Yup, am a virgin. You are attracted to women with mental health issues ? You bet I have mommy issues. You are the quiet, yet not shy type ? You better beleive I am dangeous. You like guns ? Yes, I do latch onto things that give me power over other people. 

But gender. The irony. I have walked through the hell of not being in control of my own thoughts. Waking up, wishing I died in my sleep. Going to bed, hoping I never wake up. The constant yearning to blow my brains out, just so I can stop thinking. That, lasted years.

Now I am stable, and during my last appointment with my therapist he suggested that I am ready for a relationship. ""You are well on your way to being a healthy nineteen year old."" He said to me, and right back down the rabbit hole I fell. Who do I date ? How do I explain what I am, when I don't know myself. When do I tell this to that person ? That last one haunts me. 

You can't drop a bomb like this on somebody on a first date. Yet, I can't keep it to myself too long either. I can't tell her after a month. She will feel betrayed, and rightfully so. I don't know. 

All I know is fighting brings me peace. Physical fighting. I practice Krav Maga. I train twice a week. Getting into a cage with five guys and just fighting 5-1, is the highlight of my week. It's not about winning or losing. It's because it's a seemingly impossible task. But I can do it, by constantly thinking about what I can change about myself, and how I fight.

But I can't change who I am. That is my problem with gender identity. I can't choose or change it.

animatroniczombie,asktransgender,Does anyone have any tips for me on how to gently correct coworkers who misgender me at work?,"So I start back at work on Monday, after being off for a month (came out when I went on medial leave, out socially for about a year and a half). I'm wondering what tips people have for gently correcting people who use my deadname or the wrong pronouns. I don't want to come off bitchy, but I want to make sure people know that its not cool and I really need for them to use the correct pronouns. My coworkers have been supportive online and I saw a few of them last week when I dropped off paperwork. They were all happy to see me and called me my correct name and all that, but I'm guessing mistakes will happen (plus I saw about 12 of 200+ employees). What do you folks say to coworkers and other people who misgender or deadname you? I work in a medical facility, 50% with patients and 50% in an office setting if that helps.

whydidtheydothat1,asktransgender,Thinking of Detransitioning Sort Of?,"I say sort of because I haven't really transitioned to begin with.  I've been on hormones since I was 23, 3 years now, have had FFS, and had and orchiectomy.  I'm out to pretty much everybody in my life: work, friends, family. I don't pass.  Yes I could get people to to refer to me as female probably if I wore makeup and was super femme, but I feel like having to do those things is not passing.  It will just be clearly visible trans person lets humor them.

I love my body the most I have ever in my life, but I hate looking like a man with breasts in public.  I want to get a mastectomy, to relieve the massive anxiety I experience of looking like a freak, but I don't know how to reconcile that I will probably hate my body and it will make all of this for nothing.  The only thing I will have to show for my transition is realizing I can never have what I want the most and tons of scars all over my body. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. Advice please?"
beepboopbeep93,asktransgender,It's confirmed. Both my parents are transphobic.,"I'm planning on coming out to them in early August after I'm safely moved out and have been looking for a chance to discuss trans issues with them to get a feel for what type of response I'm going to receive when I do come out. I've been politely discussing politics with them (I'm pro-bernie and my dad often looks for chances to tear him down, as both my parents are wild right wing christians) and I brought up that Trump recently did something uncharacteristic, effectively ""denouncing"" (not sure if that's the right word) the North Carolina ""bathroom bill."" 

Before I anticipated that when I came out my dad would be ""disapointed"" in me and my mom would essentially explode, and based on their reactions tonight I think they're on Par for the course.

Trigger warning here.

I stated the law was stupid. My mom said the law wasn't stupid, and that she doesn't want to share the bathroom with a ""man."" I tried explaining to her that [we] aren't men, and she went on the whole ""If they still have a penis, they're a man."" And she shouldn't have to share a bathroom with them. So I asked her about FtM individuals, and where they were supposed to use the restroom. She doesn't mind sharing the restroom with them because ""they still have female parts."" *cue me internally screaming*

My dad is a little more low key transphobe. He said we have to protect the children from predators pretending to be trans just for access to the restroom. But he says there really should be a third bathroom option for trans people.

I ended up just having to leave the room to avoid a screaming match between me and my mom. Ugh. This is gonna be fun."
carefreearchgeek,asktransgender,A question about how people think about transition,"I read a post, elsewhere, that said ""you should only really transition if you have to"", I'm just wondering where most people stand. Obviously I think transition is an important thing that bears thinking about, but I was wondering if most people view it as a ""have to"" thing. A break in case of extreme dysphoria, or if there's people who look at it more like I do; it's a weighty thing, and bears a lot of thought, but it's ultimately a question of pros v cons, and which option you think will lead to a better quality of life. Not something to be taken lightly at all, but it's not a last resort.

In so far as this applies to me, I'm still figuring out my answer, but I know I'm not at the stage where being male would be unbearable. I'd prefer to be female, but I could probably put up with being male. But that's just it, ""put up with"", for the rest of my life, a prospect that feels very demoralising. I suppose I'm wondering how many people think I'm being stupid for considering this seeing as I can ""put up with"" the status quo.

Edit: for context I'm in the UK, 24, pos. mtf, and I'll need to go through the NHS route if I do transition."
lesbrianna,asktransgender,How much do HRT letters usually cost?,"I’m seeing a therapist who says she charges 60 bucks for a hormone letter. Is this a normal rate? I’m only visiting her until I get the HRT letter then I’ll be going somewhere else. I went with her cus I was able to get the first session the week I called, and then said I’d get the letter by my third session two weeks from then. She’s made a point of saying “I’m not scamming you out of your money” at the end of both sessions and says it will be faxed and then I’d get a call from my doctor ten days later. If she changes her mind by the third session and wants “one or two more” I’m leaving."
Vonannia,asktransgender,No clue until now,"Most trans people may have known early on about their identity. They've been basically living their lives androgynously. Some people may have also known but have intentionally hidden it. Some people have had doubts but dismissed it for some reason. 

But I find myself somewhat weird. I've always been masculine. I liked stereotypical boys stuff. I liked women. While I know those things do not define gender, I was mostly your typical boy and it did not hit me that I wanted to become a woman.

The only instances in my life I recall that may have raised flags are... During childhood, I've put on my mom's clothes and tried make up. I think I somehow enjoyed the process but I was quickly disgusted because I looked ugly. I remember perfectly when I was in college that 3 people said I'd be beautiful if I was a girl. I didn't even get mad. I just ignored it. Maybe I liked it a little bit. I just didn't admit it to myself at the time. While I'm not married, I have a daughter. And before she was born, I really did want a daughter because little girls are so cute to dress up. I've always had a fascination for transgender stories. Their transformations are awesome. Their struggles are unfortunate but they've faced it. That's admirable.

Still no thoughts that I wanted to become a woman... Well, up until 3 weeks ago. School got cancelled because of a storm warning. I was just laying in my bed, fell asleep. I woke up in tears. I opened my laptop. Somehow stumbled on another trans YouTuber. I forgot the rest but I've been getting thoughts of wanting to be a woman. I've been researching since then about transitioning. I've stopped going to the gym and will go back for different reasons. I wanted to lost muscle mass on my upper body and focus on cardio and lower body. In my bathroom, while I don't stress too much about what's between my legs, I always ask myself ""Why does it have to be there? Why can't it be something else? Oh great. This bulge when I wear my pants is annoying. Why can't I have wider hips, smaller waists."" I look at women differently now. I'm still attracted to them. But I kinda want to be like them. And talking to them I feel like is unfair. While they're expecting a man, I'm not fully a man inside. I'm not initially aroused because of thoughts of being a woman. It actually gives me inner happiness and relief.
There's more to this but I don't wanna keep this long.

This is not me questioning myself. I am transgender. But I need to work on saying it proudly to myself more. I need to come into terms with myself. It's just... WHY ONLY NOW??? I feel like God stepped down to earth, slapped me at the back of my head and said ""Hey, kid. It's not a mistake. But I just wanted to let you know you're transgender."" I'm like... ""WHY U NO TELL ME THIS 20 YEARS AGO?""

I'm just waiting for this school term to end on April 22 and I will seriously go into therapy. I need it. 

Can anyone relate? Any thoughts, insights and advice would be appreciated."
wawawawipeout,asktransgender,Dialogue about enforced gender pronoun time,"Hello, I'm a cis gay male - I want to dialogue about something and try to feel better about it while also learning to be helpful and respectful to trans people. This is sincere - my best friend is trans - I love them - I don't want to be treated like a troll. Please be kind.

I've been to a couple functions now which have mandatory pronoun declaration with name introduction. I say ""mandatory"" because a trans person policed me after the first one I did, where I didn't take it seriously. I said ""he/him/she/her/hayyy"". The trans person confronted me and said ""please take pronoun time seriously"".

I think a lot of my emotion comes from a misplaced feeling that the trans person was an authority figure rather than someone asking me to please do something, but I think that feeling is valid because right now in these situations a trans person is sort of the ""person with the lived experience"" card they can play and ask for you to be socially shunned. Again, I am being earnest about my feelings here - maybe they are wrong. Well, also, the person came off as aggressive, quite frankly, but I think that was unintentional and they were scared/upset.

My feeling is this: I have a drag gender identity. I very, very seriously do not take gender seriously. You can call me he or she. I have always felt like a woman intermittently, I have always daydreamed that I am a woman, and I have never wanted to be a woman or felt body dysphoria. In other words, I feel I am trans-without-taking-being-trans-seriously or trans-without-dysphoria. (Please understand I am not claiming the word ""trans"" - I am explaining how I feel adjacent. I do not consider myself trans, but I think a bridge can be built to it.) I feel strongly about this: I have ALWAYS daydreamed of myself as being a woman and identified with female characters. I know many gay men feel this way and have various levels of self-acceptance about it.

In a very real way, I do not want to confirm that I am male or female or that I have pronouns. I have taken to saying ""pronoun indifferent"" during gender pronoun time. But I still have a question.

Doesn't it make more functional sense for trans people to establish a norm that introducing yourself with your name and pronouns is normal only for people who care if you misgender them? In other words, I want it to be 100000% normal to say ""My name is Joe, she/her pronouns"" - I have never felt uncomfortable with that. But it disturbs me to have to declare a gender identity of any kind, and I absolutely loathe (*for myself*) the idea of ""they/them"" or any other legalistic expression of gender ambiguity. I would never call myself genderfluid, either, because I don't think I am - I think I'm femme but present as masculine so it causes a playful distortion 24/7. I like the playful distortion. I don't want to enforce respect for it. The idea of saying ""I am femme but I present as masculine"" is almost like saying ""I could have been interesting to be around but I will reduce myself to something blunt, legalistic and obvious without mystery"". 

So, my question is, can trans and drag be valid identities which respect each other from a perspective of ""trans means taking gender seriously, drag means seriously not taking it seriously""? (and I know this is absolutely loose because many LITERAL drag people end up transitioning and many trans people feel less dysphoria or more fluid than others -- I view all psychological matters as a spectrum).

This is less of a question about mandatory pronoun time (I'm sure I can learn to live with it) and more about building bridges of understanding in places that feel politically correct. I am open to feedback."
AbitC0nfused,asktransgender,(Nsfw) Continuation of a post from last week...,"So last week I made a post mentioning that I'm basically not sure what my deal is and if I'm trans or not, I have distinct memories of wanting to do female stuff or be feminine from a young age but also have numerous memories of being okay with 'male' things as well. I'm really not sure whether I'm trans or not, most of the comments on my previous post seemed to indicate yes, and I somewhat believe this but also somehow feel inauthentic because I don't truly hate being male and I don't feel like transitioning or not transitioning is a life or death choice. That combined with the fact that my sex drive is still pretty male and I'm about 50/50 spilt on pentrating vs being penetrated, I enjoy my ""male"" genitals and don't really want to get rid of them at this point in my life. Idk I'm really confused about this stuff. Probably going to try and schedule an appointment with a local gender therapist to see if they can help me make sense of all this and whether or not I should transition.

Exactly how possible is it to pass? I'm aware that YMMV based on how masculine/feminine you look to begin with, I'm more looking for a general idea on how possible it is, not how difficult. I'm UK based which means I need three months minimum of RLE before HRT. Currently my understanding is that unless I'm ridiculously masculine, which I'm not, then with a lot of hard work and practise makeup, voice control, a wig and padding under my clothes would be enough for me to pass.

Edit: Bit of missing context, I wrote this a bit quick before I left home this morning. I'm not planning to go public for a while, and the passing is also for me. If I look in the mirror and think I pass then what other people think won't bother me much at all.

My questions is that do you think that instead of gender based teams (boy teams and girl teams) we had sex based teams (male and female).

liz_someone,asktransgender,Allergies to hormones and testosterone blockers...is this normal?,"In 2015 I started taking Diane 35 for hormones because it was what I could afford at the time. My hair instantly started thinning, when I found strands of my hair, the longest (old) part was very thick, then it came to an abrupt change in diameter, and the shortest (new) part was very thin. I didn't think much about it at the time, and thought it would get better. Eight months later, my elbows were full of a itchy rash, and so were my legs. I had gone to a doctor, who said it was my rhinitis and gave me some medicine which made it less worse. I stopped taking Diane-35 on the exact day of my 8 month anniversary, and a week or two later, the rashes were completely gone. That was November. I tried taking Diane 35 again for a week in December, the rashes came back in the same week. In January I tried once again, and rashes came after three days or so. 

Also in January severe acne started appearing on my scalp. I had this acne since before I started taking Diane 35, but it got worse in January and my hair started falling out at an accelerated rate. I don't know, but maybe it is because I tried to commit suicide in 2014, by taking a lot of anti-depressants (I don't remember which they were). Before 2015, my hair war very thick and healthy (my father has very thin hair, but he's not bald, it's like that because he has a bad lifestyle, all my uncles have a head full of hair). In this month too, I found that spironolactone was actually very cheap, and bought it at the local pharmacy, but was afraid to try. In February, I went to a doctor, I was not taking anything for a month, I got my hormone levels checked and they were the hormone levels of a very healthy man...(I have a good diet, don't smoke nor drink, and exercise every day, so no surprise here). The doctor did nothing else for me and sent me away. He said I should go to an endocrinologist, but the few ones in my city don't accept my health insurance and I can't pay a bus to the capital city.

In the March 29th it would be my 1 year anniversary, so I decided I should start taking spironolactone. Some things started getting better, I was feeling just like when I was taking Diane 35, which is good, and my appearance was getting feminine again. But my head hair started falling out like crazy, my fringe is nearly gone, my hairline is receding, and I have bad acne everywhere in my scalp (but mainly close to the hairline). My hair is now very very thin and breaks easily, and it's not only old, long hair that is falling, but small, new hair is too. 

I am getting depressed because of this, I cry everyday. I can't decide over having hair or being feminine. I'm going to see a dermatologist next week (the same who treated my rash), but I have little hope of being able to have HRT any time in my life...

will this hair thing go away after some time taking spiro, or it will just get worse?

Stuff that might be helpful: I am a vegetarian since february. I was takin B vitamins supplement, but now I'm taking Centrum multivitamins supplement. I have rhinitis, mild dyshidrosis, and I'm allergic to Penicillin, Sulfa, Novalgin and a lot of other stuff I don't remember right now.

SpinningInLife,asktransgender,"I'm a cis-male, but I do wonder at times if I'd be a better fit as a female? Can anyone relate?","This may be a weird question to ask since I don't fully believe myself to be totally unhappy with my male body. However, I do at times frequently wonder when I stare in the mirror, would I look better as a female, and perhaps happier as an individual? I glean hard at my face and neck, looking at my features. Is my jawline too defined or less defined than a typical male? Is my Adam's apple too noticeable or more discreet? If I grew out my hair even longer, would it be more convincing that I could look like a female? Basically, a part of me wonders, almost obsessively, if I looked even better and more fit for a female body, then it's something I would probably explore. But maybe I'm just over exaggerating these thoughts. I have no clue. I wish there was some kind of app/program that could determine how you'd look as the opposite gender after messing with estrogen. 

Some of these thoughts also come from a place of knowing how I'm seen as a passive male. I know that it isn't uncommon among the male population to be passive. Though, I don't really have a desire to be 'manly'. I do workout a little, but it's mostly because I like to feel well rather than to look more 'masculine' in my super skinny body. Also, a trend I've noticed when I join online forum communities, users tend to assume I'm a female, even if I assigned a male label to my account. 

I just feel like an odd individual trying to pass as society's view of what a male is. I still, however, feel mostly okay with being male. It's these thoughts that make ponder and ponder if I be more fit as a female since I don't believe myself to be distinctively male. Anyone relate..?"

Any thoughts?"
Gothymoon,asktransgender,could i pass without surgery,"I am very unsure about this. i cant really judge for myself because one moment my face seems feminine and the next it seems hyper masculine. i know my body can pass even without hormones but what about my face? I have an album hear with my hair styled in different ways at different ways.

I know my eyebrows need work. Also I am not wearing make up, but Sometimes people think I am wearing mascara.

Randomthrowaway132,asktransgender,Turns out my parents divorced because my father (2nd mother?) outed to my mother.,"(For simplicity, male pronouns. I'm still really new to all of this, and it's really difficult to just forget 16years of having a father...)

Hi! I am 16years old, and recently learned why my parents had divorced after years of trying to solve their ""relationship issues"" as they have been calling them prior to this. Ive already had a few weeks to think about all of this, and already (kind of) talked to my father and told him that it doesnt change my relationship to him and that im fine with it...Which i really am, it's just new to me.  
Now, i also learned that he started hormone therapy and thus started transforming(After a little bit of research i learned the later you start, the less it actually changes you, and he's almost 55 years old now, so he still looks very manly). I have seen a picture of him dressed(and makeup) as a woman. He does not know i've seen it. I'm not sure he wants me to, only time ive actually seen him dress more feminine was when i slept over for the weekend and he was wearing a tighter shirt.  

Anyways. I made this post to ask you lot what i'm supposed to be doing? Do i talk to him more about it? Do i just don't address it? What am i supposed to do with this situation? Any sort of advice would be really appreciated."
Idonnoithinkimtrans,asktransgender,Adopting a new voice and mannerisms,"I have concerns about adopting female mannerisms and voice and still feeling genuine. Like, I understand needing to in order to blend in, or even doing so because you've never been able to move/talk the way you wanted.  But as someone who has been socialized as male and has no feminine qualities I can't help but feel that it will feel fake, especially when around people who knew me pre transition.  For any mtf girls who weren't effeminate before transition, did it feel fake at first but then became who you were?  Would just like some input or advice from anyone. Thanks &lt;3"

catfusion,asktransgender,On the naming of Cats..?,"Sorry for the title; it's a reference to my username and TS Elliot.

Anyways. I'm still pretty early in transition in many ways, and I won't be legally changing my name until I can get my gender marker changed as well, but taking on a new name is becoming more and more of a consideration as I present more femininely and socially transition.

I feel like I have maybe three options here.

The first is to use the name my parents would have named me if I'd been AFAB. 

The second is to take a name that's common for women my age, the diminutive of which sounds pretty similar to the diminutive of my given name. 

The third is to take something that's either androgynous/unisex, or feminine but with a diminutive that's androgynous/unisex.

There are pros and cons to all these options, so how'd the new naming go for you all, particularly if you did anything similar to one of the above? "

vlonylene,asktransgender,Need Advice on how to communicate with a transcoworker.,"I am sort of in a confused situation and i am turning to /r/asktransgender for help.  Lately, i found myself working on a small project with another transgirl. It was originally her project and she kind of asked me to join. My issue is ,there are time when she just shuts down and by that i mean, i cannot get her on the phone or see her. She later apologises for it and explains that she sometimes feels depressed and her mood shifted and she needed the closure. The first time it was roughly a week before i could get hold of her again. 

Now i am not a newcomer to hrt. My own transition was a few years ago.  and eventhough i would love to give her the privilege of hrt induced moods shifts, there were a few other red flags.

* She still does it once in a while (of not responding to urgent work calls) but only for a few hours and she comes with some valid reasons. I can accept.

* I have found that she rarely goes out to meet new people. I can understand that not everyone is socially outgoing but i slightly nudged her to go out and meet/socialise with other LGBT groups, but she sort of avoided them. It feels like she is also actively avoiding meeting or creating new social circles. 

* When she told me that she was depressed, i told her to visit the therapist. Since she is seeing my old therapist and since she did not reply for a while, i contacted my therapist and he insists that she hasn't had an appointment for the past 6 months. While i wanted to give the benefit of doubt of not seeing therapist, she still hasn't initiated her legal name change . Over here in germany, it is mandatory to get referrals from 2 therapist to have a legal change of name. 


Putting together the above and a few other events (which are of a private nature ) makes me believe that she has some sort of anxiety or worries regarding her transition . I don't want to be a part of the gender policing brigade and so i did not tell her how transitions could be  but i did tell her that her identity is hers and if she wants to talk about any issues i am always there. 

She guards her emotions thoroughly still and she is also not in the habit of asking openly for help. So i am clueless how to approach her on this matter. I mean if she could tell me what is bothering her openly, i try could assist or work some alternative. Please do not mistake me, I am not trying to peer pressure her or invade her personal space but if her worries keep spilling over to our workspace then it becomes a different matter altogether.

Additionally, on my side, when she is in one of her good days, she is nice to work with and i really like working with her clients. I really want the chance to colloborate on future projects with her but  i cannot do it if she still locks up occasionally. 

Last week was emotionally draining week for me and this weekend my private life needed my attention. I find myself unable to invest emotionally in to different places. I really wanted to had a huge talk with her and directly wanted to tell how i felt about the whole situation (yes, i do have some notions) but i am also afraid that if i make a wrong move she might shut herself up again. I would really appreciate of some input."
RoninFTM,asktransgender,Rooms on overnight field-trips?,"I'm going on a school field-trip to Hawai'i for a week next school year. My best friend is rooming with me, he and I both identify the same way, making it a guy's room in our heads, but a girl's room on paper. My mom won't let me room with biological males, and I need her permission to do so. I want to room with people I feel comfortable with, but I have two female friends I would feel comfortable with, and one more who I DON'T want to room with. (I love her but I cannot stay in the same room with her for more than 3 hours without a break) The problem is, with the two that I feel comfortable rooming with, the girl I don't want to room with has to be with them, some pact. I don't want to hurt my friends feelings and kick her out, but we can only room 4 people. Thus making it impossible. There are other friends that we might be able to convince her to go with, but how do I do it without hurting her feelings?"

EmiCol,asktransgender,Growing my Hair Out,"So before I start transistioning my therapist said to try more reversible things like growing out my hair.  I've been growing my hair for almost 4 months now and it's in an awkward stage.  My last haircut was a fade and I haven't done anything since.  In the 5 days alone I've gotten 6 negative comments on it.  Is there anything I can do with my hair?

RikkuAsh,asktransgender,Hormone levels and timelines?,"It's just something that's been bothering me a little recently. Especially when I look on the transtimelines sub or passing, mainly with how much people have changed after x amount of months. And of course I'm always looking at the bar graph that is always floating about.

My question would be should I count how long I'm on hrt, monthly, from the moment I started T blocker, or at the point I got my levels within the right range?
Personally I started T blocker almost a year ago now, very low dosage and levels for oestrogen eight months ago, but the right levels and dosage maybe three months now?

It just feels like progress seems really really slow. Boobs have been coming in more recently with the upped dosage, and softer skins and such benefits. Mentally everything is really good with the current levels. But I'm not seeing much in the way of facial feminisation. Which is my main worry tbh.

Anyone able to help? Should I consider myself on hrt for 11 months or like eight or three?
T has always been real low since blockers, perfect range.
E on first dosage, range was between 50-145 p/mol, patch change frequency was often enough either.
And now, around 450-600 p/mol which is perfect I think."

[deleted],asktransgender,Problems with RLE,"In my country there is an obligatory RLE for 6 to 36 months.  There's no way to avoid that. Either I do that, or I don't get HRT.

My area is too hostile for that, though. My step-father would kick me out almost instantly, my real father would abandon me, and the village people here would most likely beat me up.

What am I supposed to do now?"
Simplices,asktransgender,NON-PASSABLE: Is it worth it?,"I'm a 16 year old, (very nearly 17) gender dysphoric, assigned male at birth person. I have told my family how I feel and they support me but obviously worry a lot. I often feel strong dysphoria but sometimes I feel content with living as a fairly femme acting gay boy. I think about transitioning a lot but then again I'm sure I would be non-passable as I bought a wig (only a fancy dress one not a proper one) and started playing with makeup and I did not look close to passable. I uploaded a photo on Grindr and got a sudden flood of compliments which initially made me feel better but then again those were just horny guys who fetishize what they perceive to be a guy, especially a young one like me dressed as a girl. So at the moment I definitely am non-passabe and I highly doubt HRT would change that just make me look a little better after all it only changes the fat redistribution and not your actual bone structure. I'm sure I would need FFS and that would cost a lot of money. And this is just considering my face. My voice is deep and I highly doubt I would be the sort of person who manages to change it by themselves so I would need voice surgery as well. Also I am 6 ft 1 and I know that 6 ft+ cis women exist but they are tiny minority and they have feminine features so people don't question them. I also am quite broad. I guess my main disadvantage is not being Asian. It seems most white MTFs don't look great. I read a lot of trans forum posts and I don't mean to be mean but the majority of the people with profile pics of themselves look horrific. This will be me.

So yes this is why am sure I will be a clocky girl who doesn't pass. I am reasonably attractive as a boy, I get a lot of attention from gay men which I will obviously lose if I transition. I will suffer abuse and harassment from random strangers which I don't think I could deal with. I will be single forever. I will suffer social isolation and will struggle to find a job. Furthermore if you still look like a guy is it really gonna help your dysphoria all that much? You wont even get perceived as female or treated like one by the majority of people. Is it really worth going through all this just for a bit of GD? Are there any Non-Passable girls here who are still glad with their decision and who transitioned knowing they would be non-passable?"
sktrans,asktransgender,I don't know where to go next in my transition and doctors are being unhelpful...,"Hi, sorry for using a throwaway... I'm feeling a bit lost about how to continue my transition.

I'm originally from the US and I was transitioning under the care of a therapist and endocrinologist; I spent ~3 years with them, started HRT about 6 years ago, and have been living as a woman for 4. I'm definitely ready for GRS! Except I moved from the US to Canada (Saskatchewan) a couple years ago, and now that I'm here I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out how to continue my process.

When I moved here to SK, I kept getting redirected from doctor to doctor until I found one was willing to help me continue my HRT at least. He gave me a referral to a local endo, who I see on occasion. My GP doesn't know anything about the transition process, and the endo sort of tries to convince me to lower my HRT dosages and acts like I'm unsure about transition and could detransition at any moment... it's really bothersome. I've tried asking him about GRS but he just deflects the questions. He doesn't seem to like or know much about trans* people and I feel like he's only grudgingly treating me out of obligation.

I contacted Dr Brassard's office, who redirected me to an SK health email address... the SK health email address replied and gave me the very vague transition process we've all heard: go talk to a therapist, who will point me to an endo, and then you go from there. Very unhelpful! I want to continue where they left off.

I guess I feel like I'm being bounced around at this point and I'm getting no help anywhere I look. What do I do? How do I get GRS? I just want to be done so I can move on with my life. I have about 2 years until I'll have a good time to take a break for surgery/recovery, so I really want to get the process started now so when the time comes I can take advantage of it.

Should I just get on with a new therapist and explain the situation?

Thank you for any suggestions!

e: Btw sorry if this is the wrong place to post this... I'm not familiar with all of the trans* subreddits."

aiichirou,asktransgender,Will this affect me too heavily with transitioning? (FTM),"I'm already out to my sister, but nobody else. I plan on not *officially* coming out to everybody until about a year from now. Shit I need to get in order first, boring stuff.

The thing is, I have a little history of disordered eating, selfharm, and two voluntary inpatient stays at a mental healthcare facility. It's making me extremely anxious that it's going to overwhelmingly complicate things when I try to get the process started. Not to mention I'm moving to South Dakota soon, which according to the research I've done, isn't exactly friendly for my situation.

I very heavily believe that my mental distress has been directly connected to the fact that I've been unwilling to accept myself as trans for years. Everything was always wrong, but I couldn't find a reason. Now that I've found this, everything suddenly seems a lot more bearable. Like I'm actually going to be okay if I can get this going.

But are there any extra precautions I need to take? Does anyone know if my therapists/doctors might be pretty unwilling to help due to my history? I know nobody can answer that for sure, I'm just looking for a little advice on how to deal with these concerns.

I'm coming out to my therapist next Monday and am also nervous that she's going to turn me away as a patient, which will cause me to come out a lot sooner, since my parents pay for my therapy. They'll kind of want to know why she suddenly doesn't want to work with me anymore if this turns out to be the case. Can a therapist even do that?

Sorry if this post is a little bit of a mess, my anxiety is pretty high right now and I'm having trouble getting my thoughts together. If this is an inappropriate place for me to post this, please let me know and I'll delete it ASAP."
Iotatran,asktransgender,What emotional changes did you see after starting HRT?,"My therapist asked me the other day about what I thought might change on an emotional level and honestly the only thing I could come up with was finally being happy with myself.

So I'm wondering what to expect on that front. I like to know as much as possible before doing anything and this happens to be one of them I hadn't really thought about. I've focused mainly on physical aspects thus far."

Hi! I feel silly writing this post but I really wanted someone else's thoughts (weird I know for such a personal thing.) Obviously I have gender related issues as I'm writing this haha. I am very uncomfortable being seen as feminine (and always have been for as long as I can remember really, even in my femmey stage in high school.) I have binded every second I wasn't showering/sleeping for the last 2/3 years. I consider myself pretty well educated on trans and gender issues, my little sis is trans and has been out since birth almost and just generally my family has lots of gender non-conforming people in it. Gender politics are something I love reading and talking about. And I've always prided myself on my kind of odd nonbinary identity of butch and I have been very active in my area's lgbtq community my whole life. What I'm saying is I don't come from a repressive background. 

I feel really envious, for lack of a better word, of transdudes sometimes. And I'll go through those before/after pages and feel sad, almost? I don't feel this burning urge to transition, like my sis did/does. And if I transitioned I'd not be the manliest of men given my geeky nature haha. I'm fine with what's in my pants (if not my shirt,) to put it crudely. I find myself way too invested in weirdly gendered things (like who's taking who's last name, for example, or looking masc) simply out of that weird gender envy I was talking about. When I think about transitioning, it makes me both incredibly happy but also hella anxious.  I look really masculine and get ""misgendered"" all the time and it makes me really happy. No one knows this but my fiance, but 7 months ago I actually sort of came out as trans (only to her) for two weeks and went back into the gender closet because of all this weird gender anxiety. There's more but I think you get the picture (hopefully I haven't rambled too badly.)

Uh, turns out some of you were right, I *am* transgender.

Years of denial came to a head when I, being interviewed for a depression support group about a month ago, had an apparent Freudian Slip in reference to gender dysphoria. The counselor asked me point blank if I thought I was trans and after a minute's silence I responded with, ""...fuck, I think I am.""

After coming to terms with this fact, I've begun coming out to some friends and plan on coming out to my mom soon.

I've even begun thinking about my new name and I have plans to go clothes shopping (among other things) in the near future.

whitestarkirby,asktransgender,I'm tired of this.,"There's this guy on Facebook, he's a friend of a friend. He was ranting and ranting about how trans anything is basically bullshit that leaked out of tumblr. Here are some copy/pastes:

&gt;""I sexually identify as an attack helicopter #stopheliphobia!!!""﻿

&gt;""CIS SCUM1!!!1""

&gt;""If you call someone a bigot, just because they hold a belief that you don't like, then you are the actual bigot with no tolerance for anyone elses beliefs thereby making you ignorant."" &lt;---used to justify transphobia/homophobia

&gt;""gender and sex are very difficult to sepertae in the real world, if only they would understand that on tumblr. why do you think they call it gender reassignment surgery sometimes? sex= gender!""

&gt;""transgenders, the women kind, should use male bathrooms because bathrooms are tentative of sex, because your sex is your reproductive organs, which also utter waste, which is the main point of a bathroom""

&gt;""lol tumbrinas. they ""identify"" as whatever they want, essentially saying theyre rocks or gems or whatever the fuck else they want to be. that just means anyone that ""identifies"" as a girl isnt really a girl unless they actually have a vagina. xD""

I don't understand why some people think that trans = tumblr. How is that any more sensible than saying, porn = tumblr because porn blogs? What's more is... don't you have to actively seek out people that talk like they're mocking? Isn't that like, complaining about gay porn... while actively searching for it and being angered by the results? 

The concept of transitioning is... somehow not medical to these people either. It's entirely psychological and superficial from what they say, what this guy says, whose opinion is unfortunately shared among many across the internet. Because of this, we're supposed to be identified by our genitals. It doesn't matter how they look, how long we've been on HRT. We're, ""actually men"", to these people. Why do my genitals have to define me? Why will they define me even after being completing transition one stop short of SRS due to financial reasons? In some cultures, I'd be seen as half of each, or even intersex. I guess I'm ok with either of those, even if the former is somewhat offensive, but I guess I'm just so tired of being called a man, despite living as a female every day. The sad thing is, I hear people in real life talk like this all the time, just with tumblr being replaced by liberals. I don't directly face discrimination, but I know what they're saying applies to me, and just because I'm ""stealth"" doesn't mean it doesn't make me sick to my stomach, not only because of what it's saying about me, but all the trans people I know that don't ""pass"" and end usually end up being the visible targets of these people's words and actions.

bellsprouts69,asktransgender,"Anybody getting referred to as their preferred gender without presenting as such? (For example, if I, being MtF, being referred to as female while obviously presenting 100% male)","I was donating plasma today and there was a difficulty. The tech screwed up and missed my vein a lot, causing a small amount of swelling and some bleeding. A nurse came by just to make sure everything was fine, and I assured her that I was totally cool (I once had a newbie completely miss and not realize it, giving me a large 1-1.5ish centimeter bubble under my skin, so this little bit didn't phase me). 

Anyway, she and the tech both were referring to me as male. They had looked at my chart, which does list me as male. Another nurse came by and she, however, kept referring to me as ""she"". The conversation between her and the other nurse went something like the following:

Nurse 2: (Sees me laughing and chatting with the tech and Nurse 1) Oh, good, she seems fine.

Nurse 1: Yeah, he just had some small hematoma (&lt;== swelling) but--

Nurse 2: I was just worried if she was going to be sick or anything like that

Nurse 1: Oh, haha, nope, he's doing fine.


It was an odd, yet rather amusing conversation to watch, as Nurse 2 didn't seem to register they were using different pronouns, while Nurse 1 seemed to be putting emphasis on the ""he"" so that she would get the hint. I don't think she was trying to be mean or anything. I think she just didn't see whatever Nurse 2 saw, and didn't want a patient she perceived as male.

Anyway, I just thought this was funny, and I would love to hear if any of you have had similar experiences.

misskb82,asktransgender,Can we ban this myth about transitioning before 25?,"By this I mean having to transition by 25  otherwise your life is doomed. It's absolutely not true.

It doesn't inspire people to transition adapt, it makes everyone feel bloody awful. People who are near or above 25 feel like garbage, and people on the run up to it feel like that if they can't transition before then they might as well kill themselves.

How in any way is this helping the community? It's totally toxic. I've argued against this for a while now, what feels like on my own, and this attitude just seems to be snowballing. And worse still it's a theme which keeps coming up in suicide notes.

And I'm not suggesting people wait or delay transition. We should transition at the age we figure ourselves out and not feel bad about it.

I know many transpeople of all ages in real life, there is absolutely no truth in this 25 barrier. This is purely about people wanting to believe they are within some ideal age range and therefore they will end up passing and be beautiful. It's a total superstition to think your age will bring you fortune in your transition. It's as stupid as think you'll pass because you have blue eyes or brown hair.

People can have successful and meaningful transitions at ANY age. You absolutely can transition near or well beyond 25, and pass, and be attractive, and be happy. 

End of rant.

Edit:

Wow. What a pile of shit this thread turned out to be. I'm sorry some people feel so adamantly that beyond 25 there is nothing you can do and you might as well go live in a cave. Which is just categorically untrue. Those of us who've transitioned beyond this age or are active in our local communities know so.

I'm deeply sorry if this thread has affected anybody. Maybe in the least it goes to highlight how toxic this view is. I'll leave the post up for the moment, but mods feel free to delete it if you wish. I am going to stop redditing now, I've been on here a few years and I just don't want to engage in this any more. This age thing is a toxic attitude is getting worse and it's damaging to people of all ages. Whether you agree with me or not, you have my love and I wish you all the best in your transitions.x

throwaway43863,asktransgender,Does anyone else feel like they are permanently and completely ending their dating life by transitioning?,"x-post from /r/lgbt

I am 25, male (by birth, not by choice), and a complete and total failure of a person. I make six figures and drive a nice car, but...I've never been with anyone sexually (only a ""technical"" virgin, and that was with some man), I don't have any friends, I can't seem to deal with people at all, and worst of all, I am transgender (male-to-female). The two may not seem related, but let me explain, as they are clashing and *hard*.

I am very self-conscious about the fact that I've never had sex with or even sexual interest from a woman. In fact, I've never even kissed a woman. I've ""fooled around"" with another man in college, but it was so tremendously not my thing. I don't want to date men. For years I hid behind ""gay"" as a way to avoid having to deal with women, who I view as extremely intimidating, onerously selective, and impossible to attain. In retrospect, this was kind of a mistake.

I feel like nothing I can ever do will be good enough to gain the sexual interest of one. **I do not believe it is their fault and only blame myself**, after all normal people seem to be able to do it just fine. The problem is me, I just don't know why. The worst result of this has been a snowball effect of self-hatred and low self-esteem. I feel like there is no stronger indictment that I am incapable of dating women than the fact that I am a 25 year old ""technical"" virgin. I really do feel like there's this *giant* party I'm not invited to, and people keep telling me how amazing it is. Whenever one of my friends even reveals that s/he's hooked up, I can't bear to listen. I even get jealous of the sex lives of fictional characters on TV. My virginity has become an obsession. I spend most of my time avoiding the fact that sex even exists, because any reminder that it does is a reminder of something I cannot have.

How does this relate to my transgender feelings? I *know* I should have been born a woman. I deal with crippling dysphoria every day. I knew since I was fourteen, but I never told anyone. Time is running out for me to get *any* satisfactory result from HRT, so I am consulting with a therapist and starting soon. Or, so I think I am.

*I'm afraid that transitioning will destroy the only possible way I can fix my virginity: my appearance.*

See, I don't believe I am ugly, or that this is the problem. In fact, I've had many people tell me for years that I was ""handsome"". But for a transgender person like me, this is *debilitating* to hear. I'm six foot even, which I hate. I have such pronounced masculine features on my face, which I hate. My arms are too muscular, which I *really* hate.

But, all these things I despise about myself seem to be *the only way I can quickly and effectively end this nightmare*. I *know* transitioning will utterly destroy my chances meeting any women. I'm much too old to get a satisfactory result transitioning, and will be in this ""gender limbo"" where *nobody* will want to date me. 

So why transition, then? *Because I can't date as a male*. I hate my masculine features. I want them gone. Even if I was this retarded in-between ""thing"" of a woman, it would be the best I can do, and I would just feel all that much better about myself.

But I know the chances of me ever having sexual relations with a woman stand at zero after this point. Because women *love what I despise about myself.* 

What do I even *do*? I want to transition *so bad*, but I don't want to spend the rest of my life cripplingly lonely. 

Should I try to toughen up, lose my virginity to *end* this, and then transition?

Will I ever have a satisfactory casual dating life as an old, non-passing trans woman?

**tl;dr** 25 year old virgin, and transgender. Transitioning will make me feel better about my body and restore my confidence, but destroy my only asset with women: my masculinity."

randomidiot123,asktransgender,Is transition the correct choice for everyone? Venting sorry for this.,"I want to transition, but I don't think I can handle the social repercussion that it entails. If I were to transition I'm 95% sure that my parents would disown me, or be convinced that I've been corrupted by living in a city for the last few years. I've known my parents will react negatively towards how I feel, so I've tried to live normally. I've felt like I should have been born a woman since puberty, but I've been to scared to share it with anyone until recently.

I'm 22 years old, and I've just been living as a normal guy, but my desire hasn't gone away. This feeling has waxed and waned over the years but it never disappears. I'm living a lie. I've was in denial for awhile on what I feel, that I want to be a woman.

I mostly have body dysphoria, but I don't have social dysphoria. I get very anxious when I think someone will find out I'm transgender, and I don't want people to know which is my main concern with transition. If I were to transition it paints a target on my back and I don't think I could deal with that. Essentially I'm not strong enough to endure that and I my family would either not believe me when I say that I am a woman or that I am just a freak. Perhaps both.

AndreaStewart,asktransgender,Nip development,"My question for today is in regard to people's experience with nipple development.

In my case, when I was around 14-years-old, I started to develop a left breast. There was a fair amount of mass there (a bud) and the nipple developed somewhat and I could tell people noticed it through my clothing. I went to a doctor about it and he said it was nothing and does occasionally happen to boys around my age (he also suggested that it could be removed if it bothered me - hahaha! Thank goodness I didn't take his advice!!!). When I hit puberty the bud diminished and the nipple returned to relative normality (for a cis male, anyway), though it has always appeared slightly more developed than the other one, for anyone observant enough to notice. 

Returning to the present, I've been on HRT nearly 4-months and the nipple in question obviously has a bit of lead on the other one in the development stakes. So I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and whether they know and/or have experienced firsthand the lesser nipple catching up in the long run?

Thanks :)"
Captain-Nemo,asktransgender,Should I be angry?,"So I had my appointment today to get started on HRT, and I was obviously really excited!

On the drive there I said something silly that upset her, And then for literally the entire day all she did was yell at me about everything, and just make me feel like shit. 

I ended up in tears, and asked to just go home. Now she is mad at me because I cancelled our lunch plans. I'm just so upset and angry at her. I've been waiting for this day for my entire life and now I'm always going to remember it being a shit day. I feel like I'm not over reacting, and now my girlfriend is suggesting we break up.

There's usually not a gender-neutral bathroom available for me to use, but no one by looking at me is going to peg me as trans.

I can't physically hide this anymore from my parents, let alone the guilt from not saying anything to them. I love them too much to not say anything.

I've always figured he's had to know something was going on, even if he didn't know exactly what it was, and that seemed to confirm it, because that was a little out of the norm to make a point to take me aside and tell me that in the past.

I feel a bit uncomfortable with this idea because I'm not sure how people will react.

For me, I used ""being triggered"" to relate to having a relapse to being abused (about 6 months in captivity) where I would believe i was back in that horrible situation. I would flee from everyone, hide in a dark corner and claw my arms with my nails till I bled while sobbing. If someone touched me or if i saw/heard a man i curl into a ball and sob unmovably. It took consistent coaxing, soothing, and very patient friends to help me out of those periods. smells,grey goose vodka, feelings, darkness, and dog cages would trigger me into that mode. 

I have seen triggered being used as ""offended by"" or ""disgusted"" or ""insecure"". ""That dress totes triggers me"" translation, that dress is ugly. ""Talking about hrt triggers me"" translation, discussions about hrt disheartens me. 

misusing that word hurts those that need it. I am not trying to deligitamize peoples feelings, but if you are using Triggered as being mildly offended you are misusing the phrase and I find it very insensitive. "
NOOBonboPRO,asktransgender,Questions regarding Self Medication,"Hello all! Long time no see.

I have a few questions about self medication for you all. I'm a Pre-HRT MtF, and I'm living in a very transphobic (and for that matter anything-non-standard-phobic) community, and I cannot find any medical practitioners who is willing to see me for gender dysphoria, let alone prescribe me anything for it. 

Now, I feel I have taken all the steps towards being ready for HRT. I have found myself a councilor whom I speak with about all this and everything else in my life, and have been seeing her for a little over six months. She was the only one I could find that was A) willing to see me for gender dysphoria, and b) talks with me on a regular basis without bias. She has ""officially declared me to be dealing with gender dysphoria"", and has recommended that I start HRT as well as partaking in activities that help me express my femininity. Now, I have been reading up a bit, and I have found that spironolatone at 100mg and estradiol at 2mg a day is a recommended starting dose, and I've been recommended to visit All Day Chemist if I want to buy online. 

Now, for the questions part. Where did your dosage start off at, and was that prescribed or through your own means? Second, what are some of the first month or two symptoms that you were dealing with while your body was getting adjusted to this new intake of hormones?

My parents took me to a doctor and I was diagnosed with them, I really didn't want them gone so I said I didn't like surgery.  I realized I liked men exclusively around that time, but I didn't want to be seen as gay, I couldn't even contemplate it, it wasn't what I wanted. By then I pictured myself as female but never thought it was possible considering my family and my circumstances, like it was a fantasy. 

It is hard to say it influenced me though, i felt more and more feminine the older I got even when i was actively engaged in traditional masculine things. The more I resisted and the more intense my feelings became. Did i have lower T levels that contributed to all of this? I don't know.

I'm not sure quite how to articulate how I'm feeling right now, so I'm sorry if I end up rambling or not making a lot of sense. For context, I only started to question my gender this January. I'm probably just going through a heavy doubting phase but here goes; I'm really struggling with whether or not I'm really trans (MtF) and whether or not I've actually experienced dysphoria.
Looking back, I've never felt like myself, like I've never been able to express myself in a genuine or sincere way. And I never had a real sense of identity or self-image.
Thing is, after so long, it seems like I don't even know what I want or how I really feel. I *think* I want to be a girl... 
As for dysphoria, I don't feel particularly bad about my body, in fact I feel pretty much entirely neutral about it as it is now. All though, I do feel happy when I think of myself with a female body.
Maybe I'm just worried that lack of any obvious or direct dysphoria invalidates this new sense of identity I'm getting to grips with. In any case I'd love to hear your thoughts or from anyone who can relate! Thanks in advance! :)"

BelleOfTheBallet,asktransgender,Anyone have experience with surgeons in Chicago?,"I am in the process of getting consultations for three surgeries: orchiectomy, tracheal shave, and a breast augmentation all preferably in one session. I had a consult with Loren Schechter that went well and he said he could do all three procedures in one session.

I plan to have consults with:
Traci Beck (orchi)
Alison Shore (augmentation)
Jeffrey Weinzweig (orchi, augmentation, tracheal shave)
Loren Schechter

I'm having trouble finding first hand accounts from people who have had these specific surgeries with these Chicago surgeons. I'd feel a lot better if I could hear some experiences from this forum or if someone could direct me to experiences elsewhere on the internet.

vin1832,asktransgender,i checked out what MtF SRS there are and they're confusing?,"personally, any surgery is very far off into the future, but i do still want to explore the possibilities, so i wanted to check the prices and see how avalible are then to me, [and i came across this website](http://www.transgendersurgerythailand.com/price-promotion-sex-reassignment-surgery-srs-transgender-breast-body-surgery-facial-feminization)

why are there all these different surgeries? do i have to take all of them if i want to do SRS?   I've searched some of them up and is seems like all of them just tried to create a virginal opening, but then why is there a ""Labiaplasty after SRS""

throwawaydontask1,asktransgender,Having a big anxiety and being trans...,"Hey. 

I am posting this on my throwaway account because some people here know me in real life and I don't want to disclose this issue to them.

So I am around 5 months into HRT and things have been amazing. I've been told I look passable and people are wondering why I don't go fulltime already.

Well, the problem is hormones did not fix my anxiety issue. I am like the most awkward and anxious person you can ever imagine. I recently made trans friends and joined a group in college. Everyone is being very supportive of me but my anxiety makes me push them away. I act like a cold-hearted person when deep inside, I feel like shit and is unintentional. This has been a consistent issue and eventually everyone is staying away from me. And I really am lost on what to do to make everything better because I've only took things too far.

Been suffering from dysphoria and now an extreme anxiety... it just makes me sad and depressed."

[deleted],asktransgender,Anal sex? (All inclusive),"Sorry, I don't feel comfortable going to random parts of Reddit lol... I would very much ask you guys. 

So, there's this person I started seeing (let's call them ""person"" lol), and I reallllllyyyy want to have sex with ""person"", but I haven't had anal sex in like a year. If I continuously masturbate anally will it be easier for them to penetrate me without issue? Like, I don't want to be in pain, and I know that the skin isn't supposed to stay stretched out, but will it get easier (less downtime/preparation)? Or do I have to go through painstaking patience to prep every time (I tried to masturbate and it took 20min before it got all the way in!!!! Wth!)? I'm not really a patient person lol and would very much rather have someone shove it in and go to town.

Sorry in advance, and thank you to whoever responds. I really appreciate it. I feel awkward asking this, but it's important to me. "
DudetteInDistress,asktransgender,Cold MtFs (and perhaps warm FtM's),"Generally, men are ""warmer"" than women.  
I don't have a source atm, but if I remember correctly, it's because women's bodies make an effort to keep their inner organs warm at the cost of their skin &amp; extremities.  

In any case, I've heard from a few transitioning/post-transition mtfs that they've started to need warmer clothes and things of the sort, because they tend to feel colder than before.

My question is, is hormone therapy the cause for this?   
Personally I do find it interesting that hormones would be in charge of heat regulation. Assuming of course, that is the case. If it is, then would ftms experience the opposite?

NeedAName__,asktransgender,"Alright, confused and young.","I have no intro to this post. Cough. Getting straight into it, I'm not sure if I'm trans or not.  I used to do a bunch of girly stuff when I was younger, maybe three/four, like playing with baby dolls and such, and as of recently, I've started to feel really weird being myself. I was clicking the random button when bored, found this subreddit, and now I'm questioning if I'm trans. I'm 60/40, leaning on being trans, but what's holding me back from coming out is my family. I'm afraid I'd come out to them, and then we either end up doing nothing about it, or they deny it. I'm also afraid I won't pass as a girl (MtF, haven't mentioned that yet, sorry), and I'll just be stuck in limbo for the rest of my life, or that I will end up regretting transitioning. Sorry for poor quality of writing, and the lack of info I have on my family's opinion on transgenders.

Funny coincidences: Around when I was questioning, a little autistic girl at a church I volunteer at was learning genders. I had a longer haircut at the time (spike it now), so she came up to me and said ""He a... woman."" stuttering for a moment, and then walked away. Cut my hair, ""She a... girl."" Illuminati confirmed?

Second coincidence: Friend gave me a snickers bar today.  http://i.imgur.com/4WkYKEv.jpg . It was that one. "
Older_Wiser2,asktransgender,A shopping problem ...,"I'm posting this both in response to a post by lost_melody and as a new post ....... given the shopping concerns expressed by gals I think this is quite interesting and a bit humorous for sure :)   (or at least I thought so) ....

Today I had some free time and was in the mall --- As I was walking by Victoria Secret I thought about lost_melody's post and the shopping concerns most of us have at times... I told lost_melody to ""just do it"" and so I should as well :) A few weeks ago I got fitted and bought a bra in a specialty bra shop but that was quite private and secluded. *Victoria Secret not so much ....*

Okay -- so I go in and immediately I'm greeted by a very attractive young lady who's bubbly, cute and wants to know how she can help me! As I really didn't intend to buy anything (I was just killing some time) I said thanks and that I was just going to look around (said with a smile). And for about 10 minutes I browsed around looking mostly at the bras and swimming suits. I didn't see anything which would actually fit so no worries - just kinda fun shopping. 

After about 10 minutes I walked past several employees, smiled, thanked them for letting me shop around, and walked out the door. As I was walking up to the door a woman and a younger woman (I kinda thought mother and daughter) immediately followed me out.

Then it happened! As we stepped through the door off go the alarms and EVERYBODY is looking at ME - and not the women directly behind me.... Immediately the store manager (who was by the door) says ""Excuse me!!!"" and calls me back .... of course the other women continue on .... I'm certain the employees, and the young lady who first helped me, thought I was a pervert who just stole some women's underwear. Fortunately for me the manager also asked the women to come back......

They did, AND lo and behold, it turns out the older woman had a bra stuffed in her purse!!!!   WHEW!!!!!!  I got an apology and the woman handed over the bra and walked away ......

All I could think of was how this would scar lost_melody for life!!!!  ~Joelle"
Idon7be1ong,asktransgender,Can anyone relate?,"I don't know why I *think* I want to be a woman.  I don't think i could give a list of reasons why I would rather be a woman over a man?

I mean, I don't think there would be any benefits to me.  I just feel like I would be more comfortable in the body of a female.  This feeling somewhat evaporates when I realize transitioning won't give me a 100% female body, which I am ok with.  I really just want to pass well enough to be gendered female in my male clothing. 

I can't say anything good about being male really, that's just how I have lived and I have survived so far?  I don't know, being a guy is ok but it just doesn't make sense to me I guess?  I don't like the effects of testosterone.

Growing up, I wished I could be friends with girls, but they generally didn't want to be friends since I was a boy.  As I hit puberty, this only amplified, as I became more reclusive overall and generally weird around girls.  Now I have 0 friends that are girls, and 1 girlfriend.

I don't know if any of this means I am trans or not, but I do not think I am cis."

dra6000,asktransgender,Philosophical Thoughts (I think),"You know, I'm female. I've been constant for a while now, and while I'm a glad that I'm certain now, it hasn't really given me any comfort. I have gotten many thoughts from it, and now I'll share a few of them.

Context part:
I've told my parents. My dad doesn't remember me telling him. He doesn't seem to care enough about me to. It's likely due to his ADHD. His lack of attention seems to not cement memories very well (I have the same problem) and he just doesn't seem to care too much about me. Glad he forgot. He yelled at me when I said so... My mom on the other hand responded in apathy. She doesn't want to care anymore saying I didn't want to be normal and I destroyed her hope for a normal family. She thinks being trans is a choice, and thinks that a normal family is the best family. It's not even by science, she just thinks so, agreeing with a principal of yin and yang from daoism. Suffice to say, I'm treated male. I'm not entirely happy about it, but i don't have a lot of time to think about it; I'm studying a lot to get accepted into a good college for my dream career, an engineer.

Philosophical Thoughts:
I felt bad from my dad in a reasonable way, but my mom? She gives me a lot of things. She does a lot of things for me saying she cares about me. Well, many of them are destructive to my mental health in nature. Destructive love. Does such a thing exist? What is love?

Transgender parenting... I've had such bad experiences from my parents, I only could... I... I'm almost bringing myself to tears thinking if I ever did the same to a child. A child is precious. He/she... their our hopes. To ruin them, to taint them with the ichor I feel in my heart, to taint anyone, is unspeakably evil. I'm not religious (agnostic with tinges of other philosophies tbh), but even that... even that I can agree on. How would you tell a child? Would this influence a child to be trans?

Finally, what is good anyways? Everyone I know does something for something they feel to be true. What makes anyone more right than another? It's not really another's fault to feel something is true right? So many opinions that cause conflict and rift. I feel guilty about it all. I dislike the fact that I've caused so much. I... It's been a dream of mine to help others out and to protect those I love. I've always been too afraid to though. Terribly afraid... and now I've done the opposite. The pain is too much for me to bear. Perhaps it has to do with my emotional hypersensitivity... I'm not acting... I'm not lying... I know I sound dramatic, but well, that's how I think.

Thoughts below?"
ExLibrisMortis,asktransgender,Comparison of Surgeons,"So I've tried searching around this subreddit and on the internet but my skills aren't all that great. 

I'm trying to see if there is a Dr in the US that does non-penile inversion GRS something akin to the method used by Chettawutt?

There's two reasons I'm searching for this info. First off, my insurance will not cover out of country procedures. Secondly, depth is a concern of mine and I've never been ""well endowed"". So the non-penile inversion has been one of the highest priorities of GRS because of the depth guaranteed.

So do anyone know if any surgeons in the US do that particular procedure, or can at least guarantee depth regardless of... ""size""? 

Thanks in advance. "

4riadn3,asktransgender,[nsfw] question for non-op people,"hello. i am a trans girl and im 99% sure im non-op and ive been on hormones for 11 months. since starting it has been a HUGE relief and i am really, really glad i started and i really like most of the physical changes. 

except sexually it kinda brought on a few changes i dont like quite as much. my sex drive has had a few periods where it has been high, but for the most part it has dropped to almost nothing and it's hard to get aroused. and in general erections like completely stopped, i only get one like right before an orgasm

a while ago when i was starting hormones, the doctor mentioned sexual side effects and asked if i still wanted to keep that function; at the time i didnt really care much but i think i might want to look into that. 

the problem is though, will lowering doses, etc. in order to keep sexual function result in masculinizing physically? as it is, i think i had a really low testosterone level (like at 12 ng/dl or something) and since then, i doubled an estrogen dose. with changes like that, would looking more masculine be likely to happen? has anyone else done anything like this and how has it worked for them?

the last few times i missed a hormone dose i just ended up with acne and it sucked"
Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,This girl who I thought was my friend and a trans ally doesn't think I should be allowed to use the restroom [TW],"I reconnected with her a month or two ago after falling out of touch years ago.  I'm still in the closet, only out to trusted people, so I came out to her one segment at a time, telling her one part of my story, checking to see if she accepted me, and then coming out a little bit more.  This time last week she was giving me advice about pretty much every sort of feminine topic, from groomng to clothes.  I was happy to have another friend who accepted me for who I was.

Then a couple days ago she posts an anti-trans bathroom meme, with a bunch of snarky anti-trans fake hashtags on it, like ""My feelings matter more than your child's safety"", rubbish like that.  I was confused.  I couldn't tell whether she was being ironic and mocking transphobes for their irrational hatred, or being sincere.  Turns out she was sincere.

I explained to her that strangers see me as a woman, regardless of the clothing I wear.  If I identify myself as [boyname] while wearing male clothing, then they simply think that I'm an oddly named woman with a male name, and call me Miss [boyname].  Because of this, it's safer for me to use the women's restroom, and that if I were to use the men's restroom, I would be at risk of being harassed, verbally, physically, or sexually.

She told me that her opinion is that ""men"" (this was the term she used), regardless of the gender they wish to be, the clothes they wear or the medical procedures they've had done, should be confined to the men's restroom, and shouldn't be allowed into female restrooms, locker rooms, or dressing rooms.  No exceptions.  That's a female only space, no ""men"" allowed.

I was shocked.  This wasn't coming from some far right wing person who I didn't know and didn't want to know and could easily ignore, this was coming from the same person who was giving me female grooming and clothing advice a week ago.  She was my friend.  I thought she accepted me, and that we were girlfriends (platonically).  Now I learned that she was totally indifferent to my safety, and worried more about me not defiling a women's restroom with my ""manly"" presence than the risk to me if I should use the men's restroom, despite me emphasizing again and again the personal safety issue.

After learning that my friend, who I thought was fully accepting of me, was only supportive of me as long as I didn't try to use women's restrooms and dressing rooms and locker rooms, I cried and cried for a few hours.  Never before had I had someone turn on me like that after I'd so cautiously come out to them.  I was heartbroken.  I guess she isn't really my friend after all."

Lizasaurus2,asktransgender,I've been feeling a bit ill for a long time and I'm trying to work out if it's because of HRT or something else.,"Hey everyone. So I've been feeling more cold and tired than usual since the end of last winter (probably around late July - I live in the southern hemisphere) First I thought it was just HRT making me feel that way. I mean, a lot of people do feel quite tired when they first go on HRT. Now I'm wondering if it's something else.

Probably the biggest indicator was everyone was talking about how the last summer (Dec '15 to Feb '16) was one of the hottest summers ever and I was still pretty cold most of the time unless it got really hot. Now it's starting to get cold again and I'm getting a bit worried.

So, I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced being cold and tired/fatigued for as long as I have after starting (MtF) HRT. I'm starting to get worried and I think I might go see my GP.

aliciajdavis,asktransgender,Stages of Transition/Grief,"Hello,

I remember at one point during my research in trying to figure all of this out about myself, I came across an infographic that was very helpful. It essentially took the standard stages of grief and ""trans-ed"" them and it really lined up well. I cannot find that now and I find myself trying to explain why this took so long to figure out. That seems like it would be very helpful.

For a while I felt ok with never being able to afford SRS for myself, but since hearing from her that she's getting it, it seems like my genital dysphoria is resurfacing and my jealousy toward her is getting extremely difficult to deal with.  It's kept me up the last couple of nights and I've been crying uncontrollably and even cutting.  I know I should just be happy for her, but I don't feel that I know how to do that.

halptway,asktransgender,I feel like I neglected my spouse,"My spouse came out to me recently. I feel... lost, not because I do not love him, not because I feel betrayed, but because I feel like I should have been there for him. We have been together for over a decade. We were high school sweethearts, went to prom together, made it through a LDR and college. We have been married a few years. He is not the most outgoing, he is not the most eloquent. But I only learned this past week what he thinks of himself as. He has said he has no plans on transitioning, he has no plans to act on it. The dysphroia is not terrible.

He does not want to deal with the social ramifications, he does not want to lose his family, or kill his grandparents or father with the news. He does not want to put me between him and everyone else where I will gladly stand to take whatever is thrown at him and filter things through to him.

When he told me, I only asked him that we do not rid ourselves of the means to have biological children. That we freeze what we need to. I feel like I handled everything poorly, that for the past decade I should have been there for him instead of him carrying this alone. 

He has never told anyone but me about this. He never plans to tell anyone else. I am not very good at processing things by myself. The only resources I can find are for women and men that feel betrayed by their spouses, or stuff like the SSN. I am bi, I don't care what he is, he is my spouse.  He is who I married. He is who I want to spend the rest of my life with.

But I am lost, I feel like I failed him, and I feel self centered for needing an outlet. Are there any resources out there so that I can not weigh down on him? He was so brave in telling me, I don't want to push him away by voicing my fears, voicing my own personal worries to him so soon. But I have been a mess on my own. I hold everything together near him, but when it is just me, or me with one of my friends that I trust, I break down. 

I love him, I am not leaving him, I just... I need to process everything.

EDIT: I understand if this is the wrong place. Is there a better place for me to post this? I don't want to detract from anyone's experience. 

EDIT: Other questions, to make him happier, does anyone know of where to find mastectomy bras or something along those lines? He says transitioning would be too much work, but he says that he is envious of my breasts and when he was younger he would tape tennis balls to his chest when he masturbated. I wanted to get him something that could be hidden in my drawers for his comfort, but he could use when he wanted to.

(Yes, I keep saying he, but that is what he wants me to use for right now. I asked him if in private he wanted me to say she and call him my wife instead of husband, and he said that felt wrong.)"

sockysocky,asktransgender,"Friend outed herself on Facebook today: ""A note about my past...""","I don’t usually like getting political or into activism but I have to admit that all the ‘bathroom bill’ talk has gotten me a bit worked up. Such that I feel I need to air something I haven’t brought up in a long time and frankly, don’t like to talk about anymore. But here it goes:


**I have a transsexual/transgender/‘trans’ past.** (however you want to word it)


For those of you that suspected but never said a word or asked a single question, *I thank you*. That’s how I’d prefer it…even now that you know, I’d prefer it stay that way.

Those of you that really had no clue. I’m glad. I’d rather that be the case anyway.

The rest of you have been with me for at least some of it.

The truth is, I don’t want to be known or loved because of something so basic: simply being who I am. I’d rather be loved or praised for things that I do, such as making costumes or writing apps or being friendly and loving…..not the fact that I was born with incorrectly matched parts.

I don’t consider it a secret to hide…..but merely a piece of my medical past that’s nobody else’s business. I moved on from it years ago.

That being said, people always have questions so here’s some quick answers:

1. Yes I was born with male ‘parts’ and now have female ‘parts’. As far as the law is concerned nowadays, I was born female. (yes, that includes my birth certificate and all legal documents)
2. No I cannot bear children, just like countless other women with fertility issues.
3. No I will not tell you my old/dead name and it’s rude and hurtful to ask about it or intentionally call me by it. (even in past tense)
4. No I do not want to talk about any of this so please don’t bring it up in conversation. It’s not unlike bringing up a birthmark that someone has on their face; they know it’s there so unless they bring it up, leave it alone.
5. No I am not ‘the best of both worlds’. I am and always have been a woman. It’s just that for the first part of my life, I spent it trying to be something I was not: a man. 
6. Yes my husband knows and has always known and doesn’t care. He’s attracted to women and loves me. It’s a non-issue….and it should be such for everybody IMHO.
7. No I am not ‘brave’ or ‘courageous’. This wasn’t a brave thing for me to do. It was a thing I HAD to do to survive. To live. To go on. To be who I am, authentically. 
8. Yes my parents disowned me when I transitioned and even after many years, they continue to ignore who I am and hope for the old ‘pretend me’ to come back to them; this, all based on religious counsel they’ve received. 
9. Yes I choose to try to live a ‘normal’ life instead of being ‘out and proud trans’ because society DOES treat you differently……and I don’t want to be treated differently……good or bad, I want to be treated for what I do and how I treat others….not because I managed to work through an issue I was born with. I don’t want special treatment. Don’t treat me any different than any other woman.
10. Yes I support the trans and LGBT movements. Equality for all. No person should have to be treated like a second-class citizen (or worse) because of who they are or who they love. It’s no different than race or sex or anything else. We’re all humans. I don’t care what your religion says, the greatest of all teachings is love for all people. Period.


So all of that being said:

* If after knowing this information, you consider me to be ‘a man’, **unfriend me right now.**
* If you’re a woman who feels like with this knowledge you cannot share a bathroom or locker room with me, **unfriend me right now.**
* If you’re a father or mother and feel like trans women (including myself) shouldn’t share the same bathroom as your daughter, **unfriend me right now.**
* If you feel that transgender people are merely sexual predators, **unfriend me right now.**
* If you support bills like i-1515 which seek to bar transgender individuals from using the correct restroom in WA state (something that’s been in effect for years), **unfriend me right now.**


Trans people die every year due to suicide and murder because of simply not being allowed or afforded the privilege to be who they really are…..something anyone born in the right body takes for granted everyday. This includes being fired for being trans, bullied for being trans, becoming homeless for being trans, and yes, using the bathroom that matches their gender identity.


Now that we’ve been through that, let me ask you something from the bottom of my heart: 


**Please just let it go**….and know that there are many of us among the population that just want to live our lives normally. None of us are out to harm anyone. Criminals will do that.

KlaatuBaradaNibble,asktransgender,[mtf] Looking for cardio advice (if this is the right place),"Sorry if I posted in the wrong sub, and please direct me if there's a proper place for this question.

Being an ignorant of everything physical, I was wondering if there is a good cardio to help me lose my belly and lower back muscles/weight.

I'm fairly skinny but I feel that there's a lot of bulk around my belly in particular which makes my figure appear like a barrel. But I wouldn't want to gain any muscle there (I hate the idea of having a six-pack, and it would only add to my waist circumference), just want something to help me lose whatever there is to lose there, as I'm pretty far away from an hourglass figure now, especially since my legs have skinnied out."

katie-elizabeth,asktransgender,"While closeted, did you ever feel guilt about 'tricking' girlfriends/boyfriends into thinking you were happily cis?","I have recently been able to admit to myself why I've had such a problem with relationships.  I got really good at pretending to be cis, due in part to studying for endless hours about how an 'ideal' cis person of my sex would act.  I did some deep thinking about what would make me attractive to the opposite sex, and put it into practice.  
  
I got good at it, but it was all a lie.  For me, it was a chance to be closer to femininity and appear normal to society (*'all the girls love him'*).  Some of my fondest memories would be when a girlfriend would invite her friends to hang out and I would, in some small small way, get to finally hang out with girls in an approved way.  
  
But the lie didn't lead to happy relationships - the act I had put on to attract these people wasn't who I actually was.  I didn't actually enjoy being this person... so no matter how attracted they were to it, the relationship would slowly become more work over time to keep up the facade.  Eventually they would either catch on or I would push them away before they could.  
  
I thought that was the only way that a relationship could even start.  I never even considered that someone might like me for me.  As a result, I tended to be even lonelier while dating someone because I couldn't even be true to myself.  :("
SkyeHii,asktransgender,"Discouraged with hair removal, any advice?","After a second messy failed attempt at sugar waxing, I'm pretty discouraged my body hair. I just want it to be gone, but it's incredibly difficult.

I hate shaving because it's a daily thing and gives you cuts and makes you prickly. So far sugaring has been incredible sticky and more trouble than it's worth ( I've only been able to wax half of one leg).

PeanutButter707,asktransgender,WTF sexuality...,"Ever since I've been officially out as trans, my sexuality has decided to stop being anything intelligible and at this point I don't even know who I'm attracted to. I've always been into girls and been curious about guys for a couple years, but ever since I've really figured myself out gender wise and been out as trans, whoop-de-do, it seems to change all the time. Some days I feel ""normal"", some days I feel more into girls romantically and guys sexually, some days I just feel into girls, and some days I just don't feel as into either as I used to be. I'm not on hormones yet and idk how they'll affect this, but is this normal? 

Either way I only romantically want to be with a girl, but some days the attraction is still less than others. Has anyone else been through this? Will hormones make it even worse?"

VaatiXIII,asktransgender,How do I break up with my manipulative girlfriend?,"I messed up. Long distance relationship, we dated about 3 years ago.

If I'm out with my best friend, she yells at me. I thought she'd changed and I have no idea how to leave her without risking being a factor in a suicide. She keeps forcing me to make false promises to marry her once we're not 2,000 miles away, which I never plan on letting happen because she's been manipulating me constantly since about two months ago. I don't really know who else to ask. She won't stop outing me to every single person she knows. I'm not her girlfriend. I'm her ""trans girlfriend"" which puts me in danger of harassment and a ton of other bullshit. I feel like a complete asshole because I'm her only escape from her past and her shitty friends, but I'm being forced into this relationship. Distance is a factor, and easy to work around. I'm 18, she's 16, so I'm really hoping her threats aren't real. I just need advice on how to save myself and keep her from doing... that. I care for her, but I don't want to be involved in her entire life when she's way happier than I am anyway. Basically we're on a seesaw. When I raise her up, I go down, but she's yet to raise me up because it's like she throws more weight on me the higher up she goes."

katie-elizabeth,asktransgender,"I am worried the military/government transgender policies are going to be crafted without consulting or considering any actual trans people, leading to disaster. Anyone have insight into this?","The military is set to release an update to policy next month which will pave the path for transgender service members to serve and even transition in the ranks.  I can only assume this will also apply to civil servants of the government.  
  
I am terrified of what they are cooking up behind closed doors.  I have seen bureaucratic disaster after disaster in my experience with the government, and worry about how they are coming up with these new rules and regulations.  
  
I haven't seen a call for the opinions and wishes of actual transgender service members, whether publicly or anonymously.  I haven't seen anything that would suggest that this will be anything but a bunch of gruff generals and 'experts' behind closed doors inflicting their own personal morality on an entire nation.  
  
This is a huge precedent, and they need to get it right.  There is a variety of things they could do to really fuck this up royally, including:  
  
- Requiring SRS for a member to identify as a different gender, regardless of HRT.  
  
- Requiring excessive (1 year+) counseling with inept military counselors prior to transitioning.  
  
- Requiring the member begin wearing uniforms of the opposite sex on day one of HRT or something else absurd.  
  
- Providing no consideration, compensation, or time off for any possibility needed surgeries to include FFS and SRS.

I don't need a ""Am I trans?"" topic to know I have been a girl in a guy's body all my life.  The only question is if I will have the opportunity (and bravery) to transition, or will have to continue to endure severe dysphoria the rest of my career."

Simplicity60,asktransgender,Facial feminization surgery with Dr. Chettawut. ($$$ price $$$),"I attempted to do an Internet search on a number of doctors in Thailand that offer facial feminization surgery. I  assumed it would be easy to use the Internet to shop around! I was quite mistaken. I am interested in the price these doctors charge for Brow dossing or forehead contouring. 

The only price on this procedure for Dr. Chettawut, I could find was from 2014. The only way I was able to get a quote from the doctor was to pay for a consult and go to his clinic.  The reason I was interested in Dr. Chettawut was for many years he was viewed as a low cost alternative to Dr. Suporn, so I was surprised or shocked at the price that I was given. See below price quote:


Thank you so much for visiting our surgery center today.

As discussed during your consultation with Dr. Chettawut, he recommends you forehead/brow ridge bone contouring + brow lift which costs 320,000 THB.


This really sounds quite high. With all other associated expenses such as pre operative tests and hotel costs,  the total cost will be more than 12,000 us dollars!

Well, here's a catch. I came out already, to one person. There was a two page, long, hopefully-kinda-witty letter and everything, me and the Parental Figure said we'd talk about it further on a less busy day and I was really hopeful it'd be the first step forward to getting some transitioning on. She was very supportive and everything! Promised me she'd love me no matter what path I took in life, just wanted me to be comfortable with myself...

Problem. She's acting like she forgot, straight up. Before, she'd avoided using my birthname (even though she hadn't quite committed to using my new one), dodged calling me a boy (when company permitted), etc. And by now, I don't know if it was something I said, but it feels like she gave up or something, because I'm back to square one.

TheLonelySamurai,asktransgender,"Trans women, what are your thoughts on trans attracted men? (An article and following discussion in the post.)","So, I'd love to talk about this. This discussion is prompted by [this article](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/i-love-trannies-boxer-yusaf-mack-fights-for-his-attraction-to-trans-women) I read recently. My girlfriend and I read it together (we both begged off the last bits because it became unwieldy, overly long and superfluous), and then as we often do with trans issues, we had a discussion about it together.

She got so frustrated by the article she actually started crying before we even got to discuss our thoughts on it. Of course then it became more about comforting my distraught girlfriend at that point, but I'll try and explain a bit of her misgivings here, by typing up what she says as usual!

""I feel like whenever we discuss being attracted to trans women, it's all about the fucking dick. Am I so wrong, even as a non-op person, to hate this? There is a place for non-op people in our community, don't get me wrong. I'm non-op, and you're non-op, and obviously there are some others like us with limited or no genital dysphoria, but I still just get *so angry* whenever an article about being attracted to trans women gets put out. I feel like instead of pushing the line that trans women are just women like any other, these articles highlight the ""difference"", and it's a difference so many trans women don't have, don't want, will never use, all of that. Why do I need to bear the brunt of these trans attracted men fetishizing an exploitative and untrue picture of trans women painted by media aimed at cis men? Why is there never an article that elaborates that many trans women have estrogen-shrunk, tiny, flaccid penises, and maybe an orchi? Why is is being attracted to the porno-version the only acceptable 'trans attraction', when it's almost laughably unrealistic? Instead of coddling these men why aren't we getting to speak up about how unreal most of these fantasies are?

And not to sound mean--and yeah I'm totally pulling out my feisty Latina PoC card right now because I'm about to  talk about homophobia in communities of colour--but I don't want a guy like Yusaf being the poster child for being attracted to trans women. He's showing the exact same homophobia I noticed in my community growing up. It's hard to explain it because it's more of a 'you'll know it when you see it' thing, but there's a sort of culturally accepted homophobia prevalent in Latino and Black communities. That whole line about ""I couldn't do that to my kids"", I think he *does* have an attraction to men, and yet this article is pushing the line that he's straight. As transphobic as his manager is, I also think his manager is right about him not being 'free'. I don't want a man who self proclaimed himself as the 'whoremonger' representing attraction to my people. He's a liar who just happens to be attracted to ""trannies"". Sorry I'm not jumping for joy.

When are we going to make the conversation about trans women less about the genitals, and more importantly, the false image of the hypersexualized, fully functional vers/top trans woman from porn? I feel like any discussion of trans attraction right now where the guy has to assert ""yeah, and I like dick"" is a failure to accurately represent the reality of trans attraction. There's no nuance, and no room for anyone but the very few trans women who live up to this porn stereotype. That's why I get so frustrated. Not even I live up to this porn streotype because I'm not willing to fuck cis guys in the ass, so I'm not worth shit to most trans attracted men. Where is the conversation about ladies like me? Or like Allie? (Note: Allie is a friend of ours who is post-op.) Where's the conversations for the girls who are poor and can't get surgery, but dysphoric? It's not as simple as ""oh I just like girls with penises"", they're *expecting* things of those penises,s things many trans women can't provide, and I think framing the national discussion about attraction to trans women by using this massively small demographic of us (non-op, straight or bi, non-genital dysphoric, and fully functional) is just so disingenuous.""

Anybody have any thoughts? What are your views on this slowly-emerging national discussion? Do you feel it's being handled appropriately, or like my girlfriend, do you feeling it's discussing a porn stereotype and not you as a real trans woman?"

Older_Wiser2,asktransgender,MtF: A question about hair and hair cuts .....,"So - I've decided to start letting my hair grow out .... over the last few years I've had very short hair, close cropped on the side and short on the top ... a typical male haircut.

But - if I want long hair there needs to be a starting point and this is it .... My question is this - I've been about six weeks since my last haircut .... I'm not sure if I should just skip haircuts for the next few months and then get a minor trim / dead ends cut off, etc. or if I should go now ....

I've decided, sort of, to just tell the stylist (this is a high end hair salon / spa type place) that I want a more feminine cut and maybe she'll know what to do. But - with it so short now I'm not sure if there's anything with making it more feminine she could do.... and thus my question - any stylists here who can advise me on what to say, what kind of cut to get as I let it grow??? And this will be a big deal as I'll be ""outing"" myself with my stylist .... I did out myself a few weeks ago at the same spa when I went in to get my brows waxed. I've done this a few times and she always does a good job trimming them but never goes far enough - when I first started she said that if she went any further they'd look ""too feminine"" and I just let it go as I wasn't ready to say anything.... but the last time I did and told her I was transgender .... she smiled and said, ""ok - I got it now"" and did an amazing job shaping them - much more feminine now....

Any advice on how I should proceed with a haircut? Or maybe no haircut right now???   ~Joelle"
NowIcansaywhatIthink,asktransgender,Estradiol shots - where to get them?,"My doctor at the VA said I'm ready for estrogen, they ""have"" shots, pills and patches. ""Have"" because I requested shots and she says that the VA does not have any at all in storage and does not know when they will be getting more. Apparently the VA will not pay for the shots outside of the actual Hospital so I would have to pay full price if that's the method I want to go. So I'm trying to figure out where to get them cheaply, if there is a pharmacy plan that I can join to be able to make it cheaper or stuff of that nature.

I believe she said that she can give me 3 months at a time, about how much am I looking at price wise?

OrangeLaceChair,asktransgender,A good day.,"Not really a question as such, but I'll put one at the end of this. It's just that this is the main place I post, so I figured I'd write it here.

Today I went to a birthday party, lots of kids everywhere. A couple of friends have recently had kids, aged between six months and four years.

For the day I got to give them a break from being parents, and take on the duties myself. Feedings, cleanings, settling for naps, going to the park, all those parenting things that parents do.

I really haven't had a chance to do that in the last decade or so, since my ex vanished with our kids. It was just nice to get into the grove of being a parent again, even though it was just for a day. In a way it made me feel human again. I guess my strong maternal instinct is to blame for that.

So a question, probably aimed more toward those who are in a similar situation to me, what little life moments have made you feel good and ""whole"" again?"

[deleted],asktransgender,Russian-speaking trans/nonbinary people: How do you refer to yourself in Russian?,"So, I recently posted a thing, basically [how Russian outed me in front of my parents](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4ewo4q/so_this_is_what_it_feels_like_to_accidentally_out/d24f2jh). As stated in the linked post, I use male grammar with my friends, and a combination of feminine and a formal-ish neutral in front of my parents; thinking about this got me curious about how other Russian-speaking gender-variant people refer to themselves in Russian. For example, do you still refer to yourself as the sex you were assigned at birth for stealth, or do you refer to yourself as your gender? If you are neither male nor female in any way or form, do you refer to yourself with masculine conjugations, or do you use something else? (Most Russian nonbinaries I knew referred to themselves as ""он"" (masculine pronoun and accompanying conjugations/declensions), as that aligned with both ""оно"" (the neuter pronoun) in most declensions and ""человек"" (a 2nd declension masculine noun meaning ""person""), their preferred way of referring to themselves. I did also know of some that advocated for ""они"" (the plural pronoun and accompanying conjugations/declensions) instead, as a parallel to the English ""singluar they/them"".)  
I'd also be interested to hear about how people go about referring to themselves in other languages. I have heard from Spanish friends about the replacement of *-o*, *-a*, or *-e* with *x*, *æ*, or *@* for gender neutrality, for instance."
boyshidinginestrogen,asktransgender,"Please help me. Please, please help me with these last few weeks.","It's the whiny son of a bitch formerly known as /u/reddon666. People who want to continue arguments they didn't win to the left, please.

My life is possibly better than when I deleted that reddit account a couple months ago to go stealth, but I'm back on a throwaway because I have more things to complain about, yay! I'm DIYing -- yes, FTM, and in a country where it's functionally impossible -- because I eventually got my parents to agree there is no viable alternative. Finding the right websites helped.

Glaring problem: FTM DIY in a country where it is functionally impossible is, as one may have guessed, a slightly complicated process. After wasting literally months in pressuring the people who raised me to ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE WEBSITES I AM SHOVING IN THEIR FACE, we are now finally in the process of buying bitcoin and getting verified for it. This is taking a long time. Buying T after that will take a long time. Everything is delayed. Forever. If just one single aspect of my life was in my favour, I could have done this over half a goddamn year ago but noooo. And my 18th is in early August and it's fucking late April and I'm killing myself on my 18th birthday if I'm not on T by then, which has been arranged as certain for years now, so this is a really, really hard race against the clock because everyone had to delay everything SO FUCKING LATE that even the thing that might send me to prison for 25 years if I do it wrong might not be here on time!

So I'm now in the home stretch. Turns out the home stretch sucks too. I'm back in the level of dysphoria where I can't even listen to music because I realize my voice doesn't sound like that and decide slitting my wrists would be more fun. (Other, related sticking point: All my friends are starting bands. A lot of these friends are trans too, but not quite as...insanely dysphoric. I can't have any recordings of my voice as it exists right now, so I can't start a band until my singing voice is not a horrible mess, YOU KNOW, FOR LIKE THREE MORE YEARS MAYBE?! IF I'M EVEN IN THIS CITY IN THREE YEARS I'VE FAILED MORE THAN I COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE)

And after the fucking weeks...maybe months go by, I'll have more of that. More waiting. Forever. More reminders every day that I fucked up, that my parents fucked up, that the system failed me. I pass, hell, I pass vocally, but I look 12 and living as a 12 year old boy when you're 17 fucks with your head. All my friends are like 14. I can't realize I'm in my late teens and not my early ones no matter what I do, hell, the first time I tried writing this sentence I wrote early where I was supposed to write late. My adolescence was quite genuinely stolen from me. It's a problem. Most people don't fight the same fight at 14 and 17. Most people are given the opportunity to change and evolve as a person. I wasn't.

I used to, when I thought I'd be able to start T, spend all my time excited beyond measure. I was finally getting what I needed. I could finally start my life, hit the play button after sleeping in pause for half a decade. Now I'm just broken. This is the most important thing to ever happen to me, and it will always be that way -- after going through every last circle of hell, every single important life stage could happen on the same day and it would pale in comparison to spending almost a third of my life trying to get T and finally fucking getting it before the literal deadline. But I can't be happy about it anymore. I can't look forward to the future. I hoped about it too many times and it got beaten out of me. I just have to hope I won't have to kill myself.

I have more months to go before I'm me. I might start it on August 7th and just squeak in by that much. But I'd still be a girl on August 8th.

How does one deal with finally getting the opportunity to start their life and then not being able to start it yet?"

InteractiveFailure,asktransgender,Completely gender-confused.,"I also posted this on r/MtF

-----

Ever since 10-13 years of age I've been toying with the idea of belonging to the other gender. These thoughts have developed/matured from simple curiosity to actual consideration and I'm getting to the point where I simply don't know what I think, and I can't define myself one way or the other.

""What's it like being a girl?""  
""What if I was a girl?""  
""Am I a guy?""  
""I am a girl.""  
""But I'm comfortable with being male.""  
""I still want people to refer to me as a she.""

I'm currently halfway to 21, so that's about half of my life condensed into 6 phrases, sorry if it seems overly simplified.

This causes problems with my anxiety, especially because my online identity is female as I find that *FAR* more comfortable than male for some reason. When asked ""Are you really a girl?"" I avoid the question by telling the person to pick either gender because ""I don't care either way"" or ""it doesn't matter.""  
*(Which is true! I'm comfortable with being male, and my body. But I also strongly identify as female, and would prefer to use that instead.)*

In the end, when people choose female and the friendship becomes more 'permanent,' coming clean from the fact becomes exceedingly tough, and it often limits my interactions, like not being able to speak on voice or having to think about my responses/topics.

And in real life, I don't allow the people I have my online contact details, like Steam or Skype, so I don't have to explain why I use a female name (literally), and why everybody refer to me as a female. Or having to tell them to refer to me as female when they know I'm male.

unsurestressedperson,asktransgender,Can someone please help me figure things out?,"Hello all. I'll get right to the point. Recently I've felt more distressed about my gender identity. There are some bullet points about myself that I've been mulling over, trying to figure out who I am and how to maximize my happiness and minimize my regrets. I'll list them here. For reference, I've just had my 21st birthday recently, and as far as I can tell I'm currently male and exclusively attracted to women.

* I remember a time before puberty talking with my grandmother and simply not understanding the concept of transgender people. She was of the opinion that ""some men ought to have been born women"", so it's not like she was the one imposing that view on me.
* The earliest I can remember fantasizing about being female was in middle school, and these fantasies were sexually charged from what I can remember. As far as I can tell these kinds of fantasies are rather normal in pubescent boys.
* I've had an almost morbid curiosity of people who undergo transition. I've watched an SRS surgery once. Of course I likened this interest to any interest in ""the strange"".
* I'm a member of a transformation (primarily TG) game fetish website and have actually contributed my own content. I only joined this site after reluctantly admitting to myself that yes, I was turned on by the thought of guys becoming girls. A significant number of the members on this site identify as trans, but I've always thought it was ""just a fetish"" in my case.
* I know a few friends online who have come out as trans and my gut feeling was jealousy.
* Along the lines of jealousy, I'm completely envious of the way women look, behave, sound, etc. That's reached a head in the past week or so which is the reason I'm making this post.
* More and more recently I'm staring in the mirror wishing I looked more feminine. For a while now I've disliked how masculine my chin and nose appear.
* I've been practicing a female voice on and off for a few years now. I wanted to get it good enough to the point where I could play online games and pass as a cis female.
* Along the lines of online games, a trans friend of mine offered to let me play an MMORPG with her friends where I could safely experiment with socially presenting as female. I enjoyed the experience.
* Whenever I think about hormones, I become afraid that I won't look feminine enough or people wont accept me.
* I have a bit of anxiety and depression which caused me to withdraw from this semester of school (university), and while I can't truthfully say what was causing it, dysphoria wouldn't be my first guess.
* ""Dysphoria"" is not something that is weighing on my all the time, or consistent at all. Last night I was really upset at the thought that I'm 21 and likely wouldn't develop womanly hips if I started hormones, but this morning it felt less like it mattered. I put dysphoria in quotes because I'm really not sure that's what I'm feeling.
* I've never had a girlfriend, had sex, or even (past preschool) had any close irl friends who were girls. Conversely online I have a few close girl friends. One of my biggest doubts is that, because of my lack of contact with girls, I developed an obsession with being one.
* I don't feel like ""a woman trapped in a man's body"". I don't have any super early memories of me wishing I was a girl.

I'm sorry for the lengthy post but I wanted to include as much relevant information as possible. I've been comparing my experiences with others on this sub or elsewhere online and it's driving me crazy. I would really love and appreciate someone else's insight."
MissDaisy9001,asktransgender,How much harm could Cruz potential do if elected?,"He's very anti-trans. He says that it's better to 'inflict' trans girls, who he called boys, on the teachers rather than girls. He perpetuates all the harmful myths about us, and supports laws that deny is rights. 

And will the president themselves may not have the most part in the world. Given the chance to potential eject a new justice as the Republican Senate refused to allow Obama to, doing so openly, even before he said anything about who he'd elect. This would give Cruz the chance to pick a transphobic justice, as he likely would. And it would give the Republican party control of all the branches. 

Now I should clarify that in terms of a lot of things I have no problem with conservatives, but when it comes to the recent hate the party has been putting out. And as well their refusal to accept climate change is real, which puts pressure on the entire planet. I just can't be happy with the thought of the Republican party having full control. It truly scares me. And especially if Cruz is at the helm. Which given his current scheme of ignoring the populate vote, and trying to get the delegates who are free if 'no clear' frontrunner is determined (not that the Democratic system is any more Democratic, it's not), he might be. 

So are we truly in a dire situation, or would there still be hope even if Cruz were elected. "
isleepinahammock,asktransgender,"Purely hypothetically, what do trans guys and other AFAB folks feel about being a surrogate parent for an mtf - cis guy couple?","Ok. First of all let me emphatically say this is purely, entirely hypothetical. I'm not requesting anything. My boyfriend and I are a long way away from being ready for kids. I'm just thinking hypothetically about the future.

So here's what I'm mulling. I'm in a relationship with a cis guy. We're several years away from being ready for kids, but we're pretty serious about our relationship and kids are definitely a strong possibility in the future. We've talked about it before, and we're both comfortable with the idea that it will likely involve surrogacy. My dream would be for a uterus transplant and to carry my own child, but realistically that's probably not going to happen soon enough for us.

So, what's involved in surrogacy? Well obviously you have to find someone willing and able to take on this great effort. Some couples find friends who are willing. Some couples use an agency. Etc.

Now, I have a lot of connections to the trans community. One thought I've had is, ""instead of giving money to a for-profit surrogacy agency, maybe we could find someone in the trans community instead?""

I know this is probably a long shot. I know all to well the dysphoria associated with parts and reproduction can be. I felt that pain so much that I went through SRS to ameliorate it. Still, I know there are plenty of nonbinary AFAB folks, as well as many who don't have that kind of dysphoria. There certainly have been plenty of instances of trans men carrying children. Something I'm considering, maybe a few years from now, when the time comes, instead of going to an agency, try to find someone through the community? Maybe offer room and board for a year, medical costs, plus a hefty payment to help with transition costs like top surgery, or education expenses? I don't know. 

So mainly I'm asking any assigned female at birth people here. What is your perspective on this? Does the very idea make you recoil in horror? Or do you think a few years down the road this is something we should explore? Again, please don't think of this as any kind of request or solicitation. I'm talking purely hypothetically that something I might try several years from now.

What are your thoughts?"
ditch_the_frame,asktransgender,What to do when you're afraid to make a therapist appointment? (or taking the next step in general),"EDIT: 
I FUCKING DID IT! I copy paste the mail and pressed sent. Man I feel weird now. 
_____
Hey asktg, I’m an AMAB genderqueer/fluid/questioning human being. 

I’m currently at the point of seeking professional help to deal with my gender problems. But I’m stuck at e-mailing, the therapist I’ve chosen, for an appointment. 

I’m stuck because every time I take new steps towards finding out who I am, my dysphoric (and mainly euphoric) feelings switch off and I enter this weird genderless void kinda thing, not feeling like any gender, just feeling lost. It’s not like my trans* feelings are gone, it’s just that I can’t connect with them. 

I think this happens when things are starting to become too ‘real’, it’s easier to be all happy and girly on your own, but when you gotta step out of your own little world it’s very uncomfortable.  

When I switch to this gender ‘void’ I prefer not to talk about my issues, just trying to forget about them to not feel awkward. Even if I’d manage to make an appointment, then I’m probably unable to actually talk about my problems because of this blocking mechanism. 

How the hell am I supposed to find help if ‘finding help’ itself is part of the problem? I’m afraid I’ll be stuck in genderlimbo forever. 

 TL:DR; Can’t make myself to see a therapist because trans* feelings disappear whenever things tend to get ‘real’.

queerandconfused,asktransgender,What is dysphoria?,"Maybe this is a dumb question, but what *is* dysphoria?

Whenever I hear people talk about dysphoria in the context of gender/bodies it always seems to be a **severe** and **profound** dissatisfaction, restlessness, and uncomfortable feeling when they see themselves or interact with those parts of their body. Is that what it is?

If my mental image of myself (e.g. my dream self, if I ever draw myself, etc) has a flat, masculine chest as opposed to my natural feminine chest, is that dysphoria? I'm not overwhelmingly uncomfortable when I see myself nude in the mirror, but my chest to me looks like something added on in a weird afterthought even though it's totally normal. I feel awkward when people point out my breasts or if I'm wearing a shirt that emphasizes them (i.e. tight or low-cut) but I've just always chalked that up to being a prude/conservative dresser. I wear a high-impact sports bra to flatten my chest or a binder most days as I like how my clothes fit better and seeing a flatter chest in the mirror (and also rubbing my hands up and down my flat torso like a weirdo lolol).

Obviously you guys/gals are not me and tell me what I'm feeling, but would these feelings be associated with dysphoria? Or is this just having poor self-image in terms of my chest? It's not overwhelming, it's just ""off"".

GenkiFersken,asktransgender,Rant and advice on public misgendering?,"Last weekend was special for me, I bought my first dress. I went to the local trans group wearing my lovely new dress, flowery boots, tights and I did my makeup good (I think.) and I had my cute crossover bag. I felt great.

After the group I was invited for an evening out in the city and was feeling good so took the opportunity and we went to a quiet café first. 

There was a little confusion in the queue and I wasn't asked what I wanted until I was asked to pay for a drink that wasn't mine.

The female barista then whispered to the male barista ""you didn't get that guys order"" and I just felt awful. I still do. My hair was nice. I was dressed overt femme, I just want to explode. I didn't and my friend handled it very well and pronouned me right to them, but I feel deflated.

Advice on what to do in a situation like this? 

Sorry I just want to shout at the world right now. Lots piled up on me, cards about to come crashing I think."
Lucy221223,asktransgender,Freezing Sperm?,"Hi everyone. I just came out to myself a month ago. I've been to a gender therapist, began a weight loss routine and came out to my S.O. and best friend. Before I start HRT, I want to freeze my sperm, because having biological children one day is important to me and E affects fertility. I was wondering if anyone here has done this and what their experiences with it were like? Thanks.  "
throwaway1231243123,asktransgender,Terribly confused and not sure of what to do. Would really like some help.,"Hello,

I gotta get this off my chest... 

I'm a long-time lurker of this section and ever since I've been reading it (about half a year now), I feel like this issue I've had for years is eating away at me now.

I'm a guy and I've had the desire to be a girl since I was maybe 12ish. I'm in my early twenties now and the feeling never went away, it just kind of stayed there. Once I started reading about transgender topics and whatnot, I freaked out a bit and now I'm not sure what's going on.

Unlike many stories I've heard, **I have absolutely no dysphoria**. When I look in the mirror, I see a rather handsome male and I'm actually quite confident in a lot of my male attributes. I've always liked looking male, dressing in suits, having a beard etc. 

The problem is I have this thorn in my side so-to-speak; this immensely strong desire to be the other gender that just wont quit. I day-dream, think and fantasize about it often. I can't describe it, I just feel like I want to be a woman and I don't know why. It just kind of, feels like who I am and no one in my life seems to understand it.

The more I venture into it, the more I like it. I started cross-dressing a few months back and now I'm doing that more and more as well privately. I used to be able to handle this feeling with 'self-love', but that doesn't work anymore.

The one issue I have with this subreddit though, is that I see so many people respond with stuff like ""you have to do something now or else..."" or ""it will only get worse."" That worries me quite a bit. It seems that so many people have agendas like that. It can't be so black and white, can it?

Sorry. I have many problems with anxiety and I really just don't know how to handle all of this. My parents know and are somewhat supportive, but it's more of a ""that's fine"" attitude. I'm not sure where to turn really. I even dropped out of college because these feelings got so strong. I consulted a gender therapist, but I left after being told that they had never had a client with no dysphoria.

I mean, considering I have no physical dysphoria, can I really be trans? I've read all of the literature out there and I just can't seem to find an answer. If I am, will it ruin my life as far as school, work, relationships etc.?

I apologize for the long post/vent. Thanks in advance for any help."
Lawful_Cupcake,asktransgender,(Mega Rant) I am annoyed as hell by people who think that they have a right to know what's in my underwear.,"OH. MY. FUCKING. GOD.
I seriously have to explain that it's not ok to ask about the state of my genitals. I seriously am being told that ""You should just get used to it; it's part of the situation you're in, and people who aren't into that want to make sure they're not wasting their time.""
Context: Laci Green on Youtube(Fantastic, btw, you should definitely watch MTV Braless and Sex+) is currently doing a series of videos on dating apps, her experiences, and her tips for having a more successful profile. I mentioned in the comments(Yes this is a youtube comment section, but her audience is generally open minded and mature) that on my dating profile, I listed that I was transgender, and 90% of the messages I got were basically asking me if I still had a dick.

I am being argued with by some lackwit, who's telling me that it's their right to know in a sexual situation, I just need to get used to these questions, and people may not be into it and just don't want to waste their time.

1. We are NOT in a sexual situation. Messaging me does not guarantee that we will engage in sexual activity. It means that we are going to have a conversation, get to know each other a bit better, and if we like each other, move on to the part where we hang out with a chance that we will be boning. When it gets to the point that we are considering sexual activity, then it falls upon me to inform them of my genitalia. Not before, unless I feel that that information is pertinent or required.

2. Nobody is asked on a regular basis about what genitals they have or don't have, and/or how functional they are, except for transgender and intersex people. People who consider themselves nonbinary would fall into this category for me, and if I left anyone out, I apologize. But I digress. NO other groups are asked this question IMMEDIATELY at the beginning of dating. No girl walks up to a dude and says, ""Hey, what's your latest sperm count? I need to know how potent you are."" No gay man walks up to a dude and says ""How dilated can your anus be?"" You just DON'T do that, until it becomes a relevant topic. Wanting to fist that dude in the back door compartment? Better communicate and make sure that he can accommodate you. Want to make sure Romeo has enough spunk to fill your trunk? Maybe you'd better ask that after you've been in a relationship for a while and are ready to raise a kid, with or without him? Want to know if I have a pantysnake? Perhaps you should let me divulge this particular information about my crotch to you before we engage in sex.

3. I am definitely not saying that every hetero guy has to be into me. It is heterosexual to have sex with me, but not every guy is into transwomen, and that's totally fine. Everyone has their sexual preferences. Some guys don't like skinny gals and like the chubby girls, Some gals prefer that dude who's skinny as a rail, some prefer bears. Some people don't find black people attractive. Some people don't find white people attractive. These are ok to have. These are sexual preferences. It's like ice cream. You may like strawberry, but really haven't found a rocky road that you like. This is fine. I state that I am transgender on my dating profile, MtF. A possible permutation of that is that yes, maybe I still have a growth on my crotch that I've not been able to afford the surgery to fix. If you weren't interested in that possibility in any way, why would you message me in the first place? I understand wanting to know what you're getting into, I understand that you think that it's important to know, but frankly, until such a time as I decide to tell you, it's none of your fucking business what I'm packin'.

4. By asking me that question up front, all you are doing is fixating on a part of my body that I am not comfortable with. You are saying that who I am as a person doesn't matter, what matters is what's in my jeans. We need to discuss this, because it's the most important thing about you to me, and then we can get on to that other stuff, like what you do for fun, and seeing a movie. You are equating me to a sex toy, and are checking the box to see if it has the features you find appealing. That is seriously not ok to do to ANYONE, trans, cis, intersex, asexual, ANYONE. AAAAANNNNNYYYYYOOOOONNNNNEEEEE. Choosing whether or not to date me based on my junk is disgusting, crude, and just completely immature. It's like me going out, seeing which guy has the biggest python in his boxers, and choosing who to date based on that. If it's a hookup, a one nighter, totally be superficial and judge me on my looks. But you let me tell you about my junk when the time comes. And if we're dating, meaning going out or hanging out two or more times, then I will tell you my business when it needs to be said, and not a moment before. Until then, you can consider me having a quantum crotch: it is at once a penis, a vagina, both, or neither."

BackupUte,asktransgender,"Why do I fall into this same cycle, like clockwork?","I'm 19 years old and it's been the same cycle since I was 14. It goes something like this:  

1. Feel fine, think about gender issues very rarely, focused on something else in my life. Lasts **1-3 months**.  

2. Start thinking about my gender expression. Decide to maybe move more towards the feminine side of things. Still feel like a man. Decide I'm just a guy comfortable with expressing himself. Lasts **1-3 weeks**.  

3. Decide I want to be as androgynous as possible. Start worrying about my male features, but still feel OK as a guy. Lasts about **1 month.**  

4. Come to the conclusion I'm transgender, but reject the idea of transitioning medically and decide to just express myself as I please. Lasts for **maybe a week.**  

5. I start feeling desperate and start suffering from dysphoria. Get depressed and anxious. Suddenly feel like I desperately want to transition and stop being further masculinized. Can't think about anything else. Feel like my life is a pile of ruined shit. Lasts for about **1 month**.  

6. Suddenly I feel fine again. **Repeat process**.  

This endless cycle is driving me up the fucking wall, I'm so tired. Why do I do this? "
DoomedMorale,asktransgender,What to do when I'm not sure of somebody's gender?,"I work at a very lgbt friendly and sex positive sex shop. We have a number of customers who come in that are in varying  states of transition. For example sometimes I'm unsure if someone is just starting to transition, or are a more feminine leaning guy, masculine leaning woman, androgynous, etc.

My biggest worry is calling them by the wrong label, when saying sir, miss, ma'am, things like that. I try to stay gender neutral because of it. I also don't feel comfortable asking because I don't want to draw attention to it.

Basically I would like advice as to how to best go about things without making things hard on anyone, especially in the environment of a sex shop. Right now I figure it's better to keep my mouth shut if I'm unsure."
SculptingGirl,asktransgender,Where will fat get redistributed too?,"I know this is a YMMV question, but generally where do trans women get fat redistributed too? I have big thighs and 36-37 hips (my hips are wider then my rib cage, and the same or an inch out of my shoulders) so does this mean my thighes and hips should get even fatter? Please make a list where I will see fat go and on average how long it takes to see fat redistribution results."
AbitC0nfused,asktransgender,How do I know if I am trans or not? This has been on mind like every day for the past couple weeks,"How do I know if I am trans or not? I am living as a 25 year old male but have for much of my life (i don't remember when exactly but probably at least since some years before puberty) felt uncomfortable with many aspects of masculinity and maleness and identified with many feminine things although growing up being raised male I learned to keep this to myself or be considered a (fill in blank with interchangeable pejorative). But even in stuff like video games, when there was the option to play a female character, I always did. The trouble is that there also certain aspects of being ""male"" that don't bother me as much despite wondering if I might in fact be better suited in a female body. For example I like my birth name which is probably odd but I feel it suits me and can't imagine another name. Also I don't really feel like my genitals are wrong for me so there's that too. This coupled with the facts that it never occurred to me that transitioning could even be a possibility until my early twenties and that I aside from general discomfort and preferring to have a female body, I've never experienced any sort of life or death urgency over my situation where continuing to live life would not be an option if I  couldn't transition. On top of this I would really only want to transition I feel like if I had a very, very high chance of passing successfully. So basically I'm asking am I trans is this valid? Should transition and undergo get? Or am I a confused somewhat nonbinary dude?"
fullmetalhusky,asktransgender,Just want some opinions/other ideas on my decision on dating while transitioning,"Heya all, I just want to have some people look at what I'm saying and maybe give me there perspective on this, sorry if this gets ranty or pitty party

So by next month I should be on HRT which has me super excited and all to finally start changing to how I see myself. I currently see myself as a transgender woman who is into other women, which is kind of hard because of how I still look like a guy, so only Bi-sexuals really would be possibly wanting to date me. So my figuring is that hey, just wait till you have transitioned a bit.

The thing with me is I'm a huge romantic and I really just don't feel right or whole when I'm not in a relationship and honestly can't be truly happy. So obviously that conflicts with my current plan of stay single until you have at least started to appear more female.

So I'm guess I want some people's experiences on if they found a relationship during early transitioning stages, how it went, if it is worth it and stuff like that as well as just general opinions on if it is better to wait till I'm more feminen based on the fact that I'm a lesbian and other lesbians will be more attracted to me.

Thanks for the help in advance!"
Sheepywashere,asktransgender,How did you accept yourself,"I'm scared shirtless. I just finally realized I am transgender at 26. I am scared of losing my job. I'm scared what my co workers will think, they currently love me as a male they actually give me near god like respect at my job currently. I am paid fairly well for the work I do. I'm scared Ill be uglier as a female than I am as a male. I have a lot of people compliment my looks on a daily basis. Stuff like ""oh you have beautiful eyes"" and ""Oh you're a heartthrob"" and ""you're so charming""
I hate how I look though. I am loved as I am now. I am also not overly dysphoric about having a male physique nor does my ""role in society as a male"" particularly bother me. I just wanted to be a girl ever since I was a child.

deercaptain,asktransgender,"I'm out on social media and friends, but not to my family. Facebook help?","Slight backstory about myself:
I am dfab and currently identify as agender male-presenting, use he/him or they/them pronouns, and use a different name than given to me at birth. I am out to all of my friends, my entire college campus, and online on social media (twitter, instagram, tumblr, etc.) EXCEPT on Facebook due to having family members friended on there.

I am not out to my family at all. They don't know and have no reason to believe that I don't identify as cis or use a different name, pronouns, etc. Recently I have been wanting to come out to them for the sake of my own comfort, but I do not think that I would be accepted at all by my family and I do not feel entirely safe doing so.

I don't use Facebook very often, but I kind of want to maybe get back into it, or at least make a profile for the way I currently identify. Right now it still has my old name and I don't like to use it because it makes me uncomfortable (for obvious reasons), but I am afraid to make a new one in fear that I will pop up in ""suggested friends"" for my family members, or potentially being seen commenting on mutual friend's posts.

This all sounds dumb when I type it out and I have thought of maybe changing my name on Facebook and playing it off as a joke to my family, but that seems a little lame. Ahhhh... "
overgirl,asktransgender,What's a weird moment you had because of your hormones acting up?,"I had a weird experience last night that was probably started by my hormones. I had a dream were I got to paint my nails and dress up. In the dream my dad begrudgingly gave me a cute teddy bear. It almost signified his acceptance of me. I woke up immediately crying my eyes out. I couldn't stop. In reality he doesn't except me remotely. 

Have any of you guys had a crazy emotional moment that in retrospect seemed a bit odd?"
haventa,asktransgender,"This is very new to me, and I'm confused. [Maybe NSFW?]","Sorry if I come out as a mess. Frankly, I've been so confused and worried as of late that I can't keep my thoughts straight.

Recently, I've been considering the idea that I'm transgendered. I'm 15, male (maybe not anymore), straight (maybe not anymore as well), and have only just started getting information on all this. In the past couple of days, give or take, I've been clambering in what could only be described as a slippery slope. I'm finding this awkward, so please try to bear with me.

I'll start from early childhood. When I was young, I can recall things that I've read here as being signs of dysphoria and similarities between some of you all. As some examples, I was a very emotional child, and I didn't do the same stuff as the other kids my age. Sport never appealed to me and still doesn't, and neither does partying or any of that. Instead, I enjoyed going to have high tea with my mum. I also recall questioning to myself my genitals, and wondering if I was supposed to be a girl. Just small things like that.

Fast forward. As a teenager I find that I cry very seldom. I'm outgoing, but reserved at the same time. Given that my sad-scale seemed off, I explored the idea that I might have some degree of psychopathy, but discounted that when I realized that I *do* feel emotion quite readily, I just don't show it much. I had crushes on girls, just like normal, but I avert myself from physical contact with people. No hugging or touching. I also get annoyed if I have to stand too close to people, even though everyone else is completely fine with it.

Someone said something in another thread about how they often practiced escapism by playing video games for hours on end, and roleplaying - anything to focus their thoughts away from themselves. I do this. I spent a long time, and still do, roleplaying, though this was mostly as men. A month ago I decided to roleplay as a woman, and something about it clicked. I find this easy to do and it puts me at ease in the process. I knew that I was practicing escapism, but I had no idea why, since my parents are kind and I have nothing really *wrong* in my life.

I'm telling you all this because even though I only have really been affected by these thoughts recently, I've noticed signs that I've seen pointed out in other areas of this forum. The thought of changing genders never put me off back then, but now I feel like I have to do it.

Since I discovered masturbation a few years back, I've been 99% certain that I'm straight, albeit a bit out-there. However, recently I've found that porn just... doesn't really do it for me. It feels weird. Unnatural, even. Instead, I found that imagining having sex with a man - as a woman - I find far more thrilling. With porn, I go for hours and just lose enthusiasm and stop. But just by imagining, it's far better. I'm still attracted to women, but now also men as well? Around that time, it was like a switch flipped in my brain. My outlook's changed. Suddenly I just don't feel... male.

So, these past few days, sometimes I've just sat there and fantasized about being a woman. Not being promiscuous, or doing anything 'sexy'. Just living life as female. But today was different. I couldn't concentrate at all during a two hour lesson, instead just staring at my laptop screen and internally lamenting about how I'm male on the outside. The next lesson, this continued, except I was just so torn that I started feeling ill and had to excuse myself to go to the bathroom to calm myself down. It was so odd.

I was talking to some of my good friends today, and the typical teenage type of question came up, 'how much would someone have to pay you to get a sex change?'. One of my friends said they would never, another said 5 million dollars, and I just thought that I would do it for free. I didn't say that, though.

And now, I'm sitting here worrying. Even though I know I can't pick my gender, I am still worried about which one it will end up being. Is this just a phase? Am I jumping the gun? If every day ends up with me thinking about myself not being *right*, will I end up getting hormone therapy? I feel like I should be a woman. But, I'd want it to be as convincing as possible. Even though I have a small frame, and am already lacking muscle, I feel like my hands and feet look too masculine. I have an adam's apple and I don't want it now. My voice, which is somewhat deep, I used to be proud of. Now I'm finding myself googling how to sound female.

I feel like I'm transgendered. But I have a history of telling myself that I am all these things when it turns out it was just a blip in my life. So, I am confused. Am I transgendered? I need advice."

Sharkwhether,asktransgender,"I came out to my mom, but feel really weird?","So, after a post last night talking about my mom, loving, supportive, trans/gay friendly, all that and seeing people say I shouldn't worry I ended up writing a letter and giving it to her this morning while I had the courage. 

 And I feel like I'm not standing in reality, she acted confused, worried. Asked if I was sure, how I'd never shown signs. But said she loved me and always would, and that this changes nothing.

That's a good reaction overall right? So then why do I feel so hollow and just...nothing, I feel fear, still. What if she's not telling the truth, or changes here mind? Sorry, I hope this is easy to understand. I'm in a weird place I guess.

EDIT: Thank you everyone so much for your replies, I can't even say how much I appreciate the genuine kindness from you all. I'm going to try calming down and just give her space to process it all; it's easy to focus only on my feelings and not really give the shock she must feel any credence. So I'll give her space to sort this new information in her own mind.

EDIT 2: So, with the comments you all have left in mind I gave her a call on her break, and said I was sorry if I was pushy or anything this morning, that I know it's a lot to take in, and told her  loved her and that she was why I was living a happy life right now, when I could be in a much worse palce. And that I hoped, no matter what the future holds, that she would continue being by my side, loving, supporting, and accepting.

And she said, ""Absolutely, I'm your mom, after all."" So...while I still feel weirdly...out of it, almost ashamed, It's nice that she still is saying that, hours later."
SkyeLys,asktransgender,"So I've had a decent start, but I still need help.

I'm not 100% positive if it's something that's allowed to be posted on here, so I'm withholding the link for the time being (message me if you want it).

Basically, the situation at home has further deteriorated, and my timeline has been pushed up to 3-4 weeks from now. I won't have any savings or money, but I need to leave. I explain specifics on the campaign page. I need to get out of here, or I'm gonna be stuck, homeless, hungry and broke in a super conservative, dead end town.

If I meet my goal on that, that's great. I'm not really expecting to, but realistically I figure that's about what I need to seamlessly get up there and established. If it's less than that, it's something, which is more than I have toward this now.

Anyway, in the meantime, I'll be looking for a little throwaway job that can net me a paycheck or two before I leave. That would be even more awesome.

masaiki,asktransgender,Today is my 10th anniversary of having SRS,"Today is my 10th ""neo-birthday"".  Noone celebrate with me and hence I make this post to celebrate the neo-birthday.

It may answer and bring insight to some people who wish to know how will life go on after transition.  Any question from you is welcome.  Any experience sharing is welcome.

Mtf post-op and living in stealth for 10 years.  Start HRT at the age of 25 and had SRS at the age of 28.  Living as woman for 10 years (or over 11 years if count from going full-time).  Willing to share some good and bad in these 10 years as follows :-

1.  Still not yet married.  Only had romance with girls and never had any romance with man before transition.  Have fallen in love with 3 men since transition and all the 3 knew my history.  Having dumped by two and have been with the present bf for 18 months.

2.  Never cooked anything except noddle and eggs before transition and now I am a good cook.

3.  I spend about 20% of my salary in clothes, shoes, make-up, hair and skin care.

4.  I have two 6 Ft. closet which are full of clothes and dress at all the times.  (Before transition a 4 Ft. closet could store all I had).

5.  I have about 15 pairs of shoes at any one time. (Before transition the maximum number of shoes I had at one time was 5).

6.  Before transition I usually spent less than half an hour to finish all the morning routines before going out to work.  When I started transition I usually had to spent near 2 hours in the morning for bath, make-up, dressing, etc. before going out to work.  Now I spent just about a hour on those routines in the morning.  

7.  I have more friends, both female and male.  Most of them are new friends and a few of them are old friends who knew me before transition.

8.  I can feel others, women, men and children are all more friendly and helpful to me.  Always keeps smiling and others will smile at you.

9.  More and more fond of gossip and shopping around with female friends and colleagues.  Having learnt that men are to respect and appreciate.

10.  I had transition in workplace but the experience were horrible.  I quit my job after transition and had a 40% cut in salary in the new job, which had not much increase for the first 3 years.  I caught up with my pre-transition salary 5 years after transition and now my salary is about double the pre-transition one.  (You may said that it is because of the reasons said below)

10.  I have encountered a lot of sexual harassment from men, from blue jokes to being stared straight at breasts (even my subordinates do that), from unwelcome body contact to sexual advances, both in daily life and at work.  But as time goes on I learn to adapt to those harassment and even exploit that for benefits - I would flirt with men in order to seek for help in workplace or earn a drink in the pub.  I would wear more sexist when meeting with clients.  I  had slept with boss to get promotion.

10. Fortunately I had never been actually raped, save as date-raped for twice.  But unfortunately I had been sexual assault for a number of times, from being touched on public transport to attempt raped for twice.

11.  Seldom walks alone in night or drives alone in night now without the accompany of a male friend or colleague.  Even in daylight I try to avoid walking or driving alone in  quiet or secluded place or area. 

12.  Apart from that, life as usual with parents and family.  Need to go to work Monday to Friday and cook for my own and my bf and doing routine housework daily (We are living together for 6 months).  Have travel vacation once or twice a year.  

13.  More and more patient, especially when talking with men or queuing outside public restrooms.  Lol

juliagirl1,asktransgender,Am I maybe not trans?,"So ok. In 7th grade I came out as bi. I had been envious of girls, but also a bit attracted too. People then told me I was lying because I hadn't had a boyfriend yet. Then I believed what they were saying because I was experimenting with my sexuality and I cared so much waht they thought. Then I came out as gay in 8th grade, thinking, hmm maybe I'm just gay, but there was something to it. I really wanted to wear their clothes and live life as a girl. Fast forward through highschool, I crossdressed and a couple friends knew about it. Anyway, I decided to come out as trans at 20, this year. It felt right and now it isn't feeling right. I want to be a woman, but I feel like im doing it for attention, even though I dont think I am. This could be baggage from when I was 13 coming back to haunt me. But the other night i had an awful experience. I dont pass at all and I went into the womens bathroom and the fear that I had made it impossible to pee and i left and went into the mens. Im so ashamed of this and so mad at myself. I literally see no point in living anymore and I don't know what to do. I just want to fit somewhere and be loved for who I am. "

GarmentAxiom,asktransgender,"Looking for guidance/advice in Dayton, Ohio","I'll make a quick rundown of my situation: I'm in the Dayton area, am unable to travel to Columbus or Cincy, and unlikely to be able to afford going to the only psychologist in the area who has any experience with transgender folks due to job/income and the worst employer health insurance via Wal-Mart.

Anyone in the area have any advice? Should I just take the monetary hit for however many sessions it takes to get approved for HRT, or what? I've been 100% sure this is what I want for almost two years, and the wait is...not good for me. I haven't even been able to find any trans folks in my area since I can't attend the monthly area support meeting due to my job.

My life is at a standstill because of it. I'm desperate for srs and ffs and I can't stand seeing myself in the mirror any more. I can barely afford hormones or my endocrinologist. I've only got enough scripts left to last me a month or two max. After that I'm screwed.


Its just too much. I just don't have enough money to transition. I barely have enough to eat. I often go without food to buy hormones or pay for laser let alone have enough to put aside to pay for srs or ffs.


It feels like ill never get the body I was supposed to have. I'll never look in the mirror and see myself staring back. I transitioned too late and fucked up my life pre-transition too much. I have no degree, no recent work history, no savings, no career and no money. 


The hill I have to climb is too big... I fucking tried but its too big and all I want to do now is rest. Im done.

pmags3000,asktransgender,Funeral for Uncle (father's brother). Estranged from parents due their issues with trans child.,"To be clear, it's my parents fault we're estranged, not the child. 

So this is my trans version of ""ask miss manners"".  My parents basically have not talked to me in a year.  A year ago my oldest, who is 10, decided to transition to being male.  My parents, specifically my devout Catholic Dad, basically find our support reprehensible and haven't' talked to us since.  6:30 AM this morning I find out that my favorite uncle died of a heart attack last night.  While they are Catholic, they could care less that my oldest is trans and were very supportive.  (When we told them why we were not at some family functions my aunt said ""That it?  That's what this is all about?"" in disbelief.)

So, now the question.  Do I go to the funeral?  Do I bring my family?  I had just recently started emailing with my dad about finding something to connect with that wasn't a discussion on trans issues or religion.  BUt we haven't actually done anything yet.  I don't want my presence to cause any issues at this funeral, as my uncle was a great guy. So asktransgender, put on your miss manners hats if you will, and give me some recommendations.  

Edit: thanks for all the responses.  I think I'll take the whole family to the viewing and just go on my own to the funeral.  My youngest kid is ADHD and can't sit still, so funerals with him are difficult.  "
AwkwardKid94,asktransgender,Is It Wrong To Not Come Out To Your Kids?,So I tried having this discussion on Facebook so I'll ask here.

Kids talk and I plan to live my life as close to a cis male as I can. Is this wrong?
Genderqueertrans,asktransgender,Someone who also experienced increased moodiness and stress on HRT ( MtF ) and how to improve it if so ?,"a Japanese science show about a month ago explored the topic and indicated that low T can lead to stress and depression in a feed-back cycle (the depression increases the stress, which aggravates the body condition, which can increase the depression which...)

Estrogen therapy is described in some literature as being a diagnostic differentiating those who are transgender from those who CD for sensual or erotic reasons: that those who are not TG will tend to react negatively to the low T through this cycle, or will feel disoriented and disconcerted by the mental and emotional changes, whilst the TG will instead welcome the changes.

I welcome the physical changes but I hate my mood . I hate how I feel ( mellow and softy )

What could this mean? Should I go off of E ? That's so weird cause I love how my body physically responds to it and I have a hard time believing that I would not be really trans just because I hate feeling like a softy and mellow . If only there would be a way I could get my physical changes without having to feel so moody all the time , now that would be heaven!

Someone who experienced this mood swings on HRT as well ? After how much time did it go away and what can you do to improve it ?"

Have any of you changed your mind about transitioning? "
zauraz,asktransgender,I want your thoughts on this.,"I wrote at this reddit several months ago during a time of great confusion in my life. This confusion was based in my gender identity. Finding how i felt at that time can be found in my earlier posts.

I kinda used my desire to be a girl as the cause of my depression and I finally acted upon my feelings and talked with a normal psychiatrist. Resolving my depression felt great and I learned to cope with the constant doubts with the help of this psychiatrist but he kinda put off my wants to talk to a gender therapist as he wanted to focus on the depression and end my doubts.

I accepted my gender quite nicely a bit and did not judge myself as much. I still kinda feel some weird surge when looking at women (not sexual), it kinda tells me that I want to be able to look like them. I still choose only female characters in games, I still kinda feel envy towards women for their bodies and I am still accepting but confused.

I still think nearly constantly to just let it be. To accept being male and live my life without thinking about gender at all, it feels like some kind of stalemate that I live in. I've let my hair grow out and can say that I finally actually like my hair because of the feminine vibe it now gives off.

My body is something I still can't fully accept, my individuality and personality is fully acceptably for me but I find my body ugly and repulsive a lot of the time.

Regarding why I have not done anything more aswell is my desire to one day have children or maybe find someone I love but right now I feel unable to be loved by someone, I still have trust issues and I feel that I am just socially awkward. It feels like i force myself too much in social situations, often with bad results. I've never had a girlfriend or sex in my 17 year old life and this does not really help my doubts. Something in the lines of ""If I would do this I could never get anyone"".

It feels like I am still doubting but now accepting the doubt and not really letting it affect my life. At the same time I often feel that I am just convincing myself for some reason that I am something I aren't. 

I don't really know if I am subconciously suppressing it or if I am just delusional.


Would be glad if anyone could provide similar experiences or tell me something about what you think about this. I know about gender therapists are the best solution probably but right now I don't really have the courage to ask my mother about it again as she and my closest friends are the only ones that knows and in my country its kinda hard to get access to these.

The_Satellite_Mind,asktransgender,Any advice on coming out to my religious family?,"My parents aren't together (haven't been pretty much since I was born), so I've got two families to come out to.  I'm already out to my mom and maternal grandma, which went well.

However, my dad, stepmom, and other siblings are very religious (they're Methodists, in case that's relevant).  I don't know how or if that might influence their reactions, but I'm worried it won't go well.

I've heard them speak negatively in the past about gay and trans people (and I'm both &gt;.&lt;), but I've never had the courage to actually have a conversation with them about it.  I don't know if me being family will make it easier or worse for them.  I could see it going either way.

I should also explain that by ""not going well,"" I don't mean that they would be violent or hateful or anything like that.  Worst case scenario, they don't approve, refuse to use the right name/pronouns, and tell me that I'll have to present male when I visit them.

_Shaana_,asktransgender,Is FFS possible after a previous maxillofacial/jaw surgery?,"Sorry for my bad english.

When I was younger I had to do a maxillo facial surgery because doctors told me that if I didn't do that, I would have had some problems to eat in the future. For exemple, when I shut my mouth, my ""high-teeth"" couldn't naturally be above the lower ones (it was possible, but I had to do it consciously). So, my lower jaw was more in front than the other and I had protruding teeth. 

Now, I have some screws in my mouth that I don't feel, so I must really be cautious/avoid MRI, and even if all my teeth can't touch each other (not a terrible thing since it can't be seen and it don't bother me to eat) my jaws are more ""in place"".

Because of this surgery, is FFS now impossible for me? I'm pre-hormones but I feel that without FFS I will never pass. Maybe it's a dumb question but I can't stop freaking out."

BadgerDoesCare,asktransgender,Could my anxiety disorders have been caused by repressing the female inside me?,"Hello everyone, 

I was born male, but for the last 3 months I've been questioning my identity.

Here is a little background. At age 4-6, I remember being fascinated with my mom and aunt's clothes and jewelry. I even tried to cut the heels from a pair of her boots, so that I could wear them at school. I even asked my mom about how girls are different from boys and why I couldn't be in their group.

In my early teen years, I had this wish I could be a girl for day at least. I would wear my mom's clothes and put on make up, and feel happy looking at the mirror. At the time I was in a boy's only catholic school.

During college, I thought I was a woman in a past life, even to the point of thinking my soul was female.I would wear dresses and shoes from time to time.

After college and until a few years ago, I didn't pursue anything close to being female. Probably because I was in the male dominated field of IT, and that was what was expected from me. However, I would occasionally stare at women and wish I could dress like them. When I joined a gym, I would look at bodies of athletic women as a goal, not men's.

It was during that time that my anxiety escalated to the point that for a whole month I couldn't sleep, eat, stop worrying about the future.

For the last 3 year, I've been buying some female clothes and shoes, but didn't wear them because I had just became a parent. No time for that. All my energy and thoughts were towards my new family.

Early this year, I started to dress up. Little by little, my thoughts were clear, and my anxiety was controlled. There was this moment one early morning that made me whole for the first time. I was wearing my dress and heels while playing on my PS4 around 4AM. I heard my little boy cry in his sleep. After consoling him and putting him in his crib, I don't remember feeling so proud of myself, still wearing the dress and heels.

Now, I can't stop feeling this happy, but at the same time I'm wondering where I fit the transgender spectrum.

A therapist might help, but I don't think I need one, yet.

Thank you for your time."

calisthymia,asktransgender,Hello AskTG! How doomed am I today?,"I have recently seen several suggestion to the effect that if you don't transition by the age X (or some similar milestone) then you are *dooooooomed* (and that's bad). This naturally piqued my interest but alas, I was unable to figure out exactly how doomed I am. So, after taking a selfie today I decided to throw myself at the mercy of the collective wisdom of AskTG:

[imgur.com/a/p96AU](http://imgur.com/a/p96AU)

Based on the selfie (and the pre-transition photo provided for comparison), how doomed do you think I am? Mildly doomed? Totally doomed? Doubly doomed with a side order of Götterdämmerung? Please notice that this isn't a do I/will I pass post, since I find *that* question frankly uninteresting -- I'm only trying to figure out my relative doomedness.

(A somewhat less tongue-in-cheek explanation: I very much like to connect a familiar name to a face, and thus it's always nice when I see some of the regular posters share their photos. I felt particularly positive today and this was my way of saying hi to all of you, with making a minor point about ageism along the side. Have a nice day, everyone!)"

I keep thinking that if I kill myself, I won't have to go through any hardship, and I won't have to make a decision. Either way I'm dead in their eyes, so why make myself go through all this torment for something which i'm not even sure will make me happier. I want to cry **so badly**; I want to feel any emotion at all but my body won't even let me. The feeling is so horrible, every second is sheer fucking agony.

TransgirlInLove,asktransgender,I accidentally went stealth,"So a couple of days ago I left home to get away from my restrictive parents. That same day, I was finally able to start presenting female. It turns out that was the day I went full time. I bought a brand new wardrobe, and with a bit of makeup on my already feminine features (from starting hormones early, natural femininity and the length of time I've been on hormones) I'm able to pass flawlessly. Before that, all I heard was ""sir"", but since then all I've heard was ""ma'am"", ""miss"" and ""ladies"". I got ""ma'am""ed within the first few minutes of full time when I went into a diner, and several times when being addressed that day at the mall. I was told by my friends I got stares from guys, and not odd stared. Like, ""woah, check her out"" stares. I've used the women's bathroom multiple times, and when I had to use one in a restaurant, the waitress directed me over to the women's bathroom. I haven't gotten any weird looks, I blend in quite well. I even got ""ma'am""ed at the airport. By a female TSA agent who felt me up as is protocol. And I've talked to at least ten people who have referred to me as a female, including one dude who was telling his kid ""Look sweetie, that lady has a Pikachu!"" (It was a doll I bought cuz I'm a fan).

So yeah, I accidentally went stealth. I've got a wonderful loving boyfriend of over a year, and life is going amazingly for me. I moved from New York to Georgia yesterday, and it's permanent. I passed as female in GA even when I was pre-HRT and presenting male last year, so no duh I'm passing female now. I was always sir'd in NY until I went full time.

Otherwise, the sides of the patch (as you know) will fray and curl upwards, and the adhesive left on your skin will collect any and all lint / fuzz from your clothes.  The result is awful black rings from the adhesive that you cannot scrub off for several showers.

This also helps improve the % that you will absorb - think about it, if part of the patch peels away, that's not getting you any of those precious mones.

Sir_Mitchell15,asktransgender,Can't stop thinking about being trans?,"I only recently (last few weeks) discovered that I'm trans. But since then I've been stuck in a loop of thinking about it whenever my mind is unoccupied.

I'm not sure if this is because it's a phase, and this is being shown through obsession, or if this is really me, and that's why it's so persistent.

If it's a phase, I'll feel like I've wasted mine and my friends' time.

If it's really me, then I'm scared. I'm terrified. Not wanting to offend anyone but I, personally, feel like a freak. I wish I'd been born a cis girl or at least a cis guy happy with his assigned gender. Why do we have to go through this distress? Is this me? Is this normal to have these constant thoughts?

I wonder if this was put in place to prevent trans people from inadvertently outing themselves because the warning only appears when you try to change your gender or your pronouns and disappears when you set either back without saving. Other public information just has the typical icon representing who it's shared with and doesn't warn you if you're about to change it.

And when I read point 7 and started to check my own body I found that I have the characteristics mentioned like same length on ring and index finger, the elbows, and also my pelvis being wide. I have never thought about that before, and always felt uncomfortable and had maybe minor complexities with my legs and arms. I always felt that they were so thin, and my fingers as well. When I studied these things and studied the female skeleton I could see so many similarities, and that kind of excited me in a way. Like something clicked.... Maybe it sounds weird. Now I don't know if that is something that is related to Gender or Body Dysphoria or something, but it feels kind of weird..... Does it make any sense? I feel like I am not able to explain myself fully."
Older_Wiser2,asktransgender,MtF: Anyone with experience at the University of Michigan gender clinic?,"I'm very perplexed .... I took a HUGE leap of faith regarding my transition and enrolled online at the UofM gender clinic. Their website says this is the first step in their program and to see an endocrinologist. I did this at the end of last November - I got a short call acknowledging they'd received the form and I'd hear back. In the meantime my therapist send in my recommendation letter for hormones, etc. --- but now it's April and I've heard nothing - I've called and left messages, emailed, told my therapist, she's emailed them - and nothing --- it's a black hole.

So I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with them - was it good / bad / or otherwise .....   ?????

For me sending that enrollment form in was a giant leap as I'd never put my name on anything acknowledging my transition --- and the response I get is nada, zip, zero, zilch....."
jjckcd,asktransgender,Should I wait to transition?,"The whole spiel about being a closeted trans person for 3 years i guess. I've been looking at the posts on the subreddit looking for experiences similar to mine, religious parents and a fear of coming out to them, a little bit for hope that my parents may be supportive (doubt it), but mostly what I should do if they are not.  I just turned 17 last friday, and I'm really lost on what to do. I'm not considering suicide or anything drastic at the moment, but i just feel so drained and lost. How would I go about finding help discreetly? I was thinking about waiting until i go to college to transition, but I really want to start as soon as possible because of the dysphoria I'm facing. I really just want someone with a similar experience to talk to :("
katie-elizabeth,asktransgender,"(MtF) Did anyone else starting HRT decide just to stay as a presenting male until it was impractical? How did that go for you, and how long did it take?","I think I want to start HRT soon, but I don't want to immediately throw on a dress and start talking in a higher voice on day one.  I want that 12 to 24 months to slowly ease into a new role, but I'm worried about how fast the changes happen.  
  
Ideally there will come a day when I would be right on the line of androgynous and it wouldn't be a big deal to start trying to present.  I don't have severe body dysphoria, so I can wait the months until the major changes happen.  
  
Can anyone share experiences in regards to this?  The idea of trying to present while still halfway in transition is terrifying."
Hi_im_Lexi,asktransgender,"For those in successful relationships, how does one do the dating thing as a trans woman?","Just some background:

So I've tried online dating (specifically tinder). I go to a university, so its by far the best thing to use in this area. I didn't mention that I'm a trans woman in my ""about me"" (in fear of people wanting to use me as a sex toy for their fetishes), and every time I eventually got around to telling the guy, he would instantly unmatch or block me.

I know that this dating thing isn't going to be easy, but from all of the beautiful stories about loving partners that I've heard, I really want to give it another try. I just don't know what to do. 

Any advice that you could give would be amazing and help me lots.

__its_only_me__,asktransgender,Thoughts on coming out,"So, I'm sort of caught right now. At this point I know I'm mtf. Now that I actually realize that I'm trans, it's clear that I've felt this way my whole life without the ability to put words to it. I assumed everyone secretly wanted to be a girl.

Anyways, I'm wondering if I should come out to my parents. I wouldn't actually be able to get on hrt for another year; the most I could do now is get on puberty blockers. Realistically though, I know that wouldn't happen, due to financial issues. I really want to tell someone how I'm feeling. But if I were to come out, I'd be subjecting myself to this wierd, middle stage, where I'm not transitioning but my parents are aware that I'm a girl... I don't know what that would be like, or if I want it. I could just wait until I could get on hrt to tell them, but I'm not sure I want to wait that long. I don't know if it's worth coming out to them, and if so, how would I even go about it? Would I write a letter (I live with them though), or just flat out say ""mom, dad, I'm trans."" Do I open the conversation bluntly, or subtly?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts."

Eventually-Alexis,asktransgender,Having doubts even tough I shouldn't have them.,So here's the situation. I have autism and have been know to grab onto ideas even tough it weren't who I was or how I felt. Which is understandably making it hard to belive myself around this matter. To give some background to work with. I have always felt like something was wrong and I didn't really notice before but looking back in can see it. Around age 10 I started to question my gender after having seen a TV show with a transgendered kid and it hit me. This is me. This is how I feel. And around 12 I started out trying my sisters clothes when I were home alone and found it terrifying how much I enjoyed it. Through my late teens 16-18 I always struggled to fit in with my peers and I found it to be the time were I had my toughest depression. I have experienced dysphoria but find it to come in periods and that is probably why im having doubts now since im in one of the good periods and don't currently have any. If i had to cover all the ways in felt different I would be sitting here all day but I'm almost 99% sure that I'm trans but I wanted your guys and gals opinion on wether it's because I'm trans or if it's the autism fucking me over.

"
NicoleTheVixen,asktransgender,[Rant]Why do we always have to assume malice?,"First I want to clear some things up.

Number 1.
I personally am for moving towards general desegregation of bathrooms. I totally understand that this is an issue that goes beyond being transgender. People need to be able to help their elderly parents, young kids, and a lot of us don't really know exactly how we look at any given time. Believe me it gets awkward not knowing if you're going to get ""sir"" or ""Ma'am""  or which bathroom you should use.

Number 2. I am not a fan of gender roles or forced expectations to live up to them.

Now, with that out of the way I have a **VERY** serious problem with the way so many people out there will automatically assume the worse of **ANYONE** who disagrees.

I belong to a trans group on facebook mostly for the purposes of getting help with local resources. I think it's important to stress I live in the deep bible belt south. A girl posted that she hadn't started transition yet and was still looking for a therapist and asked if would be safe to use the bathroom she identifies with.

Someone pointed out that all it takes is a picture on someone's cell phone to ignite some possible bad publicity. There is also a very real danger of police getting involved and this could be a huge ticket to reinforcing the idea our state ""needs"" bathroom bills.

What followed was a gigantic shitstorm. People were insulting her, cursing at her, and honestly twisting her words because she never once mentioned passability, non-binaries, or anything else but people were **hell-bent** on making it look like she was trying to police others. Her only point was that we as trans people don't have hardly any visibility at all to most people and we must create good impressions and minimize bad ones because we are at the end of the day a **VERY** tiny minority. We **need** support from a far larger crowd. The smaller the minority the bigger need for outside support.

To make the situation even worse? She is a medical professional. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying being a medical professional means you are always right or whatever, but she single handedly does **more** for many of us than pretty much everyone else in the group. She has the only informed consent clinic I am even remotely aware of. There is a chance this might be the only one in the state.

The sad part? It's been proven in many other context that she has a **GREAT** point. It's not fair to us (Hello that's part of being an OPPRESSED) Group but the best solution isn't being as militant as possible or completely disregarding others feelings towards us. We should be fighting hatred with empathy and not aggression. We have to work with the fact that we don't have nearly as much pull as other groups and we are still being understood.

Our entire hope of acceptance comes from the idea of being humanized and the entire PR campaign is usually something along the lines of, ""WE are human, we are like you!"" Seems like we should at least try to keep in mind how we are presenting and what we are doing may have consequences.

I present female most of the time. After spending a lot of time voice training, most people I meet think I sound like any other girl. But whenever I'm talking with my grandmother I don't completely go back to my old voice but I'll talk in a deeper/monotone version of the way I sound now... 

My grandma fully supports my transition and has done more for me than I could ask for. But she also still uses the wrong name/pronouns. She's older and has had multiple strokes in the past and her mind has trouble keeping up.

I just don't know how to go about dealing with this. I can be in a really good mood feeling really girly and talking normally, but when I have to talk to her and hear the wrong names/pronouns it just kills it.

Shes pushed me to not watching anime, playing RPG's, transitioning, and being happy with myself. She made me lie to my friends and family about why I stopped transitioning, twice.

Then this morning she left me a note saying that she believes I'm confused, that being transgender isn't a real thing, that she wants physical evidence that I'm trans, and that I'll never be a real woman even if I transition.

She won't accept my diagnosis from a therapist, won't accept the positions of the AMA and APA, and won't believe what I'm saying. 

She's incredibly religious (very conservative Baptist), and is a science denier anyway.

She's not kicking me out of the house, but she's not exactly treating me the same as she always did.

[deleted],asktransgender,Can someone explain the flair flags for me?,"So, I am new here, and I kinda don't understand some of the flair flags. I understand the flags themselves. I understand the ""questioning"" and gender-orientation splices. What I don't really get are some of the flags that somehow contradict each other.  
Examples:  
* Homosexual-Straight. Isn't that bisexual? Does it mean something other than bisexual? Is it really homosexual-heteroromantic, or something else entirely?  
* Asexual-_____sexual. Is this aceflux, or asexuality and a romantic attraction?  
* Any other combination of two orientations. Do such combinations imply a fluidity in orientation? A simultaneous identification with both?  
* Gender-orientation and and orientation-gender splices. Is transgender-homosexual the same thing as homosexual-transgender, or does putting one first imply that the person feels closer to that identity?  
Anyway, I'm not trying to say that these splices are bullshit or anything. I just want to know what they mean. Feel free to say what your personal interpretation of them is or whatever.  
PS: This subreddit could probably use a FAQ page for the flairs. Maybe I just haven't found it yet?"

Kernaghan,asktransgender,Can I only hope to find a relationship with someone who is bi or bi-curious? [NSFW],"Tagging this NSFW not so much for the post but that I'm willing for the comments to go into discussion about sex because I'm open about that. Making this post because I recently came out of a serious relationship, personal decision to break up, but now I'm left wondering if I will ever find someone who will  understand me as I am? 

I'm very non-caring when it comes to my outward appearance, it often leads to most guys misgendering me, and even the people in my life who know me as a woman will occasionally slip up because the apparent figure they are presented with looks almost completely male. Can't really blame them for that. 

People who follow the stereotypical social norm of a female making themselves look pretty and appealing are more likely to receive compliments and flirtation to the point where a relationship is a possibility, where as a lazy female like myself who does none of that is probably going to get no further than friendships. To be honest, that's not a problem in the present since I don't really need a relationship in my life right now. But in the future, should I ever get to the point where I want something, even casual, I probably won't have any chance because I don't look the part.

Even if by some stroke of luck I do find someone who is willing to look at me beyond a friendship, to have a sexual relationship with someone is something that would be a very difficult situation as A) They might not be attracted to the masculine aspect of my body B) They might not be attracted to the feminine aspect of my body (when I go on hormones and that sort of thing happens). So being with a straight cis male or a lesbian cis female might be very difficult, not everyone is open minded, and that's perfectly fine, nobody can help what they are attracted to. But to be honest, at some point, I might just want a one-off thing, to have sex with some guy or girl in a casual encounter but the whole awkward um-er situation would make that near impossible. Plus I've never actually had that sort of interaction with people anyway, I've never done casual with anyone. 

Sorry this was a bit of a rant really, not a whole lot of point to it, but is it a right assumption to make that I should only expect a relationship with a bi or bi-curious person in my current state?"

Instead, after making the appointment I got very nervous and this made me think that if I can't carry out a task as simple as having my chest hair removed how am I going to be able to fully transition?

DatabaseEmbrace,asktransgender,Unsure of my gender identity,"The short and simple: I was born male, but am feminine, but I'm not sure if I identify as female or something else. I know I don't identify as male, but I'm a very indifferent person when it comes to myself, so I'm not sure if I identify as a girl and just don't give a shit or if I don't actually identify as a girl.

tl;dr: So I was born male, but have always leaned more towards feminine traits in my life. As a child I would frequently pretend I was a girl, an was even often mistaken for a girl. Then I went through a phase of trying to be more masculine, but that only lasted about two years because I just felt really fake. For the latter half of high school I was often called ""the gay friend"" in jest due to my feminine nature and the fact that I had almost exclusively female friends.

I felt like I was ""one of the girls"" the way there are girls who get accepted as ""one of the guys"" even tho they're still definitely a girl and identify as a girl still. Finally I came out as genderfluid about two years ago, but recently I've been questioning if I'm actually genderfluid, or if claiming to be genderfluid was just a step, or just a way of coping.

I know this much: I don't identify as male. Even in my genderfluid ways I only ever present male because I look male when I'm meaning to present neutral because male clothes are more neutral and I'm amab so that just makes me look male. Lately I've been striving more towards an androgynous appearance like I had as a child where people would frequently question my gender tho.

Initially I was planning on coming out as neutrois, but then people started asking me if I wanted ""they/them"" pronouns instead of ""he/him"" pronouns. I opted for genderfluid because I'd feel like an inconvenience if I asked people to use any particular pronouns with me. I'd rather have people call me by whatever gender they feel I am. If I'm forced to make a decision for someone though, I always say ""they/them"" because then people not in-the-know will be kept guessing...and so will I, because I still don't know.

I've considered that maybe I'm demigirl, identifying partially as a girl, but not wholly, which logically sounds the most appropriate for me and how I feel, but it doesn't quite feel right for me, but neither does anything else honestly. I've always been such an indifferent person about so many things that I'm not sure anymore if I even have preferences with things, from things as small as my food preferences to something this big, which leaves me wondering what I even am.

I also know this much though: I wish I were born a girl...but strangely enough, if I were, or if I could swap bodies with someone....I wouldn't be a totally feminine girl, I'd be a total tomboy in my fashion sense, still presenting pretty neutral.

What's your input/advice? I've been struggling with these thoughts for the past five or six months and I've just been feeling really stuck."
SupJessica,asktransgender,post laser hair removal questions,"I had my first session last Friday. Hurt way more than expected but I'm good at hiding emotions so I just broke down in my head but the lady said I must have a high pain tolerance since I didn't show anything :P

Anyway after it was done she said my skin looked ok and wasn't reacting bad so I didn't need any cortisone or anything.

When I got home it was still a bit hot and uncomfortable so I put some cortisone and also been using face sunscreen 110 SPF whenever I'm out.

Following day or two it felt bruised like I was punched by a thousand little fists but looked OK.

Noticed every time I shave I can't get a close shave anymore, assuming bumps are making the razor not go as close.

Anyway my questions are: Should I even be shaving yet or should I have waited a week or so? I shave daily and not sure how I'd survive waiting a week but I'm worried the razor might cut the bumps and cause scarring.

Also a few days after the first session I started seeing red bumps, looks almost like razor burn. Is that normal?

Yesterday a lot of those bumps started getting pimples. They're not like large or filling up, in fact usually if I just touch it the pimple will pop right away so it's like just at the surface.

I don't usually get facial acne (maybe just 1 pimple sometimes), is acne normal after this? What can I do for it? Is shaving going to cut open all the pimples and cause scarring?

I'm using foundation to cover the bumps and redness, could that make it worse? I still apply cortisone sometimes and I use nivea soft face cream at night. I also wash with an alba facial scrub and/or was at morning and night.

I'm just kind of freaking out I'll have spots all over my face ahh!"
[deleted],asktransgender,Feeling worse and worse...,"Hey there...

I'm 17 years old and MtF. I'm pre-everything and only my mother knows that I'm trans.

I live in a remote valley in Austria where being LGBT is a very big taboo. People treat us like murderers, rapist and child molesters. Transitioning here is not safe and would would most certainly cause people to harm me.

Moving away isn't an option though. My mother understands my situation and wants me to be happy, but she does not allow me to move out until I have graduated. So I have to stay here for another 12 to 18 months.

Transitioning secretly isn't an option. There is only one legal way of getting hormones, which includes three years RLE, one year psychotherapy, and several psychological reports. All other ways are illegal. Pharmacies aren't allowed to give me the hormones without doing mentioned things, and usual stores and online pharmacies aren't allowed to sell any kind of medication.

I can't even do small things like dressing en femme at home. My step-father is a bigot and my sister is too young to understand it. Either of those two is always around, so I can't even be a girl at home...

It makes me so depressive. I want to be a girl since I'm 13, with some minor breaks due to denial. I can't take it that much longer. I'm so sad all the time and haven't experienced any positive feelings for almost 3 years now.

Please, tell me what I'm supposed to do... Thanks"

Right, sorry, so my question is, laser says to avoid tanning.  What's a good sun screen/lotion I can use every day until I start?  Are some better than others?  And this doesn't matter for electrolysis right, but I suppose it wouldn't hurt to keep using sunscreen, we're supposed to anyway.

I think my pain tolerance is... okay.  How much communication is needed during the actual process for elec?  Has anyone or are you allowed to listen to music through the process?  I was thinking some heavy music might help me.

Sorry for all the questions, and thank you!"

JessicaPounce,asktransgender,Dr. Laura Ellis in Florida?,"Dr. Ellis was recently recommended to me as someone who works with transgender individuals and can prescribe HRT. However, I can't find anything about her online so I was wondering if anyone else had heard of her or could recommend another endocrinologist that they can vouch for. I am in southwest Florida and have been on HRT for about five months but I am about to run out of my prescriptions in about a week so this is an emergency. My previous doctor was in another state and I have been on waiting lists for months, I am currently on a list for a Dr. Kozlow that won't see me until August!!

B0pp0,asktransgender,Can hormones ruin one's mental health and can antidepressants interact badly with hormones?,"This post might be a little long and borderline content for r/relationships, but this content is very transgender specific and I would like a trans viewpoint on this.

Two years ago, my sister-in-law came out as transgender. Not even three months after, they started on HRT and have consistently stayed on it minus one period when they moved across state lines and had to change their insurance. They always have had an ""I'm always right and know everything"" complex but since going on HRT it has gotten worse as it has triggered mental illness in them that was not always apparent. Originally she used homeopathic remedies such as primrose oil and it seemed to do fine but their boyfriend urged them to go on antidepressants.

The antidepressants have left them with Major Depressive Disorder which led them to spend two weeks in a mental ward and has put them on antipsychotic medication on top of the antidepressants and their estrogen. I am wondering if her going on estrogen caused a massive chemical imbalance which ruined her mind and both her mental and even physical health as she started cutting  which she never did pre-transition. Is this common or are we explaining an extreme case?"
Syntium,asktransgender,Effectiveness of FFS?,"Hi all,

With my transition I fell into some hard times. I had the chance of starting just after I turned 18, but then fell into a dark depression after this and ended up not starting hormones until I was 19 1/2. From what I understand I probably masculinised in this period. And all I can think about since starting HRT is what I lost.

What I'm wondering is if getting FFS will reverse these changes that happened?

If I had started hormones at 18 would FFS have yielded a more effective result?

As well as, how bad in effect could this 1 1/2 year delay have been in terms of changes?"

milgrip,asktransgender,Harrassed for being visibly trans in boymode. Is this normal? How long might this last?,"Starting from last weekend I've been getting shouted at, talked about within earshot and made fun of to my face by strangers while out in public. Examples include 'you're a man', or a derisive 'she's nice' when waiting at a bus stop I was getting off at. I also heard a couple discussing my gender as I walked past them to the effect of: 'that's gotta be a man, right?' 'I don't know, look at their legs'. Needless to say this is making going out in public very uncomfortable. I don't wear makeup outside the house, and though my hair is pretty long, I don't have much in the way of visible breasts, so I'm a little confused as to why I'm being read as trans rather than as a man. If any of you have experienced a similar thing, how long did this last? Am I going to be okay going outside eventually? I'm worried this might get worse before it gets better as I'm losing some hair up top and gaining the 'M' shaped hairline, and I'm not confident enough to use my female voice in public. "

thithiths,asktransgender,How do you feel about recent transgender awareness on television?,"(Not trans*, so please forgive any ignorance)

Recently, The Daily Show ran an episode that was totally about transgender issues and featured a transgender guest. Notable to me was that Trevor Noah didn't waste a lot of breath explaining what being transgender means. Instead, he trusted his audience to already be at least somewhat on board with him and jumped right into the issues. He didn't spend any time talking about genitals, steering far clear of missteps like the ones Katie Couric made when interviewing Laverne Cox.

To me, this feels like the beginning of a sea change in how transgender issues are reported on. The anti-transgender bill that got passed in NC recently received enormous backlash from both the public and the mainstream media. Bruce Springsteen, not someone I would think of as necessarily on the forefront of progressive thought, cancelled his show in NC in protest and many other big names have as well. It reminds of how gay and lesbians started being treated in the late 90s following Ellen coming out on TV and Matthew Shepherd's murder. It's not enough by a huge margin, but it feels unprecedented. 

Is society finally on some sort of long track to tolerating transgender folk? "
strangleroot,asktransgender,"Pursuing orchiectomy, and had a few questions for anyone in the know","Hey all! Like I said in the title, I'm looking to get my orchi done as soon as this summer, and I had a few questions for anyone who's gotten theirs done/is further along in their pursuit of it than I am. I figured I'd come here to get a few first hand reports before I scour the internet for information, since I like to hear things straight from other trans people who have gone through what I plan on doing, myself.

* I've heard conflicting information on this, but as I am planning on vaginoplasty later down the road; can anyone definitively answer whether tissue atrophying and/or scar tissue post-orchi will have an effect on my vaginoplasty? I've also heard that this will depend on where the surgeon makes the incision(s), is this true, and if so, should I talk to my surgeon about this to ensure a minimal effect?


* I've heard that the typical recovery period is about a month, which is why I wanted to try to get my procedure done over the summer, while I'm off of school, so that I'd have plenty of time to recover. Is this an accurate timeframe? Was your recovery longer? Shorter? How long will it be until I'm able to be comfortably mobile?
* In regards to sex post-orchi, will I still be able to get an erection? I assume that I wouldn't be able to ejaculate (at least not in the way I'm used to?), but I'm curious about this as well.
* This is something that I absolutely do plan to research online as well, but does anyone have a recommendation for a surgeon I should look into in the Southeast US? Specifically Florida, Georgia, Alabama area? Is this something that certain surgeons specialize in, or would I even be able to look into getting this done at my local hospital?

Thanks a lot in advance for any responses you all have for me!"
SorceressChloe,asktransgender,Could use some advice about a girl,"I had something pretty amazing happen  two days ago! A very close friend who I had lost touch with and not spoken to for like 6 or 7 years found me on Facebook! Now when we first met many years ago I was interested in her romantically but she didn't feel the same way, and instead we became very close friends. When she called me I came out to her and her reaction was ""omg that's awesome!"" Which made me feel so good!

As the conversation progressed she revealed to me that she considers her self bisexual. Then after a moment she said she might consider herself pansexual, but she wasn't sure she could say that as she hasn't had any such experiences.

I didn't really think too much of it at the time, but after our (four hour) phone call ended I started to think more about it. Was she trying to tell me she might be interested? She has family that lives about a half hour drive from me, and was already planning a weekend trip over here at the end of next month. She's getting a hotel and I'm going to visit her when she comes down!

So what do you think reddit is she maybe interested out an I just reading too much into this?"

queerandconfused,asktransgender,What the hell is gender? (x-posting from /r/genderqueer),"(Excuse the long off-my-chest post as I try to write my feelings out for myself.)

I'm baffled by gender and I'm baffled by my identity.

I'm female and I like girls. I'm 22. I've never understood what it means to be a woman or feel like one. I've also never really understood what it means to be a man. Everyone I know easily (and sometimes strongly) identifies with their sex, gender, and sexuality and I feel like I'm left out, confused, and frustrated.

I want to be one or the either but I feel stifled and conflicted and depressed when I'm forced into one box or the other. I don't want to go by alternative pronouns and be referred to as some ""other"".

But when people refer to me as a girl I feel awkward. They're not wrong... But they're not quite right either? I'm completely fine with being identified as a daughter and a sister, but being a girl and a woman is something weird and almost distant to me. It's not the social roles or expectations of girls/women that bother me as some people have asked me -- I don't give a flying fuck about those and have disregarded them from the time I was little (""I do what I want, bitch"" is generally my philosophy).

When I was in middle/high school I thought I was FtM transgender. If I wasn't a girl, surely I was a boy? My parents sent me to a counselor (not to punish me, but so that I could talk through my feelings and due to other depression-related reasons) and I was talked into? identifying as a lesbian.

So I carried along in my high school years as a fairly closeted ""butchy"" lesbian still fairly uncomfortable with myself but happier that I had some kind of label. I still felt awkward about my body (particularly my chest), about using the bathrooms and locker-rooms, and being assigned in girl-boy arrangements.

And then here comes college. I go away from my home in little ol' Vermont to Montana to try and catch a breath of fresh air and some change. Without my mother's nitpicking on what I wear I bought a new wardrobe of masculine/men's clothing, a proper binder (or two), and for the first time in a while felt more content and happy with myself looking how I wanted to look. I was still in the closet to the outside world regarding anything and everything but I joined the university's queer alliance club and finally got to interact with more than just a handful of LGBTQ identifying folk. I didn't know how to identify myself to the group and shirked away from any further labels but I made a few friends. People within the group assumed I was FtM transgender due to the way I dressed, talked, and carried myself however I shied away from identifying myself as such. I wasn't a butch lesbian because lesbians, even butch, intrinsically identify as women but I didn't quite feel transgender either as I didn't really care about what was between my legs and if people referred to me as male or female.

I had to leave Montana and come back to Vermont as I couldn't cope with the harassment I was experiencing. My parents were more accepting of how I presented myself (not that they never didn't accept me, but I think my mom had difficulty accepting her oldest daughter wasn't the feminine princess she had when I was 2-6 years old). I was happy doing whatever the fuck I wanted.

This past year I tried, I really really tried, experimenting with my femininity. I grew my hair out for the first time since I was 9 years old. I dabbled in make-up. I bought more feminine clothing. It was fun, don't get me wrong, to play with make-up and make myself look like this bizarre foreign being and dressing up in pretty clothes. I don't mind too much wearing dresses to formal/business events as long as the dress is ""my style"" (conservative, plain, solid colors, a-line). But what I didn't realize until I cut my hair short again recently is that every time I looked in the mirror I was looking at a stranger. A pretender. I don't know how to describe it, it's not like hair or dressing a certain way should really *matter* if I'm happy with myself or know who I am, but it didn't make me feel like me and it made me depressed. It was fun for a while and then it became a burden and an expectation.

I cut my hair short again and I looked in the mirror. There was the boy-ish androgynous face I knew looking back at me. My hair cut and styled how I always had it. A sports bra to diminish my breasts and a dumb t-shirt. There was me again. But at the same time... What am I?

I feel like a nothing. Like a blank person. I tell my friends that ""I'm just me!"" but feeling like you have no real identity sucks, as much as I claim not to care. I just want to be happy saying I'm a guy or a girl and not terribly conflicted and confused about what it means."

alexstrange,asktransgender,Weight and HRT,"Hello everybody, so recently I have lost a lot of weight (about 70 pounds) and I'm at a healthy weight, the problem is that I am not even trying to lose weight anymore, I barely exercise and eat normally and I'm still losing weight. The problem is that people are saying that I'm losing too much weight and I really want to begin putting weight on again because at times I feel slightly dysphoric about being skinny because fat can hide more masculine feautures such as small hips, etc. 
 I haven't told anyone I'm transgender yet but I'm planning on doing it near my birthday in two weeks. I hope to get on HRT as soon as possible.
 I have read somewhere that I should be skinny when I begin HRT and for the first few months into it because if I put on weight before HRT the fat will be distributed in masculine places and it will stay there and not be distributed into feminine places.
 So, what should I do, wait and feel more dysphoric until I get on HRT and then put on weight or put on weight now and risk having a more masculine fat distribution even after I am on HRT.

Just incase anyone was wondering, I'm 15 and MtF."

cb4jc7,asktransgender,So I've decided the the whole trans thing is not for me,"So after a lot of experimenting and self-discovery and talking it out I've realized that I most definitely have the brain of an MTF trans woman.

So I tried being one for a while with my GF and a couple close friends.  And it was ok, it had highs, but mostly it had lows. It made me hate my body and my voice. and it was a lot of work (emotionally, and all the work associated with makeup and wardrobe and etc.)

I spoke to a counsellor and a nurse about it and I was THISSS close to beginning hormones...
but I said no.....let me give this being a guy thing one more chance.
So for a month I abstained from everything trans.
This is the end of that month.

Obviously the feelings didnt go away, but they have been less frequent and overall I have been more focused on my day to day and my career. And there have definitely been happy days.  And when I am presenting as a male, I like my body (deep down i wish it was a different body) but I DO genuinely like the Man that I see.

Sure, I am probably a woman.
And since I've had these feelings ever since I was a child I have probably always been a woman.
BUT I've spent my WHOLE life learning to become a man. And I'm good at it, and I'm proud of who I've become.
I don't want to have to learn how to be woman.
It is too time/energy consuming.
I'm 25 and I want my life to be about more than this.

So that's it, I have the UTMOST respect for every Trans person on here and in the world and I am very happy for everyone who is able to make their life work while being their true selves. You are all amazing.

throwaway34771977,asktransgender,Somewhat Confused,"Back during Christmas 2015 I accepted the possibility that I might be transgender mtf. I'm 38 years and I realize its not to late to transition, I'm past that concern. But there is something else bothering me and I don't know why. Although unhealthy it seems like due to life complications it would be easier not to transition but it seems like I don't have the ability to repress this which is probably a good thing.  I guess a little background is in order.

Previously when I would think of my earlier life, I thought I was relatively normal other than being somewhat of a nerd.  I guess looking back I was kind of fem and never really realized it.  My family is kind of strange in the fact that they can sometimes be judgmental in some ways but never judged me on this other than sitting in front of video games all day.  When I was 14 I questioned by gender identity but it seemingly passed and I attributed the confusion to puberty.  I was very attracted to females and thought I had the same goals that other guys had.  Back then when I would think of transgender people I thought of  drag queens and what I would see on Jerry Springer.  I thought of it as a choice that people had, which of course I now know is it not true.  When internet access became more accessible I started reading on cross dressing and became interested in it.  I thought it was a fetish that I felt ashamed about but because I lived with family so long I never had the privacy to really explore this.  A few years after that I started to think about what it would be like to become female after a dream I had but at the time I attributed this to a fetish that was building up.

Not too long after that the feelings started to subside, which strengthened my belief that this was only a fetish, as I began a relationship with a great girl.  We even got engaged but we broke up after being together for almost a year for unrelated reasons.  The gender issues didn't come back up but I was in a long depression because I missed this girl.  After a depression of probably about a year, I finally got over her and life started going great.  I believed my self to be cisgendered and very masculine.  I didn't think there was anything fem about me.  I was interested in dating girls although I didn't really date a lot but believed myself to be happy being a male.  Looking back I realized that I somewhat felt awkward as I always had a hard time with relating to other guys the way guys do and would kind of ""fake it"" and until now thought, that it was just due to being somewhat of a nerd.  I realized that I repressed alot for so long.

Back to the last few months when I came to believe that I am transgender, at first it was kind of a relief to at least think I had an answer.  I started to seriously consider transitioning but due to fear I started to try to repress this again and forget about it.  This time I just can't.

At first I didn't think I was fem enough but now its like I'm starting to see fem mannerisms in myself which is making me self conscious for some reasons.  As I didn't notice before its making me wonder has everyone else always seen me as fem acting or is it because I'm not longer repressing anything that its coming out.

Something else, I'm still attracted to females but when I see one its like I no longer would want to date her as it now kind of seems weird to do so for some reason. Its like instead that I envy them on how free and comfortable they seem to be.

The reason I started trying to repress again is I guess I have done it so long and just grew accustomed to it and started being afraid that I was loosing myself as if I'm disappearing.

Its as if through the years of repression I built this shell and now that it is crumbled like I feel vulnerable and unable to rebuild the shell.  I can't say its a bad feeling.  As frightening as this is, it also feels very liberating.  There are several other details but it would take too long to get into.

I know everyone's story is different, but those of you girls who thought that you were a cisgender male for so long, feel and process this information when you realized that you are not?"

transgirlchemist,asktransgender,when are you obligated to tell someone new you've met that you're trans?,"a memory.

sometime in 2014 at 2 am near Times Square, I talked to a guy who stopped me on the street once and I was kind of tripping out on effexor and 5-HTP. we strike up a conversation about how we both saw the world. I was bipolar, and he said he was also bipolar as well. He ends up buying a blunt from a korean convenience store in ktown that's now been shut down.

We talk and drink and smoke and we're on the fire escape of five bar and when he starts to feel me up I get anxious because I'm not really attracted to him but I get sort of into it. The feeling of tactility on weed is electric. But I get uncomfortable and I stop him before he gets to my crotch and essentially when I tell him I am trans, he gets angry.

The effects of testosterone on my body are horrible enough as is, but having tasted the relief of HRT and blockers, going back to this state is nearly unbearable. I have to shave twice a day to keep stubble away, usually resulting in massive razor burn that I'm not used to treating &amp;amp;amp; makes me look far more masculine presenting. My breasts that were a C cup are now basically just fat / near nonexistant &amp;amp;amp; I've gained 2 and a half stone, taking me from low-Large clothing sizes to high-XLarge. If I hadn't done this all before, I don't know how I would cope, but even so I see nothing but a man anymore in the mirror whereas I was so close to passing to myself prior to this. All I want to do is drink alcohol and eat terrible foods lately, and nothing helps. I can't do this, I can't live like a man like this any longer. Being sex-repulsed usually, the other effects of testosterone make me feel even more disgusting alongside this.

It wouldn't be so bad if it were just the dysphoria, but it's also heavily effecting my hobbies too - I've had to take massive breaks from my Twitch streaming because I just can't handle it, &amp;amp;amp; my viewership has subsequently dropped by like 66%. I feel like a failure, and my quality and consistency has dropped to match. I feel worthless and so ugly in all aspects of my life. Heck, my voice is deeper now too it seems and I don't have the vocal range I had for voiceovers anymore. Fuck.

So. How do you do it, Reddit? How do you push past situations like this, patches where you don't have HRT or can't have it? How do you cope with the dysphoria and the self-hate, and push past the effects it has on your life?

I'm sorry for the more-rant-than-question post, but I really need some advice, because my head has been in VERY dark places recently and... I don't want to hurt my friends by leaving."
jupit2r,asktransgender,Genderqueer wanting to transition to assigned sex,"So, I'm not fully sure whether or not in being sarcastic, but it's kinda real for me right now.  Im an in betweener.  And its all the lovely things about me, to be sure.  But im tired and lonely.  And the people who are close to me all are so critical of transfemme presentation.   Im trans.  I've been trying to describe it to others for nearly 20 years.  And ive flirted heavily with mtf transition in the last year.  But what if i just went the other way?  Took testosterone supplements and finally stopped the stress of being in between?  When i say no one supports me, i mean no one.  Women, Men, family, friends, lgbt people.  Maybe i could finally be the man they all want me to be.  Anyone had thoughts like this?"
CCClair,asktransgender,Feeling a little confused and could use someone to talk to,"So long story short, my life has gone to complete hell in the past few years. I should be more preoccupied with other things but I just can't shake this feeling. I just don't feel comfortable anymore. I'm turning 18 soon and I'm considering taking action on this but I just don't know how. My dad is basically abusive and I know he'd pretty much disown me and I know my mom would just laugh at me. 


I don't know what to do. 


EDIT: I could go into a lot more detail if some of you want me to, but I figured I'd keep this vague for now"
whoisthisgirlisee,asktransgender,What transition means to me - my facebook post/essay for trans day of visibility,"I'm very out on facebook but have kept it pretty surface level and light. Today I thought I would change that and be a little deeper and more honest. I've gotten a very positive reaction and thought someone else might here appreciate it or connect or something! 

Today – the Transgender Day of Visibility – is a very important day to me. One year ago I considered coming out to everyone, even though I was pre hormones and even still pre total-self-acceptance. I didn’t feel comfortable yet sharing my real self with the world and regretted having to stay invisible on the day of visibility. Well, this year I’m doing the opposite – if my visibility can help make the world easier for all my trans siblings who can not be visible, then I want to be as loud and as visible as possible.


I felt it important to share more than just a smiling picture of me today – probably the best picture of myself I’ve ever seen. I post a lot about the milestones and big things that make me happy. I don’t often post about the little things that thrill me, like when I look in the mirror and finally am able to see myself as more woman than not-woman, the simple joy of being able to wake up and not have to shave (some days), the tacit (and sometimes spoken) acceptance of new friends and coworkers and random people I get to know as myself. The thrills I’ve had when I’ve cleared out non-female body hair and the look and the feel fills me with a warm contentedness. The freedom and joy of feeling like I can finally dress and express myself however I want – and the amazing relief of no longer having to wear a damn tux jacket in orchestra concerts while staring in jealousy at all the women who get to dress however they want. The fact that I can cry watching The Big Short, of all movies (our country is so messed up, yo), is both hilarious and wonderfully validating in how emotionally responsive running on estrogen makes me. The amazing happiness that comes from honing in my (still not very publicly debuted) voice work… when I hear myself speaking indistinguishably from any other woman it almost sends tingles of happiness down my spine. I just had my fourth session of laser today and the cathartic pain as my oppressive beard gets burned off is starting to feel amazing.


There is much to be happy about, but I post even less about the realities of dealing with gender dysphoria – it fucking sucks. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. It’s analogous to cancer – maybe it starts un-noticeable, and eventually tumors pop up but you’re told they’re benign and will pass and not to worry about it, until it starts to drain all your energy as it slowly kills you from the inside, permanently damaging your body the longer you take to figure it out. Only, society teaches us it’s wrong to have this disease, it’s wrong to not want to be poisoned by improper genitals dripping an incorrect sex hormone into your body, and that it’s shameful to even think you might be rotting to death on the inside even though you know it to be true. You either hide and let it slowly kill you and hope and pray it goes away through magic or divine intervention, or you repress it so deeply you find other excuses for the deterioration and the pain and the misery and aren’t even aware it’s there. Or, perhaps, you’re fortunate to realize what it is that’s the problem and you begin treatment and slowly reverse the course of it and start to heal the damage it’s done, both physically and mentally. Like cancer, the earlier you start treatment, the better your chances to go on and live a happy, healthy life are – but there’s a reason trans people have one of, if not the, highest suicide rates per person and absurdly disgusting murder rates. Dysphoria is, quite literally, deadly.


There are still days I’m crippled by the fact that my body just simply isn’t right yet. Some days the labor of having to perform such a male ritual as shaving my face pins me to bed for hours on time before I can muster the strength to face it, even if it’s only a 5-10 minute task. There are times I’m reminded of the childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood that I didn’t have and were stripped from me, and I can do nothing but cry and mourn for its loss. I still frequently feel an intense jealousy of cis women, and the relative ease of their life – who don’t require expensive, non-insurance covered surgeries for their faces to not have indisputably male browbones, or actual lips, or whatever else. Who don’t have to train their voice to sound naturally female, who’ve had a lifetime of female socialization (both good and bad) and don’t know the pain of being excluded from women’s spaces because their body appears male, who (sometimes) get to menstruate and (sometimes) have kids – who, often, are born with the proper genitalia. I watched the movie Carol last night, which was so intensely beautiful, and cried through most of it – especially the sex scenes, which filled me with such jealousy of both who the characters are and of how I’ve never had such an experience and maybe never will, that I literally had to look away to make it through it. Dysphoria has stunted my ability to form relationships in the past – both romantically and platonically. It is hard to properly connect to others when you’re internally so disconnected from yourself. It is truly a curse whose weight is difficult to bare.


But it’s not impossible to overcome. I’m so lucky I get to deal with it in this modern era of medicine, where I am likely able to repair my body to the point where I will, someday, be outwardly indistinguishable from a ciswoman. Maybe I’ll be taller than average, my hips will remain a little narrow, maybe my shoulders will remain a little broad, my feet a little big. But there’s no shortage of ciswomen with those features. I might remain infertile, but there’s no shortage of women in the world who are either. There is a light at the end of this tunnel, and I will emerge better, stronger, and more beautiful for it.


Accepting myself as trans has allowed me to truly love myself in a way I’ve never felt before. There are so many things in my life I used to beat myself up for as being a failure of a person that I can now look at and see: Oh wow, that was dysphoria. Was literally everything negative in my life a direct result? Probably not, but it’s so all-encompassing it affected everything from a minor to a very major degree – kind of like corporate money in politics wink emoticon. And the amount of things I’ve gone through that it does directly explain is staggering. The only way the story of my life makes any sense is to understand I was suffering from a destructive mismatch of brain and body that I wasn’t always cognizantly aware of, and when my mind did recognize it, I would explain it away or think it must be some other issue. It is so amazingly liberating and wonderful to be able to acknowledge this and work to fix it. Life seems crystal clear and totally worth living now.


One issue I’ve struggled with solving for my entire life has been my weight. In my slightly overcompensating weight-lifting days (2008-2009ish), I got down below 200 pounds and was well on my way to losing more… until I injured my knee and had to take a break. While that year had one of the highlights of my life – my month in Korea – it also lead to the worst living situation of my life (which was, incidentally, with a drag queen) and I went through some turbulent emotional stuff, much of which was dysphoria related. By the end of that year I had lost my good diet and my habits of exercise. Minus the stupid juice fast which was a totally unsustainable thing under the stress and lack of mobility at grad school, I never gained that back until I started keto in 2014 as a test to see if what I thought was probably dysphoria was actually just body image issues. After a year losing a good amount of weight I concluded that was not the case and started really transitioning. Between hormones, woodwind camp wrecking my diet, and all sorts of other things I’ve gained most of what I lost back and I’m so fucking done with it.


I love myself, I love my body, and I am done not treating it right. I’m done eating shitty food. I’m done not exercising. I’ve been eating perfectly clean this week and been doing daily cardio and I have a set, focused plan for myself to lose 2 pounds a week for the next year or so. I have extra incentives to do this – it’ll remove most, if not all, the fat on my body that is still distributed in a male pattern, it’ll put me at a weight where I can get gender confirmation surgery, and it will enable me to become the smoking hot woman that I know I am (not that fat can’t be beautiful). I’m making a public promise here to hold myself accountable to follow through – not that my own personal fire and drive isn’t enough – and I welcome and encourage you, my friends and family, to help keep me accountable if you see me wavering at all. It will, undoubtedly, be the most work and effort of anything yet in my transition. But the end result, will be so, so worth it.


I encourage everyone who reads this to truly love yourself despite whatever may be harming you, and if you desire a change in your life – especially if you can slay your biggest demon – to go after it, full heartedly. The resulting happiness of even just being on the journey makes it easier to weather the ups and downs of life. Even at my saddest, darkest place these days, I’m still able to return to my baseline level of happiness that is so much higher than perhaps it’s ever been, after properly allowing time and space to process the emotions.


Dysphoria is hard as hell sometimes and frequently leaves me in tears. It requires a tenacious struggle to overcome that sometimes consumes my entire life. But in fighting it, and healing myself, I’ve come to a deeper level of core happiness than I feel I’ve ever had in my entire life and a greater honesty and knowledge about who I am as a person. And I hope this post has shed more light on what my transition really means to me. Anything less just wouldn’t be as visible as I could be.


Happy trans day of visibility everyone. I love you all.


Time to go hit the treadmill."
abhpro,asktransgender,Anyone ever had a romantic or sexual relationship with someone who knew you before transitioning?,"I would imagine it'd be a bit of a mindfuck for someone who knew you as the opposite gender before. Whereas someone you met after transitioning would probably be more open minded. "
aaskew,asktransgender,How do you believe you're really your gender?,"I'm a gay trans man 5 years into transition and T, semi-stealth. I was extremely dysphoric and suicidal pre-transition and transitioning was the best decision I've ever made. I actually sort of like my body now, dysphoria is mostly gone and I no longer want to kill myself. But half the time I still feel guilty that I'm deceiving people about my gender.

When people misgender me, I see it as proof that I'm just kidding myself to think I'm could ever be a man, and I get an overwhelming urge to leave before I embarrass myself further. When people read me as cis male, or if they know I'm trans but are extremely supportive of that, I feel guilty that I'm tricking them into believing that I'm really a guy and accepting me when I still get doubts all the time about that. Then I feel an obligation to be honest and tell them that sometimes I think I'm not really male, even though I've never wanted anything more in my life than that, ever since I was 3 years old. When they continue to see me as a guy, I get slightly panicky because I'm not sure they really understood what I'd just said, because if they did they wouldn't be so affirming of my gender.

It's one of many reasons I've never been in a relationship - I'm afraid it might turn out I'm really a girl after all, and then the other person would have no more reason to be attracted to me (unless he's bi or pan) because I'd effectively be a cis woman and I'd have wasted his time. I also find that thinking about sex (still a virgin; I have massive genital dysphoria) or bottom surgery can sometimes trigger a panic attack, which then further feeds the fears that I'm not really trans, because a Real Man^TM wouldn't be afraid of sex or getting a dick. (I very much like the idea of having a dick. I do not like the idea of getting one via lots of knives and blood and pain.) It's made me think that maybe I'm straight after all, because the idea of  straight sex doesn't make me panicky, but I'm not attracted to women the way I am to men.

For those of you who have transitioned, how do you stop feeling like an impostor and coming to believe you're actually your gender? What's ironic is that pre-transition I always felt even more of a fraud when people read me as female, and that I was tricking them into thinking I was a cis girl and liking me, and that if they knew the truth they'd be angry and not want to be around me at all.

(if it matters, I have OCD.)"
amonaaron,asktransgender,Moving too fast?,"I'll skip all of the details, but I've had feelings that I was born the wrong gender for a long long time. They weren't always there explicitly, but they were there. It's been worse the past couple of years and the worst it's ever been the past 3 or 4 months. And I can't think back to the last time when I didn't strongly feel this way for at least a couple of weeks a month.

About a month ago I met with a therapist for the first time. I had few weeks between appointments and basically kept driving myself crazy because I was struggling between admitting I'm trans and being in denial, but I sort of knew what I needed to do. In my second appointment last week I admitted to my therapist that I was fairly confident in where this was headed. Her advice helped me accept who I am and to move forward.

I had been discussing what was going on with a couple friends, so I came out officially to them. Then a few days later someone else. But I agonized over telling anyone else, because I felt as if I should at least tell my mom first. It was the hardest phone call I've made in my life, but I absolutely do not regret making it and telling her. Since Sunday I haven't told anyone else, but I'm tired of walking around presenting as male when it's not really who I am. I'm working on telling other people, but I wanted to give my mom a few days before we discussed how I should tell the remainder of my family. And I figured I should tell them first before anyone else.

I don't have any sort of transition plan in place. I just want to say to people ""Hey, this is who I am and this is where this is going."" I have an idea of what the next steps are, but nothing has been discussed in detail. (Hopefully at my next appointment we can begin discussing this.) 

Anyway, does it seem to anyone like I'm moving too fast? I don't think I am, but my tendency is to overanalyze everything."
subcore,asktransgender,Why do Trans people have surgeries?,"My idea is that trans people don't want to identify with their sex, and want to change their gender. Many argue that society is pushing this stereotype of being a male gender for male sex. However, if you're of male sex wanting to be a girl, why would you want to change your sex? Aren't you agreeing to ""society's claims"" by thinking that behaving like a girl belongs to a girl body?

I'm sorry if this offends anyone, I understand how people may feel like they shouldn't be a boy or girl gender that they are born with, but I don't understand how you can feel you don't belong in your body. Saying you don't belong in a guy body is like saying you don't belong in an Asian body, or belong in a body that has curly hair.

I don't get it."
warpcorevalues,asktransgender,What have your experiences been at support groups?,"I'm considering going to one for younger adults in my town once the school year's over, but for now am kinda paralyzed by the fear of it.

totototori,asktransgender,How profound is the social effect of transitioning? (in a fairly liberal city?),"I'm 19, and have been having feminine feelings since age 3. I've been under therapy since September, and I've signed my release for hormones to start in May.

Yet, I am having second thoughts, because I'm preeetty afraid of losing status.

I realize that this might come off as shallow and unrealistic after this much exposure to the trans issue, but I'm afraid of losing existing privilege.

I know that I could go anywhere and be accepted right now, as a charming, social straight white male.

I get told that I'm pretty, and I think I have a decent chance at passing, but I'm still scared. (not that not-passing is a bad thing)

I am just very afraid of losing the status and privilege that I have had since age 14-15, solely because I think people will know I'm trans. I'm not even fully sure I want to be fully seen as female in society. I don't mind being a male in social situations - but every other feeling inside me feels EXTREMELY feminine. I like being able to go to meetup.com meetings about, say, philosophy, and be welcomed with no prejudice.

My gender dysphoria got to a suicide inducing spot a couple months ago, which led to my coming out to every one in my life who matters. 

Yet I still sometimes want to go back to the old, blue-pill me, and ""enjoy""(!) being a traditional male. There were some fun parts, and dysphoria was non-existent at times, but this has always been inside me, and I don't know if I can go back to that. I don't even know if I should try.

Thanks for any answers, gals, and may you have a wondrous night, or morning!"
f30bim,asktransgender,Things to avoid while on HRT?,"Hello, everyone! I've been on HRT for almost 3 months now. My dose is pretty low because I haven't gotten clearance for a higher prescription yet. I'm hoping this will change during my next doc visit.

I was just wondering what I should avoid in order for everything to go smoothly.

So far, I know that you should avoid drinking, but that's all I've heard so far.

Anything else I should be aware of? 
I'm becoming worried about the most random things impacting my transition... For example, I picked up a sample of a fancy cream from Sephora that claims to tighten the skin, pores, and diminish the look of acne scars. Will this somehow impact the subcutaneous fat redistribution in my face?

I don't want to become a trans woman. I want to be able to embrace my individuality that I have as a feminine gay male. I don't feel male I feel like a woman but I know that biologically I never will be one. I don't want to be unloved. I don't want to feel ugly or a sasquatch of a woman (6 ft 1, broad shoulders and ribs). A lot of the reason why I don't want to change is despite feeling like a straight woman trapped inside a man's body, my type of man is gay. Yes that's normal as lots of cis women fancy gay men more than they fancy straights. I think that gay men are much nicer and not to mention very cute. As a trans woman I will only be able to get chasers who want me for my genitals. I personally don't think I'm particularly attractive as a male but lots of guys totally holler at me and say I am, I'm doing very well with gentleman as a gay male and I don't want to lose that. I like having a sex life and at some point I really want a boyf/husband.

I don't want to have to lie to my parents about self medicating hormones (that is my only option as the UK NHS expects you to go full time before being prescribed hormones and I'm not willing to do that). I don't want the embarrassment. I don't want to face discrimination at job interviews. I  want to have a normal life. My parents fully support me but I know they really worry and I don't want to put them through this.

CrossfireInvader,asktransgender,How do I know if I'm with a good therapist?,"Hi, everyone! This is my first time posting to this subreddit, so I'll start with a little background. I'm a 21-year-old college student, assigned male at birth, and I've been struggling with my gender identity pretty heavily since last summer. Over the last few months, my amazing friends have helped me experiment with my femininity a bit and work towards a better understanding of myself. Last night, my university hosted a prom for local LGBT students who don't feel comfortable at their own schools' proms, and I got to go in a dress and makeup. It was WONDERFUL. I have such a long way to go, but I've come quite a long way, too. I have a lot of questions that, in all honesty, are probably just my way of denying some kind of truth.

Fortunately, I have an appointment with a therapist set up for tomorrow afternoon. A trusted social worker/friend of the family recommended him to me, so I am confident things will go well. Still, I know how many people in the industry don't understand LGBT issues as well as they purport to, and I want to be careful. Based upon your own personal experiences, how do you know when you're with a good therapist? What are the warning signs of a bad therapist? What can I do to ensure I'm making the best use of my time with him?

oneishtwoish,asktransgender,Money matters,"So in a surprise (I guess shouldn't be so surprising) turn of events, I got a huge bill for a transition related medical expense today. I made sure to ask before having anything done and they gave me an estimate. I saved and went through with it. What they didn't tell me is that the procedure wasn't entirely in-house and so they used services from an outside provider. So while their estimate was correct, I now have this other giant bill. I guess it's not that big, but suffice to say it's more than a month's pay. Now I don't know what to do. I guess I could sell some stuff or maybe ask for a personal loan from a friend (""family"" is out of the question), I would really rather not use a loan from a bank (not that I have good enough credit for a decent rate anyways). Any other ideas?

TL;DR: surprise medical bill is huge, ideas on how to pay for it?

yani2667,asktransgender,What's the answer to the locker room question?,"I know it must be insanely annoying that the defining question around trans rights these days revolves around bathrooms, but the issue has raised some questions for me.

I have zero problem with anyone using whatever bathroom they want. No one is naked in a bathroom, and it shouldn't matter what the person in the stall next to you looks like. I think in general this issue will be resolved by moving towards not having gender-specific bathrooms.

Locker rooms are different however. Nudity is entirely expected in a locker room, and, in the U.S. at least, there's always been the societal expectation that you're not gonna see a penis in a women's locker room, and vice versa. This question mostly relates to those who are pre-op but can pass as their true gender. I can think of 3 options (feel free to add more):

1.The societal expectation that you absolutely will never see the opposite gender's genitalia in the locker room should change. People should get used to the fact that once in a while there may be a pre-op/transitioning trans person in the locker room with them., and that person might not have genitalia that match everyone else in the locker room.

2.The societal expectation that nudity is acceptable in locker rooms should change. In the early/mid 20th century we changed our societal expectation that male nudity in pools like the YMCA was acceptable (even when females were present); this would extend that to locker rooms. This would probably require the reconstruction of a lot of (most?) locker rooms.

3.Locker room usage should be defined by what's between your legs. In this scenario a pre-op transman would use the women's locker room, while a post-op transman would use the men's locker room.

Did I miss any options? Obviously they're not all mutually exclusive. What does the trans community as a whole see as the most acceptable solution? (also sorry if I used any out-dated vocabulary, I'm not exactly up-to-date on trans issues)."

missunsure,asktransgender,Is this subreddit too biased?,"Hi

I'm a 24 year old AMAB and I've had doubts about my gender for some time. Two years ago I seriously began questioning my assigned gender. As a child I didn't really give my gender much of a thought. But during puberty that all changed. I saw the girls become women, and to my surprise I envied them. I envied their their bodies, I envied their makeup and I envied their clothes. But there was always a sexual element in my feelings. I wanted to be like the girls, but the thought of it aroused me. So I naturally tried my best to suppress those feelings as I thought this was just a fetish. 

As I said earlier, I started to doubt my fetish hypothesis two years ago. And since then I've gone through a few periods where I'm absolutely sure I'm trans and through other periods where I'm absolutely sure I am not. 
And now I don't really know what I am or what I want. I can't really call my feelings dysphoria because I don't really feel that bad. Yet it is very persistant and I know there is no way of getting rid of those feelings.


I've posted a few times on this subreddit (under a different name) and the comments have always been very supportive. But they have always been very one sided. Usually a commenter says that I'm most likely trans and the sexual element in my feelings is a result of having a female brain with a female sexuality flooded with testosterone. That is a very logical theory/hypothesis but it has very little scientific basis, like most theories regarding gender dysphoria and transsexuality. 

If there is a bias it is most likely a result of the fact that most people on this subreddit have already come to the conclusion that they are trans. Does anyone here know whether the experiences of the good people of this subreddit reflect the average experience of people that have doubts about their gender? Or is the world filled with people that have feelings similar to mine but did not feel they needed to transition?

I hope I am not offending anyone. It is just that I have been battling with my feelings for a long time and in an attempt to understand them I've been comparing them to the experiences of you guys."
[deleted],asktransgender,Had FFS 5 months ago and I want to die,"My dysphoria is mainly about my face. It's terribly masculine.

I had FFS 5 months ago with a very good surgeon, and he did all he could. But it still doesn't look female. I had rhinoplasty and major chin work, and I'm still swollen. The tip of my nose is still bulbous, and my chin sticks out still, even though it seems like the bone is massively reduced underneath.

Has anyone else had an FFS recovery where they still don't look right 5 months on? How long did it take you to look female, if you didn't at this point?

Right now, I feel like there's nothing that's going to fix this. I've been crying solidly all week and haven't eaten. I don't know what to do from here."
KiltsBootsAndSuits,asktransgender,Common Question...But Where Should I Be Looking &amp; What Are My Options For My Voice?,"I know, it's a common question, but I guess it's common for a reason? Heh. 

I have a low baritone voice that borders on bass. I've not been able to work on my voice at all the past almost year, but before that I'd been a singer for years, mostly in rock/goth bands. Knowing that, I'm familiar with a lot of vocal techniques, but I've always been stuck firmly in the baritone/bass camp, despite my best efforts. 

I'm sure that working with a vocal trainer exclusively on my speaking voice would heed some level of results, but I'm unsure of whether or not it'd be enough to ""make it worthwhile"". I'm also aware that (while some results are happily eye opening) vocal surgeries like Yeson are NOT miracle surgeries. 

Not only am I really concerned about my speaking voice,  I'd LOVE to continue to be able to sing, I just...you know...don't want to sound like a guy singing, especially after I become fulltime. 

I'm not sure whether or not just voice lessons alone can get me into passable female range on just my speaking voice, much less my singing voice, and I'm not sure whether I'd even HAVE a singing voice after surgery. 

So just what ARE my overall options? I mean, beyond vague stuff like ""voice therapy/lessons"" or ""surgery""? Like if you could be a bit more specific...that'd be AWESOME! This info is harder to get than you'd think hehe

orangetina,asktransgender,Will estrogen turn me 100% female mentally?,"I recently found out that I was genderfluid/genderqueer/non-binary/bigender/agender/gender neutral or something like that. I'm not sure which of those labels but somewhere in between cisgender and a full MtF transsexual. I felt really disappointed. It makes things more complicated. I guess it's the gender identity equivalent of a bisexual who wishes to become fully homosexual to make things simpler for them.

 I want to become 100% mentally female and destroy the male side to me. I don't fancy living a gender fluid life of living as a male who crossdresses some of the time. The life I want is as a trans woman. 

I've heard that being on HRT will make you feel more feminine as estrogen obviously affects the brain a lot. If I do that will it correct my gender identity to being fully female or more female then it is now?

SunnyfriesUp,asktransgender,Questions on supporting my trans friend,"Hello! Im hoping I wont be accidentally offensive but please let me know if i am.


I am cis myself and recently became friends with a trans woman who pretty much passes from what I can tell. I think it might be important to say that she has not mentioned she is trans, our mutual friend had before we met.


I'm Bi and had a bad experience coming out, so i can empathize to some extent the anxiety of revealing something so personal to yourself. I have the luxury of being 'invisible' until i figure out if someone is an ally or not, but im not sure if she feels she can do this or if it bothers her or not.


I only mention this because i was wondering how i could let her know i'm okay with everything without making her feel exposed by my already knowing.


 Something else I was wondering was we talked about dresses before and she seemed anxious about body types. Usually i mention corsets, as they really help shape a figure. Would it be rude to suggest a corset to help build confidence? She wouldn't be the first woman i mentioned it to.

Also, bathrooms. Where I live we don't have any bathroom laws yet, as far as i can tell, but its been a political side talk for a while so its no secret not everyone is okay with that. Could i just mention if she wants to girl posse her way in one I would be down for that/back her up, or should I just wait until she feels ok entering herself?


I'm not really overly concerned, but I care about my friends and the crap they go through so if there's something extra I can do to help, i'll do it.
Sorry for the length of this, but thanks for reading! 

TD;LR 

1. How can i subtly show i'm an ally?

2. Would mentioning corsets be innapropriate?

3. How do I approach the bathroom thing? Girl bathroom posses are the best."
k_dragon,asktransgender,Deciding between Chettawut and Suporn? [Some NSFW info in],"Money aside, I'll be eligible to schedule SRS in four months, as I'm currently 8 months HRT. I've been doing a lot of research lately cause for whatever reason I've been having a lot of dysphoria down there, and also I'd really just like to get started with my life and just be complete. I'm looking at Suporn and Chettawut as potentials and learning about their techniques, and thought it might be good to get some feedback/experiences from people who've been to one or the other.

So far, it seems like Chettawut might be the way to go because I still seem to have a lot of erectile tissue, as I wasn't lacking before. I know there's the 'use it or lose it' rule for us, and I haven't been using it, so I've lost some, but still seem to have a significant quantity, and I can still achieve stiffness (no more random erections though, thank fucking god for that), just not quite as much. I know Suporn doesn't really remove a lot of erectile tissue, which could be a problem. On the other hand, the photos both websites had available seemed a little more favorable on Suporn's site, but that could just be me. Besides people's experiences, is there anything in particular that pushed you one way or the other towards your final choice? "
pioneer_167,asktransgender,what's the actual risk?,"It's been a slow, slow, slow process for me to get to a point where the majority of my wardrobe is now women's clothing (but it's still mine, Eddie Izzard). To the point where wearing old clothes feels like crossdressing.

I don't think I pass, at least, not most of the time. I've been ma'am-d a few times.

So the fact of the matter is that when I go out, I'm most likely seen as a ""freaky guy"" (as my mom would say), especially if I'm wearing women's clothes.

I *have* been going out and running errands wearing all kinds of stuff for a few months now. I've been wearing a women's jacket all winter. I wear skirts most of the time, and while it's a bit nerve-wracking, I do go out to the grocery store that way, and into work.

But I feel like I've been cheating, and all this ""progress"" is an illusion. When the rubber meets the road, I don pants and an ambiguous top before going somewhere.

My question is: what is the actual risk (of harm, physical or verbal harassment, etc) as an AMAB person wearing the things I wear? I realize that's very dependent on location/circumstance/etc. I live in a very liberal part of New England. I'm independent of my parents. My job has been very accepting. But I'm horrified of going out as myself into the general public when I can't hide."
Lawlessflow,asktransgender,"Transitioning, work, school, homelife - Overwhelmed and Lost","Ok, some background. 
24 yrs old MtF. 
I started seeing a therapist in February after a near suicide attempt. I recently had her speak to an endo and I'm able to start hormones.

I'm holding off to store swimmers - probably going with the at home option because I'm in the bible belt and the few sperm clinics here are quite a drive and I'm scared of discrimination. 

I recently finished my undergrad in december. I'm about to finish my first semester of my masters degree - that I started only because I couldn't afford to pay back loans on my undergrad. My parents had a deal with me all through college that if I kept x grades every term they would pay x amount of my loans for me (they rake in enough to do so). Two months before graduation they called me over to their house (I live with my girlfriend at her moms) and told me they have never paid a cent. I had always asked every term how much I owed so I could be ready - they kept telling me 6k or 8k or so. I wasn't worried. Turns out its 40k. So I don't really give a rats ass about their acceptance at this point - them helping me was supposed to be their way (in their words and their idea) of patching up our relationship. They asked to handle signing for the loans and paying every term as  a sign of good faith and I put my faith in them. My mistake.  It was shit already without them knowing anything about my trans status anyways.

Girlfriends mom probably won't be supportive. She may have been at one point but her bf of the last two years is so incredibly homophobig, transphobic, misogynistic, and overall bigoted and he's been converting her since he moved in. Gf's dad will likely be accepting - gf brought it up to him in a hypothetical kinda way and he doesn't give a fuck as long as we give him grandkids -overall a very lgbt friendly dude, just wants his daughter happy. 

Gf knows and has known about my gender stuff since before we started dating 5 and half years ago. She's my one and only main support in all this. Has been more sexuallly active since I accepted myself and really wants a lesbian gf. Problem here is that she can't/won't find a job and has never worked. She graduated the same time I did. She has crippling anxiety and depression but won't see anyone about it. She tried with three different psychiatrists but every meeting made her feel worse and regressed her(her words). She was on anti depressants for a while and she was even less motivated and less happy than being on nothing. She's depressed everyday and doesn't get out of bed until I'm home. She's depressed she doesn't have a job but won't look because she feels liek she's a failure and hopeless and has a ""why bother"" attitude about it. I don't know how to motivate her. I've tried for years now. 

I work as a part time ""systems admin"" (I really am tech support but the title's nice) at a small company for 12$ an hour. I have reason to believe I'm about to be fired. They don't like that I kept going to school, but they weren't going to make me full time or up my pay so... yeah, I decided to go. Owner had me fix his laptop recently and left his email open. I was naughty and peeked a bit. I found a convo between him and my supervisor and they're concerned about my ""motivation"" and my ""busy schedule"". I've completed every project given to me, on time, and supposedly well. I don't know what I did. 

I want to start transitioning but I don't make enough to move us, or even just me, out. I'm scared to find a better job because I don't want to get reliant on the income and lose it after a few months because I suddenly have tits and, again, bible belt. Rural bible belt. I have a true passion for programming and I've thought of going self employed, but I'm scared it will take far too long to get money coming in. And I'm having a hard time fighting with dysphoria, working this 20-30 hr part time job, Graduate teaching assistant job (which is slave labor - they pay me 100$ a month for what amounts to a significant amount of work), and grad school, and trying to get something self employed going. I don't know what to do. I feel hopeless. There's this carrot dangling in front of me, and the harder I try t grab it, the further out of reach it is. 

I want to finish my masters and move us out to california or something. That's two years away at best and I want to start transitioning before then, as soon as possible because my own depression, anxiety, and general feeling of dread is getting worse everyday, the longer I wait. I have no idea how to make this happen - any of it. I'm so fucking lost and overwhelmed. I really, really just feel like I want to die. What the fuck do I do. "

So my question is, are they allowed to tell insurance to stop covering my visits? If it matters I'm in Iowa, USA. I'm 17 MTF"

Edit: A lot of people suggested I bring it up casually. I couldn't. I was too scared. I didn't think I could have a rational conversation about it in the frame of mine I was in. If I had talked about it at that time it would have been like having a neon sign above my head that says ""I'm trans"". I took it with me and tore it up and threw it away as soon as I got home."
blairmichod,asktransgender,What are typical hormones levels for MtF?,"Last blood draw put me at about 0 T, which is cool and I'm not concerned about, but also 220 pg/mL for estrogen. My doctor thinks this is fine and this is after adjusting my dosages for awhile now. 

But is it? Should the E number be higher? What are typical and/or recommended values for transitioning? Are such numbers even established? 

I'm curious primarily because I have been underwhelmed by the effects of HRT so far at just over a year and knowing that my hormones levels are off or could otherwise be improved would be validating. The more probable alternative however is that I simply have bad luck.

My endocrinologist tells me at every appointment I go to that my testosterone levels are still extremely high, and I can't go for more than a day or two without shaving before my facial hair starts to thicken up again.

In addition, I'm not really seeing any significant development of things like my breasts or hips, and was wondering if eliminating testosterone from the equation as much as possible could help with that as well. 

Additional question: I remember reading about progesterone and progestins- would it be a good idea to ask my endocrinologist to take them along with my estrogen to speed up development of things like my breasts and hips? Has anyone here taken progesterone/progestins and gotten better results?

Does anyone here have experience with getting and orchiectomy, or taking progesterone as a part of HRT?
Does anybody know the average price of an orchiectomy in the US, southern Nevada in particular? I read that they're ""as cheap as $750"", but I'd be a lot more comfortable with a range of some sort. Would the orchiectomy be covered under my insurance (Tricare)? "

Boob-a-saurus-Rex,asktransgender,Do I lie about DIYing?,"So I five months ago I went to a Transgender clinic three hours away from me and did all the stuff and got prescribed hormones. I was supposed to go back every two months, but I decided  to wait until I came out to my parents to start because I felt like they deserved to know before I started. 

Well I didn't get the courage to do so until 2 months ago. So now I've been on hormones for a while. 

Also I can't go back to the clinic because it's to much work to get there and back. It's 6 hour round trip and then there's a few hours between that for the waiting and the check ups. 

So I found a doctor in my city. Which took forever to do. 
But I since I'm basically starting from scratch with doctors, I can change my story a bit.

I want to tell this new doctor I've been DIYing so that he will prescribe me HRT. And do my blood work without me having to jump through  more hoops.

If I told him that I have been legit  hrt then he is less likely to take me on because he will be under the belief that I already have a doc to do that. And if he does  take me on he might want me to contact the clinic to get there files on me, 

So I dunno. 

Should I pretend that I've been DIYing?

Lunaa7,asktransgender,[MtF] Some questions about losing weight and HRT!,"Hey :)

So, I have decided I want to transition as soon as possible. I'll get an appointment to a therapist this week, and probably start some sessions already. I feel like I am going to spill the beans right away to see if I can make things go faster. (enough of waiting, ugh. *Just give me my goddamn rainbow pills.*)

BUT, thing is: I've been doing a treatment to lose weight for some time now, so I'd like a few advices. I've never been much active, but since I've decided I am going to transition, I have been exercising quite a lot. Does 30~60 minutes (Daily) of stationary bike (alternating between moderate and intense pace) will help me lose weight without gaining any muscles? I downloaded MyFitnessPal (Thank you for this recommendation! Really great app) and have been eating between 1200-1400 calories a day. I am not sure how many kg I will lose per week, but I'd like to lose a lot of weight.

I am 19yrs old, weighting 90kg/198lbs and am 162cm/5'4 tall. I plan to lose at least 30kg/60lbs on the next few months, but I am not sure if HRT will affect my progress. I feel like I am at a good age to start HRT and don't want to wait more time than I already did, but I am not sure if I would continue to lose weight (and muscles, please) on it, and I feel like starting with my weight now would be pretty shitty. Should I go for it, anyways?( Gonna keep doing what I am doing to lose weight!)

So, cardio (stationary bike - and ocasionally dancing to Paramore lol), low cal diet (not anything radical like Keto, just eating less and being careful) and overall trying to be positive but not going insane. How are my plans? What should I expect?"

HunterGhost,asktransgender,How do I come out?,I've known I was trans for about 9 months and was in denial for a long time during those nine months but now that my body is changing more and more I'm starting to hate my appearance and need to come out to my mom to get blockers. I know she will be accepting she watches Caitlyn Jenners show along with The Fosters and I am Jazz but whenever I try to tell her I freeze up and my body shuts down and won't let me tell her.

theRedSabre,asktransgender,"Have you always known you were the wrong gender, or did you come to that conclusion suddenly?","I am 25 years old, and was born male.  As of this year, I've come to the conclusion that I am probably transgender.  The revelation seems to be a long time coming, but now that I've come to that conclusion, it all feels sudden, and since my realization, my body dysphoria has grown exponentially.  Before this year, I can say that even though I have never been a ""traditional"" male, and was ok with my gender and enjoyed many a ""traditionally-male"" interest, but looking back at my life I am seeing many a sign that I wanted to be more feminine, and maybe I just was repressing it out of fear and social pressure.

My question to you, Ask Transgender, is do you feel like your revelation of you gender being different that the assigned one was sudden like mine, or did you generally know all of your life?"
An_Android,asktransgender,"Locker rooms, HRT, and stealth","I'm not sure I'll be able to transition in high school due to an unsupportive mother, however the way that I'm hoping on transitioning is by remaining in boymode as I take estrogen, and then eventually coming out publicly when I start failing boymode.

The problem with this is locker rooms. The changes are going to be obvious if I have to change for gym, because boobs.

Any ideas on how to hide them while changing?

I mean, if not, maybe I could just ask the school if they'd let me change in a closet or something. I'd probably draw unwanted attention to myself if I did that too, but it'd still be less so than if they found out I was growing boobs. Maybe if anyone asks, I could have fun with it. I could just make a new snarky evasive comment every time I'm asked.

eldritchterror,asktransgender,Help with understanding voice feminization?,"So I've been putting off doing this for a long time because I'm cripplingly horrified of failure but hey what are you gonna do? I caught [this link](http://lena.kiev.ua/voice/) a while back and only just now read it, and honestly, I've never been more confused in my life. I've never been too good at understanding technical reading EVER, but like this is next level. Could someone maybe explain it a little better if it wouldn't be too much trouble? I feel like I'm missing A LOT from this, but I don't know.

From what I understand the 1st paragraph simply states that most people say there aren't shortcuts so they can get repeat customers and that that isn't true.

the second paragraph describes resonance and timbre, but uses them in the same context and doesn't differentiate (??)

the third paragraph anatomically describes whatever the fuck is in your neck and tells you which ones are important, and to try and feel them inside of you

I can't understand a single thing in the 4th paragraph or the 5th (optional) paragraph.

After that it does the step by step of swallowing to feel your adams apple move, says some more 'tips/tricks' for lack of a better term, and then describes what I only assume is soem sort of vocal surgery given the descriptions. 

Multiple times in this it mentions ""read until you understand, follow and dont skip steps"" but...this seems more like an over view for a basic understanding at the mechanics behind what you're doing? And doesn't actually talk about what TO do? I'm terribly confused and don't understand any of this to the extent that I don't even know if it's even helpful or not. I don't see any 'instructions' any 'steps' nothing about what I should look for to understand progress, nothing. Am I just borderline illiterate at this point? It's really stressing me out and my voice is the reason I never talk anymore because i hate everything about it, and the reason why I gave up a while back on working on my voice because it was impossible for me to make any progress. Would someone mind explaining what any of this means, and maybe giving me a point in the right direction??

tossout581872150248,asktransgender,Pre-Op MtF Question [NSFW; Explicit],"Throaway because I'm embarrassed.

For a while I have not gotten erections without work. I know I'm supposed to keep things stretched and exercised, but maybe letting it go for a while won't be so bad...

So finally I had an erection so I could exercise the penis and noticed there is flaky dry skin up around the shaft (I'm circumcised). I've done google research and it does not look like anything but dry skin. But I am worried. I have not had sexual contact for two years.

Does the penis skin get dry and flaky if you don't stretch it? It is like it had gotten used to not being stretched. There's no pain, no itch, no red. Just dry skin.

Do I need a doctor?"

Vrayceilen,asktransgender,How do you find motivation?,"I don't really know why I'm posting here but its mostly because it has something to do with being trans but im sure its a bigger issue than that.

The question that I guess I am asking is where do you find motivation? 

Right now i have just graduated college in December and have been living with my parents since then. They know that I am trans and are somewhat supportive but don't really understand. Over these months i haven't done anything worth while other than applying to 105 different jobs with no interviews. 

As you might imagine this doesn't help when you already are somewhat depressed some of the time. 

I have lamented this with my friends(dont know) and they just say to self teach and do work for my portfolio to increase the chance and quality of a future job. And then i say that this all makes complete sense but i just don't have the motivation to do anything but play video games all day/ watch shows.

Then tonight the topic came up again and they finished with just get motivated.

So how does one get motivated to spend time bettering yourself? My first thought was to have a better job in the future, make more money in the future,  or to know more things that make you a person in the future.

That is where i think the problem lies is that i really don't care about my future. Just the next day and the next. Another problem is that i can't really transtion until i find a job and to find a job i probably will need motivation. And even then transtion probably won't be a sure thing to change this.

So to wrap this up does any else have or does feel like this?

So, I was researching about the two most well known anti-androgens, Spiro (being the AA I have been taking for a few months) and Cypro (the AA I am considering switching to if 200mg of spiro fails to drop my T levels to the desired levels). During said researches, I have read a few times that Spiro causes the breasts buds to prematurely fuse and stop growing. That is really damn terrible if true. 

So, is there any scientific basis on this claim? Or at least actual cases of girls having their breasts negatively affected by Spiro?

I, OTOH, having looked at *every single post* on /r/transtimelines, am sure that's not the case. That changes are substantial on account of HRT alone.

I'm trying to prove my point, however I'm having a difficult time finding examples of before&amp;after pictures where the after one doesn't have makeup or a particularly feminine hair style.

Help?

The best example I could find this far was this [picture](http://i.imgur.com/uNpEdAC.png) of /u/iyzie (gorgeous BTW), and I'm wondering if you could help me find more.

And the hard mode achievement: Folks who haven't changed their style at all (same hair, eyebrows, and clothes of their assigned gender) but who are failing to pass as their assigned gender on account of HRT alone.

rosalinekarr,asktransgender,Does anyone have any suggestions for Christian-oriented trans resources for my mother?,"I recently came out to my parents, and they're not taking it very well. My father is kind of okay with it, but he keeps bringing up that he's afraid I'll change my mind and regret physically transitioning. I've assured him that I'm sure I want to transition, and he's slowly coming to terms with it, I think.

On the other hand, my mother is super religious and she's in full meltdown mode. She's the daughter of a baptist minister, so she's very, very Christian. She's managed to shift her thinking on some things in the past, like she's pro-choice now, but on a lot of things, she's still a little backward, like she doesn't believe in evolution or the big bang.

I was wondering if anyone knew of any books or websites or anything that could help her come to terms with this from a sort of Christian perspective.

This isn't even because I tell them, it is just quite obvious because I'm near the start of my transition and don't pass too well yet. I've already made the move to full time legally so trying to go in ""boymode"" isn't really possible at this point in time.

What exactly can I do to overcome this? It seems no employer has any interest in me and there isn't much longer I can keep hunting before it becomes a serious problem either. It honestly makes me feel very depressed and even suicidal at times, feeling like no one wants you for anything..

transbutterfree,asktransgender,I have a couple questions.,"Hello! So I don't post much here, having only made a thread some time ago about T blockers stopping working and now I have a few more questions. I have been on HRT since mid December and everything was going well or so I hoped. My endo asked me to have a few blood tests and return to him, so he could check my hormone levels and see if everything was working as it should. Unfortunately, while I am having some changes (breast growth started by February, less libido and erections, etc), my levels still weren't where they should be. For reference, my E levels were at 57 pg/mL and my T levels were at 244 ng/dL. According to him, my E levels need to be a little bit over 100 and my T levels need to be below 75.  

Alright, so he upped my AA dosage from 100mg to 200mg a day, which sounds fine by me (not for my wallet tho), since I often read here that 200mg is the ""default"" dosage or something. He didn't up my E dosage, though.

Ok, so first question: Is it possible that my E isn't higher because of my relatively high T levels? So if the AA dosage finally manages to lower my T levels to the desired levels, my E might rise without upping the dosage?

Second question, if 200mg isn't enough, would it be healthy to up the dosage even further? 300mg or more sounds kinda crazy to me, but I am no doctor.

Third and last question, a bit unrelated but not really: When a (trans) woman's E and T levels are on the ideal range, does she still get erections or are they gone? Is it possible to still have regular erections when your levels are fine? Reason I am asking is because I am kind of using my erection patterns to guesstimate my hormone levels lol (don't worry, I will still have actual exams to check them).

Thanks a lot! All the best honeys! "

My school is, like I described in the last post, very anti-LGBT. Teachers are forbidden from even MENTIONING LGBT related topics, let alone help students. The student body is mostly conservative, and since its small, theres no LGBT support groups.

So far, everyone I came out to was really cool with it and that was a real confidence booster - especially for my dad. He is a person that doesn't seem to know any shades of grey. He only sees things black or white (meaning very good or totally bad - there's nothing in between). 

So now, whenever I talk next to him about coming out to someone and being a bit nervous he is like: ""You don't have to be nervous at all, they will all accept you, there's no doubt about that.""
Firstly, I don't think that's true. It would be an illusion to think that every single person I'm going to meet in my life is going to be supportive. 

And secondly I'm not able to talk about my doubts and insecurities next to him. I have a very loving family and normally we can talk about anything. Sometimes I would just like to rant a bit about my worries - just to let off some steam. But whenever I talk about my doubts out loud my dad is like: ""You are always so negative. You're a total pessimist. Everyone accepted you so far so everyone will accept you in the future. You're always worrying for nothing."" 

It makes me angry that he sees it this way. He dismisses my problems and makes it seem like my worries aren't real. Because ultimately if the coming-out does go wrong I'm the one who has to deal with the consequences - not him. 
I can't really talk to him about things anymore, because I know he will dismiss everything I say, but I can't really say anything against him because I know that I'm supposed to be happy about his support...and most of the time I am. 

But then it just gets too much. Is it possible to be too supportive or too positive about everything? 
I just have the feeling that he is certain that nothing will ever go wrong. He doesn't seem to realize that transphobia is real and that people can even die because of it. 
But even if I word my worries in a rather neutral way like: ""I'm not quite sure how XY will react, when I tell him about me"", my dad is instantly like: ""You're a pessimist, of course he'll accept you right away."" 
I don't know...do you guys get what I'm trying to say?"

LifesFading,asktransgender,Why do we tell ourselves we can make this go away when it won't?,"I'm not quite sure where to start. I only have ever lurked on here before but have been around for over a year. I guess hello is a good start. 

My background. I'm 95% sure I'm mtf. I still have trouble admitting it to myself really. 37 married with 3 kids. 

My issues with gender started really young but with super conservative parents it was not an option to talk about or seek help. I tried but was ignored or told I was wrong until I gave up. That happened several times between 4 and 9. During puberty I started to dress up and use makeup. My parents both worked so I could hide out in my room and had every afternoon to be myself. I got caught at 15 by my mom and had to get rid of everything. I tried to be a better son and I ended up dating a great girl. I still daydreamed and wished I would wake up a girl but never dressed again. My home situation wasn't good so I decided to get married right out of Highschool and moved away. Thought that might help make this all go away and it did for a while. In the moments it came roaring back I would drop hints about dressing up or once my wife did my makeup as a joke. I was so excited but had to hide it. Ugh, why couldn't I just tell her then. 

A few years later we had kids and I put all my energy into them. It's funny when you are so exhausted and busy how things like this don't surface as much. It was always there in the back of my mind but I could make excuses for why I acted strange, sad or distant as it didn't happen every day. 

Now it's come back full force and I'm left struggling with trying to be a good parent, husband and end up crying myself to sleep at night. The dysphoria is worse now than ever. I'm in no shape to dress or relieve it. I end up in my daydream fantasy world wishing I was me. And now I get these wonderful jealous sad fits because my wife and daughter are having the relationship and doing the things I wish I could do with them. I feel like I lost my last 37 years in a hole of indecision. 

My wife knows something is wrong with me but not what. I can't seem to say it out loud. I tried a few months ago but it was more of a joking hypothetical question and it backfired on me. Don't they always?She said she would leave cause she's not into women and I would be the ugliest woman anyway. She's probably right but ouch! Back in the closet I hide. 

I love my family and know they want me to be happy but this is the hardest most horrible decision to have to make. Why do we tell ourselves we can make this go away when it won't?

By the way my first therapy appointment is next week. I guess we'll see how it goes from here. 

Thanks for reading.

I will go to a salon because I have zero experiance with hair aside from care and treatment. Its so soft :)

KrisEtKris,asktransgender,I've lost all my friends. [Rant],"2 days ago, I decided to come out on Facebook and Instagram to my friends back in this Christian highschool. I posted a recent picture of myself. On Facebook and a full timeline on Instagram.

A day later, I didn't get the response then I got a Facebook messages from my Bible teacher back in my highschool, asking me what happened, why I changed my pronoun and name. I was actually full of hope so I explained very specifically about my past and what happened, what made me decide to transition. He listened to me very well and when I finished explaining.. this happened.

""PORN MADE YOU TRANS!!!!!! YOU SHOULD REPENT"". 

Yep after an hour of a dedicated explanation, he concluded it with how pornography affected me so deeply. I was so fucking done.

I tried to talk to other friends on Facebook and no one bothers to answer me back. They read my messages and keep ignores the fuck out of me.

It's not surprising though. It was very much expected. I am.. just sad that my reality isn't as bright as others.. and losing all my friends this way surely does not help.

traltthrow,asktransgender,"Really confused, could use some help. Long text.","Hi, I'm an 18 year old male who is questioning his identity. I've been doing so for a while, using this place as a resource. However, I am very confused right now, and an outside perspective would be very useful. In short, my thoughts, feelings and experiences don't really match up to a lot of the stories here so I'm finding it difficult to understand what is going on with me. 

I'll start by saying that I am terrified of being transgender. Whenever I find some 'proof' that I am, like a past thought or experience, I feel depressed, while when I have 'proof' of me not being transgender, I feel a lot happier, and optimistic. There have been a few times when I've been able to convince myself that I am not transgender, any 'proof' for it can be explained by other stuff, and for the next few days I've felt happy and at peace. Inevitably, however, a thought will pop up (""Hey, what about that time when you thought this..."") and I go into a spiral of worrying and questioning. This is ruining my life. 

It's not so much that I'm terrified of being transgender because of the implications of it (social repercussions etc.), but more because it has massive implications about how I view myself - my identity. Right now I feel like my brain literally cannot comprehend me being transgender. It would just completely flip my understanding of myself upside down. 

This sort of comes on to my next point. The main reason why I am even asking this question in the first place: 'Am I Transgender?' is because, at the end of the day, I have had fantasies about becoming a woman. I've read tgcaps, literotica stories, even when I was younger I was intrigued by stories about gender change. Being totally honest; yeah, these stories really turn me on, and are exciting to think about - at the same time, I felt disgusted by them. I hated that I was turned on by them, yet they produced such a response in me, one that I couldn't control. When I learnt that having sexual fantasies about being the opposite gender was a 'sign' of being transgender, I kind of felt like I'd been given a 'death sentence'. It makes me feel shit that, the fact that I have these fantasies  that 'diagnose' me as transgender. I feel sad at the idea that these fantasies indicate something about me that means I'll never be truly fulfilled as male.  

So I suppose my main point is that I kind of wish that these fantasies don't 'mean' anything. But it leaves me confused. Yes, I have had fantasies about becoming a woman. But at the same time, I feel male. When I feel most like myself, I am thinking of myself as a boy. When I look in the mirror and I look handsome, I feel good about myself. When I find myself having thoughts and feelings that match those of any normal boy, I feel secure. I have also had sexual fantasies which involve me experiencing sex while male - and these have been incredibly fulfilling, and it feels so real and euphoric, almost. In terms of 'expressing myself' I rarely feel like the true me is being limited by my gender/sex. 

It's so confusing - I find fantasies about changing sex hot, but when I think about it in 'real life', I feel completely different. I feel sad at the thought of my mum seeing me as 'her daughter' and not 'her son'. I have a fantasy in which I get a female body, and it's exciting, but I think about it happening in real life, as in, as I type this, I look down at my body and imagine it is a female one, and that thought is weird. I've tried doing feminine things (painting nails, wearing women's clothes) to see if it revealed something to me, some female part of me that was dying to be expressed, but it didn't really do anything. In fact, when I dressed up, it was kind of cool that if I looked in the mirror, it looked like there was a female body there, but it didn't feel like my body or anything. 

So I feel confused. I'm questioning my gender, and I've had fantasies about becoming a woman that produces a reaction in me that you might not expect a cis person to have, which 'means' or is a 'sign' that I'm transgender. But I don't feel like this is anything to do with my identity. How can you know when a fantasy indicates something 'true' about you? Being told that it is really scares me. I would just feel so happy if someone could tell me, with 100% accuracy and truth (not that that's possible), that I wasn't transgender, and that I could be happy living as a man, and that these fantasies were just that - fantasies without any meaning.  At the same time I'm aware how (through what I've gathered from this sub) transphobic society can be, and the phenomenons of internalized transphobia, and denial, and all that, and I don't know if what I'm experiencing is just that. You know, as I've said, there seems to be 'evidence' that I am transgender, and I don't consciously believe that I am, and that sounds like textbook denial. At the end of the day, I just want to be happy, and right now, I'm not, and I need to figure out why. And my mind is telling me that if I am transgender, then so be it, I'll have to accept it to be happy, though my heart wants any other conclusion than that to be reached. 

Sorry for the wall of text. Just needed to get my feelings out there. "
phonicparty,asktransgender,My problems with current trans discoure,"My feeling is that trans discourse and trans activism generally have gone down paths that aren't helping us, and from spending time here and years in trans spaces I think that some things do not reflect how a lot of us feel. I think we need to talk about these things and see where we can do better, and that doing so will help us collectively. The first few are, I think, less controversial, but the last two I suspect will be more so. I would love to have your thoughts.

**Preferred pronouns**

This one's easy. I don't have preferred pronouns - I have pronouns. ""Preferred"" implies that there's an option and I would accept something else if I have to. There is not and I will not.

**Transwoman / transman**

Can we not, please.

I am a trans woman, not a transwoman. ""Woman"" is a noun and ""trans"" is an adjective. A trans woman is one variety of woman, a cis woman is another. Transwoman is something else, a noun all of its own outside of the category ""women"". Please stop implying that I'm not a woman.

**Our place within LGBT**

I have often seen it said by trans people that it doesn't make sense for us to be grouped with cis LGB people, usually on the grounds that trans isn't a sexuality. It isn't, of course, but these people are wrong. Our oppression and cis LGB oppression comes from the same place - the socially and culturally ingrained orthodoxy that people with penises are male, are men, are masculine, and are superior to and are attracted to people with vaginas, who are female, are women, are feminine, and who are attracted to men, and the punishment of transgressions of any kind - and has the same solution. LGBT isn't a collection of sexualities, it's a collection of people fighting the same oppression. Of course we should work together.

**Gender Identity**

I don't ""identify"" as a woman - what does that even mean? - I *am* a woman. As far as I'm concerned we're not people who ""identify"" as a gender other than that assigned at birth, we're people who *are* a gender other than that assigned at birth. The difference between identifying as something and being something may seem like semantics, but I don't think it is. I think it's real and important. And I think the identity language that is used can be harmful and can actually hold us as a group back. That's the first bit

The second bit is that I didn't transition because of identity I transitioned because of dysphoria. I know that a lot of us feel the same way. Reducing trans-ness to a question of identity erases dysphoria. I think this does us a great disservice, and I think we need to move away from the idea that identity rather than dysphoria is what drives all of us to transition (we also need to be more vocal that dysphoria doesn't *have* to be this heavy, soul-crushing thing. That's a gatekeeper model of dysphoria, and the fact that dysphoria *can* be mild and niggling - barely perceptible at times - needs to be better known. Yes, simply being more or less okay with who you are but feeling that you would *prefer* to be a woman or that you would *prefer* to be a man is dysphoria)

Our language has failed us so I think that collectively we need to find better ways of describing our condition and explaining ourselves. We need to stop talking about gender identity and we need to stop talking about ""identifying"" as a gender. We need better. We can do better. We deserve better.

**Visibility**

Visibility can be helpful but making trans people visible *in and of itself* does nothing to help us so can we please stop pretending that it does. Visibility of the type we usually think of is not liberation, it's just a different kind of trap to the one we're already in. Visibility invites scrutiny of us but doesn't require protection for us. Visibility makes us as a group visible and under constant watch, but our oppressors and the oppressive systems and structures remain invisible and hidden. 

So what can we do? Visibility can help us, but we need to think of it differently. Making our oppression and its roots and how it operates visible helps us. Making our issues with healthcare visible helps us. Making bigotry and the damage that it does to us visible helps us. Making the misconceptions and harmful stereotypes about trans people visible helps us. Making good things that trans people have done - art, science, literature, whatever - visible helps. We need to make these things visible, not us. There's nothing wrong with trans people choosing to be visible, but when we talk of visibility it should primarily be about making our oppression visible with a view to fighting it not about making our selves visible.

I'm happy that this has garnered plenty of replies, and I'm not just happy that plenty of people agree with me I'm happy as well that people who don't have sad so and said why, because I think regardless of how you feel about these things they are things that we need to talk about.

[deleted],asktransgender,Is it normal to be akward about displaying characteristics of your gender?,"Ok, let me clear this up.

I like having a deep voice, but I feel akward or embarrased when other people notice it. It was embarrassing when he said I had a ""man voice"".

Psychosophic,asktransgender,"Cis woman but dysphoric, lost","(I know a similar post was made on here recently, but I didn't quite feel like I identified with it and thought I should tell my own story.)
I really don't know where else to turn. I was born a woman, and want to be a woman, but I really don't feel feminine at all. I wear a AA bra, have almost no hips (neither from bone structure nor feminine fat distribution), and I've struggled with skin problems since third grade, and now my face looks rough and worn, even though I'm only 22. Then I have thick hair all over my lower body (including ass crack) that I can hardly even shave once a week, because of how irritated my skin becomes when the thick hairs start to grow back in. I don't even feel like I can do things like wear makeup or do my hair, either because I suck at it or because it just looks ridiculous on me.

I feel so ashamed and wrong, because none of the other cis women I know have the same issues I do. I've had feelings of wanting to peel off my skin because I feel so sick inside it. Now it's become difficult for me to go out in public. I see all the other women, and I feel so different, so inadequate. I feel like I'll never be able to maintain a happy relationship, both because of my appearance and because of my distress over it. I can't stop thinking about it, and suspect that I've developed some form of BDD as well.

I know that these issues are usually linked to high testosterone, but I did a saliva test sometime in high school and was told that my androgens weren't outside the normal range. I'm thinking about trying again to figure out where these problems are coming from and to start on the path to resolving them, but I don't know where to start. I'm scared that I'll hit another dead end, or won't be able to afford it, or that I won't be taken seriously. But I don't feel like I can keep living like this."
SigurthrEnterprises,asktransgender,"Struggling to come to terms with things, could I get some input please?","I feel a bit lost, so please forgive my probably less than eloquent post.
EDIT: This has turned out quite long and a bit rambling. I apologize again and I really appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read it all. I've tried to leave out any unnecessary bits to keep it shorter. Feel free to ask any questions.

Over the past six months plus I've been beginning to realize more and more that I suffer from gender dysphoria and have done so for many years. I've always identified as a cis male for two reasons:  
1. I'm not attracted to men or masculine women, I am attracted to feminine women.
2. I can't honestly say ""I am a woman"" or ""I am a woman trapped in a man's body"". 

That second one may be true, I don't know yet, but saying it even internally feels incorrect (it feels like I'd be/am lying). I do want to be clear though that I am not saying others can't say this about themselves or others, just that **I** cannot say it of myself. It is a completely valid scenario and I by no means am implying that others are or would be lying if they use the phrasing I don't feel comfortable with. 

**Quite frankly I would describe myself honestly/accurately as a male who was born a male, who deeply and irrevocably wishes they were born as a female instead.**

I've never felt totally (or even mostly) aligned with the ""male perspective"". I've always felt that in terms of personality, perspective, and other non-physical/physiological aspects I've never equated to what is perceived as or expected of men. I've always felt very out of place around other men. Part of that is that I've felt like I was being silently judged, as if I were an impostor amongst them, but largely it is that I've had no interest in their ""gender-normative interests"" or their typical personality traits. I do happen to be quite comfortable around gay men though. I've idolized, looked up to, and cherished women for as long as I can remember. Only very recently have I realized that I've been in denial about all this. Only recently have I realized that I've been looking at women and wishing I were them, not just being attracted to them.

Initially as I started to accept my dysphoria I thought that ""there's no way I'd count as being trans, I cannot contest that I am male, and I've always been content or accepted being (stuck as) male until now"". But as time goes on I've been realizing that I've probably been ignoring the truth; I might be trans, and I'm pretty sure I can never be content with being stuck as male.

A side note:
One thing that trips me up is the word *identify*. I still identify as male because physically/physiologically I am male, at least everywhere except the portion of my brain that houses my consciousness and, thought process, and personality. My physical appearance and form is a large part of what defines me... not as a person, but as a physical entity. I suppose I'd physically identify and mentally identify in two different manners. This kind of confirms to me that there's no doubt I have gender dysphoria. Maybe the term identify just rubs me wrong because it feels inaccurate and inadequate when applied to my situation. 

It feels right to say ""I am male, I may not be cis"".
**Am I wrong here?**

Anyway, the bigger issue is that I am really struggling to accept the fact that barring some truly revolutionary advancements in medical science I am doomed to remain as I am now; forever unhappy in my male body. It's just so hard to accept that I can never be how I truly wish I was. (..and it is far more than just not getting what I want, I've lived a hard life, I'm well accustomed to not getting what I want, letting go, and then moving on. This... is different somehow.)

Gender reassignment surgery and/or female hormone therapy just aren't options for me because of my severe medical problems and history. I live with an incurable disease which has shut down my adrenal glands (Addison's). Simply put I cannot survive major surgery, or even most moderate surgeries. Likewise, I am on medically mandated weekly testosterone injections because my testes shut down when my adrenals did. The hypogonadism caused havoc in my body to the point of osteomalacia (I've broken bones while walking or sleeping) and other issues which when combined with the addison's disease led to me becoming permanently disabled. I am finally approaching a medically stable point after years of being just a few steps from death's door on a regular basis. I cannot stop taking testosterone. 

When I found out that I've had low testosterone most of my post-pubescent life and that I'd need long term or permanent supplementation I had hoped that it would at least lessen my dysphoria. It has not at all. Maybe it has made it worse, I don't know for sure.

I don't want to crossdress. I don't want to live as a woman unless my body is able to be totally changed into being female by every criterion. As of now, that's impossible. The current MtF technology just isn't adequate for me. Even if I didn't have the social issues or all the medical issues in my way and surgery granted fully functional sexuality as the desired sex (which, correct me if I am wrong, it does not at least on a physiological level; trans women can't have multiple orgasms, and still have a post-orgasm refractory period) I still wouldn't be satisfied. As I am now I'd never pass well as a woman with current tech because at the very least bone structure would be (horribly) wrong. If I was going to commit to changing my gender physically I'd have to be able to feel like the change would make me a woman, not just woman-like. I'd basically need body replacement technology along the lines of Ghost in the Shell (or some other science fiction type of tech like radical gene therapy) to undergo a gender change. I doubt I'll see this become reality within my (probably shortened) lifetime.

Maybe I'm just not brave, strong, or unhappy enough to take that plunge like post-op trans people have. My heart goes out to you in admiration. I cannot do as you've done, I'd need a far easier and more fruitful path. I hope you never have the thoughts of reassignment inadequacy I have, I hope you find yourselves truly happy in your new bodies. I feel incredibly guilty and ashamed that the very procedures/outcomes many would give all they could ever hope for to have are not good enough for me.

What/how should I answer the question ""how do you identify""? How do I define the disparity between my physical and mental state regarding gender? Where do I fit in the scheme of these things?

What are some ways to help cope with gender dysphoria, and the associated depression of knowing I could never transition to my desired gender? Looking at images of women, and playing a female avatar in games simultaneously helps appease and intensifies the dysphoria.

One last question I doubt there is an answer for; how the hell do I tell my wife of ten years about all this. I'm totally closeted about this stuff right now, and I want to tell her, but she's got severe anxiety and depression, along with severe self-image and self-worth issues. The last thing I want is for my dissatisfaction with my assigned gender to bleed over into perceived dissatisfaction with her in her mind.
"
katie-elizabeth,asktransgender,"Anyone else realize they were trans, but decided to stick it out and be the best they could in their birth-gender, only to wind up unhappy and unsatisfied?","For the past many years I've realized what I am.  The signs have been there since childhood, all the typical things: stealing clothes to wear, never felt comfortable in company of birth sex, etc.  Later some things like finding out I'm infertile and stronger feelings of dysphoria have lead to self-discovery and realization of myself.  
  
But I still decided it would be best if I tried to accept those thoughts while becoming top-tier in my birth sex.  I didn't have the option to transition at the time anyway.  I worked and got an amazing body, I made all the right moves socially, and I found myself in situations most cis-males only dream about.  But it was never enough, and none of it was satisfying.  At the height of my happiness as a male, I still wished to be the girl...  What's worse, I know partners sensed this if they got to know me well enough... And resented it.  
  
This year there may be the first chance in my life to transition.  The idea is so wild and alien ('*me????  No way!  I might know I'm a girl stuck in a guy's body but I couldn't actually transition... Could I?*').  I feel like if I transition there will be an endless mountain of work to do, and I still may never pass - hair removal, some hair addition (on the scalp), learning to walk, talk, and socialize all over again...  Growing up in a deeply religious background it seems like an impossibility, and yet I think soon the only thing preventing it will be my own hang ups.  
  
Or I can not transition and continue trying to be the best male possible.  I'm not despondent with dysphoria (most of the time, but there are times I curl up into a ball and wish things were different) but for the past couple of years I've thought about it at least every day, and often for many hours in that day.  
  
I guess I'm just looking for other examples of people who realized they were trans, tried to acknowledge it and succeed as their birth gender anyway, and eventually had a reckoning that they were deeply unhappy anyway - and transition was a real and valid option for them.  Thanks for letting me vent, and I hope to hear your experiences."
Dsoftm,asktransgender,Question about pills.,"I started HRT a week ago, and I know that that is very early on. But aside from a little bit of dizziness the first and second day, I have felt completely normal. From what I've read, the first few weeks are supposed to be fairly crazy emotionally speaking but none of that has happened.

On my pill bottles it says to take the pills orally I assumed that meant I should swallow them but now I'm wondering if I was supposed to take it sublingually. Has this happened to anyone else? did it just take longer to kick in?"

When i realised i was trans my height (6'4"") was one of the first things that stopped making me happy because i felt if i transitioned it would give away that I was a man. 

Also I'm new to reddit and basically everything trans so apologies for any mistakes i make."
Hk47droid,asktransgender,Something's gotta give. Somethings gotta give.,"Alright. Somebody has to say it. But this subreddits sucks.

Let me clarify.

I've been active here, and over at the underscore shadow/sister sub for a few years. I transitioned young, as has my fiancé, and together we have seen it all. We know what SRS surgery is like, how HRT affects you going MtF as well as FtM, what its like transitioning openly to your liberal family (my moms half), and what it's like to hide it from ultra conservative family (my dads side, as well as fiancé's whole family). We both try hard to help people, and would do anything for a fellow trans person in need. Be that helping them find employment, helping them emergency evac style move out at three am when a roommate assaults them, helping with DIY, navigating the at times legal web and red tape that goes along with trans issues and insurance, seen peers lost to suicide as well as drug over doses, and seen peers transition smoothly and go on to pursue advanced degrees. I don't even know how many times I've been thanked and told I helped save someone's life, or in how many states.

Point is, we both have gotten our hands deep in the nit and gritty of the trans community. Possibly because we started young and grew up with the community as our support group. But honestly, the state of the community here is appalling.

This is no longer an information based community. There are so many irreverent posts that simply don't belong, that finding a group of informed individuals to answer serious questions becomes more and more difficult as time goes on. And at that, when people post honest information that isn't hugboxxy and feel good, they shouted at and shut down- being told that they are wrong, because the mass of overly sensitives felt that truth was to mean. And at that, the content that is promoted is so soft coated that any worthwhile information isn't even able to be communicated! This subreddit has become toxic, and a breeding ground for dis-information due to our selecting for mushy gushy feel good talk that reads like a circle-jerk parody of what we should be. And that is a sounding board for drawing information from a crowd of similarly experienced peers contributing each individual's insight to help educate each other survive in a world that is often times hostile. Yet a majority of the content here is frivolous feel good stuff that belongs over in /r/transpositive, hug boxing (that belongs in the same place), drama and rants.

Yes, it's great that it was so awkward and hilariously validating that your nipples were sore at work when X, Y, or Z story happened. And yes we are all so proud of you for buying your first bra and it just feels so nice to wear with your breast forms. We get it. That's the problem. We get it so damn often that it's 75% of what we read here. But that's not the worst part!

The worst part is when somebody does ask a question, nobody is brave enough to say the answer if it could possibly be hurtful, or anything other than amazingly validating and feel good. We treat honesty and tough information like poison, and sugar coat the tidbits of useful content so much we have an epidemic of societal diabetes here. As much as it scks, the truth is, sometimes posters do not pass at all. And lying to them robs them of the chance to better themselves. Sometimes, what OP is describing, probably is a fettish, and encouraging them to 'explore their gender with a low dose of HRT' is not only risking their health, but likewise robbing resources that could otherwise be going towards helping the actual transgender community. I'm from Chicago originally, since have moved around a lot and still planning on to, so I know just how insanely taxed the doctors and staff are there. Sending them every stud lesbian and Fred the fetishist that posts a story via throwaway by giving misguided direction through aknowlaging them as trans* is not helping them, the staff who chooses to help us rather than taking the easy route and passing us off, or the IRL community as a whole. Likewise, labeling those you disagree with as having 'internalized transmisogeny' doesn't do any good either, as it just reinforces the unhealthy socialisms of responding to the few valuable posts with emotion charged buzzwords over well thought out or researched responces.

Which brings us back to the title: Something's gotta give, and somethings gotta give. The things that have give are the utter lack of establishing an information based forum here and lack of reinforcing rules and guidelines that we need. And the things that have to to give way are the useless, if not entirely unhealthy, content of both posts as well as the crux of this sub's existence, and that is *quality answers*.

tl;dr Half the shit here belongs in /r/transpositive; also, half the shit here is shit. MA(t)GA. &lt;--See what I did there?"
BlazeDozer,asktransgender,Im kinda confused,"So ive been on hrt for a bit over a month now, and since ive started i think the most ive done in a ""feminine"" manner is underwear. Its not like im against it, i do enjoy it, but i just havent been in the mood.

Im loving the effects so far of HRT, as little as they are, so its not like i want to stop.

Have there been people who just dont socially transition? Cause that sounds appealing to me. Im not scared of it, i just have little interest in it. Maybe my feelings will change as the effects get more noticeable or i fail boymode. Thanks for any answers in advanced."
killingspeerx,asktransgender,I am really confused about Transgenders,"now many Transgenders that i have seen so far i assume that they were males before doing breast, hair, face...etc surgeries because they have a male part, but what about women?

and thanks"
MaybeAngela,asktransgender,Tru Transexuals and Generational Differences?,"Ok, Im not entirely sure what my question is but Ive just had a bit of a jarring encounter with some ""Tru Transexuals"". Essentially the short story is that these two people believed that unless a person ""passes"" then they are not really transgender. That Tru Transexuals would never seek visibility but instead the ultimate goal of every ""real"" transperson should be invisibility and that harsh societal treatment of non-passing trans people was proper punishment for faking being trans. To that end these people had a laundry list of things never to do, never be seen with other trans people, never go without make-up, never go out not dressed to the nines (always wear dresses), never engage in any stereotypically male activities (enjoy woodworking, you're a man) etc. Honestly, and I would never say this to those women but to me they looked like drag queens, they looked like people who were performing every stereotypically gendered behavior possible and insisting that it was completely natural for them (maybe it is, who knows). 

So my question is, is there a generational component to this? These women were well over 50 and had transitioned decades ago. They viewed their ability to navigate the medical process decades ago as verification of their true status. Gatekeeping to them was a necessary evil to weed out the non passing fakers. Is the behavior I just witnessed a result of the gatekeeping method universally employed in years past or is it something else. Part of me really hopes that something else is going on here, I found these people to be really quit despicable and if they are indeed a product of gatekeeping I feel pretty bad for disliking them as much as I do.  

I am obviously setting these women up as  a bit of a straw man, (out of necessity, there was no nuance to their argument whatsoever). Their argument smacked of the worst kind of respectability politics and really left me angry. So is this kind of thinking on its way out or is there still significant pockets of people out there like this?  "

JaneTheTran,asktransgender,Don't know what to do here with my mother.... Could use help,"So I told my mother how I felt about my gender and it didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped. I told her how I'd been questioning my gender, and she flat out said ""no"". I told her about how I thought it was a fetish and how I was starting to think that maybe this was more than that. She said that being trans is trendy right now and that I've always been influenced by these things because I'm kinda on the autism spectrum (apparently I have aspergers symptoms, but don't have full blown aspergers). I told her about how I felt really good wearing girl clothes and how I'm really unsure about my gender, but it kept circling back to the whole aspergers thing.

The next morning I received an email with this link:

https://transresearch.info/2014/08/01/gender-dysphoria-in-aspergers-syndrome-a-caution-review/

She said she's trying not to be unsupportive but she's trying to be cautious. Now I just feel like even more of a freak.

We said we are going to continue the conversation later, so now I don't know what to do. What should I do?"
newaccount2000,asktransgender,Feeling weird after a month of HRT (mtf),"Today I just feel emotionally overwhelmed.  I feel like I'm about to cry, my eyes keep tearing up but I also feel happy, almost giddy.  I've burst out laughing at the dumbest things. 

Is this normal?"
morethanother,asktransgender,Turned away from a rental in Philadelphia,"So I checked out a place in Washington Square West last night, and I really liked it. The house is owned by a single woman in her 50s, and there's one other female boarder in her 20s - I'm in my 30s.   The owner and I had a great conversation, and the other boarder and I got along pretty well, the briefness of our meeting notwithstanding.  

I know from recent experience that my deadname appears on both my background check, and my credit report so I decided to email the owner to inform her of my *status* before completing the application.  I really didn't see the need to complete all the paperwork if my transition was going to be a problem for her.  

I did supply her with plausible deniability by stating that no response to my email was required if my being trans was a problem for her.  I figured that if I never heard back then I'd know that it was a problem, but she still had an out to say that she never got the message, or to make up some other excuse.  

To my surprise she responded to me via email stating that she was 100% supportive, but that it would be a problem for the other boarder.  Now, neither of them knew about it at the time that I checked out the place, and everyone was ready to move forward until this point.  So, the only way that the other boarder could have known is if the owner told her.  I know now these aren't the kind of people I want to live with anyway, so bullet dodged I suppose, but still, WTF?

The question now is what do I do about it?  According to [this](http://www.phila.gov/HumanRelations/PDF/FPO%20Ch9-1100%202014_newer.pdf) what she did is clearly a violation, but I'm unsure what I want to do next.  

Any input or advice would be appreciated. 

Edit:  This is the response i sent back to her.... 


&gt;I really like the place, and I appreciate you taking the time to show it to me - you seem like a very nice person.  I just want to clarify that the only reason I elected to tell you about my transition is that it my old name would show up in the background check - the company that does the check would likely ask you to verify the SSN because of it. I recently had to go through the same thing with my job.   That said, there is no reason why the other boarder would have had to know.  My medical history is my business, not her's, your's, or anyone else's to share.   
 &gt;
&gt;
I'm not going to take this any further because I don't think you had any malicious intent, but please do consider that some trans people will take much greater offence at being turned way.  You said that you were 100% supportive, but your're not; being 100% supportive would mean not tolerating or participating in sex and/or gender discrimination in your home. 
&gt;
For future reference I would encourage you to review this: http://www.phila.gov/HumanRelations/PDF/FPO%20Ch9-1100%202014_newer.pdf
It's against the law in Philadelphia to discriminate against LGBT people with regards to Employment, Public Accommodations, and Rental / Housing, and there's a $2000 fine for each violation of the code. This is also a violation of the Fair Housing Act, which carries additional penalties.  
&gt;
&gt;I wish you luck in finding a new boarder."

BewilderedDash,asktransgender,*RANT* Not sure if I'll ever feel complete.,"There was a time when I thought I was binary trans. Since then I've been on HRT a few times and am currently on a lowish dose of just AAs. Now I identify pretty strongly as genderfluid. While I feel genderfluid however I'd probably say I feel like a woman most of the time.

I dress how I feel any given day. Mostly just androgynously. Sometimes more femme, sometimes more masc. I'm  comfortable there and it's good.

But lately I feel like I'll never be complete. I feel like I'm at this crossroads where I need to decide what to do with my body and I have no idea. Lately I feel like my chest is missing. And I see posts about chest growth and most of the time i get just a tad envious. 

Now getting those fine breasts of mine growing again isn't an issue. That's easy enough, my endo is great. It's just that while the thought of having them is often great when i then think about having them they feel so incrongruent with the rest of me. 

I'm worried if I go on HRT fully or even partially that at some point I'm going to have to start speaking like a woman (more so than I so now) in order to be 'genuine'. Which I know is ridiculous and is kind of why I'm ranting. Maybe I just have this crippling fear of being visibly non-binary (more so than just with what I wear).

I just feel like it will force me to socially be someone I'm not. Especially with regards to my voice. Because i quite like my voice. Especially my singing capabilities. Singing is something that gives me great joy. And I don't know if I'd be comfortable singing like a man if I look more like a woman. And I know that's silly.

It's just like while i keep thinking about going back on E and there are bodily changes i do want. There's a lot about the results that i feel are juxtaposed with other parts of my identity. And it's making things difficult. 

Also terrified of losing sexual function and size. That's also a problem. 

But I'm also really not comfortable with further masculinisation. I'm just hoping I can be okay with being androgynous, but sometimes HRT seems inevitable, despite the internal difficulties it could potentially create.

I'm having trouble seeing how to be the genuine me in either scenario.

I just feel like I'm two people tearing each other apart. And it's getting so mentally tiring. I'm sure there's more to my situation that's relevant but that about wraps up my rant for now.

For aesthetic and practical purposes, I usually wear pantyhose, maybe 60/70% of the time out of the house. I'm fairly conservative dress wise and always wear a knee length or longer skirt. Of course, tucking is not a issue for the most part for this since no one except me knows what's underneath. Problem is, due to the compression and my size, sometimes it is very tight and uncomfortable around the crotch area for obvious reasons. Not to mention my weight gain makes it more difficult to get an accurate reading. 

But when I'm not wearing a skirt, I'm usually wearing shorts or jogging/yoga pants. Due to my body type, weight and my penis size the bulge is a obvious issue and very noticeable. Sometimes I'll wear a long hoodie or something to hide it. Also, I only wear cotton or microfiber hi cut panties, it's the only style I own, it's most comfortable for me.

What if that early-game mistake was our character's class?  What if we accidentally had chosen the wrong one but persisted with it because the game was fun enough that it didn't bother us, but now much later in the game our actual character isn't satisfactory?  Perhaps initially swinging huge swords at mobs was an easy way to get into the game, but you watched the whole time as the magic users got to have the real fun.  Or maybe you thought magic would be a fun path, but the rogues were the ones you secretly wished to be, with their lockpicks and skullduggery.  
  
Lucky news!  The game includes a way to effectively transform your character to a new class.  You won't lose the thousands of hours you've invested.  You'll have to push a button every day to 'train', and there will be a heavy stat and skill penalties.  As well, let's be honest: you're going to have to learn all the skills of the new class, and some of your old skills may not be relevant.  It won't be an easy road.  
  
Nevertheless, if it's what makes you happy, why not?  You've already invested thousands of hours into this character, and you've got some good things going for you.  I mean, your team mates are probably going to be upset.  You won't be a pure Warrior anymore, and you aren't going to be as specialized as a pure Wizard either; you're going to be something in between for a while as you slowly learn your new class.  But maybe you'll find new players who will appreciate your expanded abilities.  Maybe you'll realize that all those hours spent slinging spells as a Wizard actually allow you to be the Rogue a lot more effectively once its said and done.  
  
And you're actually pretty lucky - earlier versions of the game didn't even have this feature to change classes.  This is all new for this version.  
  
----------------------  
  
This analogy is even more significant than presented because unlike a game you don't get to reset your character and start over here.  You only get this one chance.  So you can either spend the rest of your experience doing something you resent, or make the slow transition over to something new, which you'll actually enjoy... but it will take a while and is going to require you to learn all new things.  And yes, other players are going to selfishly resent you for slightly changing their own gameplay experiences.  
  
You'll have to decide whether that's worth it.

Yaknowhowthatshitgo,asktransgender,After 6 years I'm finally seeing a therapist; but I have a question about confidentiality,"So after six years of dealing with my gender issues internally, I'm finally seeing a therapist about it. Now, I'm not looking to get on HRT from this therapist - that's further down the road - and my gender issues aren't the only reason I'm seeing this therapist. They aren't a dedicated gender therapist, but they do specialize in transgender patients.  

Anyways, I'm still on my parents insurance, and I'd rather them not see gender issues being the reason I'm seeing the therapist. When it is billed to insurance, does it list the reason why? Should I list my gender issues on the intake form or wait until I actually talk to the therapist to tell them? Do I need to explicitly ask them not to list gender dyphoria as something they're seeing me for?"
pm_me_your_dresses,asktransgender,Has anyone had success with going from 0 straight to 100 with their transition?,"With a little luck, I should be starting HRT by the end of May (if there aren't even more delays or blood test anomalies), and I've decided to come out to everybody on Facebook the day I start. This is for a couple of reasons - mainly, I'm planning on working most of this summer, and I'd really love to do that as myself for the first time. Because my work is mainly online, it would be impossible to change everything there without there being loads of questions from people I know about what's going on.

Does anyone have any experience or advice for going this route? I'm pretty worried, but I've been planning on doing this for at least a year at this point and the prospect of it finally happening is super exciting.

kallmekat,asktransgender,Cosplay Happy Story,"Posting a happy story again, that's twice this week. I must be on a roll...

Anyways, I went to the Sakura Matsuri festival today (4/16), and I saw all of the cosplay. I mean, it was my first IRL experience with it, and I don't think I could've had any more fun. But it just got better.

I was unfortunately volunteering (as a boy scout, but that's a story for another rant), so I couldn't cosplay myself, but I ended up working at one of the entrances to the festival. And in walks this beauty. I mean, her outfit is great with a capital everything. I fall in love at first sight, and then I start my speech for all entering guests, and observe this beautiful persons face a little bit more. Yeah, definitely male features. She talks back to me (it's also slightly obvious in speaking with her, but I think that may be only to a trained ear), and I didn't want to be outright that I knew and loved every bit of her, but I knew immediately. I was very disappointed that I never got to see her and compliment her.

Until I ran into her as I was getting lunch. I saw her, and had no courage to approach her. I just sat there, loving from a distance (no I don't mean loving as in a relationship, I'm in a happy relationship of 14 months now). I sit there for longer, until I look away, and she's gone :(

I walk around a little bit more, I was shopping for a pair of cat ears, how fitting with my preferred name, I know. And I approach every cosplay tent I can find to look for them. I then find a tent, and I'm looking down at the tent, it turns out it's a cosplay repair center. Love the concept, didn't seem like much could be done there. 

Tangents are fun.

But then I look up and look around, and there she is. I say F it all, I have no other chance, and she immediately turns to me when I try to say excuse me as politely and quietly as I can. I tell her I love her outfit, and she immediately thanks me, and as I'm in my scout uniform it seems like she wouldn't expect it. I love this girl, total confidence. I now have a small amount of hope for my future. Thanks all to this one person. And I said this, she immediately retorts that she knows hope, and they're not that friendly ;P yeah, a jokester here. Anyways, I just wanted to share a little more light I had this week, after quite a long bout of depression. Thank you all for always being here."
Zazh95,asktransgender,Feeling so bad,"I'm just so sad these days. I've been on HRT for 5 months so far but I still can't see happiness, or at least inner peace. I struggle a lot with presenting as a girl, I'm not yet full time because I don't have enough money now but mostly because I'm so anxious and I'm so scared of people judging or looking at me.. The only time I feel myself is with my friends, the only people in this world who treat me and call me like I want. My family knows everything but acts like nothing is happening, and I don't present as a girl with them, though I'm quite androgynous. Another huge struggle is love life. I'm so upset about being alone and I've never been in a relationship at 21. I'm terrorized that I won't find love with a guy because I'm transgender and that I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life. I always fantasize about being born a woman, and how life would have been just amazing! Please if you have some positive experiences, share them with me!

Adobe_Flasher,asktransgender,The Am I Trans?,"Around the age of 18, 24 now, I started to sometimes crossdress whenever I had the chance to and wouldn't get caught by anyone. It made me happy to wear the clothes and feel good. Everything fit better to me. 

I did it every so often whenever I had the chance between the years of 21-24 which wasn't always a lot just because I haven't had many opportunities. 

24 now and I cross-dress quite a bit more. I have looked at videos of transitions online and they honestly make me feel jealous inside because I wish I had a more feminine body than whatever I have now.  I have told my girlfriend and best friend about what I enjoy doing and both are very supportive of how I feel, but I am not sure where I stand past crossdressing. 

I started my own makeup collection about 2 months ago finally and have been trying to learn from MakeupAddiction. Which is going well so far. I had makeup on and looked in the mirror and honestly smiled for what felt like the first time at myself in a mirror.  I also believe this summer I am going to shave my body hair. I am really nervous about that and don't know where to start. I also don't have insurance right now and won't until the end of the year. "

I was looking into gender therapists in my area so I can get an appointment as soon as possible. To my surprise, there are 11 gender therapists within a 30 mile radius of my house. I was wondering, how come I tell a good therapist from a bad one since I have never been to one before. "
orangetina,asktransgender,Am I correct here?,"Someone told me that despite my fears of not being passable and not being able to cope being a non-passable person, they told me to take hormones and see how it goes in the hope that it might work out and I might be passable

I replied with that I couldn't just try hormones feeling unsure of it and only being OK with the outcome if I pass. This is because HRT unless in the short term causes irreversible changes such as breast growth and testicular atrophying. If I wasn't passable  then I would have to detransition, pay to have boobs surgically removed which would cost a lot, leave scars etc plus I would be infertile and due to me testicles atrophying I would not be able to naturally produce testosterone so would need to take T for the rest of my life.

People then downvoted me. Is it because I'm wrong? Is breast growth and castration of HRT reversible?"

BlakeTheGamerHD,asktransgender,I've been getting these questions about T,"First off, let me get the first one out of the way. 
""What is T"": T is the hormone of Testosterone, often found inside of the male sex and gender.
""Will Testosterone over time increase the size of a male penis?"": In general, no. Testosterone will triger the development of males to their geneticly pre-determined ""size"" or potential. But to take testosterone solely to increase one's penis size is not correct.
However, in boys who have not yet developed, the administration of testosterone therapy to trigger their development will cause an increase in size... but only to what their normal potential size is.

•Will I be doomed to an A cup forever? I feel like I won't look right for awhile until I get to my target weight then regain the weight back?

Around the age of 16, my junior year of high school, I started having these strange depressing feelings. Feelings of disconnect from my body, as if my body wasn't my own. Initially I could get these feelings to pass by meditating and listening to music for about a minute or two. I thought maybe they originated from the fear of graduating high school and going to college, but now I'm in college (still living at home) and I'm still having these feelings, and they're getting worse. They've started to get more intense in the past year and a half. Normally it would have taken me a minute to calm down, but recently it's taken me 10 minutes at the least, 30 at the most. Last night was actually my worst experience, I tried meditating for at least 30 minutes but I just got worse, it actually drove me to tears. 

These feelings have always come up when I think about things like gender and sexuality, even in the smallest amount, and they always make me feel uncomfortable in my own body (like I said, as if my body isn't my own). I don't really have a support group I can go to about my feelings. My parents aren't the most accepting of things like this, they still think that being gay is a choice, let alone being transgender.

Is there some way to cope that's healthy?

But it is not. It is something real. I can't speak for anyone else than me, but I can definitely say that I experience it, and I am far from being a religious bigot. It doesn't have anything to do with that! I've found that no matter what my opinions are, there is a part inside of my that still feels like being trans is something that causes guilt and shame.

soso_throwaway,asktransgender,Not exactly sure what to do,"Hi, so I'm apparently male, but may not be completely satisfied with this. First regarding gender roles (which totally should not be a thing in society, but it is, so I'll use the current US conventions): If gender roles didn't exist, I would mostly wear female clothing. Currently I only do that when alone at home which isn't that much, and otherwise outside only wear a corset (not visible) and high heels. More would be nice but I don't want to stir the pot too much. Makeup seems like too much work, and in theory I would like long hair but in practice it seems like too much work to maintain it. As for behavior, I really don't know where I fall in that; I suspect its rather mixed.

My current body parts don't cause me disgust or anything, but do wonder if I'd prefer a different set more, and sometimes like to imagine that. Actually being able to give birth would be cool, but I think scientists are busy with cancer and stuff so oh well. I think I mostly appear male, though strangely on the phone people not infrequently get it wrong even though my voice is pretty normal.

I think I'm fine with my current life as-is, then again I was drafting this post in my head while I should have been sleeping and then got up to start writing it, so maybe that's not actually the case. Then again my life is currently quite nice and do I really want to open a can of worms? I don't know.

I live in the SF bay area, and will probably stay here, though if not would probably go to Washington, Oregon, or the Northeast. How are people's experiences in these places?

Currently I work in software development and am fine with it. In the future I'd like to work in the environmental/transportation/urban planning areas (what exactly is not yet clear yet). Will there be any problems here for either career?

Family is Asian and seem open-minded, how are they likely to react?

(this may not be an accurate telling of history) In the 1860s and 1870s, there was a lot of optimism for equality for African-Americans. Then things went badly for a hundred years before starting to look up again. Is there any reason the same thing couldn't happen here?

I'm in early 20s, married a few years with no children to a female who is open-minded but also with heterosexual partner preferences. So yeah, that's a problem. By now I can't imagine separation after we've been through so much together and still have so much to do, and am possibly willing to push down any issues to stay together, though as there have been cases of people saying the same thing, then not doing so, I'm not sure if it'll actually work or not. Anyways they have mentioned that when imagining me as female they feel no sexual attraction, and they fear that my clothing choices may lead to something more later (which I denied of course). We somehow end up at this topic not infrequently. So yeah I really don't know what to do here.

DisposableChrysalis,asktransgender,Standing on the Edge and Fixing my Problems,"Hello everyone!

I don't really know how to start, or even how to say all of this, so here it goes in no real order. Sorry preemptively for the wall of text.


I'm looking to be MTF and am currently closeted. 


On the job and economics side of things, I'm 24 years old, have a M.S. and am job hunting for something in my field. I am presently unemployed. I'm living with my parents until I can get on my feet, have about 2.5k in savings, and my student loans are deferred for the next 11 months or until I get a job. I'm a resident of Rhode Island, and have United Healthcare's Community Plan as insurance. I know that HRT, and top/bottom surgery (if I decide that I need them) should be covered, but FFS is not. I don't know how much they cost with insurance and am unsure of how to begin down that path. I'm afraid that it would only be another drain on my savings at the moment, and that it might negatively impact my ability to get a job. I'm entirely unsure of how therapy fits into this, if it even does at all (I don't know if it's covered, where I should go, or if I need it to begin with). I'm also afraid of being unable to reproduce, though I'm willing to give it up if need be.


On the social side of things, I have my parents and my girlfriend of 2.5 years, though my brother will be joining us for at least the summer (he graduates this year). I've tried to talk with my girlfriend about this once before, but she sees it as self-mutilating and told me that I should seek therapy. I love her and would rather not lose her as she's my closest friend and we enjoy each other's company, but I don't think that she and I can have a future together as is (for a number of reasons, this included). I don't expect my other friends to give me too much shit for this.


Concerning the rest of my family, I'm unsure of how they will respond.

My mother is ultra christian/right wing and believes some seriously crazy bullshit (Satan's out to gettcha). I don't hold it against her; She had a stroke about 12 years ago, and hasn't been the same since. I could see her disowning me, or at least crying every time she sees me, but at the same time I've become so disillusioned with her and her views that I'm not sure I'd care beyond sadness that it would have come to that.


My father is going to be sad. He's not religious, though he is conservative. He stuck through utter hell for the sake of keeping everyone together and ok, and has sacrificed pretty much everything else in his life for us (including pretty much any shot at retirement). He stuck through my mom's recovery, put my brother and I through college, and is doing his best to keep their business running. He's the greatest person I know, and I hope I don't hurt him too badly by doing this. I don't know if he'd agree with me or support what I'd do going forwards, but he and I will be ok in time.


My brother's the wild card in all of this. He's very religious but has more liberal political leanings. He will not agree with my decision, but he's also reasonable and will likely try to make a rational argument against it. I don't think he would disown me, but I know that he and I will never agree. He's also getting married next year, and I don't know how his fiancee will react at all.


I don't know how to come out to my family and girlfriend. I could wait until I can move out, then transition on my own, but I'd rather not keep them in the dark for so long. I intend to do it in person, but I'm afraid, I'm unsure if this is the right time, and I don't know where/how to start transitioning.

**TL;DR:** I don't know how to do this. Nothing in my life is concrete, and I have problems with everything and am seeking outside advice on how to handle it, medically, economically, socially and otherwise.

Thank you to everyone who's read this far.

Sincerely,

A."

lobbedgrenade,asktransgender,What do you think about being politically correct?,"What do you think about being politically correct? Not even in regards to trans issues; just being PC in general.

Personally, i don't care whether or not someone is being ""politically correct"". I don't get hurt by slurs and if someone does call me something stupid, i don't feel i have the right to censor what other's say just for my comfort--not that slurs make me uncomfortable, i really don't mind them.

Now, there is a fine line between political correctness and harassment or abuse. Sometimes i think people mistake someone saying a slur as abuse... Slurs exist and people saying them does not mean you're inherently being abused.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you think censorship in favor of a more PC world is the ""next step"" for ""equality""?

(And also: there is nothing PC about using someone's preferred pronouns)

EDIT: I'd like to add to my last statement about pronouns--the reason there is nothing PC about using the correct pronouns when referring to someone, is because pronouns aren't something that should be considered ""political""; pronouns and identity respect are a basic human right therefore, there is nothing ""[politically correct](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/politically%20correct)"" when it comes to using them. You use the preferred pronouns of a person no matter the circumstance."

asktransawaq,asktransgender,"Any other mtfs falsely accused of abuse?.... wait, am i an abuser?","That title sounded awful. It sounds like something straight from r/mensrights. Sorry for that, but I can't sort my head out.

I'm a visibly trans girl, dating a cis girl. I've only dated boys before, so this is my first time with a girl.. I've been accused of abuse enough times where its starting to wear on me.  I honestly think people look at me and go ""large...tall... deep voice, must be an abuser"" **But I don't know!** I've dated lots of boys, none of them said i was abusive and i'm still friends with almost all my ex's..

Im not an abuser... but on the other hand, don't all abusers go around saying ""I'm not an abuser""? 

Anyways, some of the times i've been accused of abuse are:

My girlfriend's psychiatrist started her on Amphetamines for her asperger's. (Dextroamphetamine). She tried it for two months, during which she: 
assaulted a security guard, got into screaming matches with WalMart cashiers, crashed her car into still objects/parked cars four times (after a lifetime of never crashing) because in her words ""i want to go fast and feel danger"", and drove to North Hollywood to sleep on the sidewalk because ""Its the only city without rape"". I called her psychiatrist to make sure she was aware of her sleeping on the sidewalk, who told me ""you're calling me telling me to cancel her meds? sounds like you're the problem. you have control issues. that doesn't sound like amphetamine psychosis at all that sounds like abuse."" 

We used to have an agreement where whoever did the cooking also did the dishes. But then my girlfriend said ""i like your cooking more... can you just be in charge of the cooking every night?"" I agreed before realizing i was doing cooking and dishes alone while she watched tv. After a month of soloing the kitchen, i asked her smiling cheerfully if she'd mind helping with the dishes tonight. Her uncle heard, stormed into the room, got within an inch of me and said ""So the woman has do all the cleaning? fuck you, abuser. My father was just like you"" 

I went to my girlfriend's friend's party. An hour deep, my phone timer went off to take my HIV meds. I forgot them, so i asked if i could borrow the car, get my meds, and come back. She was like ""Yeah thats cool whatever"". When i get back, she goes ""While you were gone, a few people asked me if i was trapped in an abusive relationship...i asked why, and they said because asktransawaq stole your car""  I don't know! I smiled and asked nice and friendly, i would have taken no for an answer... A lot of these people i had just met for the first time, and they were already sure i was an abuser.

Another time, we're with her friends i just met. She has my pack of cigarettes in her pocket. I say ""hey can you pass me one of those cigarettes?"" and im smiling and cheery when i say it. Immediately her friend goes ""you dont have to support asktransawaq if you dont want to. you dont have to give asktransawaq your things"". My girlfriend goes ""....oh she bought these cigs. not me. they're hers."" Her friends go ""..........oh. But still, you don't need to take that from asktransawaq""  

it just....it seems in the past all my boyfriends' friends would try to be nice to me and friendly and we'd play video games together. Now it seems like all my girlfriend's friends have already decided i'm bad before they've met me, and start the game playing a hard defense.

I tried to break up with my gf, saying her friends are making me think i AM an abuser.. she said ""oh thats bullshit dont leave me. ...you're supportive and loving and not an abuser you're my special girl"" 

anyways, giant tl;dr

My girlfriend's doctor and friends have told me i'm an abuser after not more than an hour or two interaction with me. Half my brain says ""if they recognize the symptoms that quick, you're definitely an abuser"". The other half of my brain is like ""They're just transphobic haters"". 

Is what im going through typical? Should i just schedule a meeting with a therapist and ask her ""AM i an abuser??"""

ImSomething,asktransgender,I need help/advice on a few things,"
A while ago, about 8 months ago, I started questioning my gender and I just could not come up with any idea of what gender I actually am. And ever since then I've questioned my gender constantly for the last 8 months and I'm nowhere near an answer, and everyday the questions torment me. To put it shortly, I need help but due to some circumstances I'm really confused as to whats actually happening in my head, whether I actually am transgender and what to do next if I actually am, so I'll try to summarise as best as I can in bullet point form so I can hopefuly fix my problems rather than just siting there and silently enduring them. 

So first lets talk about the ""evidence"" I have that might point to me being transgender

- Since a while after the first time I started questioning I've never felt like I identify as male, and I doubt my myself everytime I identify as female. There have been days when I do accept myself as female and they felt great but the next day its back to the doubting all over again.

- I hate everything masculine about myself, my body hair, face, genitals, all of it. When I look in the mirror after shaving everything, I think my body looks great since I'm not particularly muscular but then I see my face and my genitals and my mood just drops, they both feel like they shouldn't be there.

- If I imagine myself in the future as a woman, It makes me feel happy
- I know this probably means nothing but I really cannot play a story based game as a male character when there is a female character option, especially if the character is voice acted, since it really doesn't seem to fit with how I envision myself
- When I see beautiful Women I get this feeling, I'm not sure whether it's attraction, since I'm attracted to women, or jealousy. For instance I walked passed a women with absolutely beautiful hair and I got that feeling.
- I've asked 2 people to start calling me a female name and whenever they call me it, it gives me a weird nevous/embarresed feeling but I always start smiling and feel a bit happy.
- I once went out underdressed with a padded bra and I felt great and confident on that day.I think on that day I really managed to pull of an androgynous look and seeing the confusion on a person working at a shops face when I spoke made me feel happy.
- I enjoy conversation with my female friends much much more than my male friends although I dont get many opportunities to talk to them


Now for some of the doubts/evidence against me being transgender

- I have a persistant feeling of doubt, although I hear this is quite common when people are questioning

- I can't be certain I haven't just talked myself in to believing I'm transgender

- I'm quite succeptable to stress and I don't know if I'm just using this whole transgender idea, as a way to escape my stress

- I'm not sure if I'm just doing this to be ""special""

- I have a few issues in my life right now, since around the time when puberty started for me I've felt like shit. For the past 5 years or so i've been so apathetic, all my emotions are dull and blunted, it's a rare occurence when I actualy do feel happy. I just want to be able to feel things again, to be as happy as everyone around me. On top of this I also struggle with stress and socially interacting with people drains me instantly since I have to actually act like I'm feeling emotions if I don't want to be bombarded with questions asking whether I am okay or not. What I'm saying is I'm not sure if I'm using being transgender as a way to escape these problems or if its the other way around where gender dysphoria is causing me to be apathetic, anxious and emotionally drained when I socialise.

So after all that do I sound like I'm transgender? Do I need a gender therapist/regular therapist?  Because if I am transgender or need a therapist I have a whole other set of problems

- I don't think there are any gender therapists within a reasonable distance and going to one would raise suspicion from my mother, whom I live with since I am still in highschool, since I hardly ever go out and I wold need them to drive me to them as well, at which point I would have to reveal why I am going to there which I don't want to do since I don't think my mother would accept me being transgender since she seems to enjoy gender roles so much, she's forced me to cut my hair at times and said that I needed to start ""being a man"" when she took me to get it cut. She also likes to tell my younger brother to ""man-up"" when he winges about things.

- I don't think I would ever seriously start to transition without being 100% sure and since I can't see a gender therapist this would be quite hard

- I live in the UK and would need to contact my GP to start transitioning, the problem with this is I don't know how to and would not feel confident enough to come out to my GP like that. If be some miracle I did all of this then I would need to go to a gender clinic at some point which I would not be able to get to without my mother driving me there meaning I would basically need to comeout to her

- I dont think the place where I live has generally high opinions on anyone who goes out of the norm in terms of gender and sexuality.

- I have a relatively small group of friends, 2 of them know I am questioning and are supportative, however some friends I am not out to have implied they dont have positive opinions on transgender people when I have had disucssions with them on the topic. So I dont exactly feel like Im going to have a good time coming out to them

Thansk for listening to all this, I'm so confused as to what to do in my situation. Really, any advice would be much appreciated. Feel free to ask questions although you may not get an answer for a while since I am going to bed now and have school tomorrow. Thanks again"
Utopia325,asktransgender,How Do I Get Rid of Internalized Transphobia?,"After 6 months of therapy I've come to the conclusion that I am transgender. However, whenever I see things such as excessively feminine mannerism, a non-passing trans woman or a trans woman practicing her voice I have some sort of rejection and I think that perhaps I am not really trans. I even felt that for myself when I smiled in a kind of feminine way to my therapist; after getting out of his office I thought I was kind of pathetic. On that side, I'm starting to feel like a female therapist would be best for me, I'm starting to feel uncomfortable around him. I hope I don't sound offensive to anyone, I definitely don't mean to be."

cassie_hill,asktransgender,Female to Male NSFW-ish,"I've thought I might be trangender for awhile now. I've always hated my breasts, being reminded that my body has a period and that it could hold a baby disgusts me. It makes me physically ill. I can't stand having things put inside me during sex, and the times I've tried just don't feel right. I used to bind my chest, and dress like a boy. I had to stop, since my breasts got too large, and dressing like a man just makes me look like a butch lesbian now (nothing against them, I just don't want to look like one.) 

I've tried ignoring these feelings, I convinced myself they're due to the stereotypes of being a woman, and that I just don' like those (which is true, to be fair.) And also that it's because I'm a lesbian. In the past few years, I've tried to make myself girlier. I tried wearing dresses, and skkrts, which I've always hated. I've tried being really into feminism and women's power, but it doesn't work, because, in the end, I can't really identify as being a woman. 


What I really wanted to talk about was this: I had an experience today that I can only describe as gender dysphoria. I had to go to a gynecologist, due to potential ovarian cysts. I've been anxious about the appointment all week, but just kept telling myself it was because it's a new experience, etc...Well, I got there this morning, and had to fill out a questionnaire about my period, contraception, pregnancy, and I could hardly bring myself to do it. I felt like crying, I was disgusted with my body and what it does, but I filled it out anyway. After that, I had to sit there for another 20 mins before seeing the doctor. Finally, I got called in. The doctor starting asking questions about my period again, and all the things I had already filled out on the questionnaire (I don't even know what the point of it was, jf she was going to ask anyway.) I was looking down the whole time, tears in my eyes. Finally, I just told her straight up, I hate being a woman, and I don't want anything stuck in me during the exam. She said it won't work without that (which I don't believe.) So, I left. I just couldn't stand that idea, and I'm never going back.

I guess, what I'm trying to ask is, do these sound like typical feelings if gender dysphoria? I tried using google, but I mostly find medical articles, which, honestly, don't explain it very well. I had such a feeling of inner hatred, disgust and anxiety today (and other times as we, this was just the worst) and I really need help. I just want to know if anyone else has felt this."

What kills me is that my brother and I are actually really close too, and now that we are both in college/recently graduated, I feel like I get along with my brother better than ever. but despite numerous chances, I can't bring myself to really tell my brother about my hopes for HRT soon and being genderqueer. Part of me, as the older sibling, has a feeling of guilt or nervousness because I worry I will be ""killing"" myself as a brother to my brother. I've just been &lt;deadname&gt; to him his entire life, and it makes introducing such a huge change really hard, even though I'm confident he would be supportive.

gonertop,asktransgender,Why have I been so back and forth?,"Throwaway account.

I'm almost 20. Since I was 15 all I wanted to do was transition (MtF). When I was 18 I finally got on hormones for a few months and I was happy. Then...I got sick of being a girl and being trans. I stopped transition and was happy as a guy for a few more months.

Then...I hated being a guy and got back on hormones for a longer time to be a girl. My hair was long, I had noticeable breasts, and honestly I passed as female without trying to. Then..I got sick of it again. Currently I'm back as a male and I was happy for a few weeks...but now I'm questioning myself and I can't figure out what the hell it is I want.

Honestly, I think a lot of not wanting to transition anymore stems from me only seeing myself as a freak and just wanting to be normal. Dammit society. But there are a lot of things I like being a girl and being a guy.

My life is incredibly unstable right now, not just including the back and forth between genders, and it's breaking me tbh."

I know life is short and we should aim for happiness, and so transitioning seems like it would be the best because I hate being anything male, however a lot of pain and hastle seem to come from transitioning: Infertility, sexism, SRS looks nice but the pleasure doesn't sound as good, fear, etc. But I really don't want to deal with that hastle. I want kids (don't have money to store sperm), I want to be taken seriously and I don't want to fear for my life constantly. Yet, not transitioning would just cause my dysphoria to grow worse and worse. 

Life right now makes me very uncomfortable, scared and I feel so lost and confused. Yet the idea of death scares the shit out of me.

MumbaiConfusion,asktransgender,I don't care if I'm a girl or boy; I just don't want to be transgender,"I hear transgender people talk about how much they want to be their desired gender and how much they hate their assigned one. I can't relate to that at all.  

I was born biologically male, but since early childhood I haven't been able to help my thoughts about being the wrong gender. I mean, I'm only 19 and I've already spent what feels like every other waking hour of my life consumed by this - and I *hate* it.  

Here's the thing. I don't *want* to be a girl, just as much as I don't *want* to be a guy. I could honestly not care less.  

If there was a button that if clicked would remove all transgender thoughts and dysphoria from my brain, but would turn me into one gender or the other with complete randomness, I'd click it in a heartbeat. Hell, I'd click a button to remove my trans thoughts even if I was guaranteed to stay male.

NineQuietLessons,asktransgender,Gotta love those voter ID laws [sarcasm],"My home state recently enacted a new voter ID law. A law for which the ostensible intent is to solve a non-existent problem, and the actual intent is to perpetuate and further break an already-broken system. And if that theme sounds familiar to you, then you've obviously been paying attention to...well, I was going to say ""bathroom laws,"" but actually it's pretty much every law passed by a Republican-dominated legislative body recently. 

So, I went to do my civic duty and vote yesterday. The nearest polling place is an elementary school within a short walk of my house, and I've voted there numerous times before. Now, I changed my name (and most of my other documents, including my driver's license) back in late 2014, and consequently I've voted under my current name at least twice since then. The first of those times, I updated my voter registration. The name change never was an issue, until yesterday. 

I'd gone to the poll along with my girlfriend. We share a house, which usually makes things pretty simple because all I have to do is give my name and then say ""same address as her."" This time, I had to give my drivers license too. Okay, fine, no problem there. Only, it turns out that the voter registry never got updated and still has my old name. So my girlfriend has already gone on with her ballot, while I'm stuck at the table as a bunch of volunteers try to figure out why some dude has the same address as me yet I'm not on the list. I had kind of hoped that I could pass by without much comment once they made the obvious connection, but after a minute or two it became plain that that wasn't going to happen. So I had to bite the bullet and say ""That's me, I changed my name in 2014."" 

Right away, I see an instant of shock pass across the face of the lady at the table, and she stammers something that sounds like ""oh, congratulations."" But apparently, the other volunteer was kind of deaf, so soon the first lady is leaning across the table and shouting my old name five or six times, and we had a record voter turnout yesterday, so the place was packed instead of being near-deserted like usual. And of course me in the middle of it, with probably the most incredibly put-upon expression on my face.

I considered having a few words with her about privileged information, but I ended up deciding that the better thing to do was to act completely unaffected, even though by that point I was fuming inside. About all I really did was take the time to correct my voter registration (again), in the hopes that it'll finally take.

I was pretty pissed at the time, though in retrospect I suppose the silver lining was that look of shock on the lady's face. As much as I hate having to make myself visible like that, it was pretty sweet. It's had me thinking too, though, about how all the document shuffling didn't really happen that long ago, and that if I had been a little slower about getting it done, I could have been completely out of luck, with no ID that actually matches my face or name, instead of just having to deal with some slight embarrassment. Which, of course, is certainly the intent of our voter ID law, to disenfranchise anyone who's unlikely to vote for the sort of people who wrote that law. 

And that of course, got me wondering about how hard or easy it's been for all of you to navigate the polls. So, how's it been?"
AlexisCM,asktransgender,Not trans enough?,"   I'm so full of insecurities. My current life choice makes me feel excluded from the community and the support that I need. I'm married to a sweet and wonderful woman but ever since I came out to her as mtf, it's been a constant struggle. After two years of fighting and a twice on HRT, we're still together. The only problem is that she has only agreed to stay with me if I never go full time. Its tough and I honestly don't know how long I can go without being the real me. Even if I play with makeup, it triggers her and sends her into depression or we get into an argument. The crazy part is she notices if I didn't clean off my eyeliner good enough. Every little detail is under scrutiny.

   Because of this the only real thing I have done to transition is HRT. Some days I just don't feel trans enough compared to the rest of everyone here. I feel like because I'm not trans enough, I am inclined to stay quiet and not reach out for help. Even when I make a post I usually delete it after a few minutes of being up. I just don't know. I feel like everyone is pushing forward with their lives and I'm just stuck. I have been such a ball of negativity this week. Am I not trans enough?"
F3mshep,asktransgender,What hotel to pick for Dr. Chettawut?,"My mother will be traveling with me this January for my GCS with Dr. Chettawut.

We want 2 bedrooms, so we are most seriously considering getting either 2 attached cottages with the Rama, or getting the C room with Vertical Suites.

I am leaning towards the Vertical Suite myself, while my mother is more interested in the Rama. The Suite seems to be more clean, be better decorated, and having a washer and dryer in the room is a huge plus.

My mother is leaning towards the Rama because it will be easy to walk around and get fresh air. Also cats are awesome.

leydigcellhate,asktransgender,My Orchiectomy experience with Dr. Beck in Chicago.,"Hey Lovelies! 

I am writing this for informative purposes; I had wished someone had done this when I was researching the process, so here is my experience and what I have learned. I would have loved to have a detailed explanation of what to expect. So, here we go!

I had been given Dr. Tracy Beck's name when I asked for a respectful physician that performed orchiectomies. It is not the procedure I want, but the only on I had time to recover from currently; SRS if a bit off yet.  I called her office, and set up an appointment. The appointment was roughly 6 months from the time I placed the first call. She is only in the office one day a week... she is very busy.

At the consultation, Dr. Beck was very kind and just a wonderful example that doctors can be polite and warm individuals. I was her last patient for the day, so the visit was roughly an hour - I think it was scheduled for 15 minutes. There was a brief genital examination to assess for ""testicular atrophy."" The aforementioned exam finding is what the procedure was billed under so that insurance would cover the operation. She asks why you want the procedure and that you known it is permanent. Towards the end of the encounter, she described the surgery; her description was not exactly accurate - she said that it would be done under local anesthetic... that was not the case, It was ultimately done under general anesthesia. 

With the conclusion of the consult visit, I met with the scheduler and booked a date 5 weeks from the time of the date of the consult. It was explained to me that I would need a pre-operative physical as well as some labs. a BMP (basic metabolic panel), a PTT, and a PT/INR. The physical and labs were to be done within two weeks prior to surgery. I was also told I would receive a phone call the DAY BEFORE the procedure with an arrival time and further instructions. 

The day before the operation, I received the phone call shortly after 5pm. The kind women on the phone told me what time to arrive, and what time I was expected to have the procedure. Additionally, she told me when I needed to stop eating for the day, and when I needed to stop drinking any fluids. She was excited for me, and really eased my nerves.

Upon arrival at the surgical center in Boys Town Chicago, I checked in and waited to be brought back to my preoperative room. 

I was brought back to my room by a very kind nurse who gave me instruction to clean and dress into the gown. They asked for my legal name, and then asked what I go by... THANK YOU. They then wrote down my preferred name on a wipe board. :D My preferred name and pronouns were used for the rest of the encounter except when they HAD to use my legal name. 

The anesthesiologist came by and introduced herself, and placed the IV. She even numbed the area before placing the IV!!! That was nice... I didn't even know it was placed. I explained that I was nervous to be having this procedure done under local anesthesia... The anesthesiologist chuckled, and said ""oh no hun, you will be out. We will give you Versed before we take you to the OR. We will give you Propofol, Fentanyl, and a cocktail of other drugs once in the OR."" She used drug names as she knew I was a medical student. I'd assume if you didn't know the names, she would have described things differently. This comforted me. 

Dr. Beck came by shortly after the IV was placed to see if I had any questions. She was very busy so we did not talk much. 

I laid in bed for 4 hrs before they came to get me for surgery. The very kind nurse checked on me and talked with me numerous times between arrival and going to the OR.

When they came to get me for the OR, they gave me versed IV and wheeled me to the OR. By the time I arrived at the OR (30 seconds later), I was quite foggy. I remember trying to get onto the VERY skinny operating table. They took my arms and did something to them. They told me something was going to burn... and then that was it. I remember nothing and don't remember anything burning.

I woke up to severe pain. Excruciating pain. 10/10 on their pain scale. Someone gave me dilaudid and asked for my pain on their scale. This continued until they gave me as much as they could give me. I was still VERY uncomfortable. I tried to fall asleep, but the respiratory depression from the dilaudid was causing me to not breath on my own. The machine kept beeping as I stopped breathing. I had to consciously breath for a while.  

Once things settled down a bit, they brought me graham crackers and water. Eventually they had me sit up and eat some more. They gave me a Norco for pain once I had eaten a decent amount. 

I was put in a wheel chair and wheeled down to the Uber that was to take me back to my hotel. 

The following hours were very frustrating as I was unable to urinate. I finally was able to urinate a very small amount by midnight - It took so much concentration. I was not prepared mentally for the difficulty of not being able to urinate. This continued for 2 days. I was ABLE to pee, but it took all the tricks in the book; tapping on my bladder, pushing, warm washcloths, concentration, etc...

This was completely resolved within 4 days. The pain was managed quite well with staying strict to taking Norco every 6 hrs and iceing nearly constantly. By 72hrs post-op, I stopped the pain meds and switched to Naproxen and Ice. 

Now, at 9 days post-op, I have very minimal pain, but I still am uncomfortable. Most, if not all the swelling is gone. There was very little swelling to begin with. I have noticed that long days on my feet wear me out and exacerbate the pain a lot. 

The cost before insurance was ~5,000 and my insurance covered most of it since I was in-network. She also is signing the gender marker change medical affidavit! 

If you have any questions, feel free to message me. 

Again, I feel I must reiterate how wonderful Dr. Beck was. She has inspired me to go into that area of medicine and surgery. The single nicest doctor I have ever had the pleasure of meeting... I have met and worked with many. She was fantastic. 

Love, 
E.

A few people pointed out that this was offensive, I can't figure out why.


You may object to the term 'women' and 'men' without specifying which kind of gender the poster ment but I think everyone here realizes that when most people who are not familiar with the trans community say that someone looks like a women, they mean that they see the stereotypical features that are typically seen with biological women. So with that out of the way, what is there left to be offended about? Or is this not offensive?

IdounBlue,asktransgender,A question for those in male dominated fields.,"So.

I've changed all my documents and seem to pass to just about everyone I meet now days, but I have some concerns. 

Firstly: how have you all felt the environment is, working with a typically male dominated labor field? What's the harassment and attitudes like towards women?

Secondly: My husband to be and his brother work there. All be it in parts, we would barely see each other. His entire family doesn't know I'm trans. I'm worried that when/if one of the other techs finds out, both myself and my hubby2b would be harassed and such. Not to include the delight of his brother finding out and eventually the whole family life going down a rocky path once that's out of the bag. So. I suppose the question here would be: have you been outed, or worked out of the closet as trans in a male dominant tech field, and how's that worked?

Maybe I'm just paranoid. I don't know."

I don't think I've had a 'normal' relationship with my father during my childhood.
I think our relation should have been made of conflicts, mental fights, etc... It wasn't the case. On the contrary, I had the constant will to make him happy (like getting good scores at school, making him proud of me, and sh*t like that...).
The relation with my mother was more superficial.... 
It actually looks as if I had missed the resolution of the Oedipus complex...
I have searched the wiki and found this :

*""In classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, a child's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex and of the Electra complex. This is a key psychological experience that is necessary for the development of a mature sexual role and identity.""*

And this is the best case scenario, it doesn't account for my complete lack of motivation and desire to do anything. It is completely ridiculous even to imagine that I'll have strength to go through those years of university when I can't even study at home in a pretty relaxed environment. 

I'm completely alone. Just recently I broke up with my boyfriend, who was basically only person who cared about me. Now, only people who give a fuck about me are internet strangers. I have no IRL friends and my parents are huge transphobes. 

I just don't know, it my life doesn't really work out. I can't force myself to study or work and if I don't work really hard I won't have a slightest chance of getting out of here.

It is just way easier to end all this than to try to do the impossible. I just don't see any options and, to be completely honest, I don't think life is somehow inherently good. "

Does anyone here have any experience with the Howard Brown clinic--if so, was it a good or bad experience? What should I expect when I call them? And their website doesn't say anything about phone call hours so is there any time you would recommend me calling them? Also, if you are on hrt through them, how long of a wait was it from your first visit to your first dose of hormones?

I know it's kind of a lot of questions. Answer whatever you're willing to and thanks for reading!

(p.s. I'm 17--turning 18 in july, i'm ftm, and my parents support my decision to start hrt)"
WitchDearbhail,asktransgender,Any clues that your parents already knew?,"For those whose parents figured out they were trans before you came out to them, did they ever drop hints that they knew?  What did they do?  There are times when I can't tell if my parents are dropping subtle hints that they suspect something or if some of the things they say are pure coincidence.

For the record, I don't live with my parents.  Without giving it away, I'm old enough that I have finished college and I am living elsewhere but I am in close contact with them."

AnnieRin,asktransgender,[Inspirational] Today's the day I planned on killing myself,"One year ago, right before my 29th birthday, I was at the lowest point emotionally in my entire life.  It wasn’t my marriage, wasn’t my job (ok a little my job), I just didn’t know what it was.  Then, it happened....

I was on vacation browsing reddit and youtube when I came across a transition video.  I knew I should’ve been born a girl, but never in my life did I think I would transition; I didn’t even know what transitioning was.  That video changed my life and the life of everyone around me forever.

The keyword was hormone replacement therapy.  That, along with hair removal, makeup etc. I saw that it was possible to look like a girl, that I was a girl, and could be treated like a girl.  I did so much research on being transgender that week and knew transitioning was what I had to do.

I was so depressed and knew I couldn’t continue living how I was so I made myself a very morbid promise, transition and be both publicly and privately a girl, or kill myself before I turned 30.

I knew I wouldn’t be able to handle another year how I was, let alone the rest of my life.  I had spent 29 years lying to myself… I thought, maybe if I could transition before I turn 30, I can at least spend the “second half” of my life how it was meant to be spent.  I figured if it didn’t work out, I could just kill myself anyway and It’d fix the problem.

Fast forward to August.  I’ve now come out to my wife, had a bit of laser hair removal and just gotten a prescription for HRT.  I didn’t even know how to feel… I was so happy yet so scared.  The first time I took everything, though, felt like absolute heaven.  A lot of people say it’s mostly psychological, but I swear I could feel the difference in myself not an hour later.

About 2 months later, I had officially decided on my new full name and was returning to work from a Leave of Absence… As a woman.  Sure there were many hickups on the way.  I knew not everyone there accepted me, but who cares?  I was finally out at work being treated and called by the name and gender I identified with.

I still hadn’t come out to all my family (and not even my immediately family!) even though I was out at work (awkward I know).  My immediate family was extremely accepting of everything and I am eternally grateful for that.  I was able to spend a week visiting them and everything went wonderfully introducing them to the real me.  My wife’s family was hit or miss, as expected, but things smoothed over for the most part.

A few months later, my bff in Arizona and I went into the courthouse to file paperwork.  It was finally time to officially change our name and gender.  In February my new DL was issued, listing F as my gender and Annika as my name.  I felt complete.  Now not just my friends, family and co-workers would see me as I really am, the entire world would.

And now here I am, just before my 30th birthday.  I pushed myself as hard as I could to transition and I made it.  I faced a brain tumor scare that took me off HRT.  My wife and I separated, but on very good terms.  My bff in Arizona attempted suicide.  I lost a few friends, but I’m better off without them.  It was the hardest year of my life, and I brought a lot of people, including my wife at the time, along for the ride but we made it.

I’m alive and I have no plans or thoughts of killing myself.  I’m going to start my 30’s how they were meant to be.  I’m going to be happy.  I’m going to be content.  I’m a woman.

For all you brothers and sisters out there, don’t give up.  It gets better.

Older_Wiser2,asktransgender,"MtF: Is she for real? Had ""the"" talk with my ex-wife...","So I had an unexpected conversation this weekend with my ex-wife .... we were married for 36 years and now apart for five years .... the split was *very* bitter but now we're actually good friends. After this many years and two kids having her as a friend is very important to me.

She invited me to spend the weekend at her place and I did ... separate bedroom of course... She's known about the hormones for about six months and seemed quite ""iffy"" about where this was going. Long story short - she's good with this but not good with a full transition ... it's hard to explain in a short post but she understands me and if we were to put gender on a Likert scale with male on one end as #1 and female on the other end as #10 she's very against me moving to a #10 --- very very very against. BUT - she's fine with somewhere in the middle - androgynous. I told her I don't think I've ever been a #1 but close. Now - I told her I'm more of a seven - I'll never be a #10 and that's my choice. I'm just going where the hormones take me.

I thought the conversation was about over - and then it happened --- she wanted to see my boobs and talk about bras. I'm about a C cup and now always wear a bra without wire. She always wears a bra with underwire and remarked that I should consider one as it would give me more shape and lift. Okay .... I'll give it some thought -- then she opens her dresser drawer and pulls out several of her bras and said, ""here - try this one on"" .... WTF???????????  At first I said ""no way"" but then she pushed a bit and, okay, I'll try it - but her frame is small - mine is not. Of course she had a solution - bra extenders and put one on .... the bra was white with a lot of lace, very low cut (seemed like maybe a balconette type maybe? My mind was reeling so I actually have no idea) ... AND then she says *""Wow! You look great! - We need the wires to give us girls shape and lift...""*  I about passed out ...... but our conversation and day was not over - she suggested a little makeup to cover some age spots on my face and then proceeded to give me a short lesson on applying makeup.

As this discussion needs to be focused on questions my one question to asktransgender is this --- *Has my wife of 36 years and mother to my two children been abducted by aliens and is this person in front of me an extra-terrrestrial?*

CrystalVivian,asktransgender,Coming out seems near impossible.,"I am 15 years old (Closeted MTF). My parents are registered liberals (though they have conservative views, and their reponse to LGBT issues is ""just let them be""). I don't know if thats a good response, but oh well. My brother, a die-hard conservative. The kind of person who says ""f-ck the blacks and the gays"".

Some people may remember my post about my ex girlfriend who was making it difficult to come out. I recently talked to her about it, and she agreed that it was immature and she was sorry. Thats settled for the most part. Now my issue is coming out.

My mom is probably the one who would accept it the most. She once said (about 8 years ago) that she would be okay if anyone in the family was gay or trans, she just doesn't understand it. I would like to tell her before my dad. My mom apparently cried when she found out that I was male, since she wanted a girl. Now that she is accustomed to a male me, I think it might be rough for her if I change it up again.

My dad is very vague about his political views. I think he will feel like he is losing one of his two sons. He will probably take time to adjust.

Now my brother, the biggest problem for me. Racist, conservative, and anti LGBT. He is honestly the kind of person who would start an anti-gay rally at a pride parade. I'm afraid that he will completely cut me out of his life. He is close to moving out of the house and I feel like if he ever chooses to see me after I come out, it wont be pleasant. 

People always refer to coming out as hard. For me, it seems impossible. It's one of those things that I can never see myself telling my parents. I have planned and planned but I never make progress.

Does anyone have any advice or a similar experience?

nothingyoucando2,asktransgender,People who don't pass but have been transitioning a long time?,"Hey there,

Sorry if the title is awkward, I wasn't sure how to phrase what I'm trying to say. 

Basically: Everyone I've ever spoken to since I started transitioning (two years) either a) passes eventually or b) doesn't pass but is in the relative early stages of their transition (like 4 years is the maximum I've seen). I've met ONE person who doesn't pass but has been transitioning for 15 years, but they kind of reintegrated into society in sort of a male-presenting genderqueer kind of way without even realizing it. They dress in their work uniform and wear no makeup and have their hair back during the week, have a girlfriend and appear as a straight couple but she (the trans woman) dresses up on the weekends. Part time, basically?

What happens to people who have been transitioning for a long time but never quite pass or feel comfortable? What are your lives like? Do you just sort of disappear? Get into a routine? Live on the internet? Go back to part-time/dude mode, especially with all this visibility backlash?

Thoughts?
Thanks."
neurophilos,asktransgender,Epiphany: a catch-22 condition for transitioning,"Turns out I've been giving myself a catch-22 condition for transitioning, and I just figured it out. I didn't want to transition if I could live with where I was already, out of deference for the people I love and concern for my career. But I also didn't want to transition as a reaction to someone or something that made me unhappy, because I would probably regret making that kind of a decision to alter myself just to try to solve a problem I still might not solve. Turns out that combination of conditions means I can only transition if I'm already miserable and transitioning wouldn't fix it, and I feel like an idiot. 

Now I've decided I should transition if and when there is a preponderance of evidence that it would make me happier, and I think I hit that milestone a while back. 

Anyone else have a similar experience? Any advice to those of us who find it hard to trust current self to do what's right for future self?"

I began crossdressing at a young age around six, and it stuck with me sexually all my life. I have felt attraction to both men and women, but sexually I have always wanted to be a woman.

plathhs,asktransgender,Why can't I ever get my thoughts straight?,"Ok, this is probably just another one of those posts in the ""Am I trans?""-category, but I can't help it. I'm going insane.

I got my diagnosis yesterday, and will be starting HRT shortly, along with hair removal and other stuff. And while I somehow feel really happy that it's all beginning to happen now, I still don't know how to handle these crazy doubts. And even worse than doubt, is the feeling of numbness or indifference. Like this thinking of transitioning is just a big distraction I put in the way of dealing with other ""real"" issues. I don't know.

Sometimes I feel like my thinking I'm trans or wanting to be trans (or whatever it is) just gets in the way of me living my life. Like it doesn't really matter that much what gender I am or how my body looks and feels. I'm so much else than just a gender, and most of the time when I don't think of any gender-related stuff I feel fine. I don't think I can really cope with transition making me have to think about my gender all the time. It feels like it will. I'd kind of just want to get on HRT and then forget all about transitioning, letting the hormones do their thing while I'm living my life.

Ok, this is quickly getting disorganized. Here are some things I worry about a lot:

* I have this mostly vague dream of having a female body, but I don't think I care that much about gender really. Why does it have to keep bothering me so much?
* All the people I'm out to support me. Yeah, that's great I suppose, but it's like I don't even care. I get quite annoyed or even angry when they ask me about being trans or transitioning. I don't know what to say most of the time. It feels like I have to prove something.
* I'm not even sure I'd like living the life of the girl I'm transitioning into. Like it's all just a fantasy that goes away in the morning.
* I try to take small steps in the direction of social transition (like wearing a bra, etc.), but it all makes me so self-conscious and uncomfortable.
* I feel like a complete fake, especially when I hear my own voice trying to talk about trans stuff. I get that this is really common, and that it might be dysphoria, but I just don't … Everything just feels wrong all of a sudden. I don't want my entire life to feel wrong.
* I cough, feel sick and my tongue feels like it's swelling (what's up with that?) from anxiety when I try to convince myself that I'm trans. Yeah, that's just it: I constantly feel the need to try to convince myself that this is real and not just some delusion.

What else? There's so much more … And I know, both you and I have read it a thousand times before and all the common replies as well. Nothing helps. I just can't get past it all. I'm stuck. Sorry for rambling.

**tl;dr** Medical transition is up ahead, but I'm utterly confused about everything, and everything just feels plain wrong all the time, but I still somehow feel like I *want* to transition (what is this ""want"" anyway?). Help?"

Thefanoodler,asktransgender,Thinking of apologizing to this girl,"Chalk this post up to revelations you have in deep thought at 2am.

To try and put this as best as I can, back before I started transitioning or even realized/came out as trans I had this friendship with this girl.  Or looking back now, I'm not sure friendship is the best term to use. Perhaps at best we were acquaintances. We had what I thought were some good times while we knew each other but things eventually got out of hand as I was attracted to her and generally just made mistake after mistake in those regards.  

By the time she left to transfer colleges, she had sent me a message basically saying that she never really liked me and felt awkward around me and wanted me to stop talking to her.  Needless to say I ended up confused, angry, whatever you might expect from a guy that heard that said to him.  I complained to my friends about it, called her names, what have you.  

Some of this ordeal lasted into when I did realize I was trans, however any social transition was quite a ways away.  And as of late I've started reaching that point where you start getting treated differently or where people expect different behavior from you.

A prime example of this revelation I've had is very much so interacting with guys.  As it turns out, someone in my circle of friends finds me extremely attractive, or so they said drunkenly one night.  The thing is, I've always felt awkward and uncomfortable around him even before he said that and I've been honestly embarrassed to see so much of my old self in him.  I see it in the way he messages me like I did with her.  I see it in the way he just gets up in my personal space like he's entitled to it, much like I did with her. I see it in the way I end up responding to him in such a manner as to not provoke any hostility, much like I now realize she did with me.

It's just come as such a sort of punch in the face when I feel I'm in some uncomfortable situation and suddenly it Dawn's on me "" oh my god this is exactly what I put her through "".  I realize that I mistook her choosing to not be a bitch to me as friendship, when realistically your choices in that situation are: be seen as a bitch and risk inciting some kind of hostility or simply don't, and try and deal with it.

I just think that now I see some awkward situation between a man and woman and think "" what the hell leave her alone she clearly doesn't want you bothering her! "" only to realize at one point I was that exact same guy doing it.

And I know we left off on that sour note, but we also have a butt ton of mutual friends and have still run into each other on occasion.  The last time, she actually started the conversation and bothered to come up and give a hug good bye and to put that in some kind of perspective, the time before that we didn't even make eye contact out acknowledge each other's existence.  So I think at the very least an apology would be fair ground."
blaineisthetruth,asktransgender,Some serious doubts... [MtF] Were you sure?,"Hi guys, where to start?

I've visited my psychologist and therapist a few times already and I think I'm few months from starting HRT. My coming out to my closest friend went super well, she is incredibly supportive and everything... Most importantly I know that I am a woman, I knew it my entire life...

Despite all of this, the closer and more real it gets, the more terrified I am, as if my mind wanted to snap back one final time.
I have so much at stake, so many people I don't want to lose, Even smaller things are constantly on my mind, for example I am scared I will not have hair regrowth and will be stuck with my receding hairline or a wig.

Were you 100% sure before starting HRT? Right know I feel stuck having two bad choices ahead of me and feeling cheated by life.

Could you please share some wise words, people of reddit?"
katie-elizabeth,asktransgender,"Has anyone else ever accidentally came out to a girlfriend/boyfriend, without realizing what that meant?","I'm thinking back to a few years ago when I was seeing a girl.  It wasn't anything serious, and we didn't intend for it to get serious - just some bedroom fun and hanging out while we both got back on track with our lives. 
  
I guess because of this I felt more able to be honest with her.  ""I really think I was a girl born in a guys' body"" I told her once.  She seemed perplexed by that statement at first, but a few days later she commented out of the blue, *""You know when you told me that thing about being a girl?  I think it's actually true - I think you really are a girl in a guys' body.*""  
 
At first I kind of got defensive.  I hadn't meant it like I was transgender or anything!  I was just referring to how I generally felt about life and saw the world!  I even went so far as to wonder if it was a below-the-belt insult....  
  
But now I look back and it feels like one of the most validating moments of my life.  Here I was honest with someone who didn't really want anything from me, nor I her, and she gave me an honest and perfect assessment:  
  
I wasn't some weirdo or pervert.  I'm transgender.

throwawaytranss,asktransgender,Considering de-transition? I don't know what to do.,"Details: 

* Around 20 years old, around 1 year HRT. MtF. 

* Out to friends/family/public. Accepting. Do not present female, present androgynous and live as male (but use female name). 

* For me, I am not okay with being a non-passing transwoman. I am not okay looking like a man in girls clothing, or a guy trying to be a girl. That is the worst thing I can ever imagine, and I do not want to change this mindset. It may be internalized transphobia, but I am not open to changing this. 


With that said, the problem here is that after 1 year I am not happy. I have been more depressed than ever in my entire life. I am happier with how I look now than I ever have been, but I am so far from my goal that I feel even worse than ever. I just don't think I will be able to pass, because if I look at the timeline for effects of HRT, it seems like I have another.... maybe 12 months of major changes, and maybe 24 months if you really want to make it seem longer than it is. The issue I have is that while some things have changed (legs, arms, etc?) my face is just so awful and causes me a lot of sadness. My shoulders and overall body shape too. I am trying to lose weight, but I fear that even if I get to my goal, I will not be happy. I would consider FFS for sure, but I have no way of paying for that for another 2+ years. How am I supposed to live years while not passing then? I can't look like a girl, but I can't live as a guy either. I am not okay with not passing, I would definitely become even more depressed and suicidal. 



The problem is my life is sort of, all around the girl/trans thing. I am literally moments away from changing my name and gender marker. All my friends know about my situation. I just.... don't look the part at all, and I just feel like there is no guarantee that I will in another 3-12 months even if I do everything I can. It's actually highly unlikely. 



All of this leads to me thinking ""maybe I should just try to live as a feminine guy?"". I think it may be possible, I wouldn't be as happy and stuff, but I may be able to do it if I try I guess? I don't know. I just know I cannot live as a non-passing transwoman. The problem is, how do I go about that if I do just want to live as a feminine cis man for now? Do I just cancel my plans to change my name and gender marker, and then not tell my new friends? I am planning to switch campuses next semester anyway. I could just keep taking estrogen in secret I guess? I mean, I want to be a very feminine guy anyway. Maybe this would take off a lot of the pressure for me, if I just lived as a feminine guy (I could even wear girl skinny jeans and paint my nails) and took estrogen secretly? 



EDIT: I have decided to cancel my plans to change my gender marker and legal name, but will continue taking hormones. I will think about whether I want to disclose my transgender status when I swap campuses next semester. This semester I was very open about it, as I was beginning to transition. With my current results and feeling, maybe I will try living as a feminine guy for awhile until the hormones allow me to pass. I will also see about getting a gender therapist. 

Thanks :)

It wasn't really until about a year ago that I decided to really consider what was going on and look further into it. But, the point of the story is that I'm not sure I can do anything about it. I live in the south, more specifically SC, and in case you haven't heard, almost the entire south is transphobic, but especially the Carolinas (what with this bathroom bill nonsense). My parents are both pretty aligned with that stereotype, which means telling them has been out of the picture from day 1. I was able to hold this in until recently when it really started to bother me, to a point where my parents and counselor (for unrelated things like anxiety and ADD) have started to be concerned. I have friends I've told, some of whom are actually experienced with almost identical issues, but I still feel constantly depressed. So my question here is what can I do? Telling my parents would almost certainly result in the next three years of high school being a living hell, not to mention the anti anything progressive majority of the student body. I've thought about talking with the aforementioned counselor, but there's only so much they can do. I really don't know what to do. I don't know if there's anything I can do. Any advice?

Tl;dr: I am at an age and place where coming out would make my life unbearable. "

Sex change and HRT is illegal here, therefore I wanna self-med.
However, Im afraid to post my hormones (Im want to get them from qhi.co.uk) as it will have to pass border control.
I will have to fill out forms telling exactly whats inside, how much of it, how I am going to use it...
If they get any suspision they will open it.
Im gonna order hormones 200 euros worth so Im afraid to lose all this money if mones dont pass the border.
Also, I am afraid they might ask for prescribtion but HRT is illegal here and its impossible to get it.

Have u ever had any problems with postal border control for HRT? Do u think its risky or am I being paranoid?"
nothingyoucando2,asktransgender,What happens if you don't pass after FFS?,"Or only pass some of the time?

I feel like FFS is this milestone that people have waiting for them if they don't pass with just HRT and there's this assumption that once you get FFS you're definitely going to pass. 

But what happens if you don't? What happens if you're *right there*?

Do you get more FFS, revisions? Deal with it?
See if the hormones keep doing their 5 year thing?

Zazh95,asktransgender,My family situation,"I'm in a delicate situation with my family. I live with my father and my brother. I came out to my mom six years ago and she outed my to all my family. Few days after I talked with my father who already knew from my mother. Since then I was very very happy because I saw them very comprehensive. The situation remained still for years since actually my mother was very anxious and not accepting towards transition and she also told me that she would have not talked to me anymore if I had transitioned. My father seemed more accepting but quite indifferent, too quiet. My mother passed away in January 2015.. That was really hard because she was the only in my family which I used to share all my struggle of being trans (even if her reaction was always so catastrophical). After two months my father told me that he would have sustained my transition. I was happy! I started going to a therapist and in November 2015 I started HRT. From that date, he became colder and colder, and now I'm very sad because I would like my family used the right pronouns and my name. As I told them to do that, they replied coldly 'okay'. But they never do that, they don't even effort. I heard my aunt saying to my dad that this situation is ridiculous and it's ridiculous to call me with female pronouns and name. My father agreed. I'm just crying right now. I don't know how to communicate with them since I've tried so bad but it's useless.. I can't even imagine how it would be hard with the rest of the family.. They will hate me more and more."

I plan to begin transition in college (possibly over the summer, but mainly in college). It has a three star rating on the campus pride index, and USC has 4.

laidymondegreen,asktransgender,I want to be a good ally. Advice?,"I am a member of the LGBT community but not trans. Frequently in recent days I find myself in discussions with people who are in favor of laws such as the one in place in NC. Very often, the people in question know almost nothing about what it means to be trans or the issues that trans individuals face. I've been trying to help combat that lack of education and have polite discussions with people explaining the parts of the puzzle that they're not seeing. 

However, at least once now I've shared something only to later see a trans friend post (not directed at me) that this particular item was problematic. The thing I am specifically thinking of is the pictures of very stereotypically masculine trans men and stereotypically feminine trans women, with captions asking if you really want this man/woman in your women's/men's restroom. I hadn't realized how invalidating that can be to individuals who don't present, or don't want to present, in such stereotypical ways. 

So what I'm asking is whether there's any coherent message or argument or set of explanations out there that is approved by the transgender community (or at least by some, since of course getting everyone's agreement and approval is impossible) that I can read and use as the basis for my conversations?

On one hand I feel unqualified to have these conversations, even after the research that I've done and discussions that I've had with friends. I don't want to accidentally spread information that is false or problematic. On the other hand, I don't want to sit around silently while hatred and misinformation exists.

Lets start from the beginning, I have always played female in games, or any type of fiction, I used to it was "" to have something nice to look at"" but i knew it was more than that. I have never been attacked to men but have never really felt happy as a man myself. The question of transgender-ism did not really come up till sophomore/junior year and for the longest time i simply thought it was depression and me being unhappy with myself/wanting change i may did not really want. The thought never went away though. Then recently i have started dating a girl, I lover with every fiber of my being. She was the first and only person i ever talked to about this and she helped me figure out my feeling on transgender-ism. Now i am genuinely thinking about going through with it, i i am want to be female but i am scared about what people will think of me during the long transitional period, what if after HRT i don't look feminine? What if my voice stays they way it is? It scares me and i really want to make sure this is what I want and i am not just doing some weird phase thing. I do really want to be female but i don't have a super attraction to men, and am not all to feminine in action ( i don't like dresses or any loose clothing for that matter.) I am confused and unsure of what to do, I will be talking to my therapist Tuesday about this (for the first time) but i felt is hould ask some actual MtF transgenders before that.

 I should have hurried youth, in truth,

 And moved more quickly on -

 *I should have made the most of youth,*

 *Before the time was gone.*







 I should have followed fancy, free,

 Before it thought to fade -

*I should have picked a good degree,*

*Or found myself a trade.*





 I should have stopped to stare above;

 To share another's dreams -

 *I should have never welcomed love,*

 *And lost it all, it seems.*






 No matter what the aim or end -

 No matter what you do -

 Regrets are part of life, my friend:





Don't let them conquer *you.*

BellaEllaElla,asktransgender,"I'm transitioning mtf, but sometimes I still feel male, does anyone ever experience this?","Is that sort of like being bigender? I still sometimes feel male and it makes me feel like a fraud because I feel this way. It's making it tough for me to own it and be confident to my family who want to understand my situation, but I haven't even mentioned this part because I've been having a tough time as it is, this would make them think I am uncertain, then again they already do.

I don't always visualize myself living as a woman, yet I want to be one. I know these thoughts will never go away. Might just be that I need time to adjust. I definitely don't have much confidence to wear dresses in front of ppl even if they're supportive of me. I have worn skirts a few times though. Idk, Maybe I do just need to adjust, after all, I'm used to living one way for 24 years.

This emotional distress has been draining though to say the least. The thought of all of this struggle makes me tell myself that I would rather die and not have to deal with making such a big decision. How do people make these decisions so confidently without double thinknig their decisions?

Does anyone else ever experience this?"

Fact is, I'm lonely.  I have a best friend (cis woman) and other people around, but I want to kiss and hold someone again.  It's been years, a lot of them.  In fact I'm not even sure I can honestly say I've ever been in love.  Everything from before was me faking it.

Then I encounter people in the trans friendly personals and dating apps... and frankly YUCK!  I mean, no, I'm not some naughty thing.  I'm a person not a fetish.  Besides, I don't want sex.  I'm not even sure what sex would be like for me now.

I just feel so like I'll never fit with another person, regardless of their gender.  No idea where I'd meet such a person, or what I'd even say to them if I did.

Mitsunee,asktransgender,I don't know what to do anymore,"So...I've dropped out of school 16 months ago. At the time I was addicted to the MMO Tera, where I also had a really nice group of people. This is also where I came out as being transsexual, after pretty much keeping it a secret for years. I told my mom around september '15. She used her work connections to get me at least one chance for psychologic help. That person has now not called for like 5months, so I guess that's all I got out of that work connection of my mom. The wait lists for other people who could offer help are at least 2 years long, but I can't wait that long. I'm literally at the end of my strength. I keep asking people on the internet for help, keep annoying my mom with it, but I can't find a job, can't find any help, I feel like I can't do anything.

I tried using my few webdev skills to make something and maybe get some money via ads, but that never happend, as I would need a credit card, which I can only get if I ever find a job. I also called every school in my region, but none has any space left that they can/would offer me.

I don't know what to do anymore. Other people are telling me, that I should be happy, that I can play videogames all day, but that is just a mere timesink for me. I just want to be who I am, do something to earn me the things in life that would make me happy and find someone to live with. Is that really that much to ask for?"
gamespluscience,asktransgender,Feeling miserable. I thought telling more people about how I'm questioning my gender would make it easier for me but it just seems worse.,"A month ago I started feeling a bit weird and came to this place with a few questions about whether I was trans or not. Since then I've gone on to try various things like cross-dressing, wearing make-up and even doing my nails. I felt really happy doing these things, I've always hated trying new things so feeling happy about this made me suspect I was trans.

I went on to tell a few friends that I was probably trans and when we'd go hang out together I felt good and could be myself around them (talking about my nails and cute boys we saw). The more people I came out to however the more I started feeling miserable when I was by myself. Things about my body started upsetting me a lot more. A month ago I was fine with having hairy legs and now I can't stand hair being anywhere other than on my head. I feel like shit when I look in the mirror and can't tell who the fuck I'm looking at.

About a week ago I decided to tell my mum that I'm trans and she showed so much support going as far as to buy me some nail polish (she'd noticed I'd been doing my nails). And yet even though I've come out to my mum and some of my close friends I feel even worse. I've started to hate myself more, become even more detatched from people and for the past month every time I get in the shower I just have a breakdown and cry for ages.

Today I had one of my close friends come over. I made pizza and we played Splatoon for a few hours before I had to drop her at the train station. I had a great time. Within about 10mins of getting home I immediately started feeling like shit again. I should be really happy!

It doesn't mean that I'm stupid or brainwashed by magazine adds, but the fact that I put out that vibe is really starting to make me second guess myself. How should I deal with this?

orbital121,asktransgender,Occasional doubts and my mum isn't helping. Advice?,"So I've recently been outed to my parents as trans (MtF) due to an unfortunate letter sent from my GP that my mum was snooping around whilst i was busy one weekend.

She isnt sure that its what i really want and is worried i'm gonna make a permanent mistake and that I've 'self diagnosed' myself wrong. Moreover she's said some pretty painful things whilst drunk to me that have really lingered. (For example; ""Your granddad is one of eight children, and you are the only male child of our family in your generation"" pairing that with him being a ""mans-man"" . This almost made me feel like i'm betraying my family and made me want to just run away from them all.)

I know what i want. Its unconventional and weird (To my mum at least). I don't really care for frilly dresses and the such but would rather just be a girl as i am now. How can i explain this to my mum without her responding with some stupid response (Like ""are you sure you're not just gay?"" and ""do you even really need to be a girl then? like does it really matter that much?"" (and a further note, I've responded yes to this and she doesn't seem to listen))

My GP has been trying to redirect me to specific agencies but to no avail and from what i can tell she doesn't know where to send me... On top of it all i keep getting this horrible looming feeling that i'm wrong. If my GP doesn't know what to do, what then? i literally have no idea where to go...

On an additional note i just came back from a 1 week holiday in the Mediterranean getting drunk and pretending to be my boy self in order to see if i do want to transition and i'm just content. Like it doesn't pain me to be this guy(most of the time) but i just feel like id prefer it as a girl. and that's my problem. I have no concrete base to back what i want on... How can i justify this to myself? (let alone my family...?)

CranberrySunscreen,asktransgender,I think I'm just going to let people think I'm a gay guy. What do you think?,I don't pass which I'm okay with but I'd rather come off as a genderfluid gay guy or something than dealing with people knowing I'm trans. I feel like there are way too many expectations. Being genderfluid doesn't really have to have anything to do with being trans. I think it might be easier. I don't really consider myself mtf just genderfluid I suppose so that might take some of the edge off in the first place. I'm totally rethinking my flair now. It's hard to ignore my transness though. I feel like it's a part of me but not the part I want most people to know. I feel compelled to tell people I'm trans when they're nice to me or open up to me. I think it's way too much and I can't help it. Maybe I'm just trying to convince myself of something I'm not or already know that I am. Like telling people is supposed to make me feel better. I think I just think about gender too much so I through it in there randomly and people aren't ready for it.

Will I be okay? I can't find any info on actual average/good measurements for someone my height. My shoulders stick out a good 1-2 inches beyond my hips on either side, and I'm really hoping that the hips will catch up :(. I'll probably lose an inch of perceived shoulder due to muscle loss, but I wonder how much the waist will shrink and the hips will grow. Also my band just seems huge when I look in the mirror :( but I don't think that'll shrink."

[deleted],asktransgender,Tips on growing hair [MtF],"Hi! I know that this might not seem the right subreddit to post a question like this, but there are details.

My hair is really dense and thick. I can't just lay my hair to one direction. Everytime I tried to grow my hair I end up with, having a biig looking heead, very ""bad"" hair structure, and it's not like a girl's hair, even with the same lenght as a girl, my hair doesn't look like a girl's. So, here is a question, would my hair grow like girl's if I just let it go? Here's another two, how should I have my hair cut/should I have my hair cut for ""growing"" purposes?

These are like the way I want my hair to be,

I just post here, because my biological gender is male. I thought that there would other people who are experiencing the same problem as me.

ashleythepeach,asktransgender,The Pre-HRT Emotional Roller coaster,"Alright, so to begin with I'm assuming this is a general pre-HRT thing (maybe?), but for my own sanity i just want to get it off my chest and make sure I'm actually not loosing my mind

I've been up and down with my emotion's ever since i started exploring the possibility i was ever trans a couple of years back, i spent weeks where I happily enough live as a man without much care, to other weeks where it's hit me real hard that I am not acting or living as my true self, i sort of got adjusted to it over time and just managed to keep on living like that, finding it easy to bottle up everything and keep on surviving mentally 

Since early this year that frequency has increased 10 fold, from day in/day out to sometimes a matter of hours between the two, i also have these periods that i just feel emotionally blank, I'm not sad, happy or Angry I'm just empty, nothing can change it, it makes it hard to take interest in anything, i just want to sit there and stare at the wall or just lay in bed and wait for something to change, eventually I'll snap out of it or if it's night time i will just go to bed and then wake up totally oblivious to what my mind was going through the night before

It freaks me out a little sometimes when i find time to think back on it and wonder if i have some deeper mental issues than just being Trans?

Or have i just been bottling up these feelings and emotions for so long that my brain has had enough and the only way to make these better is to start moving forward with my transition, instead of just being excepting of who i am while continuing to live as a man?

Or am i just crazy???      "

HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,Am I wrong to be mad at my mom for this?,"My parents like to invalidate my feelings without realizing it. My dad always takes my mom's side in scenarios like this, so I didn't even bother trying to talk it out/vent to him.  

So my mom doesn't think I should wear a dress to my cousins wedding.  I don't think I'm ready to anyway, but I wanted to see what she said.  I don't want to take attention away from my cousin anyway, so no bother.  That's not the issue.  The next morning, I overhear her talking to her sister (my cousin's mom) about it, in a way that bemoans her hesitation about me being trans.  She says ""yeah he wants to wear a dress, but I don't think he should etc etc"" and then she denies that she talked to her sister about anything relating to me when I asked. 

Yeah I shouldn't eavesdrop but it was about me, and further, when I asked, she denied outright that she was talking about me, in a way that it looked like she didn't even realize what I was referring to.  So then she gets back on the phone with her sister and I'm right next to her, and you know what she does?  She gets all excited about going dress shopping with her sister for their dresses for the wedding.  *Honestly.* 

She has no regard or even *awareness* of my feelings.  I'm sitting there dumbfounded as they talk excitedly about going to look for dresses.  Fuck me, right?  It'd be useless to complain because similar times I tried and they invalidate me, saying things like, ""give us a break, this is new to us"" or ""we might never understand how you feel"".  But to me its basic human emotions!  Haven't they tried walking in someone elses shoes? I think its because deep down, part of them doesn't want to understand.  Part of them still sees me as their son, too.  "
BTPent,asktransgender,St. Luke's Endo Appointment in 4 months. What is their procedure and is there a faster way?,"Hi. I've been lurking through askTG since late August last year. I've been in therapy since November, have come out to my parents and felt like I was on the brink of finally starting HRT.

However, I just made the appointment with St. Luke's Endo in their Barry Road branch in Kansas City, and the date is set at July 21. This is terrible.

I live near Platte City, MO, and am having difficulty finding an alternative. Cynthia Glass, who is mentioned frequently, is over an hour away, and their doesn't seem to be something closer, or any sort of IC clinic practically at all.

I need to know if someone else has been in my situation before, and which (if any) alternative doctors there are available.
If ultimately I'm forced to wait for the July 21st appointment, how does St. Luke determine whether they'll give me medication or not?"

HyenaNow,asktransgender,Can't balance my Estrogen levels,"I had bottom surgery last summer (~8 months ago), and ever since then, I can't get my E levels to a safe and healthy place.

I inject with Estradiol Valerate 20 mg.  Taking half that dosage (10 mg) my numbers last month at midpoint were under ~120 pg/mL E, and T was 43 ng/dl. 

I started taking the full dose again a month ago (20 mg) and my latest numbers were ~1050 pg/mL E, and T was 37 ng/dl.

I also supplement with T cream since post op, my levels were under 3ng/dl.

Preop, my E was ~400 pg/mL and T was under ~5 ng/dl.

My Endo wants me to cut my dosing again, which I agree 1,000 is too much, but I've also started to feel really good again for the first time in months, after enduring fluxuations in E, that were mostly on the low side.

My depression really kicks in when my E gets on the lower side, and it's been hard.

Any advice would be appreciated.

mooqwert,asktransgender,Hidden facts about transgender? What do you think?,"https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/104381245/ What do you think about that link? Often people do talk about the fact that you are born being transgender.  Some people do talk about autogenphyle (agp) and HSTS transgender.  But it is often against autogynphyle people.  Or it says that all autogynphyle people are attracted to women and vice versa.  But there are gay people, cant you be agp and heterosexual? Also with age, ""all hsts transgender people transition before 24 but what if you are more closer to the middle of the gender spectrum but still on one side, so you can put up with living as the opposite gender well?  Plenty of intersex people who are also transgender transition late.  I really don't think that the two groups are as defined as people think.

lobbedgrenade,asktransgender,"17, ftm, almost homeless in Chicago due to family violence, need advice","TL,DR: I’m 17 going on 18, living with my family is worse than ever due to violence/manipulation, no reason to stay here, considering going to Chicago to find a homeless shelter that doesn’t report minors to the police, I'm also ftm transgender. I need to know of any resources available in Chicago for kids in my situation. If you want to know any more details, read below.


My life has always been a bit of a massive bullcrap clump. Right now, my home situation is worse than ever (and that’s saying something). I’m going to stick to all the possible “need to know” things here.


•I’m 17 (18 in july)

•I live with my mother and 21 year old brother. My brother is extremely violent and i would not be surprised if he tried to kill me or my mother. I already know he’s thought out how he would go about hurting us because when he get’s angry he can’t help but shout his plans--he’s been this way as long as i can remember and i would call the police when he’s having an episode but i would rather not be sent to social workers. My mother is not physically abusive, but mentally abusive--I won’t waste time describing her just know she’s done terrible things and at one point had a restraining order to stay away from local school parks because of the things she would say to people.

•I came out as transgender in October. My mother is supportive enough to not shun me, but because of who she is, I know she’s willing to use my “transness” against me.

•I’m not in Chicago but have access to a bus and it’s the place that sounds most helpful for people in my shoes.


I’m more comfortable with the idea of being in a homeless shelter than being here. There’s nothing here for me; hardly any personal possessions, no school, no friends, no job, no family I belong to, no feeling of safety... Days go by and I won’t leave my room because I'm scared to encounter any of the people I live with.


I need to know what homeless shelters in Chicago are trans-friendly and won’t report minors to the police (or if there is someone in Chicago willing to let me room with them; I won’t be able to offer any money until I can find a job but y’know, just putting that out there). Has anyone grew up in a similar situation to me? If you did, what did you do to get out? And also, I turn 18 in July, so do you think it might be worth just waiting until then to leave? I just don’t want police involved, and waiting until I'm 18 can almost guarantee that they won't get involved.

If you need any more details in order to provide substantial information, comment and I can answer. Thanks for any and all information you have to offer.

I wanted to thank everyone who put up with my questions over the weeks I've posted on here. I've decided decided to put an immediate end to my life tomorrow once I get certain things in order after coming out to my father today and his disapproval over the phone. I won't force him to change his ideals as he cannot force me to live a life bound his ideals. I haven't made any real friends on here but thanks to everyone who supported me in the topics I submitted to this sub. I do not want to attempt a fruitless transition in a world where I am the lowest being for being black, transgender and ugly. Waiting for myself to become independent is not an option as I am already starting to experience a quickly receding hairline and my body is fairly masculine, hairy and beyond fixation without immense effort. I have read many times that once I am 25 it only goes downhill from there in terms of transitioning. It doesn't seem logical or worth it anymore to stay on this Earth and attempt to live freely when I can simply be free in death.

Thank you again for putting up with me and goodbye."
nonamegivenyet,asktransgender,"I'm feeling scared about transitioning, and how to go about it [TW]","I don't think I can do this. Yes, I've questioned my gender a lot. Yes, I've gotten an answer. Yes, I'm trans. That much is apparent, I'm bored of second thinking it anyways.

But now that I know this, everything isn't instantly solved. Now that I know that I am trans, now that I've told a few very close friends and now that I have a hidden wardrobe of cute clothing... I'm lost about what to do.

I want to start HRT, but my psych wants to wait for my parents to be on our side rather than cause problems. I want to dress up and be who I am, but I'm scared people will look at me like I'm a freak. And they will. And sometimes I feel like they're right. I mean, I've gone out once or twice with nail polish on the last few weeks. I'll probably do it again. I feel more comfortable with my body that way. But even then, I usually curl up my fingers and put them in my pockets as much as I can to hide it. Wearing the shoulderless top and the cute flowery skirt hidden at the very deepest part of my skirt seems like an impossible task. 

I'm just really lost. How do I do this? Do I have to one day decide ""this is enough"" and wear a skirt and go out? I haven't even dressed up when alone for the last few months simply because it gives me an anxiety attack to do so.

iluvwimun,asktransgender,My grandma wants more concrete evidence and I don't know how to respond.,"

So I out to most of my family. I haven't had one unaccepting member yet (cuz I knew who to tell) but my grandma seems to be the most involved and concerned. I love this about her but she seems to also be my biggest potential roadblock. She wants to have absolute 100% proof that I am trans and I have know idea what to tell her. We had a discussion for a full day over the matter and we talked about things from testing if I was XXY, to testing of my testosterone level is off balance, to brain mapping. 

One of the good things, though is she called her therapist friend who gave her two therapists in my area that deal with trans issues, which is nice. But she is worried that they will steer me one way or another rather than take a neutral outlook on things. She keeps saying ""you don't know what you don't know"" and refers to her issues with hormones as her experience. 

She thinks informed consent is bullshit, I have an appointment in late June and she knows that, but she thinks that it's a place where you sign papers and get meds and the doctors aren't held liable over major complications that occur, and I don't know how to convince her otherwise. I'm not sure there is convincing her I am trans but I wanna know if there is something, ANYTHING, that will give her some peace of mind.

I can already see she's trying to turn me away from HRT by telling me that I need to ""live my life to the fullest"" (because I'm moving out of my parents this June) and do other things before you come to this important decision but she'll still love me and accept me no matter what decision I make in life. Thing is, I'm 23 and have already lived my life as a male this long and moving out is not going to change my mind.

I know this is hard for them. I do want to be as accommodating as possible. But there is a point to where I can't fulfill their requests. Concrete proof? Me feeling like this since I was 11 is somehow a potential ""obsession"". Does anybody have ways to give more concrete evidence. Talking to a therapist will definitely help, but more for me and not for them. Brain mapping and chromosome testing won't prove a thing, especially considering that I don't express any symptoms of the latter. Hormonal imbalance? Again no symptoms and even if I have symptoms there are plenty of people that have a hormonal imbalance one way or another that aren't transgender.

I know I don't have any solid questions, I just needed to vent, but if you have anything that can lead to a solutions I would love to hear it because once I go on HRT my situation is probably going to get much much worse."
EmilyATrans,asktransgender,Thinking about telling my mom tomorrow,"I've spent a long time trying to ignore or deny being trans and I want to transition. But I'm on my mom's insurance. I can't get my own. I don't know exactly what she sees when she gets paperwork or whatever from the insurance company, but I'm fairly certain she sees who I'm going to. I've started seeing a therapist all ready and my mom hasn't said anything yet.


I can tell her I'm going to the therapist for anxiety (which is also true), but I can't exactly make up an excuse for going to an endo. So if I want to start hormones, I kind of have to tell her.


The thing is, I have NO idea how she's going to react. She's very religious but also politically liberal but also sometimes ribs me for not being very masculine but also really loves me but also tries to tell me how to live my life sometimes? I have equal reason to expect her to be totally supportive or totally unsupportive. And that terrifies me. And then there's my dad. Even more of a wild card, but my plan there is to tell my mom and whether she's supportive or not, adapt my dad strategy from there.

I do pass and I do live as a man (I'm a trans man btw.) but sometimes I wish I didn't. My boyfriend was really popular in high school. At first. Everyone loves him. But I ruined it. I ruined it because passing turned this popular guy into this weird gay guy. Of course his friends stuck by him but there's no way a gay guy would stay popular. I miss not passing. I miss holding his hand in public, I miss getting quick kisses in public. And now we can't because now we are gay.

GersemiValkyr,asktransgender,Questioning whether I'm a MtF Transexual or not,"So, for a while now I've been questioning my sexuality as to whether I am transgender or not this has been going on since I was around 12 (I'm 15 now) and I'm not sure how to go about describing this...

So, for a while I've always thought I'm more female mentally, as I've always felt more empathic, sensitive and in tune with other people (sorry if that was sexist in any bit.) and I've never fully understood how my guys think. And that could be because all of my friends are female (with the exception of a FtM friend...would that really count as a female friend? I'll just say male.) because I just seem to get along better with girls than guys.
Another thing I kind of want to add, I've read about other people's MtF experiences where they enjoy wearing feminine clothing (which there's nothing wrong with that, heck, my best friend gives me her t-shirts that don't fit her and I'm fine with wearing them) but for some odd reason I've never really felt like feminine clothing would fit me (maybe because I don't have a sense of style yet and I'd love to wear geeky clothes like T-shirts and hoodies, like I've just started wearing beanies)
Oh, and about naming, I've never really had a problem with my name and pronouns so I'm questioning whether I'd like having a female name would be like and being addressed 
with female pronouns. (I haven't experimented at all with it)
Oh, before I go into further details involving possible gender dysphoriaI'd to say that I'm heterosexual in my orientation, so I guess if I transitioned I would become lesbian.

So, for a bit now I've felt as though I'm uncomfortable with how I feel with my body. Being 15 and going through puberty I'm feeling uncomfortable with hair growing everywhere, especially on my face and developing an Adam's apple, it just feels wrong to have hair on my legs for example, to the point where I've actually shaved the hair off and kept it secret. (and I have to say, shaving my legs feels good, just the feeling of having smooth legs is good) I also have felt uncomfortable with... Well... What's down there... It just feels out of place there, and I'm extremely self-conscious about it to the point where I won't lay down on my back near anyone, ESPECIALLY with... Well...(idk how to say it,) arousal? It just feels SO UNCOMFORTABLE!
On the other hand, I've always been self conscious about my chest for some odd reason. Now, I have to admit, I'm a very self conscious person and I'm underweight. So, I'd always cover up my chest after getting out of a shower, I never go anywhere without a shirt on even when swimming, it's odd, it's like as if I'm trying to hide breasts that don't exist.

Okay, I feel like I'm going on rambling about things. So basically, with what I've said in this post, could I be transgender? Or am I just going through an odd puberty-induced phase? And please be as descriptive as you can. Thank you in advance."

Hard for me to remember the details of what exactly was involved. But for example last night I dreamed I was pregnant. Can't remember how it happened in the dream. I don't know. But woke up, realized it was a dream, and just wanted to cry.

This Tuesday I'm 5 years HRT. I'm nearly 3 years post SRS. I turn 29 in June. I'm in a relationship with a great guy who is himself straight and cis. If I was a typical cis gal, I would be in the prime years to have a child. 

Ugh. It's like, this isn't something really even specifically trans-related. It's not like I'm regretting transition, SRS, etc. I have zero regrets about any of that. I'm guess it's just a general deep feeling of deep loss in not being able to carry a child. I've felt such feelings before, just lately I've been having some really sad and vivid dreams about it

sayaka_abstergo,asktransgender,"I'm confused about my gender, any help?","This might not be the right place to put this, but after scouring Reddit for a solid hour, I figured it was the best place to ask.

I've identified as genderfluid for the past two years, but even then I didn't feel like that was quite the right term for me. Biologically, I'm male, but I feel more feminine the majority of the time. I still feel masculine and agender sometimes, but it's very rare for me to feel either of those. 

I know it's something I need to figure out on my own, but what do you think I should identify as? A few of my friends have tossed the term ""demigirl"" around, but I don't really know what that means. Am I that? Am I just trans? Am I just a really insecure and stupid genderfluid?

aaskew,asktransgender,For trans men told to use female bathrooms,"I'm currently in a couple of online arguments with people telling me to use the female bathrooms because chromosomes and how ""you can't change your gender"", and that if I make women uncomfortable or get arrested because I look male (5 years on T), then it's my fault for transitioning and it's totally fine by them if I end up in jail.

actually I'm just angry and need to rant because that person kept contradicting himself and calling me crazy and saying lol a lot and I want to punch things. 

There's no bathroom bill where I live (yet), but IRL people have also suggested I use the female or handicapped bathrooms after finding out I'm trans, even though they previously thought I was a cis man, and that if anyone complained I should just tell them I'm trans. But I haven't stepped in one for four years, after I kept getting lots of stares and angry comments that I was in the wrong bathroom.

Are there any trans men out there who pass and are still told to use the female facilities? Was there any time when you listened to them, and what happened if so? Are most women genuinely okay with it if you tell them you're trans, as several TERFs have insisted?

(sorry in advance if any of this is offensive. I can't think straight right now because I hate people and there's a part of me that really wants to go stride into a female restroom right now and hope I get arrested.)

lskdfslkjfsl,asktransgender,"NSFW genitals discharge question, MtF","I didn't want to post this on my main account, I don't like talking about my genitals even on this.

I've been on hormones for almost a year, and I tuck almost constantly now. Yesterday something weird happened. The tuck felt a little off, and when I went to the bathroom to check on it, there was a bunch of discharge. It was slightly yellow, and had no strong odour. That had never happened before. It stained my underwear and the tip of my downstairs was really sensitive and sore, it looked raw and a bit swollen too. The discharge continued for the rest of the day. This morning there was more discharge after sleeping, but nothing was painful this time. I'm not sexually active, so it's nothing like an STD. EDIT: I should clarify that the discharge today was more normal. Clear, non-painful, non-odorous, just normal.

The main thing I can think is that it might have been that my tuck was weird and rubbed the area raw, and the discharge was something like lymph. The other thing I can maybe think is that it was some sort of acidic discharge, and the reason it hurt was that my genitals have no mucous membrane and that the area equivalent to a clitoris was completely exposed to the acidity, whereas in a cis woman the clitoris wouldn't be as exposed to it, maybe? Otherwise, I don't know what's happening.

If you can tell me what happened or how to stop it from hurting, that would help a lot."
ToyingWithCorsets,asktransgender,So what's insurance and what is its significance to trans people?,"Sorry all, I'm not very knowledgeable on what insurance is and why it is such an important thing to have. It's brought up a lot on this sub, but all I've garnered is that people choose it and some ""cover"" medical costs. My understanding was that it's this service thing that will financially pay you back an amount equivalent to what you lose if something goes wrong, but is that actually correct? I often see people on here talking about how they can't afford surgeries etc. because their insurance provider won't cover or pay it. Do insurance providers actually pay certain things, such as SRS? And what's all this about them not covering medical procedures for trans people?

Sorry that this is potentially a really simple question, but I am legitimately confused. I'd have asked on /r/ELI5 but the trans part would have had to have been left off."
Scotyyslut,asktransgender,"Super confused, scared, unsure what comes next?","So here I am a person on this planet that barely touched questions about there gender identity and sexuality till they where twenty five. It was because of my religion. unequivocally and directly linked with it. I even was saving my self for marriage till the age of twenty two but was then raped taking that choice out of my hands. nothing traumatic now but some one had sex with me while I was passed out against my will. Keep growing up and discovering my self in other ways come to the conclusion that I no longer believe in the religion I was raised in and decided that me having been raped and having had sex at this point doesn't devalue me.

Skip a few years get outed as a atheist to my family and have to deal with that and figuring out that I'v had depression for most of my life for a couple years. Family is loving but unaccepting of atheism but all in all that went wonderful. Now around the age of twenty seven I final start to look at my self and what makes me tick where as it comes to sexuality. I quickly came to the conclusion that I was at least bi or pan sexual if not straight up gay. During this course of discovery I get into some specific fetishes, some specifically about cross dressing and I proceed to get really into them.

Now I final catch up with the present. I am now thirty years old and today i walked into a department story to buy my self some stockings, panties, and a cute little dress that I thought really complemented me as best they could. When I got home I put them on and am literally wearing them as I write this. I just don't know what to do. I feel so comfortable and it felt so good to pick them out and try them on. It wasn't even a sexual thing just pleasurable to put on and where and feel pretty in even if I could still really use some work to make them look better. And even with all that happy comfortable felling I'm barley holding my self together right now. I am literally having trouble holding back tears as I write this sentence. Because I know I have made my already complicated life harder and most likely added yet another thing that will now have me hurting my loving family. whither there hurt is justified or not I'm still going to break my father and mothers hearts if they ever find out. And I know, because of the kind of people they are, they wont stop loving me or accepting me for who I am but I'll still be hurting them even if its a unintended consequence of my actions. I'm thirty and very physical male and I fell like I'll never be what I wish I could be, cute, girly, feminine. This all seams hard and scary and I don't know if I can bear to hurt my family again. But whats worst is I feel like I couldn't not do this even if I tried now. It feels so comfortable and as I was buying the clothes I didn't want to but knew I was going to anyway because I knew I would. I guess my question is what do I do? I'm so afraid and sad and angry that my life couldn't just be easy for a change and literally covered in tears right now and I just don't know what to do?"

arkwald,asktransgender,When is it repression and when is it not?,"I thought I would field a question I have been pondering and see what others might think. As a bit of background, I am in my late 30's and have realized that I am not quite as cis as I had thought I was. I used to indulge in occasional crossdressing and then exhibit myself off as such. I really got into the idea of being forced to turn into a woman. So while all this was happening I didn't really think I was trans, which is some Olympic level cognitive dissonance. When that side of me leaked out, I just buried it back up again with whatever strength of fear and guilt and promise to never go down that road again. That somehow this time will be different.

Of course it never really did and I got to the point where part of me wanted to be caught. Mistakes were made and I was forced to admit what my clandestine life was to my wife. Who understandably was confused and frightened herself. So in freeing myself from my secret I threatened to burn down the rest of my life. This was not an optimal solution. So my response was to shut everything down and try to stop this tumble into destruction. Which is where I went out and got the therapy I should have sought out long ago but was too afraid and prideful to do.

From that I came to see that I am more than my gender, and that I shouldn't let this aspect of myself rule the rest of my life. So the task I have set myself to over the last few years is to come to terms with these repressed feelings I have had and try to fit them into the rest of me. Which is funny because the feelings come and go and there are times where I feel I am trans and others where I know that its a ridiculous and absurd thing to believe. In that time my feelings never just resolved themselves just the periodic struggle. Then I thought that maybe if I wanted change to happen I needed to do it myself.  So I tried to remind myself I am a man and that I can control myself. It does feel a bit better, since I don't feel the uncertainty I had been feeling. However when I stop to think about it, I don't see much of a difference between trying to chose to be a man and when I was repressing myself. Am I just setting myself up for failure again?  I really do not want to transition into being a woman. I don't feel I have to, yet I can't dismiss these feelings as much as I wish they would be.

TL/DR Is telling yourself you are a man, repressing your feminine side?"
[deleted],asktransgender,Trans PSA: Do not internalize nasty comments,"Back in the day when I first discovered the Internet I was young and would get upset over nasty comments. Whether it be on YouTube or a forum or a chat room, I would take those comments personally. I have since learned not to take them personally (internalize them). How? I finally realized (while being a bit of a troll myself) that these comments are only meant to hurt you. Sometimes we internalize these comments becuase we think that this is how people really feel. Don't get me wrong, some people actually do feel the same as their comments. But mostly it's just people saying whatever they can to get a rise out of you. They don't actually feel so passionately about what they're saying. They just think of the nastiest thing they can think of. Think about reading an article or watching a video about someone who fell down a manhole while texting. Look at the comments. People will insult the person's intelligence very harshly. Saying how stupid they are or calling them retarded. Saying that they're a special needs person or that they had backwater parents raise them. But we all know that this isn't true. It's just an exaggeration. So when you see this happen with a trans article or video, just remember that these are just empty words that don't mean anything. Just keep scrolling."

slimshadygrimgravy,asktransgender,"Respond to my hateful ""friend""","Little backstory, my friend, we will call him Dragoon, had a crush on me. He visited my place a few times, we used to hangout a lot, typical stuff. I wasn't really interested so we kinda stopped talking, but we still see each other at mutual friend's parties and stuff. We're still Facebook friends too.

I notice he posts [this](http://imgur.com/s8IvzEf) status the other day. 

Basically Dragoon is saying, most transgender people are xyz, but not the ones that I know, they're cool.

Needless to say we aren't friends anymore, he's no longer welcome in my home. The bathroom I have in my house is gender neutral (both men and women use it!) and he obviously doesn't feel comfortable with this concept. 

Now here is my argument against what he's saying. I think he's entirely missing the point. 

""Dragoon seems to be under the impression that transgender people asked for a gender neutral bathroom (aka ""you want your own bathroom"") but really, it's bigoted cisgender people wanting to keep non-passing transgender people, specifically male-to-female transgender people, out of ""the incorrect"" bathroom.

So the gender neutral bathroom is the transgender community's suggestion to let all parties (cisgender people, transgender people, non binary people) win.

Really, it's the cisgender people that have ""dere widdle feewings huwt"" over someone who they don't even know, using the same toilet as them.

Cisgender people are the ones so butthurt over what kind of genitalia someone has, when really transgender people want to pee.

The Republican Logic on Gun Control: If you make more restrictions on guns, criminals are going to break the law anyway so it's no use.

The Republican Logic on Bathrooms: If you make restrictions on bathrooms, criminals will abide by the new laws completely and it will be totally effective.

Point being, if a predator wants to dress up like a woman to try and assault someone in the women's bathroom, he's gonna do it whether this law is in place or not. The only thing this law does is make it harder for non-passing transgender people to use public restrooms.""

Does anyone else feel the same? I'd really like to hear your thoughts on this. Im just another confused teenager."
shoelaze,asktransgender,"How can I determine whether I desire to be trans, or desire to be a woman? Is there even any difference?","So, if you couldn't already tell by the title, or by my flair, I am currently wrestling with pre-hrt, early self-exploration doubts. A big one for me, perhaps the biggest, is that I am unsure whether I what I desire is to assume the opposite gender presentation in order to attempt to mend incongruency between my gender identity and my outward expression and social role, ""True"" (Not in the subcultural, jargonistic sense) transexualism, for lack of a better term, or whether what I experience is more akin to an obsession growing into an appropriation of the transgender experience in order to account for my lack of identity and self-loathing.

I constantly flip-flop between stages of doubt and certainty over my own transness- I'll probably post more questions like these as I grow more confident in expressing myself here- and within these a smaller battle rages attempting to push me from one mode to another. I'm constantly looking for resources to affirm my own transness- again, because I *want* to be trans- and I just came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1msl8x/how_do_i_come_to_a_conclusion_about_my_identity/) thread which has brought up all these feelings again.

I see a  lot of similarities between myself and this guy, however by viewing him objectively, I also feel reviled, with him and myself...

I managed to waffle a bit there without saying much so I guess I'll give you a brief profile of myself, not that I want people to tell me I'm totally 100% trans or anything... :3

Keep in mind, at the stage of doubt (denial?) I am at, I genuinely believe that anything I say could be fabricated. Not that I don't believe it, but that there is some subconscious element at play convincing me these feelings/experiences are real/happened.

*I know for certain that I experienced some level of dysphoria/disassociation, especially surrounding images of myself in mirrors or photographs. I would often be shocked, and disappointed, each time when first viewing myself. Since I had begun to question if I was trans several months ago I've found myself developing dysphoria with my secondary sex characteristics, particularly body and facial hair, and now believe I always felt some discomfort but thought it was still developing and I would ""grow into it"". I'm basically indifferent to my genitals. I suppose if you pressed me I would say it felt attached, and I could never understand how people would refer to theirs as Little ___ or their Best Friend etc

*For as long as I can remember, the things that stick out are trans related. I have very clear memories of being enthralled by TV shows featuring transgender situations, particularly those not due to magic. I remember asking my parents what my name would be if I was a girl only to be told that they ""Always knew I was going to be a boy"". As I progressed into puberty all my sexual fantasies/desires were trans related, starting at tg porn, before developing into ""forced fem"" and ""sissy"" fantasies, but rarely full-blown agp/fef. I am unsure whether this is due to unable to suspend my disbelief, or a sign that this is just an obsession that got out of hand...

*That being said, the few times I have crossdressed I did not get the sexual experience I expected. At first I was upset, due to looking like a ""dude in a dress"", but as I looked closer at myself and picked out parts I liked to focus on, I began to spontaneously smile, something that had rarely happened in half a decade of depression.

*Finally, I don't feel male, and never have. I am unsure if I feel female, but the only hopeful future I can imagine is one where I transition, all male futures end in ruts or suicide... I found the button questions revealing, but it still doesn't really give me an answer. If I had the one-time gender swap button I am unsure if I would press it, but if I had one that expunged me of all these feelings and made me confidently cis male, I certainly wouldn't push that. If I *had* to push one, it would be the gender swap, with very little doubt.

This has gone on so long, I don't really know what I'm asking anymore...
I've never kept a diary so I guess I'm throwing everything up here, sorry :(
Though if anyone reads this far thank you so much, it really means a lot regardless of what you think. I tried to be as clear as possible, but trying to put how I feel into words is hard, and even now feel like I'm missing 90% of it already...

Thanks &lt;3"

Is there anything you wished you had known prior to surgery? Anything I should bring with me? It was suggested I bring a doughnut thing to sit on; is that useful?

My worries:

- It is done under local anesthetic... will I at least get something for my anxiety? Or something to ease my discomforts just prior and during the procedure?

- Post-op, does it hurt to sit down? I have to sit for a examination 3 days later...

- Is being off E for a week as bad as I think it will be? Hot flashes? Night sweats? 

- Bleeding... I have to be back in professional attire 3 days post-op, and I cant ruin pants. Is there any blood, or is that a non-issue?

The above is only a small list of my worries... I tried to boil it down to only the rational worries... the rest I will keep to myself (thanks anxiety). 

I am sorry for the long post, and I am sorry if anything seems like a dumb question. Not suuuuupppper rational when it comes to worries.

I feel extremely grateful for this privilege - my parents and I probably couldn't even pay for one semester. However, I think they're transphobic. I always thought that maybe they were accepting, because I had a best friend who was gay growing up and when I brought him on a family vacation, they were very nice. Although they are very Christian, they have always seemed to me to be the type of Christians that try to love and accept everyone, and help people that they perceive as sinners instead of shaming them. However, I found out my Uncle is voting for Trump. Although it is my grandparents' money, this uncle is the one in charge of the account and hes the one that physically pays the bill each semester because I guess my grandparents are old and its easier for him to do it idk. Additionally, close family friends that live in their neighborhood (close enough that they spent Christmas with us) posted transphobic memes on facebook, shaming trans people for wanting to use the bathroom and calling them perverts. So, I don't know for sure if my grandparents are transphobic, but I find it likely. I'm unsure if they would pay for my college if I came out, but I'm starting to realize I might really want to go on T and get top surgery. Both because of the stress dysphoria is causing me, and because I would want to pass by the time I got a full time adult job, I would rather get on T sooner than later. Is it likely I could get on T and hide it from them for 3 years? I only see them for about a week a year. I'm also probably gonna grow my hair out long because I like long hair so maybe even if I've been on T for a while, since my hair would be long and if I shaved really close and wore androgynous leaning feminine clothing maybe they wouldn't be able to tell?? I don't know, all I know is I starting tearing up thinking about the possibility that technically I could get on T this summer if I wanted to, but I'm unsure how much I would be upsetting my extended family and if I'd be able to pay for college... sorry for this being a really disorganized and repetitive post im sorta anxious right now"

AmazingSpiderLlama,asktransgender,Girls on the patch: how do you deal with itchiness and/or the patch starting to peel off?,"It doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes it just itches like crazy. Usually, I can put a little lotion on and that helps, but not always. Not sure why it only itches sometimes.


Also, about one out of every ten patches starts to significantly fall off. I can usually get it back on with a band-aid or whatever, but that's way not attractive.


I've tried different placements to alleviate these problems, with limited success. Front of my tummy itches less, but tends to peel off if I have particularly enthusiastic sex. The sides of my lower torso keep the patch on better (usually) but itches more. I'm considering the underside of my breasts, but the S.O. is fond of... recreational pursuits in that area, and I don't want to mess with that. I'm considering my back, but seems like that would be hard to place and monitor throughout the day. Arms are out because I wear shortsleeves pretty much all the time. 


Should I just put it somewhere it doesn't itch and resign myself to unattractive placement of medical tape? Any suggestions of the magical perfect spot? Thanks y'all!"
start315,asktransgender,DIY HRT Questions,"Hello, I'm self-medding with pills of cypro and estrofem. This is my first week so I am taking 25mg of cypro. Next week I will start on 2mg of E and after some time I'm gonna increase it to 4mg.

Today my pre-HRT results of hormone levels came out, though... It shows that my T was at 874ng/dl. Much higher than I expected it to be. And the displayed norm for male is 72-853mg/dl.

So with my T just a bit above the ""norm""... should I consider taking at least 50mg of cypro? Is there any correlation that those who naturally produce more T have to take more AA or E? Or does it not matter at all and I should stick with 25mg for the first few weeks until I do my next hormone test?

I feel impatient, I have my dysphoria triggered like hell by these T results, I want to reduce it faster if possible..."
alyzb,asktransgender,Learning to accept a bad profile view?,"Im hoping some of you here can help provide ideas or advice for this, because it seems like the one major part that causes me the most dysphoria and general discomfort.

Please do not suggest FFS, I am aware it is an option for me but it is highly expensive and not feasible in the near to distant future.

From the front view, my face is fine. Yeah there are some angles here and there that are less than pretty, but some angles I am gorgeous. 

The issue is my profile. I have a brow bone that juts out a bit, a beak nose, and a recessed chin. To me it looks beyond hideous, and I can see the man in it. I probably do not pass at all from this angle. At best I look weird. Add that to a tall frame, and things just dont look great for me.

From the front, all is good. Im confident in that view, im beautiful. 

So how much does profile matter? My hope is that when my body is where I want it, the overwhelming gender cues will put me in the range of ""girl with an akward profile"" rather than ""hey that girl is pretty OH WOW ITS A GUY GROSS"" that I worry it is now.

Im hoping that maybe profile just doesnt matter that much but pf course the fear is that mine is glaring enough to overpower every other part of me, that that will be the only part that stands out, that will be what im seen as.

How do I even begin to make peace with a part of me I can only see as glaring and hideous? How can I rewrite this script? How do I dtop caring? It colors my reality, in my head its the only part of me that I can see as *me*. Like my internal image is just this ugly transsexual with a jacked up profile, an awkward gawking mess.

How do I cope?

"
reeseypuff,asktransgender,Whatever confidence I had was completely destroyed by my brother and his friends,"I apologize for the wall of text, but the situation is complicated and I desperately need help.

First off, I live in my parents house with my brother. I've been in the closet for about 3 years and my family seems to have a lot of negative views on gay/trans rights. My dad has a job that requires him to travel and my mom has to leave town frequently. Most weekends it's just me and my brother so he usually invites his friends over.

I've lived with my brother for about 7 months now. He and his friends are 5-6 years older than I am and in college. When they come over we usually just watch movies and smoke weed. Recently I've been saving three grams of hallucinogenic mushrooms for when we decide to trip together. 

On Thursday night, 4 of my brother's friends came over so we could take  shrooms and chill out like usual.

About 30 minutes in we all feel pretty good and decide to play a game of frisbee on this court in my backyard. Recently pollen has been falling like crazy and around this time every year I have problems with breathing congestion. I start getting incredibly spaced out and am having a great time. I start to have trouble fully breathing out of my nose but it didn't seem to bother me all that much. 

This is the turning point. I don't have a very good grasp of what's going on and I keep going farther and farther off the court for reasons I can't really explain. I start to notice 2 of my brothers friends are talking to each other where I can barely hear them. After they say a few more things I realize they are saying passive aggressive shit about me. At first it was about me walking off the court so much, then it was about how my body motions were super ""wavy."" I shoot them a look and they just made some sarcastic comment about how hard I'm tripping. (I only took 1 gram and they took 2.5)

At this point my nose starts running and I don't have a tissue so I just have to deal with it. Now they start saying stuff about how they hear me sniffing and they just keep laughing. I just pass it off because I might just be paranoid, but more shit was said leading me to think that I was actually right. I get bummed out and don't want to be around these two people bringing down my mood so as I was leaving I said I was going to watch a movie and they just kept to their sarcastic remarks.

I walk inside and grab one of my movies and am sitting in a chair about to put it in, just kind of spacing out. After maybe a minute I hear the one guy who's being the biggest dickhead in this situation outside the window (who was trying to watch me through the window) say something along the lines of ""he's just been sitting in there crying this whole time."" Then more conversation ensues and all 4 of them including my brother are talking about how they have a problem with me saying I'm acting incredibly feminine.

My heart drops, I realize this isn't good at all. After a few minutes, they walk inside and are sitting in my kitchen STILL talking about me. I get up, walk in the room and say something along the lines of ""if you have shit to say, tell it to my face."" everybody stops talking and there's an awkward silence. Then all of them try to pass it off saying I'm tripping too hard, or I'm just hearing things, etc.

Whatever, they were too scared to say anything to my face so I went back to watching my movie. My brother turns on his loud ass music making it impossible for me to hear the movie.

Skipping ahead a little, they are talking about how I'm crying and my brother is only adding on to the conversation. I confront them for a second time, this time saying something like ""are you going to say something to me face to face, or are you too scared?"" Again the same thing happens and they pass it off.

A little later, more people start showing up and I'm just in my room trying to watch netflix. At this point, I'm getting ridiculed for everything I do, including my habitual knuckle popping, things I've said in the past, medication I've recently been prescribed, and even texting my girlfriend. It only gets worse from here.

At around 9:00, there were people listening to me through my door and others watching through my windows. I was some sort of sick fucking entertainment. This is when my brother played one of his modest mouse albums, specifically one with a sad song somewhat applicable to the situation. As its playing, maybe 2-3 people are singing along with the lyrics while I'm just trapped in my room surrounded by shitheads trying to give me grief for every single detail of my personality. 

Then this one guy shows up I never even liked in the first place. He has intense anger management problems and does hard drugs like there is no tomorrow. 

It's around 11:00 and somebody is still watching me through my windows. It was obvious they were on the phone with someone in the kitchen. As I was about to fall asleep and started closing my eyes, the guy with anger management would just cuss up a storm and say something about waiting until I was asleep. I was already pissed beyond belief putting up with everyone's bigoted slurs and opinions of me, now I had to deal with this coke-head and some sort of sick prank he wanted to pull on me when I was asleep.

I just stayed up until 2:00 and they finally gave up because they were all leaving. 

Now I have no idea what to do, my brother is avoiding the situation as much as possible and tries to blame it on my medication saying its almost the equivalent of methamphetamine or speed. His friends still come over and talk shit about me and I'm out of options. I can't just go on letting this happen, I need advice.

Tldr; I was tripping on shrooms and accidentally outed myself because my body motions were ""too feminine"""
Gialicious,asktransgender,How did you find fitness?,"All right people I could really use your help... Before I started transitioning I was a personal trainer. I love working out and being healthy but unfortunately once I started recognizing my trans identity I became very depressed and completely stopped my fitness journey. That was in early November. Also a part of it was that I used to be very heavy into lifting weights and I was self-conscious about being a woman with big arms (I'm transitioning male to female). At this point I've kind of handle my depression and my social anxieties so I am really interested in getting back into fitness..

Now after many months of eating whatever I want and not incorporating Fitness into my schedule I recognize I have gained some weight... Made all the more obvious with warmer weather and my tight clothes are feeling a little too tight if you know what I mean. It's difficult because I'm very early in my transition but I am very happy with my appearance at work and socially. I am pretty girly and I do wear wigs right now because my hair is still really short.

So i guess at this point i am looking for inspiration, How did you start your fitness journey in your transition? did you do anything with dressing or anything specific that really helped you get to the gym? or even tips would be nice. I do have some workout clothes that I like, but it's tough because you can't exactly work out in a wig and my hair is a big part of my feminine identity at this stage. pretty much any insights would be very helpful. and for reference I do have a couple different gym membership still so I do have places I can work out and I live near the biking paths as well."

TheGreenSkeleton,asktransgender,Hair styling tips? Balding sucks.,"I'm hoping you might provide some hair styling tips for me.

I've been on my journey for about three years now. Only two people know about me — my therapist and my exwife. Still, I'd like to starting looking and dressing more feminine.

After my wife left me, I started growing out my hair. It's barely grazing my shoulders now, and it's fun! However, it seems to be accentuating my budding baldness.

I am not on hormones, nor do I have plans to take any at this time (working through other things first). I'm using Rogaine to hopefully stop the loss until I decide where I'm going in my life.

I have always had high temples, but the peak is now starting to get very thin. I also have vertex balding, so that is thin as well.

I've been able to hide the vertex balding with ponytails, but 1) it's a short ponytail and looks weird with the high temples and 2) I'm worried about pulling out more hair in the meantime.

Other info: My hair is fairly straight, but I air dry so it gets a little curled around my neck. I don't have a blow dryer yet and I don't know much about hair products to help style.

**TL;DR**

Do you have any suggestions for hairstyles that:

1. look cute and feminine?
2. hide bald spots?
3. can be ""masculine""-ish when I'm at work?

Please and thank you!"
stel_diamond,asktransgender,What's the law (federal or state) that prevents people from assaulting people in public bathrooms?

The counterpoint goes that there is already a law in place that protects people from this sort of harassment. Can someone point to me the precise law that mentions this.

For the record: I believe HB2 to be motivated by transphobia and does enormous harm to trans people, whether or not the law I asked for exists.

scarletb23,asktransgender,What am I? Please help.,"Hey everyone, 

Im Scarlet.

I'm a 26 year old male and I could really do with a little help figuring out what is going on in my own head right now.

For the past 6 months I have had really confusing feelings, which in turn has led me to this subreddit. I'm starting to feel more feminine, like I should be acting/feeling more feminine and that all things/thoughts feminine are making me feel good. I sometimes look at women and feel jealous at how pretty they look and what they are wearing. 

I have shaved all my body because I can't stand the fact that I am hairy. I have started looking into buying women's clothes and makeup, my house mate is going on holiday soon and I plan on trying these for the first time when he is away. 

It is very strange, in a sexual way, I am attracted to women and I am not attracted to men but the thought of being F****d by men, (If I was a woman) turns me on A LOT, I have started using anal based toys and I am enjoying it more than conventional male masturbation.

I am looking into the subject more and more of transgender and watching videos on youtube of other transgender woman and feeling like I relate to some of the things that I see. 

The more I look into the subject the more scared and anxious I feel but the more I think like this is the more it feels ....right. The way I should feel. The thought of being a women really does excite me. I fantasize about being female, about not having a penis but having female genitalia. 

The strangest thing about all this, is that (I must say, I do not remember much of my childhood) but I do remember playing with girls toys and dressing up like a girl quite often but I am not sure if this was a phase or my parents /pushed me out of it. 

I'm not sure how I should take all of these new thoughts and this information. I have not even talked to anyone in real life about this. 

Thank you so much to anyone that is willing respond.

I've met up with my dad and step-mum a few times, but I haven't actually visited home in over two years.

I've never been close to my brother either. I'm not sure how my grandmas are going to feel about it.

A lot of stuff has happened in the past few months. I had to take time out of university because of depression, and also I've been trying to get an autism spectrum diagnosis.

I'm worried that on top of everything else, me being transgender is going to be a lot to drop on them all at once. I'm wondering whether I should wait a while before coming out.

It's going to be around 4 months before I can get my first gender clinic appointment, and then who knows how long after that before I can start testosterone and get top surgery.

I'm torn between trying to tell them soon - to give them some time to adjust to the idea - or waiting a while - to give them some time to process the other stuff going on with me before I drop this on them.

I know that they're sympathetic to transgender issues (I had a trans friend in school that they know about, and were kind to her), so I think that they will handle it reasonably well when I finally come out to them. But I think it will come as a surprise and I don't want it to upset what is already a pretty delicate family situation."

So I'm biologically male, and its plausible that I'd prefer something other than this.

Here are some facts and possible problems, that hopefully I can get some ideas on.

(Some of these may be stupid, I've read a bit but still don't know much at all...)

- Location: SF Bay Area, California. Most likely I will stay here, if not then places like New England/Washington/Oregon, nothing like Texas/North Carolina. Would it be valid to assume that in these locations people are generally more open-minded?
- Currently work in software, am fine with it. Will ability to work be affected? Any other problems?
- In early 20s, married to female who is open-minded in general but in terms of gender preference is heterosexual. I'll do whatever is necessary to avoid separation.
- Prefer to have biological children, but flexible on this (after all one/both of us could already be unable to have children).
- Family seems open-minded, don't know how they would react, but I don't depend on them for anything anyways, so it's no great loss (wow that sounds bad, I mean at least in terms of survival and so on, not necessarily emotionally).
- A few friends, they seem open-minded, but I've dealt with friendlessness in the past and could do so again for a while if needed.
- Will the political climate sour in the future? (Yeah this is kind of hard to predict but still)
- I'm into /r/financialindependence like things, could there be problems? (Besides the obvious of possible income loss)
- Other stuff?"

oh my goodness, I stumbled on your post of your a MtF and lemme say this, I'm not bein' rood or nothing but Nox and I were shocked to find that out, there's nothin about you that even screams masculine, like  YOU ARE SO SOFT AND FEMININELY FEATURED AND AHHH IT'S SO NICE TO FIND IT OUT AND I WANNA PET YOUR HAIR BECAUSE WOW GIRL YOUR FUCKIN' STRONG.

Me:
Holy crap, you couldn't tell? O:

Friend:
NEITHER NOX OR I COULD TELL, I SAW THE POST AND WE WERE BOTH LIKE IS THIS AN APRIL FOOLS'

but oh my god the way you carry yourself is very feminine too and just AHH

like, one of Nox's brother's friends parent is a MtF and lemme tell you this, that one you can tell, mostly the voice, and somewhat of the body features, and it's not unnerving to me or anything, I just kind of get confused because their caught in the middle, so the fact Nox couldn't tell anything about you is like 'woah she's really in her perf state of mind right now ain't she :3c'

Me:
Holy crap, I had no idea that I passed so well O: I've been on hormones for less than 4 months, thank you so much!

Friend:
That's so crazy that you've been on 'em for less than 4 months. I would have thought you'd been on 'em for years ahh

Nox said he's known a lot of MtF and FtM people who have been on hormones for years and still don't look it or act it, so the fact that you've been on for less than 4 months and look and act is just, awesome. He says you shouldn't feel self concious about it at all cause you REALLY can't tell period.

I REALLY CAN'T SEE YOU AS MALE SO LIKE OM F G"
Veretrix,asktransgender,"I asked my gf to start using my new name in text messages, and I feel so happy now because of it!","Over the weekend, I asked my girlfriend to start addressing me by my new name whenever we are talking through text. I'm not out to everyone I know yet, so I'm not comfortable using the name publicly. Regardless, when she started calling me Erin (or Eri as she seems to like calling me), I couldn't stop smiling from ear to ear and blushing a bit. It felt like she was addressing me by the name I was meant to have. Aaaahhhh! I'm just getting all bubbly inside thinking about it! I have felt so much happier than I have in probably a long time just because she was calling me Erin and referred to me as her girlfriend.

blessedwolf,asktransgender,Can an employer make you use your legal name?,"Hello! I am asking this question on behalf of my boyfriend. We are both employed in the state of Nevada at Aramark, which is a company with an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action policy. I've looked up bills AB 211 and SB 331, which protect against discrimination based on gender identity and expression in Nevada. But nothing within these bills nor our employee handbook says anything about the use of one's legal name. Currently, he's trying to get our coworkers and manager to use his preferred name, but it just isn't working. The manager says that the company will just make him use his legal name, is this true?   

EDIT: Okay....bare in mind we are baristas....making barely above minimum wage. He does know he can't do anything about the HR side of things, he just wants to know if our manager and employees can just refuse to use his preferred pronouns and name. "

I think most people realize that regardless of how they feel personally that you have to basically treat trans people like the modern day gay person who's achieved ""full humanity"" lol. I don't pass and have never ever been called out. In fact I've been sexually harassed more often than not like a female. Maybe I'm lucky in a shitty sense but it's still weird. I'd have a real hard time knowing if I actually pass and if not passing is all in my head bec of social conditioning to be mostly polite about it; at least where I live. What do you think?

Edit: I live in MI which I'm told isn't great for trans ppl but I haven't seen it. I know we don't have legal protection yet though.

DanielleInChi,asktransgender,I've reached that moment in which it's transition or die,"I've reached that moment in which it is essentially transition or die.

After coming to terms in November and moving in February, I thought I could push off HRT just long enough to freeze sperm.  I want biological kids but my GD is getting worse.  I started another downward spiral and got the dreaded why still single question last weekend.

I'm 31 and grew up a Conservative Jew while slowly becoming Orthodox in college.

My dad says I can't be trans because I didn't know something was off until puberty.  And then I lied to myself and repressed while:
*turning in trans fiction for homework in 7th grade
*looking up sex change in 8th
*raiding my mom's closet in 7th or 8th without knowing why
*looking up boy wants to be girl in 9th or 10th and discovering trans fiction

I'm a writer and 95% of my writing projects turn into trans fiction.

My sister-in-law's father is trans so that's helped me in some ways.  Still, the whole being Orthodox and trans thing is not fun.  It's scary as hell but I feel more comfortable and at ease when presenting as a woman.

I'm going to try to present as male for as long as I possibly can.

On the work front, they don't know and I'm also a long term temp, too."

My only question (for now); I generally feel that I am trans, or want to transition to female. Some days more than others, something I've noticed though is that when I am aroused (attracted solely to men) and when I am masturbating or even when being intimate with my partner (cis male), I sometimes feel like I am cisgender, or to put it another way I feel very ""male"" during these times, but more often than not I orgasm, and then shortly after go back to ""Well I likely am transgender after all""

Alexis_Melody,asktransgender,Was I in the wrong?,"So I used to go to this one forum and the people there had known me for like 6-7ish years as male. I had come out to people and asked them to use female pronouns. 


They made some efforts to so and I appreciated that but then many people would, on accident, use male pronouns. I would just correct them with a ""she*"" They then started to act like I was saying they were being mean and asking for too much. 


Then someone posted this: https://imgur.com/gallery/kcN15MC as justification for their actions. I find that link rather truscummy though. Simply because of what they say about preo-op and post-op people.

Surprisingly, however, he seemed in a way kind of opposed to the idea of me being trans... Throughout the conversation he kept saying ""Well if this is what you want, then that's OK, but..."" and something each time about how I might be making the wrong decision. Possibly the worst thing to hear from him was that he thought I might just be ""up my own arse""!? I tried to explain that I'm not happy with the person that I am, and that I *do* feel like I'd be happier as a woman, but he said he thought that being unhappy is just *who I am* and that changing this isn't going to change things. I'm not certain that's quite what he was going for, but we were both a bit drunk (not the best time to come out, but certainly the easiest) so his meaning was a little garbled. 

Anyway, I'm not sure what I'm hoping for in terms of answers, but it's really set me back in my head hearing all this denial again after doing it myself for so long."

The trouble is that the driving force behind my current dysphoria is a maternal drive. I want a child, and a child deserves an accepting family. So even if I transition, I might be just as frustrated as before. 

I was hoping to adopt a special needs child, but after hearing my mother go on about how I'm not 'normal' I don't want to subject my child to that-but I don't want my child to miss out on having a grandmother.

GFofaTransgender,asktransgender,I'm scared I'm going to say something wrong,"So I've posted here before, I'm the partner of a MTF person, and I keep feeling I'm going to say something wrong. 

Today, I saw a video of what MTF genital replacement surgery actually did. I sent the link to my partner, saying it looked painful, emphasizing painful, because hell, stuff down there is gonna hurt. They got pissed at me because they thought I was against them changing, which is not true. I'm still trying to process everything, and I was trying to be supportive by showing the video, since they've talked about the surgery before, and I held a neutral opinion

Did I say anything wrong? If I did please tell me. "
namahn,asktransgender,It's like having the person who I am on the inside stabbing me,"I've been trapped for years. I came out a few years ago to friends and family on facebook about being transgendered (MtF) and everyone shook it off like a joke. I tried to talk with my mother about this but she became hysterical, crying and saying that she would never accept me as her daughter. I have always been so terrified of telling my father after that incident. 

No one in my family who really knew supported me, a few of my step siblings did but they were just going along with it, not really promoting me. I had a roommate who was very open minded who tried her hardest to help me, makeup, clothing, everything and we would go out to bars and mingle. It was really fun! Guys would hit on me, I was told I was passing really well from her too.

But when I started taking some herbs I had found on the internet from many many MANY lists saying they helped, I noticed no change ever. I was still the same man I had always been and nothing was helping. I was and still am completely broke. I have nothing to my name really. I got extremely depressed and quit my job and just let my life fall to pieces.

I became homeless, I lost my car, I'm living with my brother now as he tries to help me get on my feet but each day it's like I'm fighting to live a life I don't want anymore. I don't know what to do. I don't know where to turn, I feel like I'm running in circles and hitting every wall.

I recently found a website that sold estrogen without need for any prescription or doctor. I was so excited, could this be true? I began doing research and those big scary terms popped up. Blood clots, deep vein thrombosis, etc.

I can't bring myself to end it all, I just don't have the heart to do it. But I don't see a point in trying anymore if I'm forced to live as someone I'm not.

I'm more than likely making a tl;dr and I'm probably posting this in the wrong section. But I'm losing it. Any help is appreciated. Thanks. -B"
Commander_Waffles,asktransgender,Trying to get her to understand.,"So I've been slowly coming out (MtF) for the last few months &amp; while my friends have been incredibly supportive &amp; accepting, it's been harder for my mom to get there. 

She adopted me before my first birthday from an extremely abusive family &amp; has been there for/with me through everything thus far. Couldn't of asked for a better parent than her. Except when I came out as transgender to her. 

She constantly deadnames (to be fair I haven't told her my chosen name yet) &amp; misgenders me any time we talk. I've tried explaining to her multiple times how it makes me feel, but she doesn't seem to want to understand. She even called me at 2:30 in the morning because she found out I went to the doctors to see if I can start hormones. That talk went about as well as you'd expect. 

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how I could get her to understand &amp; be as supportive as she's been in the past? "
gqthrowawayyy,asktransgender,Had a few questions about HRT &amp; transitioning,"Hi, I just found this sub recently and have lurked a bit, seems like a nice place. I've been thinking about the idea of transitioning more than usual lately, especially once I saw someone say in one thread that virtually all trans* folk end up transitioning even if they're initially reluctant. 


For some context, I'm AMAB, and not entirely sure whether I'm trans per se but do think I would at least be happier being able to pass as female. Possibly genderqueer or something, still trying to work it out. SRS is something I'm currently reluctant to consider, but it seems like some people have had success with just hormones, which is something I was wondering about. So...


* What kind of time period is typical for visible changes to start being made, once you start taking hormones?
* How do facial, bodily etc. changes tend to show in people undergoing HRT, if there are common patterns? Am I right to be worried about the possibility of trying this and having nothing to show for it?  
* Hypothetically speaking, if a few weeks/months into HRT someone was feeling like it was a mistake, or otherwise unsatisfied with the results, what would happen if you just stop the process? Would any physical changes...revert, to some degree? At what point would changes likely be more permanent, if any? 
* Are there any variants from just estrogen used in MtF hormone treatment? Or different methods for how hormones can be administered? I don't really know how the process works, whether you take a pill or injections or something else.
* Somewhat off-topic, but voices. For people transitioning after puberty, do hormones have any noticeable effect on your vocal range? Assuming not, how much could someone train themselves to sound more female? Or what 
* More general, but if anyone would want to just share their experience with HRT and/or transitioning in general, I'd like to know more about what it was like.


I'm also wondering how difficult it is to get approval for HRT, but I feel like this might vary too much by location and doctor to get a meaningful answer. 


Sorry if submissions are supposed to be more focused than this: I was going to just ask one question, but more kept coming to mind. My knowledge about these things is pretty hit-or-miss, so any help would be appreciated."
Natoli_val_Nasalune,asktransgender,Misgendering the ER,"So last night around 11, a really important friend of mine kept telling about the fact I might have appendicitis. Having had it himself, he knew what the look for. So I went to the  ER with my father, and then it started. I pass well, so well almost very doctor felt the need to ask me when my last period was or if I had an increase in my period cramps. I couldn't help but laugh, because obviously that's not possible! Regardless, upon finding out that I was biologically male and not female, almost every single nurse/doctor started using male pronouns! It was a complete shift from what originally happened! Some of them didn't realize, and I guess heard my voice and assumed I was male (I wasn't allowed to drink water, and without water my voice sounds more smoker-y and male). Thankfully there were two amazing nurses who completely understood and gendered me correctly the entire time! 

That said, I was wondering what I can do to prevent this from happening next time. My name is legally changed and I told almost everyone that I identified as female, yet I guess they didn't call me by my pronouns? Some did when we were alone but not with others. Is it protocol or something for the patient to be addressed as their physical sex regardless? 

I didn't mind to much, but it left me an uncomfortable feelings for most of the day (I was there until 9am after getting an appendectomy). Any ideas on how to better approach this problem?

crazycounter,asktransgender,What do I do? #129321843495,"So, I've been agonizing over even just writing this post for the past few days. I'm thinking strongly that I am, but I...I just don't know what to do....

To start with, I'm a 22 year old male living in Chattanooga, TN.
Dating back to when I was in middle school, I would cross-dress whenever I could sneak it in. Female clothes always felt.....right, especially skirts. I even spent most of high school feeling like I would sprout breasts and my downstairs would re-arrange itself overnight. Still think it to some small degree. ""Why didn't I already? Why am I like this?"" I would sometimes think to myself. I still often push in down there where it feels it should be to make sure I just didn't miss it last time.

Half way through high school I changed schools, I lost my few friends (mostly female) who I could test these interests with (never directly said anything, though). Around this time I also started to ""become a man"" (facial hair, deeper voice, body hair), too. Then, I started to get really ""blasé"" about everything. Either sleeping through class or buried into a book, trying to escape the reality around me. I would spend lunch in the back corner of one of the halls curled up with a book. Never made any more friends through the rest of school.

After graduation, I spent a year or so lazing around the house just not wanting to do anything. Parents didn't like that, so I was pushed into going to college. Well, I've been going. Failed a couple classes, though, because I've been too scared to get up in front of people. I won't even look into a mirror if I can help it.

But, I'm the big brother of a fractured family. I'm supposed to be the bridge, the strong one. So, I don't show anything. I hide it from all. Just smile and laugh when necessary, no one will see. Give them flowery words about how their just being worrisome when they think I'm not alright. I've kept all these feeling locked in for awhile. A couple of times a year, though, it kicks back up; rearing it's head at me. I get really bummed about things and starting thinking about it all this all over.

Over the past year I've become more self-dependent and it's slowly been eating at me. Before, I could push it off as being a burden or fearing what would happen if it all goes wrong. I've always put everyone else first. Worry about them, then yourself. It what you're suppose to do. But, now, I've been trying to do what I want to do. To be selfish. But, this keeps coming up.

Sorry......kind of ran away with the main reason I was posting. I want to move forward in a direction, but I still want to keep quiet about it all. I'm quite sure, though. I've revisited this subject multiple times throughout the past 5+ years with the same outcome. Should I still see a professional to talk things through? If so, how can I do this rather discreetly (My health insurance, whatever Walmart uses, is still under my dad, but I have my own income). I don't want to directly say anything, yet. I'm quite sure they won't react *too* badly, but I'm not quite ready to put that strain on my relationship with my parents just yet. Things got weird enough when they thought I might be gay for a short period of time. I already get enough flak for having hair past my shoulders, for wearing pink shoelaces, for liking Hello Kitty/Tinkerbell/Barbie, for having mannerisms closer to that of a girl, for being ""girly"", for not liking sports, but watching Gilmore Girls, for...... I just want to cry, I spend my lunches at work curled up in a dark corner just wanting to cry...... But I can't. I feel like I should be crying, this is the time to, but I just sit there in agony. It sucks.

Sorry again for the overly long post. I've been trying to write it for the past few days, so it's probably somewhat broken and scattered. I'm scared to even write it, someone in the house might see me writing it. What if someone I know see the post?....I've tried to keep it broad enough that no one can directly connect it to myself. But, I need to help myself. So, I'm here asking you all for advice."

MyRealNameIsNotThis,asktransgender,Anyone going to Coachella this weekend or previously went while transitioning?,"Hi everyone, 

I'm going to Coachella this weekend and have been to the festival a few times already, but have never had to worry about bathrooms other than how disgusting they are.  I always used the men's bathrooms and even last year I could still get away with it.  This year I'm not really confident about how well I'll blend in in either bathroom.  If I'm with my brothers and cousin it's not a big concern because I'll be with some guerrilla sized football players, but if I'm on my own I don't know which one to use.  I guess what I'm asking is that if it's fairly obvious that I'm trans, or at least how androgynous I am, how much of an issue would me using the women's bathrooms be?

Also, if you're going to watch Deafheaven, Rancid, M83, Beach House or CHVRCHES lets be friends.  "

Utopia325,asktransgender,Can someone have GID without knowing?,"I'm a 30 year old male and I started therapy a few months ago because of a strong sense of discomfort when I'm alone and huge problems with sex. I've had erection problems countless times and I have basically never enjoyed sex although I've pretty much tried everything: women, men, bdsm activities, various fetishes, etc. I've always felt extremely unsatisfied. After only three sessions my therapist told me that we needed to discuss gender identity even though we have NEVER talked about gender related issues. I still don't know how he could say that out of the blue; isn't that something that I should have brought up myself? I initially felt confused and excited but after reading the symptoms of GID I thought it could not be possible. I don't feel comfortable as a man but as far as I remember I've never strongly wished I would be a girl. I've always felt very frustrated and angry, just never happy, anxious and constantly uncomfortable. I also find it extremely difficult to make male friends.

After that session I dismissed the idea of having GID but at the same time I started crossdressing more and more, putting makeup, shopping for clothes and seeking ways to expose my female persona. Now when I think about a hypothetical life as a woman I get extremely euphoric like I discovered that there is a much better way to live. At the same time I get very upset when I have doubts about being trans. I also started fantasize about being a woman in bed and being penetrated by a man (even though I consider myself heterosexual). Is it possible for someone to completely ignore that the dysphoria is related to their gender? Can the GID get out of control all of the sudden like this?"

katyaminx,asktransgender,Am I being over sensitive?,"I was out shopping with my ex (good friends, she's just not a lesbian). In boy mode as just came from work and in a rush to meet her to pick up my daughter. Anyway, we had fun trying clothes on and sneaking me into changing rooms. Not much actual sneaking involved being SoCal. 

At some point we were talking about styles of shorts and she said something like, ""those won't work because you aren't s woman."" 

Now at first glance, pretty negative. And it cut deep. But she has been amazingly supportive in all this. Like my biggest champion. Slip of an expression simplifying a larger concept of proportion and such and as a result I'm way over sensitive? Or am I right in feeling a bit miffed?

I said something about t and she actually got hurt like she didn't mean it like that but was also upset that I could think she would mean it like that. "
eldritchterror,asktransgender,[NSFW] MtF; nipple questions??," I've only been on hormones for almost 2 months now, and within the first 2-3 weeks, I noticed my nipples are very sensitive now. I've gone from hardly ever feeling them even when actively touching them to sexual stimulation from a light breeze. That's not really a concern of mine though, figured it would happen. 

What I HAVE noticed, is that my areola are darker now, and they seem - for lack of a better term - puffy? everything is the same size, but it is just more...prominent, I guess? Whenever I touch them,  I also feel a small 'lump' underneath each of them although I'm assume that's supposed to be there, but I've never noticed it before. I'm just curious if anyone else has experienced this before/if it's normal. Thoughts?"
transthrowawawyawy,asktransgender,[Question] I'm getting cold feet about transitioning when I think about the distant future. Any thoughts?,"Okay friends, I came out about a year and have socially transitioned. I go part time right now. Luckily I have a small frame, short, very skinny, so it's easy to look fairly passable. I finally have the appointment made to get HRT and I did my blood labs Friday.

 I'm 24 years old and hesitant about the future of it all. Male pattern baldness, wrinkles, etc. I feel my value as perceived by society as a male will increase over time and as a female, decrease. That loss of value as I age makes me really worried. It's not the sexual or imagery aspect of it, it's societies perception of men vs women as they age. Like, will I become less passable and less passable over time? Or will I just look like an older woman. I would be happy with the latter but the former makes me worried. All this work only for the male in me to claw its way back to the surface with time..

Further, I keep thinking about a major global crisis that destabilizes world markets. The financial system has been on life support for the past 5 years, etc. I'm afraid that in 20 years some drastic event could happen and the access for estrogen and anti-androgens would be gone. In that case our bodies can't just rebound. I'm scared of being dependent on a manufactured substance for the rest of my life.

I have always wanted to be seen as a girl and since I've partly transitioned my life has been so much better but the far far distant future has me worried."

I don't want to have to always be wearing makeup to cover it up because it is expensive to wear foundation and the right stuff to cover up the five o clock shadow every day, not to mention it's just stressful and acne issues. Waxing, hair removal cream, and using an epilator will force me to wait like a week without shaving so that the hairs are long enough, making me feel gross and miserable.

shyember,asktransgender,Does a trans* networking subreddit exist? How about something outside of reddit?,"I know a few older trans* folks in my area that are good, outspoken chaperones to the sleeping world when issues (like the bathroom bill garbage) come home to roost.

At some point, once I'm out and full time, I'm considering taking up a similar role as an advocate and example of the community.

I imagine it would help if advocates and liaisons from different areas could assist each other in drafting response language and building effective outreach programs through collaboration.

Do networking resources exist for trans* advocates outside of the large, formal organizations we're familiar with?

If not, I figure this is something I could help build as a way to give back to a community that, despite all its foibles, has been the single greatest source of joy in my life so far."
BearWalrusCat,asktransgender,Confused; Possible FTM?,"Over this past week, I started watching an FTM youtuber. He made me realize I feel similar to how he did when he was a girl. Sometimes I feel like if I were a cis-man, I wouldn't be confused about my identity, that I would already be fine with who I am. This youtuber I mentioned felt like they were in the wrong body, I feel the same way but not as strongly. The only reason I'm still confused about this is because I don't always feel out of place, but occasionally I will strongly feel like I'd might be happier if I were a dude. But sometimes I'll have the suspicion that I just want to be different from my friends since none of them are trans. My doubts may sound stupid but it's because I know that I love to feel different from others. All the same, I still know I sometimes feel out of place as a girl, but other times I feel okay. I have taken a few internet quizes but I already know they are utter baloney. I always get genderfluid since I'm cconfused about this anyway. I hope I didn't confuse anyone the way I worded this, but please give some advice. I do still realize that I am the sole person to identify my gender."
SorceressChloe,asktransgender,My story of self realization and coming out(so far),"Back around September I started to feel like I no longer could or wanted to repress feelings I've had for my entire life. Feelings of being drawn to femininity and feminine things. The problem for me then was that I really didn't understand why I had these feelings or what it meant, and so I finally did what I should have done years ago. I went online to see if I could find anything that was even close to what I felt. The internet is a big place and surely I couldn't be the only one with these feelings, right??? So I discovered this subreddit and /r/MtF. I spent a few hours... days... weeks reading various posts on a multitude of different topics and found out that I was in fact not alone in these feelings!

I read so many posts that described things so similar to what I felt and dealt with growing up. Even reading all this though, I still couldn't quite accept it. I still wasn't sure this was REALLY me. I began to search the Internet for documentaries on trans people. I watched every one I could find. Again I saw so many stories that were so similar and that I could identify with so easily. I searched youtube for transgender related videos and found several channels that were great for me in learning about trans things and learning to accept myself. My favorite one is from Julie Vu ([PrincessJoules](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT9lRRTBWIqMIfVgSyfsg7Q) is her youtube name) I found some youtube videos of an old Barbara Walters interview with Jazz Jennings and her family. Following that I found the TLC reality series following Jazz and her family! It was so great for me to see such a perfect example of a trans person who was completely normal living a completely normal life with a family and friends that love her! Finally I started to feel that I could accept myself. This was no longer something that I needed to be scared or ashamed of! 

Finally in mid November a few weeks before Thanksgiving I gave one of my sisters a call and asked if she could talk to my other sister and arrange a time for the three of us to meet and talk. They were the first people that I came out to. Their initial reaction was very supportive! Both said that they would love and support me no matter what. It was so hard to even tell them in the first place I was completely in tears, but I was very happy to have gotten this kind of reaction. I didn't really think that would have a really negative reaction, but I'm not especially close with them(I'm not all that close with anyone really) so I wasn't 100% sure how they would feel about something like this. There was a part of me that was hoping this might bring us closer, but unfortunately in the 5 or so months since then our relationship hasn't really changed at all. They've never brought up the trans thing with me, never asked if I was doing ok, if I had found any doctors, or made any steps towards transitioning. I'm not really sure how to feel about that, but I feel bad that we aren't very close. Either way coming out to them was one of the hardest things I've ever done, and it was the point where I thing it finally hit me that this was real. That I really had accepted this and was ready to do something about it.

I began to search online to find what I could do about it. I was really worried it would take a long time to get anything going because I kept seeing all this stuff about having to see multiple doctors in order to get started on hormones. Starting with seeing therapist until they are willing to write a recommendation letter. I don't have any insurance and new it would be close to, if not actually, impossible for me to afford to go through that kind of process. Then I learned about informed consent clinics! I started to search for any that would be in my state(Alabama). Sadly, but not surprisingly, there was nothing that I could find. My next step was to search in Georgia to see what I could find. Atlanta is only about an hour to hour and a half drive for me. I thought surely I would be able to find something in Atlanta! Sadly this was again not the case. I found some places in Georgia that did transgender care, but couldn't find anything informed consent based. I was feeling fairly distressed at this point, but expanded my search further to all the surrounding states. Finally I found a clinic in Memphis TN! I called them up and scheduled an appointment. It was unfortunately a 4.5 hour drive for me to get there, but I was determined to do this and wasn't about to let that stop me. I called them up and made my appointment. Honestly I was nervous as hell making the appointment, and being in the clinic the first time. I had absolutely nothing to worry about in that regard they were wonderful! It took two trips going up there, but I finally had my prescription!

About a month ago one of best friends and I met up for lunch and were having a conversation after about a bunch of nerdy stuff that veered off into politics. This isn't something that we have discussed much of in the past so I wasn't really sure where he fell politically. Since the conversation was already getting into politics I took the opportunity to bring up the horrific anti lgbt legislature that's trying to be passed in most if not all of the southern states at the moment. I was delighted to hear him voice protest to these bills! I was seriously trying to decide if I wanted to come out to him right there, and how to go about it, but his girlfriend called and said she was coming over so I decided it wasn't the right time. About a week later we met up for a movie, and I decided I was gonna tell him after the movie. So after the movie we went out to my car and started to talk, and I told him I had something that I wanted to tell him. I started to cry a little, as I got it out, and things seemed pretty awkward for a moment. It was probably a few seconds but seemed like forever! When he spoke, though, he was quite supportive! we sat in my car in the movie theater parking lot and talked about it for like 2 hours! I drove him back to his apartment and we talked for another 15 or 20 minutes, then he hugged me when we said goodbye! It was pretty great we had never hugged before that, so it really sealed for me the fact that he really was going to be supportive! Since then we've actually been hanging out a bit more often than usual even!

Two days ago I finally decided to tell my mother! Our dryer is broken and she needed to dry some laundry so I went with her, and after we got the clothes in the dryer we went back out to her care to talk. It was actually a lot harder to tell her, than anyone else I had told thus far, and I was unsure how she would react. Once i finally got the words out through the stream of tears on my face. She said to me, ""You're my child and there's nothing you could ever say or do that would make me not love you."" I was already crying at this point or else that surely would have done it. This was maybe the happiest single moment I've ever experienced in my life. We sat and talked about it for a while. Especially about telling my father. He is the person that I most fear to have to talk to about this. I told her that I want to wait until I can get back out on my own(I'm living with them atm) before I tell him. She agreed that might be the best idea. I think he will likely take it very badly at least to begin with. Mom seems to think he will probably come around eventually, and while I'm hopeful of this, I'm not so sure. I hope I'm just flat out wrong, and he takes it as well as the rest of the people that I've told so far, but well I just can't tell him yet.

So that's my story so far I guess. I have a few important friends and my dad left to tell before I no longer need to hide anything anymore! A day that I very much look forward to!

I'm not completely sure why I even bothered to write all of this out but hopefully it can help someone else!

TLDR: This ended up being way longer that I thought, and I don't know that I can sum it up that easily, so my apologies."

Thr0w4w4y1mw0rthl3ss,asktransgender,As I sit here staring at this rope.....,"I can't help, but wonder how my life came to this. I've essential lost everything. And I feel like I've done nothing. I came out to my wife who seemed supportive and a few friends. Started seeing a therapist. Made plans to start hrt. And thats it. Now it seems as though I've created a rift between myself and the world. My job will be torturous if I were to ever come out there. My wife has seemingly turned on me. My children see me as some sort of monster. The friends I thought I had, who say they'rr acceptong and supportive, have stopped talking to me altogether. And this is only the beginning. It would only seem to get worse long before it ever got better.

I dont know why I'm writing this. Maybe so somewhere someone knows why I did what I did. Maybe in the hopes that by the time I finish I'll change my mind.

I can't imagine life without my wife and kids. I also can't imagine continuing life the way I have. I may be able to be happy with myself without her, but I'll be miserable. I can also be happy with her and just hate myself. Neither of these options are good enough. I'd rather not have to maake the choice at all. Easier, less stressful.

I've spent a little more than 3 decades hating me. Hating my appearence and how I was seen in this world. Hating how people treated me. I've tried to conform, so very much have I tried. Played football, basketball, worked on cars with my dad, shot guns, went hunting, climbed trees, all of it and every bit of it I have hated it with a passion. I don't care about cars. I would rather watch sports than play them. I don't want to kill things nor do I want to know how to. I could care less how a car works so long as it gets me back and forth to where I want to go.

I guess in the end you're only as good as those around you and apparently I chose unwisely. I apologize for this wall of negativity, I know you all have your own ordeals to handle. I just needed somewhere to put this cause I don't know that I'll ever be able to say it."
anon33249038,asktransgender,I have a serious question about trans life that has been eating at me.,"This is a serious question and I would appreciate serious replies and no criticism because this is something that's really been eating at me because I can't figure out the answer. I'm coming here in good faith and not to start an argument but just to try to see some opinions.

I am a straight male in all respects (birth, identity, lifestyle, etc). Could I identify as female and change nothing else? What I mean to say is, could I identify as a woman without shaving my beard or growing out my hair or changing to ""feminine"" attire or leaving my girlfriend or changing any other aspect of my life? I think the bigger question I have that's really at the root of this is should I, if I identify as a woman, conform to how Society thinks a woman should look? Why wouldn't a woman look like me if I identify as one? Why do I have to change what is outside to conform to their views of what a transgendered person is?"

HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,I can't feel womanly without feeling fetishistic and disgusting and guilty,"I've barred myself from really feeling and participating in social interaction because I'm done participating as the fake man, and I can't as a woman because whenever I start to feel female, I get too excited, in an aroused way.  

Now I've gone through all the autogynephilia stuff, and I don't believe its a good definition of trans people *at all* but the fetish thing persists in me (probably because it was the only way i could enjoy the thought of being female when i couldn't realistically be one...i actually still struggle with this, i'll never be a 'real' woman, only a trans woman.  i know trans women are real women. its just an emotional problem).  I also know i feel the guilt because society told me i was wrong to have these feelings.  I can't get over it though.  All the persuasions of society win and I shrink back into my detached void of non-emotion (except anger and anxiety) ---

--at least i think its the persuasions of society that make me detach. i don't really know why. its like, automatic



I mean literally i don't socially interact.  I quit college because coming out killed me socially, I became a hermit, living back at my parents house, luckily they support me (monetarily and trans-identity, although they don't understand it and my dad makes that clear), and i sit up at my computer near my room all day.  I only interact with family at meals, and rarely see friends.  

I also don't go out in feminine clothes.  No dresses, no skirts, never even worn makeup (well mascara once or twice).  I might pass but I don't feel like I do, not while I have a penis, a brow ridge, and a low voice (i know some trans women are totally cool with keeping their genitals as they are, its just not the case for me).  I could work on my voice but I dunno, it feels fake to, too.  And it still wouldn't be enough,  I believe my brow ridge gives me away to strangers, and I don't want to cover it whenever i'm in public, that also feels fake.  Wearing skirts with male genitals, for me, doesn't jive.  I do wear women's fitted jeans and shirts, and since they've become the norm I'm not aroused at wearing them...or don't let myself be. I dunno.  

Anyone relate?  Any advice?  

It kinda sucks not being able to be me. i know im the one stopping myself but still.  argh

Antianara,asktransgender,"A question about bathroom rights in the UK at university, who to contact when I'm being denied my rights?","Hello, firstly I apologise for the poor title, never been good at getting my meaning out, secondly I'm a male to female transgender girl and currently a university student, I attended a trans youth group meeting a while back and we discussed trans rights, one thing that stuck with me was that in the UK under the equalities act people of any gender may use any gendered bathroom that they feel most comfortable using, so I began using the women's bathrooms at my university campus. Shortly after I'm called to see the student guidance councillor who tells me I can't use the women's bathrooms because, in his words, ""[I'm] not feminine enough and there have been complaints from some of the female students that they feel uncomfortable with [me] in their bathroom"". I tried to stick up for myself and told him about the law that I had been given a print out of at the youth group, which was a direct quote of the act on the matter, but he disregarded it and said that I'm not allowed to use the women's bathrooms or the men's, but I can just use the disabled bathrooms instead. I'm honestly incredibly insulted and upset by this and I'm really at a loss as to what I should do, or can do about the situation. I don't want to provoke my university and jeopardise my degree, but I also don't think this kind of behaviour should be tolerated and short of getting a lawyer, which I cannot afford on a student loan, I don't see who I can go to about this. Does anyone know of perhaps a governing body for universities that enforces codes of conduct, or if I could contact my local mp perhaps? Really any advice would be appreciated.

Anyway, I constantly daydream/fantasize about me as a girl. With breasts, curves, soft skin, long hair, feminine voice, etc. But when I begin to think about my genitalia, I ask myself questions about SRS.

I feel kinda ""whatever"" or ""meh"" about my genitalia. I'm not proud of my so called ""manhood"" it's just hanging there, literally. I only use it to pee and ... pleasure myself. ._.

I mean if I could snap my fingers and magically have a vagina, I would in a second. It's just the actual surgery of SRS that scares me. I really don't want to go through it, but yet I do only for the positive outcome.

I know, not getting SRS doesn't make me less woman or anything, I get it. But like I said, it's the whole idea of the surgery that scares me most.

I understand that getting SRS comes with life changing challenges post surgery, such as having to constantly dilate.

Anyway, my question is how did you get over the fear of getting SRS? How did you manage to calm down and be brave about it? Can you please explain to me how things went for you?

HyperFreya,asktransgender,I need some advice...,"So after almost 10 years of self doubt and what I today recognise as gender dysphoria, I've finally come out to a few close friends. There has been a few different reactions, from ""I've always kind of figured as much"" to ""If that is how you feel, I will respect you for it"". But these are people who I kind of knew would be very nice about the whole thing.

My problem is that I do not know how I should break it to my other friends and my family. I fear that they will react badly or not take me very seriously. I want to talk to a therapist about it (because you need to do that in sweden to start the transition), but I don't know if I should tell my family and friends about my plans first out of respect for them.

This is driving my up the wall because I feel like I'm stuck at a crossroad of sorts. Either I move forward without telling anyone or I do tell them and see how they'll react to it."
cloaked_mode8,asktransgender,MTF social expression easier after starting HRT?,"Has anyone found their female emotional/social expression came more naturally once they started HRT (or transition in general)?

I'm a mid-30's AMAB who is slowly coming to terms with some long-standing gender issues. My dysphoria seems to
be mostly physical and emotional in nature, and so I guess I've never felt a deep need to present as female in a social sense. I was raised in an extremely masculinized environment (Deep South), and despite feeling like an imposter, I've worked hard at cultivating a male mask. Weight training, martial arts - I even worked for a while as a bouncer (probably my city's smallest ever, ha ha). Anyway, I'm strongly considering starting HRT, and I'm really concerned that the male mannerisms, speech, walk, etc. that I've worked so hard on will make it very difficult for me to ever present or pass as female. 

And to be honest, while I'd love to be able to openly enjoy some stereotypically female things (female fashion is sooo much more interesting than male fashion, and babies make me feel like I've been punched in the ovaries), I also genuinely enjoy some masculine activities: craft beer, weight lifting, woodworking. 

I have an inkling that starting HRT might take the lid off of Pandora's box, so to speak, that feeling physically different would help me unleash some of my repressed emotions and interests. But I'm curious if anyone else has found female presentation more natural after beginning transition?"
purplepariahhood,asktransgender,[bit off-topic] Are proxy families a thing? Success stories/advice? Just good family stories in general?,"*Sorry, not super trans related, but I don't know where else I'd go.*

('Proxy family' -&gt; family by choice, not by blood/culture)

There happens to be alot of different people (~ 4-5 family's worth) that I'm technically legally/culturally/biologically related to. But, you probably guessed it, stuff isn't exactly not good, it's just...not there at all. I could expound but it probably wouldn't be fun for any of us :P.

I've heard alot about families where people feel...like family? Good, maybe? I thought they were exaggerating/lying. Reading more online, I've been coming across stuff basically saying that my experience isn't the norm. I'm not sure how much I believe it, but the idea of being around a family and being psychologically healthy sounds as much a fairytale as transitioning successfully did. I actually think I've been unconsciously trying to find one, I dunno.

Has anyone in a similar position found a family for themselves? Any advice for someone interested in this?

Also, if you feel like you have a successful/good family situation, please feel free to just share some sort of summary or story about it. I like reading that stuff :). (Is there a place for just good family stories? I'd love to read them)"

EmiCol,asktransgender,Dysphoria Gone?,"I have posted previously about having crippling dysphoria so bad that I just couldn't focus on school, work, or anything not having to do with me being trans.  I was just really wanting to transition but still having some minor doubts.

Well, yesterday it was like some just flipped the switch and I was able to focus on and complete a lot of schoolwork (woo!).  The dysphoria is still there but nowhere near as intense as it was just Monday.  I had days like this when I first started questioning but this has happened for several months.  I had just gotten used to the intense dysphoria everyday and was just dealing with it.

So my question is... has anyone else had days like this?  This makes me feel like my prior feelings are invalid.  I already had doubts about transitioning before but now this has added even more doubts.  Does this mean I'm not trans?  I've been seeing a gender therapist for 10 months now and she won't give me the ok to start HRT due to these doubts."
Osricthebastard,asktransgender,2nd transition casualty: officially an orphan.,"Things have not gone well between my father and I. His reaction to my transition wasnt just to deny it but to be downright angry about it. He'd accuse me of being selfish, harp about all the people I was hurting, be dismissive towards my struggle, and more or less treated me like the biggest piece of shit for doing this ""to everybody"" (even though he was the only one actually complaining).
Now my dad loves me. I know this. He was an excellent father to me for 27 years and he's just in shock and dealing with grief and doesnt know how to handle these emotions appropriately.
Regardless I was getting sick of the screaming matches. I was getting sick of having my buttons pushed until I said hateful things back. I hated what these conversations were turning me in to.
So I called him again to tell him that I couldnt do it any more and that things are no longer up for discussion. I didnt get that far. He told me to check my email. In it was what basically amounted to an ultimatum. The first ""term"" was of course that I would ""only dress and present myself in a manner befitting a male when in his home"". By that point I already knew my response was ""well I guess Im never coming into your home then, but then the demands got even more absurd. I wasnt allowed to use my girl name in conjunction with my last name. I can only conduct myself in a manner that would not bring embarassment on the people around me and I couldnt be too public with my transition. He was basically telling me that I keep it on the downlow for the rest of my life and never be out or proud or else... Im already out, full time, and my face and name are gonna be in the local paper in a month for a local pride event. He was in essence demanding that I resign from my position in this years pride.
Did I mention that Im 27 and have been independant since 19? I couldnt live with those terms so our relationship was effectively over. I later sent him an email the tl;dr of which is that when he's ready to begin accepting this he can have a place in my life again.
Truth is that may never happen.
So as of now I have 1 dead parent and one disowned parent which equals no parents. Feels bad.

Edit: you know what actually DOES make me feel like a piece of shit? My mom was  a bad parent when it came to providing for her two children and taking care of her adult responsibilities, and had a mountain of mental health issues that, while she'd begun to heal and become healthier as she got older, still made her a nightmare to deal with for long periods of time, and died of a crack overdose. But you know what? She loved my brother when he came out as gay. She would have loved me as her trans daughter. She was one of the single most generous and accepting souls that walked the face of this earth and I wish it had been him instead of her. THAT makes me feel like the selfish prick he's accused me of being this whole time."
LunarTransceiver,asktransgender,Social security record update questions,"So, I'm going to try to change my SS records soon (US). After reading a little about the process, I still have 3 questions. I'd love to hear from anyone who has already done it.

1. If I go to the SS office in person, can I take my photo ID  back home with me when I leave? I know the new SS card will be mailed to me, but I read something about them mailing you your ID back too. Do I have to leave it with them?

2. When will the computer records be fully updated? Immediately? Or not until after I receive my new card? I'd like to do something that requires a background check soon. They just need my SSN, not the card itself. Can I do this right after leaving the SS office, or does the change take time to register.


3. How will I know for sure that they actually changed my gender marker? It's not printed on the card. What if they say they changed it but actually didn't? Would I have any way of knowing before I potentially got outed by it somewhere down the road?

Thanks!"
LongBeachVero,asktransgender,Dense Facial Hair and Electrolysis / Skin Healing / NEVER-ENDING!,"Kind of a rant and reaching out for solidarity at the same time. I unfortunately didn't start laser hair removal until quite a bit of gray hair started growing. Although laser did help zap a LOT and got rid of the horrid 5 o'clock shadow, I'm not left to subject myself to what seems like countless hours of electrolysis. The person who does this for me is a trans woman herself and we've been doing 2 hour sessions every weekend for 4 months now and honestly.. I don't see any change except for the dark skin spots which she says go away and they are normal due to the skin damage that is caused by electrolysis (she's right.. over time they do lighten..) and the scabbing which usually clears up after a week which she also says is normal. She tells me that electrolysis on the face takes a long time and to not get discouraged but it's hard not to. One of the worst things is not even being able to get a close shave in due to not wanting to shave off any scabbing that might occur. My saving grace is that I still present male so don't have to worry about putting make up over them but ... all the stubble is bumming me out. I've resorted to clearing as much of it as I can by buying an electric razor. 

Please tell me this gets better!"

Some I have known for over 25 years. For the last couple years I have been on HRT and have been finding it increasingly difficult to continue hiding myself, both mentally and physically. 

Lately, I've been letting more of my inner self show through, and I'm afraid this is not going over too well with my boss and some co-workers. Some of them are very bigoted and close minded, so its not a company where I think I will be able to transition socially. At the same time, I am terrified that I won't be able to find work
as a trans woman. I also have some serious health issues.
Because of this, the insurance and good pay are very much needed for my well being.

I'm really stuck at the moment. I need to be myself and I need the job. I'm afraid the two are coming to a head and it scares the shit out of me.

I sort of understand this just due to the sheer oppression and the struggles of dysphoria and so on but I've never felt this way. When I think deeply on it I am not ashamed of being trans, that is part of who I am. If I started cutting up my brain to match heteronormative standards where would we stop? Would I even be me? Would we just cut out the gay and lesbian desires while we are at it? Would we have a master mold that all brains should more or less resemble? I don't know I just don't ever think I could turn my back on who I am and I think it is only hatred that makes me have any kind of muddled feelings about being trans. I'd much rather just accept myself and have researchers work on better methods for transition and ideally someday just have it so that transition becomes low risk with good consistent results.

Recently I really started to envy women!! when they exhibit themselves I think ""I wish I could be her"". if I read a Facebook post of a woman in leggings or sexy clothes receiving likes and appreciation, I literally die of envy!! I envy the fact that they can wear sexy clothes and show off. 

In my life I am very timid and I feel that I am not as assertive and secure as other men, but apart for this I have masculine habits. It's like if my sexual identity is completely split from my real life identity!! I don't know how to explain this...

I masturbate regularly, but I'm still a virgin (I'm not really concerned over my virginity, it is what it is) and I suppose I'm concerned over what the effect on me could be, and how I'd feel about them. I've heard of shrinking, difficulty getting and keeping erections, infertility, possible sterility and low sex drive.

What happened to you? How does it feel? How are orgasms now compared with before? How difficult is orgasm to achieve?

Furthermore, would this be a favorable outcome? For people alive now, the question is academic but were we somehow able to entirely remove gender labels from activities/behaviours, would we see a reduction or even the disappearance of people identifying as transgender and instead see people identifying with a range of things from across what we now define as the gender spectrum and viewing biological sex as something akin to hair/eye color?

The one person in my family who is even semi-sensible is my brother.

Now, my bro is pretty liberal. He supports Bernie Sanders and seems pretty chill about LGBT related things, but he's always considered me his ""bro"". We always hung out and stuff, did a lot of things, I just dunno how he would react if I told him I was trans.

I mean, should I even bother telling him? I dunno. Any help would be appreciated!"
animeboy2016,asktransgender,Am I transgender,"I have been questioning my gender for a will now but I have known that I'm bi for a long time. I've never really thought about wanting to be a woman. I'm fine with my body and I really like myself as I am, but I started to play this game with several trans characters in it and I felt really weird at first I thought it was because I found the characters attractive but that didn't seem to be the case. At the end of the game it showed one of the trans characters in her wedding dress and I just got so emotional I nearly cried. I just thought I'd give anything to be her she looked so beautiful. I've started to have dreams about it. I'm in my classroom but dressed as a girl and everyone was just talking to me normally It felt amazing to be so accepted and comfortable. In another dream I'm in a shop where I can wear any cloths I want and I pick out a dress. I'm still fine with my body and I really enjoy being a man but every now and then I remember those dreams and feel really confused."
Florient,asktransgender,Is there a general awareness of circumcision's affect of transition surgery?,"
I'm an anti-circumcision advocate, and I've always wondered about the relationship between intactivism and the trans community.

From my understanding, circumcision has a negative impact on the pleasure MtF individuals will experience, because when constructing the new vagina, there are less nerve endings and erogenous tissue available. 

Is my understanding correct? And is this issue discussed much in the trans community?

Thank you!"

##Some tips for working on your voice:

* Stay out of falsetto! Falsetto is only useful in finding your head voice, it's not a very good place to go for finding a voice to speak in. Falsetto is the vocal range above your normal vocal range, and you should feel a ""break"" in your voice as you transition from your normal vocal range up into falsetto
* Work on your resonance! You should feel no vibrations in your chest when speaking. The target you're looking for is your ""head voice""
* To find your head voice, try pushing your larynx (the thing your adam's apple is attached to) up as far as you can, and attempt to ""throw"" your voice out of the top of your throat instead of your chest. You should feel vibrations in your mouth, teeth, upper throat and maybe even your nose when you're doing it correctly
* Once you get your head voice, take your guy voice up into head voice and you should get something that starts to sound female.
* Talk to yourself in your female voice when no one else is around, so you can build up muscle memory

##How to rate others' voices

If you don't know the vocabulary to describe what someone is doing wrong, feel free to simply state how close you think they are to passing. Please be honest and respectful, and don't tell someone they pass when you know they don't so that they don't end up using the wrong voice techniques. There's nothing worse than building confidence in a non-passing voice and then realizing it doesn't pass later on and you wasted your time.

If you are going to post your own voice clip, please help others with their voices as well! The best way to make this a useful thread is for everyone to pitch in :)

boudica_of_skyrim,asktransgender,Positive media starring/about trans people?,"Title. I was trying to find something on Netflix that actually showed trans people in a positive light (that wasn't OITNB or Sense8, which I've already seen lol) and couldn't find jack. I was wondering if you guys knew of any media - books, TV, music, movies, whatever - that shows trans people in a positive and accurate light. A.k.a. doesn't use us as a stereotype, doesn't have us die at the end, and doesn't have us as a ""magical minority"" type character to help the cis main character learn about themselves or whatever.

So far all I have is...

*Orange is the New Black*

*Transgender Dysphoria Blues* by Against Me!

luxaeterna952,asktransgender,FFS Consultation List,"Hello everyone :)

So I put together a list of the FFS consultations I've done so far, along with upcoming ones. There's sooo many options!! As of now I'm leaning towards Zukowski or Facial Team (if I can be patient...yeah right), but I have a lot more consults to go. Elliot Jacobs I worry would be too conservative, and for that amount of money I could go to someone ""better"", but that's just my opinion. Consult with Javad Sajan is next Monday, so maybe I'll do an update after that. 

I'd just like to hear your thoughts on who I've listed, and maybe it'll help me narrow down the list just a little. Feel free to give suggestions. Aiming to do the surgery around May-June. 

Dr. Mark Zukowski (Illinois): Jaw, Chin, Rhinoplasty, Scalp Advancement, Cheeks (maybe) = $30,000. $26,000 without cheeks

Dr. Elliot Jacobs (New York): Rhinoplasty, Hairline lowering, Juvederm to lips, Radiesse to jawline = $18, 650

Dr. Toby Mayer (California): Forehead lift/Hairline lowering, Rhinoplasty, Small Cheek Implants, Chin Contour, Lip Lift = $25,000

Dr. Jeffrey Spiegel (Massachusettes)

Dr. Vartan Mardirossian (Florida)

Dr. Javad Sajan (Washington)

Facial Team (Spain)

Cocobrien23,asktransgender,Gender Problems :/,"Can anyone help me with my gender confusion? I've had a little bit of gender dysphoria my whole life, or at least a desire to be female, which has permeated every single day. For a very long time, it was largely a sexual thing. The idea of either turning into a girl, or being one excites me so much, and I want to say 99% of the time I have ever pleasured myself is using that thought.
I tried crossdressing two years ago, and it felt really good. It felt comfortable, and right. I decided, however, that it wasn't enough, since I still felt like a man in drag. I then made the decision to transition, and concluded I was trans. I got on hormones four months ago, and it was the happiest moment of my life. After coming out as trans, I was filled with amazing euphoria. I was so excited.
Now, I don't know what has happened. :( Everything seems to have changed. The thrill is gone, and neither female clothes not the thought of being female fills me with euphoria anymore. I can't say it has done the opposite and made me feel worse, but I just feel so confused now. I also have other moments in my life that are constantly making me question it now. For starters, I am attracted to women, and sometimes in a ""male"" way, if that makes sense. I also am very happy with friends, and in certain environments, and considering I haven't transitioned much at all yet, doesn't that mean I should be just fine if I continue being male? The idea of being gender fluid doesn't really appeal to me. I'm a person who wants to simply pick a side, if I can. But I'm so discouraged lately. Why am I not loving this anymore? :/ Why am I feeling confused? Or depersonalized?
There is one other possibility. I quit my zoloft (an anti-depressant) cold turkey two months ago. I was on it for 9 months. I've heard it can cause bad withdrawal effects, but after two months shouldn't I be fine now? Ugh. :(

es-so,asktransgender,(MtF hormones) does anyone else experience uncontrollable crushes?,"So I'm about two months into hormones and am starting to get an uncontrollable crush on a friend of mine. I can't stop thinking about him and want to spend a ton of time around and close to him. 

My E levels are in female range and my T is almost bottomed out. I'm used to not really having a thing for anyone so this crush is really hard for me to control. 

He's a new friend of mine but we're close already and very emotionally open. I think I have a crush because of this openness but would very much like to get rid of this crush. I value his friendship too much to risk it. 

Did anyone else experience crushes like this? If so how did you cope? Any other advice is welcome too."

shoeroof,asktransgender,Signs of HRT working?,"I've been on 100mcg/24h estradiol (estradot) for little over two weeks now, and 50mg cyproterone for little under two weeks.

10 days into estradiol I started feeling tender around my breast and a bit towards armpits. Felt kind of like what you would feel after a workout, but I can't remember using any of those muscles recently. Nipples felt a bit sore also. It lasted for five days, which made me think it was just some muscle tenderness. But today it started again. Not so much tenderness but nipples feel sore and breast feels tens (a little like if it's very cold).

Is it possible that I'm already reacting to hrt? Or just wish full thinking that obscures my feelings."

lauraj1983,asktransgender,Realization triggered by major event?,"Around 2 years ago my wife and I had twins. Before then i had only cross dressed occasionally, and always felt a bit uncomfortable being masculine. I figured all these feelings i had had were normal male feelings. 
When the twins were born there was of course massive stress - as twins are known to cause. But also came a lot more dysphoria than i had had before. It was only after that that i began to think i may be transgender. Since then the stress has subsided a bit but the dysphoria remains. That niggling doubt is still there that tells me it is just an overreaction that started it and it is just something i convinced myself of. 
Has anyone else came to realise they are transgender after a major event? Could this just be something i have convinced myself of due to stress?"
Lilstephanie,asktransgender,Phone Anxiety,"Hi, I'm embarrassed to say I have phone anxiety.  I get nervous if I have to call someone I've never met before.  I also don't like answering the phone.  I think it's bad news or something.  I was interested in going on HRT because I got jealous of all the girls saying they were starting on them.  I'm fortunate to be small and feminine from being intersex.  So I've never had body issues many have.  I was born with one testicle and a micropenis.  So I have some T from the one ball but it's very low.  I want to see if I can benefit by getting HRT to eliminate any t and increase e.  But starting around thanksgiving I went into a tailspin.  I had a routine physical and they found a high white blood count.  So after New Years I was re tested and it was still high.  Then I was referred to a cancer center!  They ran a bunch of tests and I don't have leukemia.  But they thought I might have something called lupus.  Well, on Monday I found out I don't have that!   So I got the go ahead to look into HRT.  My original plan was to call the trans clinic on Tuesday.  But I chickened out.  Damn phone anxiety!  So today at around 4:30 pm I just said fuck it and went into the other room and called them!  I didn't want to be thinking about this stuff over the weekend and 5pm was approaching.  So I just did it.  The girl who answered was very nice.  I talked with her for a half hour!  So on Tuesday I have an orientation with a trans lady who does the orientation.  I have a Dr. Appointment for May 9th.  I feel awesome and very excited!   So my question is do any of you get anxious calling on the phone?  I'm normally very outgoing and not shy.  But this one little phobia gets to me.  I feel proud I called the clinic today and I hope others who are similar to me can do it too!"

Simplices,asktransgender,Will I be passable if I go on HRT?,"Please be honest and be real. Will HRT be enough or will I need FFS? I'm 16/ (17 in a week or two)
So far any attempt to look like a girl through dressing up has failed. I have a clear man-face.
I'm not interested in transitioning at all unless I'm going to be passable. I dislike being male and hate my body but it's not too bad. I would rather have a little dysphoria but be be a cute gay guy than a non-passable TS.
Please don't say I'm going to be passable just because of starting HRT in my teens because I've read people who started at 18 or so and did not turn out to pass at all. 

This is full on makeup so this is the most simply wearing makeup will do for me.

TrAshleyMac,asktransgender,Long-term spiro / antiandrogens,"Hey lovely girls :) and boys if you can help :)

I am a pre-HRT MtF transgender (maybe :P), but i think I'm non-op; could change my mind on this one day of course but at the moment I plan to keep my factory parts :)

What does this mean for hormones? I know spiro has some annoying side effects at least being a diuretic, as well as the hyperkalemia risk (annoying dietary requirements?)... would handling that for the rest of my life be a minor irritation, or intensely annoying? Are there any more serious side effects of long-term antiandrogen use (apart from the side effects of the intended hormonal changes of course)?

I will obviously talk to a doctor about this when I do start on hormones, but I'd love to hear people's experiences with this :)"
lobbedgrenade,asktransgender,Scared I might regret hormones (and other feelings that hold me back),"Hey, i'm a 17 yo transdude. I know for sure i'm trans, I know I suffer from a lot of dysphoria, and I know that hormones are pretty much going to solve most of my anxiety/dysphoria/social problems.


The thing is, i'm really scared to start medically transitioning. I know it's 100% what I want and need, but I cannot help feeling doubtful. I think one of my biggest and most petty fears of hormones, is that they'll make me ugly (which is totally ridiculous I know).


I know doubt is a really common reaction considering the life long commitment, the expense, the dedication, and the patience that comes with hrt. I want to know how you guys and girls got through these mental hurdles when faced with medical choices of transitioning.


For the past three days, I've been working myself up to call the howard brown clinic and schedule an appointment for getting hormones. These feelings of doubt are keeping me from confidently picking up the phone to make the call. Should I just get over it and call them anyway? I'm pretty sure once the call is done i'll feel more confident in my decision but y'know.... i'm terrified of regret D:

n0stradumas,asktransgender,How is this bathroom issue even an issue?,"Hello, non-trans male here.  I don't really have a question so much as I'd just like to vent.  I searched for a transgendered sub, but this was the first one I found and I didn't see anything else specifically for this.  If there's a more suitable sub where I can post this, please let me know, mods.

This bathroom issue is asinine.  I don't understand what people expect to happen.  Say a person transitions from man-to-woman, dresses like a woman, acts like a woman, etc.  Is this person really supposed to go in the men's restroom?  We don't want women and their children being upset at the sight of a man-turned-woman washing their hands, so here's a novel idea!  Let's make them use the men's bathroom!  Because most men would LOVE to see  a trans woman walking into the bathroom while they're taking a piss!  Nobody will get the shit kicked out of them by bigots for being a ""fag"" or anything!  Problem solved!

Conversely, I'll bet women would be thrilled to see a transgendered looking like a man coming out of the stall next to them.

This is so stupid it makes my blood boil.  I apologize if I'm coming off ignorant, or if I don't have a complete grasp on the law, please enlighten me.  I'm writing this to say that I'm a straight male, I have a casual acquaintance who is female-to-male, and he hasn't changed at all as a person (Initially, I had to remind myself not to mistakenly call him by his old name, as that would've been inconsiderate and embarrassing for me).  I used to be ignorant to why people would want to do this, but I realize now that it doesn't matter.  It's your life, and if you're comfortable with it and not hurting others, then that's the important thing.  Anyway, thanks for listening to me and allowing me to vent."
LoliSophie,asktransgender,How do gay and lesbian ppl feel about transmen and transwomen?,"I saw this blog on Tumblr that called lesbians who aren't attracted to transwomen ""vagina fetishists"" and transphobic. 

This is an interesting issue I hadn't thought about before, as a straight translady I've mostly just been worried about not being able to have relationships with men. 

But I never wondered about gay men and lesbians and how they would feel about trans individuals. It seems very controversial and a little paradoxical to me, to be a part of a community that so readily and eagerly supports one another but turns away in disgust at the thought of being with a trans person. 

And I was shocked at the amount of transphobic subtext I saw in responses to this Tumblr user. Many comments about dicks (surely this is a faux pas when it comes to trans people?) and insinuations that trans lesbians promote rape culture. 

It really blew my mind and kind of bummed me out. =[ I understand where people are coming from, because I love dicks and I'd be sad if my partner didn't have one but gosh those people sounded so mean. I wish I could remember the user so I could show you guys. What are your thoughts on this? I'd like some deeper insight!

Idon7be1ong,asktransgender,"No question, just venting","I have an appointment with an endo in 3 weeks, and I am becoming increasingly anxious and nervous about it.  I am afraid that I am too unhealthy to begin HRT.  I feel like I am in good health, but I have pretty bad heartburn/gerd and I just feel unwell at times.

I had issues when I attempted self medicating HRT (posted about before) that also worries me.

To be honest, I don't want to transition.  I only want to start HRT, which makes me feel like I am doing this for the wrong reasons, and makes me question why I am even doing this.

I feel like I would become even more of a recluse than I already am once hrt starts making certain changes obvious.

At the end of the day (literally, like when I'm going to sleep) it all makes sense, and everything is justified, and I feel like I'm doing the right thing.  But when I wake up this feeling is gone and my day starts.  I go to work and try not to think about this, end up coming here and reading other posts trying to find something that *validates* me being trans, but reading things on here generally makes me feel worse, because everyone seems so sure of themselves when I'm here struggling for the majority of my life to just accept it.

I don't know what it means to be female, and I don't know how to be male.

The thing that bothers me most, is I dont know if **any** of my problems are a cause of me being trans.  I feel like I could just stop going to my therapist and cancel my appointment to the endo and just forget it all and live life normally.  Then I remember I have pretty much tried all that and it hasn't worked, and it just makes me feel stuck and lost.  If i continue I will be an outcast to society, yet if I dont continue I can pretty much expect life to continue being as empty and depressing as it has been."

I'm trans, MtF, and I have a NC license plate on my car. I live out of state now, and some asshole decided that NC plates = bigot, so they put this lovely note on my car (warning, strong language, if that sort of thing bothers you):

https://imgur.com/gallery/9ollN

Yes, I hate my politicians as much as you do, random note-leaver, but making the assumption that I'm a bigot just because my license plate is from NC is just ignorant AF. The fact that I myself am trans just makes it more ironic. So, please don't be like this person, don't hate on people from NC just because their politicians are bigots."

AmIDysphoric,asktransgender,Does this sound like dysphoria to you?,Growing up I was quite feminine. I like to be seen and treated as a woman and I think I would prefer to have a female body. But having a male one does not necessarily upset me. I have a tendency to cry if people talk about how I can't get pregnant or how I am not a 'real woman'. I don't cry all the time but sometimes I do.
thisismalvar,asktransgender,I thought noone could understand how it feels to be trans if they didn't experience it themselves - turned out i was wrong!,"Yesterday I had a very pleasantly surprising conversation with a friend:

We were talking about a lot of things and at a certain point, i started to explain to him how i feel about being trans, how i am so confused in my head while being so absolutely certain in my gut and eventually, we got to the point where i said ""I suppose noone can really understand this if they're not in the situation themselves...""

His response was ""You're wrong, people can understand it if they only REALLY try for 5 minutes. Try it like this: First you ask the person what their most important possession is."" At this point, as you can probably imagine, i was almost certain that this was going to be absolute bullshit but i still kept listening:
""This is just to throw them a bit off-guard. When someone for example says that his most treasured possession is his guitar, you tell him ""Now I'm gonna play one note and poof you're a woman for the rest of your life. Imagine for 5 minutes how you're going through everyday life now and how it makes you feel."" If the person is really open to it, he will be able to understand how you feel.""

Ok, at that point we had established that he had actually given some thought to it and that he was convinced that he knew how i feel. Of course, i still had my doubts and so i asked him to describe how he felt when imagining this, expecting to have to tell him very soon that he still had no idea...

His answer was the following:
""I felt under constant observation. I felt like everybody was watching me and i was torn between hiding that i'm actually a guy or hiding that i was physically a woman.""

Not only could i not have phrased it any better, i couldn't have put it into words nearly as good as he did. To be completely honest, i wasn't even aware that this was exactly how i felt for such a long time before i finally decided to be honest with myself and admit that i'm just not a man, no matter my male body.
For a few seconds, i was about to tell him that this describes more how i feel now that my transsexuality is out in the open but then it came to me, how right he was: For all my life, i was torn between hiding that i always felt more like a girl inside and putting effort into appearing more masculine than i actually was, while at the same time, i also had to make sure that people didn't see me as a stereotypic guy. I was always proud and ashamed at the same time for how i just didn't think, feel and act like most men do.

Seriously, that person, who i thought would have never even had the slightest chance to truely understand what all of this means to me, had just managed to describe the very core of gender dysphoria in just a few sentences and he did it so well that even i, who has lived through it for the last two decades, actually realized something i hadn't fully understood before!

And the most astounding thing about it: To understand this, he didn't have to read lots and lots of books and articles on the topic. He only had to do the most simple (yet often most hard and painful) thing: He REALLY opened his mind to the idea and imagined it for 5 minutes.

When i told him, how impressed i was, he only said that he was certain that everyone was able to do so, if only they tried. However, as he said that those five minutes felt really awful, probably not everyone would be willing to do so...

Anyways, no matter whether i can get other people in my life to do what he did, it felt awesome to learn that someone was able to truely understand my pain without having to have experienced it himself. (Though, actually, he DID experience it himself, if only for a few minutes.)

I hope that reading this story may give some of you a bit of what experiencing it myself gave to me!

R0bojesus,asktransgender,Am I hoping HRT will be a depression cure rather than something I truly want?,"I've always been a guy who doesn't really care too much about gender. I tend to be uncomfortable around most other cis men so I've made friends with mostly women and ftm men and I guess I'm trying to sort my thoughts out about what would make me happiest. I don't experience any dysphoria, at least not intensely, but I've always had the desire to have been born a girl, and for years the idea of transitioning via HRT has been something toying with my mind. 

One thing I'm constantly upset by as a man is the feeling of intimidation. I don't want to be that scary guy among the group of girls. I don't want to be the odd man out among my best friends. I hate scaring people or upsetting them more than anything.

Throughout my life I've been suffering from intense depression and despite nearly heart stopping amounts of anti depressants, nothing has seemed to help. 

I can't tell if it's my perspective being warped by seeing so many other people go through transitions and be generally happier after. I want that too, I just don't know if it's for the right reasons and if I'll end up regretting it. I'm 20 right now and I feel like if I were to go on HRT I'd want to as soon as I could, but I don't really know and I don't think I'll ever know. I'd appreciate any kind of advice, to help me decide if I should even bring this up to my psychiatrist. Thanks a ton ^.^"

I regret not telling my very best friend about my desire to transition, one night as we talked about my suicidal thoughts, at age 20.

I regret not being true to myself for the first 21 years of my life.

I regret not transitioning earlier.

I regret spending years of my life just barely getting by, uncomfortable about who I was and with who the world said I needed to be.

I regret.

I regret.

I regret.

But is it worth it?

Is it worth spending the last years of my life, whether they be very numerous or very few, obsessing over who I once was?

I was once young. I was once confused. I was once unhappy with my life.

But now I know. Now I can fix it. And so I have. 

So why dwell on the past? I'm going to enjoy every last minute on this planet as I truly am and never dwell on what I could have done.

[deleted],asktransgender,Is there something wrong with me? [TW: SexTalk],"Literally. Should I be medically concerned? Or should I speak to a professional about this?

Throughout the day—anywhere from 5-20 times per day—I'll get nauseatingly horny out of no where. It makes it so I can't focus, I can't think, I can't concentrate on anything. All I can think about is having sex, or my mind is completely blank. I mean, up until maybe a couple months ago I've been pretty normal in that department—getting urges and what not, turned on whatever. Normal stuff. But now? For the past few months it's been crippling. My stomach feels like there's butterflies in it, my lower abdomen starts cramping. ERECTIONS? Why am I getting erections all of a sudden? It's so embarrassing in public because I'll have to sit down randomly and wait for it to pass (I present/pass full time). My whole body starts to tingle and I have to control my breathing or I start to pant and shake from how horny I am. Don't get me wrong, I liked it at first, but now I don't like it. It's debilitating. And I'm beginning to think something might be wrong with me. Not to mention how unsafe it makes me feel. I don't want to walk around in public and all of a sudden have a lump in my skirt. I've been wearing 3 pairs of panties to hold my junk back Incase I get an erection and it's been unbearably painful. I've been wearing nothing but super tight jeans to make sure I don't fly a flag in public.... but it's been so difficult. 

I've only told one person—my sister. I've been really embarrassed and kind of concerned/confused. 

Has **ANYONE** experienced this before? 

I'm on 100mg spiro 3x daily (300mg a day), 3 2mg tablets of estradiol 1x daily (6mg a day). I'm almost 17 months into my transition. 

My sister said I'm evolvin into a nympho like a Pokemon, which made me feel worse, but I'm worried. 

Any replies are appreciated. 

Thank you.

b7d,asktransgender,I'm feeling diseased and unsure...,"I've been following the news lately and I have someone I follow on Facebook that is extremely right wing. They made a post about Target now allowing transgender individuals to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as, and the comments made me feel so horrible. They were all about how transgender people are just diseased men and women who are running from the requirements of their assigned at birth gender. I know transgender people are not this, but I'm worried that maybe in my case that's what I am. Maybe the idea that I am a transgender woman stems from the fact that I'm a virgin male that's never been with a girl and has no clue how to be with a girl and no idea how to make a move... Therefore I want to be a girl so that someone else has to make a move on me. 

I have tried to get with a girl, but I have absolutely no desire to have sex and no libido. I'm worried that maybe I'm trying to find an excuse for that lack of feeling, and that maybe I'm just a sad aromantic asexual trying to find some semblance of normal in society, even if it is through being transgender. I was doing fine until I saw the Facebook post, but the doubts that have stemmed in my mind since then run so deep and it has me so scared and so unsure. I'm worried I'm just a stupid guy playing a charade, and since I've told everyone (and they've accepted it) I'm now trapped in a trans identity. 

I want to be female but I don't want to be a trans female. I just want to be stealth and normal; something that my frame will never allow. "

leydigcellhate,asktransgender,I was told I can change my NAME when I change my Gender Marker... is this true?,"Hello, I hope all is well!

So recently I filled out my medical affidavit for gender marker change (Michigan), and it has been signed by my surgeon. On the form there is a line that says ""New Name: ____""

The affidavit: http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdch/Medical_Affidavit_08-2010_346045_7.pdf

When I look at the FAQ at Michigan's Department of Health and Human Services, the website it says:
&gt; NOTE:  If you want to **also** change your **first and middle name** as a result of reassignment surgery, the physician should designate the changed name on the affidavit. If the physician does not designate the name to be changed at the time you submit the application, it can be done by court order.  
Link: http://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/0,5885,7-339-71551_4645_4933-13952--,00.html


To me, the above statement makes it seem like I don't need a court order to change my name. I had talked to someone at my local transgender support group, and they said this is true; that you don't need a court order. I am having a hard time believing that this is true! 


How have I not ready anything about this in my research!?!?

I hope it's not too good to be true. Does anyone know anything about this? 

Thank you!

Best,

tom_boy_princess,asktransgender,I'll be coming out to my parents tonight... [UPDATE],"On Friday night, I made this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4ewgod/ill_be_coming_out_to_my_parents_tonight/) mentioning that I was finally coming out to my parents. Well, here's what happened, and excuse the novel I'm about to write...

Around 9pm, I went by my parents house and found my dad alone watching a movie. I sat with him watching, making small talk, until my mom came home from work and sat with us. I kept up a good poker face, and pretended like nothing was out of the ordinary. Just after 11, I called it a night and left them to watch tv, and on my way out, I left my coming out letter on the kitchen counter. I paused at the door, thinking deeply about the million ""what ifs"" running through my head that could happen once I walked out that door, but I knew, it was time. In a rush of emotion, I literally ran to my car, got in, and drove home as quick as I could. I had gotten very little sleep the night before, and a few minutes before midnight, I fell asleep.

I woke up at 2:30am, checked my phone, and saw that i had two missed calls from my dad, along with a text that simply said ""Oli, I love you... Everything is okay."" Thinking my dad was probably asleep, and still exhausted, I fell back asleep until just after 6 when I received a text from him asking me ""Oli? Are you okay? Please text me back..."" Knowing he was worried, I texted him letting him know I was alright, just fell asleep is all. He said that he hadn't slept at all yet, and wanted to make sure I was safe. He then invited me to go out to breakfast with the family later in the morning.

11am rolls around where my brother, myself, dad, and mom all meet for breakfast. Nothing seems out of the ordinary, other than my brother being quieter than usual, and my parents are acting like nothing is wrong, like nothing happened. I skip work to spend the day with them furniture shopping and running errands. 

I'm getting nervous after a few hours because you'd think after dropping off that note that someone would want to say something about it, right? Finally, before we decided to all go out to dinner, my dad asks me to walk down to get the mail with him at his house. As soon as we're outside, he asks me about my letter and what it means.

I explained briefly how I felt and what I've struggled with for years now. 

""But you like girls still, right?""

""Yes, but it has nothing to do with that.""

""Are you like Caitlyn Jenner..?""

""Transgender? Yes.""

""Are you going to go around... in dresses?""

""Eh... probably not. Everyone presents differently, transitions differently, and expresses themselves differently. Honestly, I'll probably always be as I am now: skinny jeans, button up plaid or fitted tees, and skate shoes.""

""And... you mentioned hormones in your letter...""

""Yes, I have been taking them since August of last year, and they've literally turned my life around. I'm no longer depressed, my anxiety is half of what it once was, and I feel normal in my skin for once in my life. I'm finally happy, dad.""

""But.. um... won't they make you a chick?""

I chuckled, but seeing the concern on his face I composed myself.

""Yes. That's the point of them...""

""Oh... Well, I love you. I always will, and that's unconditional. If you're happy, then I am happy, but there's just two things I ask. One, please don't ever tell you mother. I don't want that sort of grief, on top of, she will reject you, and when she sees that me, and your siblings support you, it will create animosity that we just don't need. Two, please... I... I don't think I can handle hearing the details of your transition. If you absolutely need to talk, fine, but please, if you don't need to tell me what's going on, I ask that you refrain.""

I nodded and, as a family, we all went to dinner that night. I wasn't upset at all by his questions, considering he literally knows nothing on the subject. He's in his 60s and has never thought much about the subject besides snippets he's seen on tv. 

As far as I'm concerned, I've always been closer to my father and siblings than my mother. I love her dearly, but she's a religious fanatic that will never open her mind to the ever changing world around her. The more things progress, the more she digs her heels in. It's obviously debatable whether or not it was fair for my father and siblings to decide if she knows or not whether I'm trans, but honestly? I'm happy with the way things turned out. I thought, deep down, I was going to get disowned, or at very least, that my family wouldn't want to speak to me for awhile. I will respect my father's wishes and say nothing to my mom. Besides, she'll figure out it eventually as I transition further. 

Lastly, my dad texted me an hour ago asking if I'd like to get tea with him at our favorite local coffee shop later today. So, I'd say things are going as well as they could have. I apologize for the delay for anyone that was curious as to what happened. It's a sunny, beautiful day outside, and I feel good about what the future holds."
VolatileLemons,asktransgender,Alcohol Tolerance?,"DAE have their alcohol tolerance go way, way down on HRT? For ftms, did it go way up for any of you? I had a absolutely stupid alcohol tolerance before HRT. Like I could drink probably anyone I knew under the table if I wanted to. After about a month on HRT this tolerance went down considerably, with me blacking out after a drinking game during spring break of last year. Now, though, I can have like 2 beers in 2 hours and be pretty tipsy. I'm having minor difficulties typing this rn, whereas before hormones I could easily have six standard drinks in an hour or and hour and a half *before I'd even start feeling it*. Did anybody else have such a drastic change in their tolerance??"
iamnewhere01,asktransgender,My mom isn't helping me,"So two days ago I went to the JAC (it's a sort of help centrum for youngsters in Belgium). It was my second time I went there, normaly if the bomb attacks in Brussels (I live in a city about 30 minutes away from it) wouldn't have happend I would have gone there 2 weeks ago, because of this I was really excited for the session. During the session the lady that was holding the session with me handed me a brochure about transgender people (basically everything that's inside the brochure I already knew but I took it anyway because I didn't want to not be kind). She also wrote the address of a gender team in Louvain (rather close to where I live) in the brochure, advised me to go there with my problem because the JAC isn't specialized in problems gender related and we made plans for the next session. The session ended, I called my mom and my parents picked me up. I got in the car and not even a second later my mom saw that I was holding the brochure in my hands and asked me if she could take a look at it. I handed it over to her and at this point it all went downhill.

My mom asked me what we did in the sessions, I explained that we talk about stuff, obviously (trans)gender related stuff. She then asked me what was going to happen next probably because she saw the address for the gender team and wanted to hear what I had to say about it. I said that we planned for another session, she asked me when and I told her that it was somewhere in may. For a moment there was a horrible and long silence in the car, I hoped that that silence would have stayed there but a couple of minutes later my mom asked another question. ""So you feel different from the inside?"" she asked. Akwardly I answered ""Yes."" resulting in another moment of silence.

At this point my mom just became very against me for some reason (I wonder why) and she told me this ""I don't think that the problem you are struggling with is this, we know that you are struggling with something but we just don't think that it really is this"" She than asked me when I started having these doubts about my gender. I said that my doubts started pretty much when puberty started for me. She than told me that they (my mom and my father) won't send me to the gender team ""because they find the step from the JAC to the gender team too big"" Instead she proposed me to go to someone specialized in people with autism (since she thinks my 'real' problem is caused by my autism) Finally as the cherry on top she told me this: ""You don't become transgender at puberty, you are born being transgender"" basically telling me that because I had no doubts about my gender from birth I can't be transgender which (obvioulsly) is incorrect. 

Now I just don't know what to do. I really don't want to go to that person specialized in autism I really want to go to the gender team but I don't want my parents to not help me either. I know that I am transgender, the lady at the JAC also knows that otherwise she wouldn't have given me the brochure nor advise me to go to the gender team. Why doesn't my mom just want listen? Why does it have to go her way?

Sorry if this came over as a rant, I just can't control my feelings right now even though this happend two days ago I am still very angry about it."

Tuchopotila,asktransgender,"On Suicidal Thoughts, Psychiatric Commitment, and Coming Out","I know many of us here are afraid of coming out to our love ones because they will not understand how much not transitioning is torturing us, how much it is hurting us. 

I too was terrified of coming out and I did not know what to do. The Gender Dysphoria was agonizing and was causing me to have suicidal thoughts. I got myself screened and they deemed me a harm to myself and hospitalized me.

For many people this would be a terrifying experience but for me it was rather liberating. When asked ""why were you feeling suicidal?"" I answered honestly by saying ""I have Gender Dysphoria which causes me to want to kill myself"". Later on when my parents learned of my hospitalizing they was concerned and asked the doctors why I was suicidal, and they told my parents that it was because of Gender Dysphoria.

I think getting hospitalized for the suicidal thoughts was in many ways great because it showed how serious and painful being trans was, that it was not a joke, and that if it was not treated I most likely will kill myself. With this as the background, it made transitioning appear to be the viable and healthy choice.

If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts I suggest you please get help. It may turn out like my situation and be the best decision you ever made!

requiem1994,asktransgender,so unsure!,"I'm 21. Forgive me if this is a bit all over the map, I don't quite have the words. I have always felt disconnected from my body, that there was something deeply wrong with my form and my person. I would fantasize about being someone else entirely. I had a phase once where I was wearing makeup, nail polish, dressing more feminine, but I had so many outside voices telling me I was doing it for the shock factor. Recently, I've begun to experience these feelings again. 

I was sober for a year and six months before drinking again. And that's when these feelings began to resurface again. Shortly before drinking, I found all my makeup from back home and brought it back with me from college. There's always been something missing from my life. I thought muscles would fix it. I thought a dog would fix it. Or a relationship. That something would help me to see what others see in me, a beautiful person.

I am my harshest critic. No one judges me the way I judge me. But when I look in the mirror and see a woman, picture a vagina and breasts, and see a feminine, clean-shaven face with a shaved body. I feel so happy. But I'm also so afraid. I am 21. How can I be realizing this so late? I loved wearing my moms shoes as a little 'boy', loved hanging with the girls, wanted to be part of their crowd. Just always thought i was a gay man, but that label never felt right. Could this really just be another phase? I feel that indirect dysphoria. A complete separation from my body. I always feel like I'm going through the motions. Like I'm never really here. But when I have my nails painted, shaved legs, and see a woman in the mirror, I feel like I'm seeing me. Again, this is all so new. Please excuse the scatterbrain.

I feel so disgusted by masculinity and the body I have. I want it to be gone. I want a smaller forehead. A softer jawline. I want to get pregnant! I have always envied that in women. The ability to carry a baby.

The entire time I write this post there's a voice in my head of doubt saying ""You're wrong. This won't change anything.""  But I just knew I had to get this out there. It's too much being alone with this. I have friends I can talk to, and have talked to. But this being so new, I figured this was the safest place to unload.

Look forward to response and hearing what your experiences were like. Hoping to get some clarity.

imlostinmyhead,asktransgender,Why did I never know anything until I started learning about being transgender?,"So, this is probably confirmation bias. I have an issue requiring that Law and Order is on my TV pretty much all the time. I have been noticing so many things that are just like ""why did I never question what this was before?""

I've heard HRT on the show (in a post-menopausal woman, not transgender), the DSM-4 got mentioned (old episode. I literally had to look up why it wasn't DSM-5), and just certain things that I'm seeing in reruns I'm just going ""oh that makes sense now""

On top of that, I started learning about how to shave properly... how to take care of my skin... how to take care of my hair... 

I'm wondering if it's coincidental, or if it's actually connected to dysphoria is some way."
myaltaccount86,asktransgender,Inversion vs non-inversion?,"I've seen a couple people here specifically say that they want non-inversion GRS. I've seen videos/read about inversion, but I know nothing about non-inversion.

The thought of GRS is a long way off for me, but it's something I could start educating myself on now. Can you provide me with more information about non-inversion GRS? Also, why do you prefer one method over the other?"
SigurthrEnterprises,asktransgender,A question for those who use digital avatars to help alleviate dysphoria.,"I apologize if this isn't the right place or format. I was going to put the question directly in the title but I couldn't phrase it short enough.


Do you actively embrace your identified gender through your chosen avatar when interacting with others? If so, do you find it helps more with the dysphoria than just internally placing yourself in your avatar's shoes?


I'm totally closeted everywhere but this sub, with no plans to really out anywhere else any time soon as it isn't safe to do so. But I was thinking I might get better results regarding dealing with the dysphoria if I were to ""roleplay"" in my identified gender. I don't like the term roleplay here in this context because presenting as your identified gender isn't play (though I'm sure it must be exhilarating) and it isn't a chosen role, it's being myself/yourself. However, I use the term in a non-gender-related way to refer to one being ""in character"", it is often common while playing a RPG in a larger community (it would be a bit hard in a solo game). 
  
I've never RP'ed and thinking about doing so brings up a similar feeling of anxiety and hopefulness that thoughts of presenting as a woman does, albeit less severely because of the vicarious / physically removed nature of doing it from the comfort of my keyboard. So far I've just been wistfully admiring my avatar and enjoying the game, just with the added internalization of ""I wish I looked like this and am as free as she is"" thrown in good measure every so often. An added bonus; my guild does seem to be LGBT friendly as we have several openly gay members on teamspeak (voip) and in text chat. Again, I'm not out to them, but I like to think that someday I might be.  

For those curious, here's a few screenshots. I know, totally unrealistic standards of beauty, haha, but a girl can wish, right?

Mr_Snuffles7,asktransgender,"Girl from school found me on dating app, I'm scared she's going to out me.","I'm FTM and 18, I'm in my last year of high school and I'm waiting until after I graduate to come out to everyone. I'm out to some people but not others, so I'm kind of living a double life right now lol. I'm on a few dating apps, and so far I've been lucky enough to meet some cool people and avoid people I know. Until recently.

The one person at my school that I dislike showed up on the app Hot or Not, and I immediately blocked her. I thought I was in the clear until I got a notification telling me I had a message from her. She said ""*****?!"" The asterisks being my birthname. I freaked out and deleted my profile and the app. 

I'm so scared she's going to out me to my school. It said on my profile that I'm trans so she has to know. She doesn't like me and she knows I don't like her. I don't know what to do and I'm so scared for school on Monday. How do I handle this situation?"

HyperFreya,asktransgender,Having a crush on my male childhood friend!?,"So I'm having a problem. I think I have developed a crush on my male childhood friend. We've been friends since I was around seven years old and I've just recently figured this out and now I don't know what to do.

I haven't come out to him yet and I believe he's straight but flexible so to speak. I'm not very feminine at the moment with my short hair and stuff, but I'm working on it. So I don't know what I should tell him. Would it be ""hey I'm trans"" and go from there or just tell him that I might have developed feelings for him?

I mean, he's always really nice to me, but that is more likely because we're really good long time friends I think and I am worried that if I tell him anything it will ruin a great friendship. But on the other hand we've been able to talk about anything up until now, so maybe this will work out.

We're going to spend a weekend together at a gaming convention with another friend next month. I'm excited, but also nervous, which is a new feeling when hanging out with said friend."
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuug,asktransgender,Should I start HRT?,"I'm 24 mtf, I already have my diagnosis and pretty much everything needed to start HRT in my country. I wasn't informed about how deeply the side effects can go (especially without orchidectomy which I'm pretty much never going to afford) earlier and how little does the therapy do to what I'd actually want to change and how long does it take for highly noticeable changes to occur, though. Right now my body is completely androgynous and I am able to accept myself when I really try (I'm passable). The question is: is anybody able to predict how more masculine would I get without HRT around the age of 30 and later? How normal is it for an 'adult male' to become more manly in his late 20s? What about a specific diet, how much does it affect? Is taking stuff such as pueraria safe, or would I be subject to a high risk of testicular cancer like on normal HRT? I live in a somewhat conservative country and access to transgender-experienced endocrinologists and such is very limited and expensive, but if I'd know I'd suddenly became a manly man unable to pass anymore at some point, I'd probably decide to go on HRT anyway.

thrangal,asktransgender,Hormones don't define the gender. You will never be the gender you want to be. Is this true?,"I had someone tell me that taking hormones does NOT change your gender. I told them that they were wrong and hormones ARE the defining mechanism for gender. Estrogen in time turns you into a female. Testosterone, a male. 

They said it may make you feel like one or the other, but you will ALWAYS be the body you were born with. A man that uses estrogen still doesn't have a uterus, doesn't have a monthly period as example and so cannot be a woman. 


    

Do hormones define Gender? I'd really like to know if I was right or wrong here. 

**Edit:**  I have learned a lot here. Thanks for the thoughts. To paraphrase back my new understanding. chromosomes define the sex at birth. Hormones help to shape the sex of the person (and sex hormones can fundamentally enter every cell to influence it), Gender is the minds view of whether you are male, female. That sum it up?  And I'd like to apologize for my lack of understanding, I'm figuring stuff out all the time. Good discussion, thank you all

CheshireHats,asktransgender,"Am I ""not really trans?""","I'm not sure exactly how this site works, because I've been on Reddit for about 10 minutes. I hope this gets submitted cause I don't really know where to turn or who to ask. If it's not permissible for me to post here, I understand completely. 

So, where do I start? I'm 31, and I've been passionately fascinated by my feminine side since childhood. I've always known I was born male, and for the most part (when I had to) I've always ""been"" male. I played sports, lifted weights, chugged beers, got into fights, etc. 

But any time I had a choice, I was a woman. Tabletop RPG's like Dungeons and Dragons or Vampire: the Masquerade? Every time. It wasn't some generic male fantasy of the perfect female either (ok, some of it was... But I do have boy parts. That's part of the territory.) they were beautiful, powerful yet frail, compassionate, feminine women. Video games? I'm always a woman when I have the choice. I found myself loving the female form and everything that came with it. Why weren't my clothes pretty? Why did my hair have to be short? Why couldn't I paint my nails or wear makeup? Make no mistake, I understood the societal answers to these questions, but I didn't accept them.

It happened to come to pass that during the end of my high school career, I became enthralled with two types of music: Techno &amp; Trance, and Punk Rock &amp; Ska. As such, the cultures of these types of music opened a door to expression that I couldn't show before that. I had beaded bracelets, rings, feminine clothes made for men, and glitter on my skin or in my hair. That's one of the reasons why I love electronica so much. The concept of PLUR is beautiful. As to my punk side, eyeliner made me look like an Egyptian God. I've got a darker complexion anyway, and when I first used eyeliner, jaws dropped. I had every female in my graduating class asking me how I did my makeup or complementing me on how good it looked.

After high school I continued on with my pseudo-feminization. I always had an excuse, but normally they were partially true. ""Chicks love guys with a feminine side."" ""These pants make me look hot."" ""No, that's not a girl's coat. It's a Scott Weiland coat."" I started wearing eyeshadow, tighter clothes, experimenting with guys. I just loved feeling pretty and feminine. Eventually, I hung it up. You can't rave with kids, and you can't wear makeup to a job interview. But ""she"" never checked out. ""She"" never left me. There was even a costume party after my first child was born where my ex dressed me up in a corset, pencil skirt, and did my makeup. I was fearless that night, cause it was a costume party. But I was also complete for a few hours. I was able to be ""her"" and it felt so amazing. 

Today, I'm a father and a husband. My wife knows and understands that this is part (I'll get to that) of who I am. She doesn't judge, and actually thinks I'm rather pretty when I dress. The rub is, I'll never be able to fully transition. I'm 6'2"", 220lbs and in shape. I have a very physical job that keeps my testosterone levels high, and it's not the type of money I'll ever be able to walk away from. If I were to persue a field that my degree covers, I'd take a hit of at least $60,000 a year. As a parent, I believe no matter who I am, what I want, or what I need, my children have to come first. I also made a vow to my wife, as a man, to be the man she married, to have and to hold forever. That vow is very important to me.

I love dressing in private, and I'm learning some makeup techniques. I have a few gorgeous wigs that I've researched how to make look as real as possible. I want to make myself passable when I dress, and I actually believe I have the bone structure and the body to do it (I'm surprisingly fit, but my lineage comes with man-boobs. I'm actually a 44C and I fill out those bras nicely.)

But I'm curious what or who I am. Am I just another guy wearing panties since I'm too afraid of losing me entire world to actually transition? ""She"" is a part of me. When I listen to music I can see ""her"" in my head, with long gorgeous hair and patting the left side of her chest, giving a seductive smile as she sings along ""I feel your heart beat to the beat of the drum. It's such a shame that you came here with someone..."" to Kesha's Die Young, but five minutes later, I'm belting out Pearl Jam or Dead Kennedys very much like a guy.

What am I? Is this just a cross dressing fetish? Is this only sexual? There is so much I've been handed in this life that I didn't ask for or want. I'm extremely intelligent and very adept at every job or hobby I've ever done. That doesn't matter to me. I honestly don't want it, because it's brought me more pain and isolation than it's brought me joy. The only two things I've ever wanted were to be a US Marine (a medical condition kept me out) and gorgeous &amp; feminine. The longing inside of me for those two things becomes downright unbearable at times, and my emptiness and yearning for something I could never, and can never have is almost too much.

Please help. :("
BubbleControl,asktransgender,Taking Blockers without Estrogen,"hey everyone,

I have recently decided to start transitioning. I'm incredibly excited and just as terrified, but I'm almost completely certain that its the right choice.  I'm running into some major problems, however, which are preventing me from actually starting. 

I live with my parents at the moment, and while I am trying my best to move out as soon as possible, I simply don't have the financial means to do so at the moment, and no one seems to want to hire me.

With that being said, I have a seriously strong desire to start HRT, and the fact that I can't yet is getting harder to deal with every day. I feel like Each day I don't start is another day where my body is being further affected by testosterone, and to be honest its really starting to hurt.
I'm far too afraid of my family noticing the changes that HRT brings to start taking estrogen, so I was curious if it was possible to obtain only androgen blockers for a while. I've read that in the long term it can negatively affect my bones, but would it do much damage if it was only for a few months? And would a doctor be willing to prescribe that sort of partial HRT? I would very much appreciate any information. Thanks!"

I *have* been approved for HRT and should be getting it in the next few weeks so long as my blood tests are fine, but no one wants to talk to me about potential changes in this issue. They'll discuss aggression and all that usual jazz but this issue is being swept under the rug - probably because it's easier.

ilikebeards00,asktransgender,How do I handle this restroom situation that occurs in my bar?,"I work in a high volume bar with only one boys and one girls restroom. The lines can get quite long (especially for the girls). However, last night the line for guys was particularly long while there was no line for women.

I shouted at him that he was using the wrong toilet (thinking he was just intoxicated, as these things happen often) when he shouted back at me that he was transgender. 

Obviously I couldn't tell and it was none of my business, but as an employee or business owner...if someone is clearly male or female how am I supposed to handle a situation like this?

PariahSilver,asktransgender,Anyone else taking that Trans Sexual Desire and Orientation survey that's going around?

Drosophila_melanogas,asktransgender,What are your thoughts on Julia Serano's book Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity,"I've found it to be the best book about transgender issues to date that I've had the pleasure of reading, especially wholeheartedly agree about how important it would be 

* for femininity to get empowered, which would greatly benefit cis women, trans people and effeminate cis men as well
* for all gender identities to be accepted (instead of there apparently having been fights between non-binary and binary trans people before because of binary trans people comfortably identifying within a gender binary)

Also really liked concepts such as oppositional sexism, how gendering is actually a conscious process and so on, and was also an excellent resource to find out about the sad history of how trans people were treated by the medical community.

Also made me overcome my long-time shame for being feminine, by it presenting femininity as something that in reality can actually be really fucking empowering and the people who choose to express it can feel really fucking cool, brave and badass.

I would definitely recommend that book to all trans people and feminists.

Rose_Hawk,asktransgender,Confused to the point of anxiety and need to get this fully off my chest [Warning: It's a really wordy one],"Well hello, thanks for reading this if you are. I am a 19-year-old who as the title states is just confused as all hell. I at the moment in time do not know if I am or I am not transgender. This will also be as stated in the title be a rather wordy one, ungodly sorry about it too, but is kind of needed. I also will avoid swearing feels as it politer this way and this all may be written in a weird jokey way which if it offends anyone I do sincerely apologize.

So I was born and raised a male in a very men are men community, an ex-mining town. This also came with the really f**king stupid teachings like ""Boys don't cry"" and ""Boys can't like dolls and girl’s toys"". Now for my entire life I have had shoulder length hair which in my younger years got me mistaken for a girl a lot. Back then I hated it and I think it was because of my upbringing but this is just an interlude to the main bulk of context.

When I was only 14 I began to suffer for severe depression, self-harm and the whole wonderful nine yards, which over time really ate me away. By the time I was 15 I had already thought ""Okay, I will probably kill myself prior to be 16"" which is horrible in retrospect. But a week before I turned 16 I began to get treatment however that ""dead by 16"" clock did in a way work. After being 16 I cannot see any future for myself meaning thinking of my 20th birthday it is black, a trip black, just nothingness. I spent the next 1-3 years coming back around from depression and now am moderately okay.

After depression however I was left with 2 really distinct sides to myself. One is a really immature, hyper and random side which is the kinda broken remains of me prior to depression. The other is a more mature and cynical side which really does hate the annoying side, this entire wall of text is the mature side. The other thing I figured out is that the immature side is male and the mature side isn’t.  

Now a year ago for reasons I cannot remember I began to wonder “Am I transgender?” and spend a few days thinking about my life up to this point and a few things were rather striking. Like as a kid stealing bras and wearing them and the most striking being that when I was depressed I did genuinely wish multiple times to wake up female. So I thought well this isn’t a thing I can just make a decision on over the course of a few days and I also had to life stuff to sort out so I left for around a month or two. After it was over my head instantly went back to the question and I decided to do some real research on it and it really was more in depth that I thought.

I have never been a masculine person and have always carried a more being more feminine air in general. I asked my close friends if they could ever remember a time I was masculine in all the years I’ve known them and they actually couldn’t think of any times. In recent months I have really stated to hate my junk as well because mother of god is it not just useless and a hindrance. I have said to my friends that if someone said they would cut it off and replace it with an alternate method of urinating it would be done in a heartbeat. Along with this I have just began to hate how manly my body looks and it doesn't help I'm 6'1. I recently have also been really envying women in terms of looks and such, not the reproductive system because my god you folks have to unfairly tough, which I didn’t do at all like a couple of years back. An example of this was that an interview I had for something the young women who interviewed me the inter I was just like “All of your clothes and hair I envy you for”. 

Back to the confusion part, sorry here folks, now do to a larger degree believe that my mature side is a female not a girly girl one but female to a greater degree. The only problem is I keep questioning myself if it is isn’t just a phase. This is due to whenever I had a problem prior to depression my parents told me it was just a phase and it would blow over soon. This also doesn’t help that I am ungodly anxious so if it think about it too much I feel like I am going to have a panic attack. And to add more petrol covered wood to the fire I feel my dad is rather anti-trans and me looking in anyway not male. For example, I have lots, me and my dad were at the hospital and he was filling out a form and it came up to a gender tick box. My dad turned to me, who is thinking “Am I transgender?” and has this sub-reddit and a .pdf of MTF HRT on his locked phone, and says “Transgender?” and laughs. It really stung, now I don’t know if it was meant in a bad way but it was how I took it.

Now since I have been wondering if I am transgender I have had a lot of weird good mental moments. One was a like 10 second dream where I opened my eyes looked down saw I had boobs and just nodded then woke up. The more eye opening one is that if I imagine myself after transitioning I can see a future that isn’t black and I look as happy as a cynical person can. 

So summary here:
I am born male who is around 80% sure I am female inside but am so nervous that I am going to make some sort of mistake and destroy relationships with family that I for example I have been stiff armed and shaking while writing all of this. I just don’t know what to do because it is pretty much a thought know from morning till night which is really getting to me.

Sorry for the literal 1000+ words, awful grammar and more than likely point of view changes. I just need to say all of this.
Thank you if made it to here, it means a lot.

SlowDrips,asktransgender,Feeling like a failed male,"I don't know how to stop feeling this way. Basically, every time I get close to transitioning I back out because I become angry with myself. Angry because I feel like I'm just going to end up feeling like a ""failed"" male. I already feel that way to an extent.  

I'm a pretty assertive person. I don't like or seek out conflict, but when it presents itself to me I can't help but take it up on its offer. If someone engages me in conflict, I can't back down from it. So the idea of transitioning to me makes me feel like I'm failing in that regard. That by transitioning, I'm forfeiting the ""game"" and I'm the loser.  

But I know how I feel. I know this is never going to go away. And I know what I want. So why do I let other people, essentially, govern my life decisions in this way? I'm so afraid of ""losing"" that it prevents me from doing what I want.  

Why do I let the concept of hegemonic masculinity dictate my life?"

I initially decided not to come out to that friend group because it wasn't likely I would have many interactions with them. At this point, they definitely get an email, but I'm not sure what to add past the basic name pronoun switch. 

I haven't interacted with them in ages so I have no sense of their education level here...

nonspecificname,asktransgender,Genital dysphoria without the rest?,"Hi /r/asktransgender! 

I'm a 26 year old AFAB, with a MTF partner. 

Ever since my late teens, I questioned my gender identity because of how I felt about my genitals. I have always loathed them. When my partner and I first got together at 18, I went through a period of dressing very masculine, I would wear a hat to cover my hair, and wear very baggy t-shirts to cover my breasts. I would occasionally do makeup to highlight the masculine parts of my face.This feeling of something being off continued for years, though I stopped trying to present masculine. I became obsessed with trans guys video journeys on YouTube but never told my partner because I was so embarrassed. 

The last time I tried to look masculine was about two years ago. I hated what I saw, was repulsed by my reflection, and haven't done so since. Fast forward to now, and I'd consider myself okay with my gender. I'm a woman, and I'm happy to be one. I've realised that wanting a penis doesn't make me a man, that I was trying to fit my feelings about my genitals into a neat label of ""trans man"", and that looking and acting masculine doesn't help the pain I feel about my genitals. 

Since my girlfriend started transitioning, it's allowed me the freedom to explore these old feelings. I got a pack and play packer, which I loved when I first starting wearing it. The excitement died away pretty quick, I felt like a fraud. It wasn't my penis, I had to strap it on, I couldn't feel the sensations when I stroked it. I remember masturbating while wearing it, and simulating jacking off with it. When I came, the sadness overwhelmed me and I cried for ten minutes. I just felt so hollow. 

What is this? How can I be happy being seen as a woman, looking like a woman and yet it always feels like a part of me is missing. I can feel where the bulk should be, I can feel the absence of weight on my crotch and it makes me so sad. If I was allowed phalloplasty, I would get it in a heartbeat. I remember feeling so jealous of non op trans girls because they're women with penises. 

Yet, I like looking pretty, I like my curves. My breasts are annoying but I don't hate them. I like being perceived as a woman. 

I don't understand these feelings, can anyone relate?"

NaomiOni,asktransgender,Extremy depressed because I cant pass. Any advice on dealing with not bring able to pass as a woman.,"Hi everyone. I was wondering if I could get some advice on coping with never being able to pass as a woman. I recently tried committing suicide and am currently stuck in a hospital for recovery so I can't talk much. Passing means so much to me and it hurts whenever I know that when I start hrt I won't be able to pass. I hate how I'll have to get laser hair removal and ffs even though I'm only 20 years old.

I told my doctor in the hospital and he said that I shouldn't try to transition because I'll never pass as a woman. He furthered stated to embrace being a man as its just better and easier. He further said that and I quote ""there's no point in being a woman if you're ugly. If you're an ugly woman you're essentially just a man anyway"". 

My dad is so angry with me right now he doesn't want to even be seen with me in public. When I woke up from the procedure they did to get rid of my toxins from overdosing he started yelling at me and they had to have him removed from the hospital as a result.

It hurts me so much that a medical professional would even say that. He couldn't even say ""well with surgery you'll pass someday"" it's just automatically assumed that I'm finished in the realm of passing. I feel so horrible about myself right now I haven't been able to stop crying and my eyes are dry from lack of hydration and crying so much. 

I can't take this anymore."

Sorry_for_the_mess,asktransgender,Anyone else wander into /r/gendercritical?,"I'm not here to bash anyone's opinions or stances on anything. I want to make that abundantly clear. But i wandered over there just to see what kind of views they have. Some of it hurt, but mostly they look to radical, and honestly, quite bizarre people Edit: as examples of what transgender is as a whole. It mainly concerned me because it was those examples that they used to De-legitimize my identity. If you ever go over there, like i did, dont be too off put, most of it seems uninformed people. I started off being offended (or threatened?), which wasnt quite right but i cant think of any other word right now, but it actually helped to reaffirm that even though there are still radical people out there who want to stop me, or do not support my freedom of the pursuit of happiness, that what i knwo in my heart is right. That i will still transition, and have a hell of a lot better chance to feel happiness (as oppossed to being simply 'ok') which i know will never happen if i dont transition. 

I guess my big point is, even though there are people out there who would want to cause you harm, who would rather see you opressed, dont lose hope. Be who you are and let people know its ok. Another thing i want to say, just because I get concerned for people, dont give them a real reason to hate you, or be mad at you. Yes there are people who will do this regardless, but dont play into what they want you too be in their eyes. "

koreycabra,asktransgender,"Moving to Start Transition: Job Advice, long-distance coming out to parents..ect","I'm pre-T, and I'm about to turn 25. I ignored my feelings for everyone else for so long that I had to do something. Doing something so dramatic out of desperation might not help me. I'm moving next month and hopefully once I get a job I can start going to a clinic.

What do I do about employment? Do I say something to HR once I'm hired, do I not bring anything up? They're going to notice once I get on T. I'm not sure what makes me the least dishonest. I'm in a position where I'm moving everything to my name to a location and cannot risk losing my job, but I can't compromise on transition..I need to start. I've started using my preferred name everywhere but on legal documents.

Second reason I am moving is so I have independence from my parent. My mom is very LGB friendly, but sometimes she makes transphobic statements without even realizing it ""oh I always thought she was one of those men in a womans body/one of those girls pretending to be a guy"" statements about someone or something. It's never anything vulgar about parts or way out there. I think it's mostly ignorance. But I am moving to try and distance myself incase she rejects me. My family will, they're all really conservative. I wrote a letter to send her, but I'm really torn on when and what I should send..I feel like scum if I start T without telling her. I feel like I'm lying every single day. I feel like withholding my transition is like a gun to my head...I can stay closeted and unhappy or I can tell her and lose my entire support system.

I think I'm transgender. I was never really concerned with my gender identity until about 5 years ago in elementary school. In fifth grade I began watching videos of mtf transitions and wondering if I had gender dysphoria. Eventually, after maybe a year of thinking, the internal struggle kind of faded away. I barely thought of it until a year ago or so. I sunk into a bit of a depression about half a year ago really trying to figure out who I was, and I've only recently realized that I'm probably trans. However, that's not the issue I'm asking about. 

I honestly don't feel like I can come out. I just...While, there are a few reasons. The first one (and the most stupid, I'd say), is that I have a serious crush on a girl. This girl is one of the reasons why I'm not still in that depression. However, she's straight. Fully. 100%. Which is why I've even ever had a chance with her. I feel like any chance of a romantic relationship would completely crumble if I told her. Another reason is my oldest brother. He recently turned 24, and he has a nice job. However, he's a very devout Christian, which isn't common in our family (We don't really associate with any religions). I really fear that if I ever came out as trans, he would basically disown me. I would be horribly hurt by that, as I love him very much. Another reason is of our financial situation. I really don't want to add any potential costs to what my parents have to deal with. Gender therapists and hormones cost money, and considering my second brother is in the middle of college, I don't feel right adding more costs to that. Another reason is my school. While we are quite a liberal school overall (Very little bullying or anything of that sort), I know quite a few of the type of people who would not hesitate to go after me, especially since I am in the Athletics at the school. Speaking of which, that is my final reason. I feel uncomfortable with the whole situation. How would I be moved? When? I'm in the soccer team, so there's be girls taking showers. Would they call me
Disgusting? Make me a loner?

I don't know. I feel as if I'm being too self-absorbed...Could you guys share any relevant opinions on this? Just to clarify, I am not in a depressed state currently. I generally feel content with life, and I never really show it if I'm sad or conflicted."

I also like to think about being called ""she"" and treated like a woman.

But, there's a lot of things that are making me feel like I shouldn't, and that it would be better to stay as a guy.

I don't hate being male, I really don't mind it at all.

I like my name and probably wouldn't change it.

I've only recently thought about it, compared to people who have for very large portions of their life.

I feel like I would rather be a girl (matter of choice) vs. boy, and I've heard that being trans isn't a choice. (I don't know much about LGBT community and that sort of thing, so I'm very sorry if I say something disrespectful!)

All together, I'm thinking about it more and more, but these things really make me feel like I'm de-legitimizing what trans people feel. I think I mostly just need some support if these are regular sorts of thoughts that questioning people feel, or if I'm really just a confused cis guy with an elaborate fantasy.

The ""typical trans story"" is of someone who knew they were different from their assigned gender from a very young age, so I am somewhat worried."
samuraiche,asktransgender,My manager banned me from using the bathroom,"I'm still in shock over what happened. I thought it was just a really bad joke when he first told me. ""Two older women complained. I can't have you using the bathroom anymore. It felt so unreal because it's never happened to me before.

I'm intersex bodied and have been partially aware of such since I was 13. I'm trans because while my parents raised me as a boy, I later decided to socially present as a woman and personally identify as non binary after I struggled with how people perceived me and treated me as an intersex person when I did present as a guy.

I live in North Carolina and the system here doesn't know how to treat me. My birth certificate says I'm male but my background papers and ID says female. When my manager did my background check, he made assumptions that I had surgery to change my appearance and told as much to half the staff at the restaurant I now work at, to the point where people have asked me whether I'm male or female and what my name was before ""I got all my surgeries done"".

If that wasn't bad enough, apparently recently a customer complained about me being in the bathroom. This has never happened to me since I socially transitioned since I've always been cis/dyadic passing while presenting as a woman and I struggle to present as a man. 

I identify as non-binary, though. I like to present androgynously and I'm not very comfortable being very femme or masc. I thought this was fine, but presenting androgynous will make people scrutinize you more, and this is a real problem if you aren't cis/dyadic bodied. I know that a lot of butch/andro presenting cis-women have been sacked over this too.

 If I weren't intersex and trans I wouldn't care, because then I won't get caught on the ""well your body isn't normal"" clause. I'm not allowed to use the bathroom until my manager talks to his lawyer. I can't use the men's bathroom because I can't pass as a man, even with no hair and layers of clothes to hide my body. All I wanted is to be treated as any other human being but instead I'm just going to drink myself to death.

XXYme,asktransgender,Any trans XXY folks out there?,"So.. I'm a recently out MtF.  Been trying to do some research and starting the medical process next week with a counselor.  

The information out there in regards to Klinefelter's is pretty minimal and most of it is copy/pasted from other sites like the NIH or something like that.  (USA here)

Is anyone willing to share their experiences and symptoms?  I've read that it's pretty diverse and can even go so far as to be completely asymptomatic, but I've always had certain traits that are associated with XXY (gynecomastia, adhd, depression, social withdrawal/issues, tallest in my family by roughly 3 inches, wider hips, long legs, loose and weak muscles even though I've worked out considerably in my lifetime and excess fat around the belly that seemingly never goes away no matter what. I even seemingly have fairly pronounced labia in the whole downstairs mixup).

I could go on forever, but I digress...

If there's anyone out there, when did you get tested?  Any experiences you'd like to share?  

Obviously I need to go get tested for it first thing, but education is important too, at least to see if it's even something I should concern myself with.

ahugeminecrafter,asktransgender,Questions after my HRT appointment,"Hello everyone. I just got my first prescription of hormones (MtF) and took my first dose an hour ago :D and I just have a couple questions that I asked my doctor and was surprised by the answers. I trust her but I am just curious if her answers are backed by everyone's experience:

1. I want SRS someday. My understanding is that masturbating/not masturbating has a significant effect on the atrophy of the penis and testicles. I currently want to have surgery with Bowers or someone else by inversion. Is the amount of atrophy going to have a significant effect on my SRS outcome? My doctor said more atophy is actually a good thing which surprised me.

2. I thought I remembered reading that in addition to having different fat distribution males and females also have different muscle distribution. So that muscle naturally develops in different places, meaning the difference is not just size of muscles. I thought I remembered reading about transgender women actively reducing their muscle mass in the hopes of rebuilding it a feminine shape. Is there any validity to this idea? My doctor said no and that the only real difference is natural muscle size, which will be reduced for me with no real effort required on my part.

3. A big concern to me was that my sexuality could change on hormones. Right now I picture myself marrying a man, and for that reason I decided not to bank sperm because I am uncomfortable with using a surrogate mother. If I ended up marrying a woman though, I am afraid I might regret not banking sperm. I hate to spend $500 and another $200 a year just for that unlikely scenario though. My doctor said it is unlikely I will all of a sudden switch to desiring women on hormones.

My goal is not to undermine my doctor's advice. I trust her, I just found it surprising because a lot of what she said seemed different from what I had read on this sub. If anyone could share their experiences or knowledge it would be most appreciated.

Thanks everyone :D"
haventa,asktransgender,My father is fantastic.,"Sorry, just had to tell someone about this.

Now, I'm (sort of) out to my mother and no one else. I decided to try to gauge how my father thinks of transgender people, so I brought up something about people calling transgender people 'it' in YouTube comments and stuff along that line.

Keep in mind, this man is a manly, beer-drinking tradesman. He looked disappointed almost, and said this: 'I think your body is just a receptacle. It just holds yourself in it. If someone thinks that they are a woman, *they are a woman*. Their body doesn't affect that.'

He talked some more about how terrible it is that people aren't treated as equals and that ignorance is to blame. I never doubted that he wouldn't mind transgender people, but the fact that he was so understanding and passionate of it was surprising. I'm almost giddy at the moment."

AppleBrownies,asktransgender,Changing my hormone regimen and self-injecting :s,"So after a year and a half on HRT (I think, not really sure on when I started hormones), I finally went to an endo (I know, I know, silly me) and surprisingly my hormone levels weren't that bad, but my endo changed the regimen of the one I was already taking, wich consisted on spiro 100mg and estradiol valerate 4mg per day.

Although spiro will continue to be the same, estadiol valerate was replaced by an injection of algestone acetophenide 150mg/mL and estradiol enanthate 10mg/mL every two weeks.

Now, in your opinion, my beloved and beautiful people of this subreddit:

1.- What do you think about this change? I have never heard of anyone using this kind of injection to transition, and my endo says she always prescribe this and results are great.

2.- For the people who self-inject, how did you overcome the anxiety of sticking a piece of sharp metal on your own body? I know you can pay to a doctor to fo it, but in my opinion it looks like a wate of time and money if I can do it by myself.

The only cool thing is the massive amount of money I'll save from the estradiol valerate, as the injection only costs the equivalent of 3 dollars in comparison to the valerate pills wich costs 30 dollars, thank you all in advance. :)"

Don't let anybody hold you back. Just be yourself, and be proud!

shonkshonk,asktransgender,Permanently smaller boobs,"Hey all, 

I'd love to get your opinions on this. I (trans woman) lost weight before HRT (down to about 75kg) in anticipation of putting some back on as female fat to grow my boobs. Starting putting weight back on (a bit too fast) and six months in was at about 90kg. Then I get my blood levels checked and find out I've actually had male levels for the last four months of that. Now I'm on two patches a week but I need to lose male fat again.

In your opinion will losing fat at this stage permanently affect my (long term) breast result? I saw a comment to that effect a week or so ago on this sub. If it matters the only way I can lose weight is hardcore keto, losing about 15kg of fat over the next four months. I don't want to do that if it might ha e a long term effects though.

I sleep great, so that's always good. My dreams are earth-shattering. My energy is pretty consistent, and I think that helps with my focus. My physical appearance, I think, may have improved since taking Prometrium, however it is hard to gauge whether it's the Prometrium or the estradiol I am currently taking. Probably a bit of both. All I know is my skin feels soft. Like sponge cake. Sounds kind of gross but it's actually pretty spot on.

All good things aside, something that I strongly loathe about it is the mood that I have. I feel irritable. I notice that and I feel horrible later, if I act on that with someone. But I do it again and again, so obviously I didn't feel too terribly bad...

I also feel flat, emotionally. Since being on estradiol, I became very reactive, visibly. Starting Prometrium, I feel distant. Depressed, maybe. I don't really know... maybe the cons are too much for me to stick with this for the long haul.

I have reservations about quitting of course, losing some of the good parts of Prometrium including a nice libido. Feels very 'masculine', though, and I'll admit I haven't been on a stable dose of estradiol, my doctor kept moving it around. I am going to injections in a couple weeks, maybe I don't have enough in me to make Prometrium less paining on my emotions? I've heard some speculations online about that, so I'm wondering 

Maybe when everything evens out I will feel fine, but I don't know if I should stick with Prometrium as of now.

tthrowaway670,asktransgender,Advice/proofread my coming out letter,"I was hoping someone could proofread my letter and possibly give me advice if I have something I should add or leave out. The letter is to people that I still consider friends, but haven't seen/talked to for quite a while that I'm sending through facebook messages pretty soon tonight probably..
____________________________________________

I’m sending this letter to my friends because I want you to know something about me, and it’s important to me that you hear it from me, and not through gossip.  I am transgender. I know this is going to come as a huge surprise to most (if not everyone) since I was really good at hiding this from people around me.  I assume you are somewhat familiar to what this means (especially with how it’s in the spotlight in the news right now), but I wanted to use this opportunity to explain a few things and how it pertains to me.

I have known something was different since I was about 10-11. At first, I thought all boys felt this way but weren’t supposed to admit it. Not long after, I found out that there is a word for the way I was feeling. I felt ashamed that I had these feelings, and continued hiding this.  I became very good at keeping this a secret, mainly because I feared (and still do) being rejected by my friends and family.  Over the years, I forced myself to do as many “masculine” things as a way to keep my secret and hoped that maybe these feelings would go away.  The whole time though, it was something that was always on my mind and it’s been obvious to me for quite some time that it’s not going away, so I made the decision to transition.

What exactly do I mean by “transition”?  The first thing that I did was start seeing a therapist that specializes in transgender issues.  After almost a year, she finally OK’d me to start hormone replacement therapy. I have been on these medications since September, which are essentially causing my body to go through a second puberty, only a female one.  Socially, I present female basically all the time now, with the exception of work.  I am currently in the process of legally changing my name as well.

I realize that it’s going to take time for you to adjust to this, it took me many years to find my own self-acceptance, so I don’t expect you to completely adjust overnight. All I’m asking is that you try to accept me for who I am. If you cannot accept me, I want you to know that that would be on you. Having your support and friendship would mean a lot to me, and I think you’ll see that I am just living a more authentic version of myself.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask! I will probably make a public facebook post in a month or so to let some extended family and other people know. I encourage you to educate yourself on this topic. www.transwhat.org is a good place to start for the basics, and I hope you’ll read through it no matter how you feel initially.

I may just be worrying a whole lot more than I need to (as I am prone to do), but I really am worried that my relationship with her will be strained if my sexuality is effected once I'm on hormones.  I love this girl with all my heart and it would destroy me if anything happened within me that changed the way I felt about her."

I made a huge progress in my transition once again. I struggled with my voice for a very long time. The primary reason being my extreme anxiety.

But When I was with my friend, I've gained confidence. A lot of confidence. I tightened my throat and started speaking. I tried to sound like how I learned and how I'd like myself to sound like.

And no one gave me an eye on me! Totally natural! I was so happy. I just felt like all the weights on my shoulders have been lifted.

Unfortunately, I don't think of my voice as a finished product. It honestly sounded bad lol. But then again, it's been less than a week practicing and I feel like this will only get better from here.

The problem is, there are virtually no gender identity therapists in my area and those who do list gender issues as a focus have it on a list alongside twenty other issues, with their primary focus usually being drug and gambling addiction.

I've read that some therapists may consider a telemedicine approach, using a camera to provide remote therapy. While it isn't ideal, I'm considering trying to find a therapist with more experience working with trans patients under the assumption that a better therapist on a computer screen would help more than a worse therapist in person. I understand that this could have implications for insurance coverage, but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.

whitegold42,asktransgender,Need resources on estrogen levels,"Hi everyone.

A few days ago I posted about frustrations with a lack of breast development, and I mentioned my estrogen levels. Most people were shocked that they were so low. Well, I just got my most recent lab back, and they have dropped down to **52 pg/mL**. My doctor's only comment was, ""They look fine,"" although we are meeting for a longer talk next week. Needless to say, I'm pretty concerned, especially because the lab itself places the upper limit on estradiol for men as 39 pg/mL.

I am absolutely going to talk to my doctor about my concerns, and probably seek a second opinion if she refuses to increase my dose. That being said, I think the discussion will go much better if I can cite actual sources about what my estrogen levels should be. As is, I have only been able to find two numbers, and they happen to be the two cited on Wikipedia:

&lt;200 pg/ml (this doesn't help me) and
80-140 pg/ml.

I keep finding the &lt;200 number everywhere online, but again, under that criteria I'm fine and therefore have no ground with my doctor. As for the 80-140 number, I've found that once outside of Wikipedia, although quick conversion places it closer to 80-110 (still helps me). Does anyone know of reliable resources that give a range of estradiol for MtF people? I definitely need an actual range, not just this &lt;200 nonsense. Anything you could point me to would be helpful, although I don't think I'll get very far with some WebMD results.

Edit: Should probably share other relevant information. I'm on 100mg/day of Sprio and 2mg/day of estradiol. My testosterone levels were at 16 ng/dL."

My brother seemed to be under the impression that top surgery isn't necessary, that testosterone would make the breasts go away completely. I told him that whoever told him that was wrong, and he seemed to think I was accusing ""the government"" of lying.

My step-mom noticed that my overall mood changed (like, long term) when I started to go through puberty. But she blamed it on Prednisone. That I took for less than a month, around the same time.  That because my period didn't start immediately before/after that, that it couldn't have been puberty. She thought I was angry that the medication made me fat, even though I lost all the weight I gained (and more) pretty soon after that.

The other side is telling me that I'm okay, that my feelings aren't playing tricks on me and that I'm not going to regret it.

I really feel as if I want to be female, but can I be sure with a sea of evidence both against and for me, with FtM's and MtF's for it and against.

I do not know what the outcome will be, if I'll really be proud and satisfied over my appearance.

I need an answer, should I trust the side with evidence that I'm just unstable and I need a cure, that I should just go on with my life, or the side with differing evidence that I'll be happy if I do it, that it's the correct thing to do.

I do not want to regret my decision, what should I do form this point? Thanks :)

So I forwarded the guy over to my sales contact, but while waiting, I was discussing the issue with said contact. I couldn't help but shake the feeling that I'd heard of the place before, specifically that I'd heard good things. 

So my contact starts doing some googling on the place, to see if they're a good business, good reviews, etc. and then I notice, in the body text ""primary healthcare center dedicated to meeting the needs of the LGBT communities"" and then about 3 links talking about how good they were for HRT treatment.

NicholasA_ftm,asktransgender,Questioning FTM- thoughts/help/advice please!,"Hi everyone! So this is my first post ever- Id appreciate your insight on the following....

I am 26 and questioning if I am trans (FTM). I currently identify as a lesbian who dresses,acts, and prefers to be more masculine. I have a few acquaintances who are FTM but no close friends as of now. I feel unsure as to how I identify. I was always a tomboy growing up- wearing boys clothing, playing sports, acting like ""one of the boys"". I started dressing more feminine in fifth grade when I felt pressure to conform.Through the years I would feel confident and even sexy as a woman but as Ive gotten older I felt less of this. I feel much more comfortable dressed and trying to pass as a guy. However, I am quite curvy so more often than not, people will still refer to me as ma'am etc. Which isn't terrible but I like it more when people ""confuse"" me and call me sir.

I dont identify with my chest or my curvy hips etc and wear tight sports bras and clothing that I feel hangs better and doesn't ""show off"" my curves as much. 

I don't feel depressed or sad or even mad that i wasn't born a boy... Idk if other trans identifying individuals experience that or not.... but I do think Id feel better and more at peace as a guy.

Id appreciate any and all feedback/thoughts on what I've written. Also, I apologize in advance if I used any terminology or wording that came off incorrectly or rude. I promise it wasn't intentional. I have been questioning my gender for about 9 months now but am not totally familiar with whats appropriate and whats not in the community. thanks!"
Eventually-Alexis,asktransgender,I hate my life. Everything is so unfair.,"I feel like I do absolutely nothing but posting here at this point. And this is going to end up as a rant.

At this point I feel like everything in my life is simply obstacles without any rewards and I get left with an immense amount of disappointment and anger that I have no outlet for. 

A few months ago I finally accepted that I was trans but even long before that my life has been filled with let downs and disappointment. I come from a family that isn't fantastic financially strong and never really minded not getting what my peers had since I didn't feel a connection with them anyway. Later on this started to become a problem when I couldn't get the games that the few friends I actually had could and I hated it. I felt left out and alone once again since the few connections I had to my friends started to fade because they were moving on to other more exciting things. 

And only to make matters worse I started to get a depression. I would slowly start to fade away only staying in my room refusing to go to school and not talking to anyone. We had startet to ask my school for help so that we could get financial aid so that I could see a therapist but they refused to help and instead tried to force me back in school by trying to take away my parents child support and since my parents didn't have much of a choice they sent me to school. Your mind can only take so much pressure before blowing up and it did. 

One morning when they tried to force me to school I lost it. I yelled uncontrollable and started throwing the chairs around breaking a few of them in the process while screaming that there were no reason to live and that I might as well kill myself. To this date I still can't remember any of this. Understandably my parents and my younger sister got really fightend so they decided to take me to a mental emergency room that started treating me. They allowed me to go home since they didn't actually belive that I were in the danger zone of hurting myself or others but started me up with a government funded therapist.

Things were starting to get back to normal and my mood were slowly getting better and I got the diagnosis aspergers. Then in a  process lasting 2 years where I couldn't go to school I finally got into a special school for autistic teens but once again had all my dreams shattered when I were told that any form of career or service in the military had become a no go since they wouldn't accept anyone with a diagnosis in the autism spectrum and down in the drain went the career that I had planned for my entire life and gone were my biggest childhood dream.

As of right now I still don't know what I want to do with my life and after FINALLY having accepted the fact that I'm trans I can look at 6-12 months of emotional hell before any developments happen there and I can't take being told that I have to do something for my happiness another time. I have tried and every fucking time I get shot down AGAIN. Is it a freaking wonder that I'm giving up? And the worst part is that I don't want to live like this anymore but I know for a fact that I don't have the balls to take the easy way out. But I'm just so tired of trying. So damm tired."

 (I deleted a lot more but basically my parents have always been good to me, but I've always been inexplicably terrified of them, so I don't present in front of them, which is why they think I'm either still questioning or even insincere)

Anyway, I used the week alone to my advantage, and outside the house things are getting better steadily. At work, it's become one step shy of an open secret.

I met my therapist this morning and I told her I was DIYing. I guess I kinda spooked her because now she referred me back to my pediatrician to try and get a blood test, but my parents don't know anything about my hormones (MTF) and they think it's just for a physical for other reasons. But I guess my main question is how can I get my pediatrician on board without her wrecking havoc throughout my family? I want help to make sure what I'm doing is safe but I don't think I can take the risk of my parents finding out, considering they freaked when they thought I bought something that's usually meant for girls. Maybe there's some law that keeps this sort of stuff confidential? I don't really know how to go about this... (I'm 16 and live in New York, United States.)

EDIT: Okay so I went in there and I told her what I was taking and why, and then she was like flabbergasted but ended up telling me that she can't tell my parents and that she's referring me to an endocrinologist and said that she can't disclose that either, so things went really well! :3"

merwitch97,asktransgender,Doing 'Drag' for dysphoria/confusion/clinical depression,"OK so I'm currently trawling through amazon and eBay looking for makeup/wigs/bras and panties as I write this. Over the last few months I've been going through a really dark time with anxiety and depression, mostly facilitated by me understanding that I had gender dysphoria and taking steps to come out about it, but struggling with internet addiction/procrastination/extremely low self-esteem (caused by other issues like bullying/toxic relationships in the past/family stuff both related and unrelated to gender dysphoria) and spiralled into dehabilitating clinical depression and one suicidal hospital visit which I'm only just getting myself out of (it really really sucks, help and support from other trans people who've gone through this would be helpful since UK mental health services aren't helping atm).

Anyway after a blessed few days on holiday without internet access (does anyone else here struggle with wasting hours distracting themselves on the internet? I think its a product of low self-esteem and wanting to escape reality) I decided: these gender identity issues aren't going to go away, but I felt so confused about the whole thing because I was so depressed and had such low self-esteem that just doing anything felt hard, least of all learning how to do make-up and hair and get new clothing, change my name etc. etc.

Another part of the confusion is I've always had a strong attachment to my identity as a gay boy and gay culture. It saddens me that there's this rift with the gay and trans world nowadays because in the vogue balls and drag pageant scene they're still very much linked. I was still dating gay men despite going through all this inner turmoil, and then the new season of RuPaul's Drag Race came out and it was like 'maybe I could just be a drag queen- but I've already told my GP about my gender identity issues and wtf I'm so confused about everything ugh'. 

So I've kind of decided that it's OK to not be 100% sure, since it is kind of a big fucking deal. And that maybe I could start going to my local gay club in drag (I was a witch last Halloween and my friend did my make-up so there's gonna be a learning curve girl) and use that as a stepping stone to maybe start wearing these clothes and make-up more often. I do see trans girls at the clubs sometimes as well and I've already decided on what my 'drag' style will be- typical showgirl Carmen Carrera violet chachki-esque pin-up body trans drag (if I can pull it off without looking a busted manly mess lmao)

It's really hard because I have the kind of depression that makes me just want to stay in bed and eat and watch tv all day and not do anything and it really fucking sucks- but if I can just get myself to this place where I can put on some make-up (tips on cheap brands and basic skills would be much appreciated), get a decent wig, some nails, some fake titties and a cute dress then maybe just maybe I can turn it in the club, look sickening and have some self-esteem and confidence for the first time yes gawd! 

I'm hoping that doing this will help me to decide whether transitioning is for me or whether I'm fine being part-time. The main thing that gave me this huge bout of depression and dysphoria is my height- 6'4 hunty! Not cute for a girl but fierce for a drag queen, hoping I will be able to get past that and move to a better mental place with that as well. I think I probably will transition at some point but I just need something to make me feel less like the world is a pile of shit and I want to die PLUS I have an excuse for hair and make-up and pretty dresses. Kind of just writing this as a therapeutic way to get this off my chest plus if anyone has any suggestions for CHEAP wigs/clothes/make-up etc. that would be much appreciated.

Thanks xoxo

I want her to be able to come to terms with this, because it's eating away at her right now and doing the exact opposite for me. I want her to be *content* with the fact that I'm transitioning, and that this is the best thing for me. I don't want it to be just tolerating. 

She was very concerned about poor responses from friends/family (to which I probably rolled my eyes, knowing me). I tried to explain to her that I simply wasn't worried about them, and that anyone's well being was more important than a few opinions. 

I'm not necessarily worried about my mother distancing herself from me (I would be devastated if that were to happen though). I'm worried that my mother is grieving over some novelty of having a son that she never really had to begin with. How can I help her with this? Also sorry if this was a bit poorly written/disorganized, I've just been a worried mess this past week."
SuperWorker,asktransgender,When referring to transgender youth in legal documentation what can I do to be most respectful?,"I routinely write legal reports that become part of the court record for youth, and several of the youth I work with identify as a different gender than that ascribed to them at birth. In my narratives, I include sections that focus on attributes the youth have. An example might be: x is an intelligent and articulate young lady who is facinated by chemistry and never lacks for a joke when among friends. 
Given that one of my youth is unavailable for comment, I am asking for ettiquite assistance: should I refer to a female identified youth as a young lady as I would typically do for a female identified cisgender youth, or simply avoid gender specific language? I ask because absent a youth's input, and especially with a youth who has experienced a huge amount of prejudice already, I want to be respectful as I find that respect is the fundamental base of a helping relationship.

Thank you for your time!

1989hamburgers,asktransgender,A few questions about a potentially transgender individual I am working on a project with,"Hi all. Sorry if there is some insensitively phrased things in my post. I go to college in a state (USA) where unfortunately people of the LGBT community are oppressed and I have never personally met anyone in the community.

So I am studying electrical engineering and for my senior project I was paired with an individual and his girlfriend. It was a completely random pairing. I'll henceforth refer to this individual as Phil. So Phil is actually quite a nice guy, and I am very pleased to work with him. He is a little shy though. His girlfriend, who I will refer to as Bertha, is also very nice. When we first met Phil introduced himself and told me he identifies as female, and that his personal pronouns are he and him. Bertha introduced herself and said she is cis-female and her personal pronouns are she/her. I was a little startled at first since I didn't know much about personal pronouns so I just introduced myself, said my major (since some people in the class are computer engineers and mechanical engineers), and didn't say anything about pronouns.

Now I have no problem with either of them, but I am curious to know if they are transsexual or not. Again, I have never met someone in the community so I am naturally very interested to know more. Phil is quite the big, muscular individual. Everything about his complexion looks like what I would have up until that day identified as male. Bertha is quite skinny and again, looks like most of the girls I have seen on campus I guess. But what is interesting is that even though Phil looks like a powerlifter, has a very deep voice, and the way he dresses just looks like everyone else, he says he identifies as a female. So does this mean he is transsexual, or is this something else?

Again, sorry for any insensitive phrasing!! Please tell me if I made any mistakes wording this."
Fairlady31,asktransgender,VFS: Yeson and Haben differences?,"Hey, i'm looking to go for VFS around January 2017. I'm getting a settlement, and with some saving I could afford Yeson in Korea or Haben in Rochester. Living in Canada though, I could save flight money by going to Seattle and flying domestic to see Haben from there. Also accommodations in NY i'd assume are cheaper then in Korea. But what I'm most worried about is the surgery result. Are Haben and Yeson's results comparable? Would it be ""risking it"" to go to Haben instead? I understand the procedure is performed slightly differently but Haben has a good satisfaction rate as well, correct?  Has anybody lost their voice from Haben, and are their client satisfaction rates similar?

Scienta,asktransgender,"Looking into SRS, I am finding it hard to find solid information, I'd like to aggregate opinions here.","Simply put, I am doing research into SRS, it has always been on my radar, something I wanted since I came out, and I have the funds to make it happen, but I am a little hesitant as I can't find much good information on the process, different surgeons, and the like. So I will ask here, and I want as many opinions as possible, give me as much detail as you like, and answer some basic questions I will outline below

1. Sex is important to me, I have two partners who are very sexually active. Now, I made the decision to get SRS before I entered a relationship, at that point in my life I was worried more about aesthetic than stimulation, yet I hear from some girls out there, that SRS has left them somewhat unsatisfied in this respect. I would like to know why, and whether or not a certain surgeon would fit the bill more accurately in the realm of stitulation. I can provide details if need be.

2. When, Where and who did you get yours done with. I see mixed answers all over the place, this place is great over here, but terrible then, and this place is the best, but now all surgeons do the same. Its all a mess, and its mostly because a lot of these reports are years out of date. 

3. Were you circumcised or not, and did it affect the outcome negatively, or are you happy, please tell me why. The fact I am asking this question should signify that yes indeed I was circumcised, and yes, it does frighten me, please alleviate, or reinforce my concerns, and if you are happy, then please do tell me who and where. It is important to me.

Thank you &lt;3"

TheUltimateAlt,asktransgender,Suggestions Wanted Please,"So, I posted this on r/offmychest earlier today, and one of the comments said to ask about things here.

""I'm not sure if this is the best place to put this, but as the title says, I wish I was born a girl and I have wished that for a while now.

I'm a 19 year old, 6'2"" male with broad shoulders and a deep voice. Even so, I'm the least masculine ""guy"" that I know. I am very ""feminine"" and I always have been. Unlike most people that are transgender, I have never worn women's clothing because I wanted to, but that's only because I was embarrassed. I didn't want to be judged because I wanted to wear makeup, girly clothes, or anything like that.

I've thought about transitioning in the past, but I'm worried about not being convincing as a female. I wish I was able to have just been born as one so I didn't have to worry about this now. I want to be girly, I want to be able to do all of this without judgement, but I can't because of the body I was born in.

Sorry for the rant, I just had to get it out to someone.""

(Copy and pasted for reference).

Now, my question is, could I be convincing? My biggest fear regarding the possibility of transitioning is that I wouldn't be able to pass as a female. The deep voice, height, and broad shoulders are what really scare me regarding the transition. Should I be worried?"
leavesthrowaway15,asktransgender,Questions from a cis individual on how to be an ally,"Hello! This is my first time posting here and I very much hope that none of the questions I ask are offensive; if they are, please let me know so I'll know to do better in the future.

I am a straight, cis female who has several questions regarding trans individuals. I live in the bible belt and don't have much exposure to the trans community, but I've had several experiences recently with trans individuals that made me want to learn how to be more of an ally. I happened across a trans subreddit recently (can't remember exactly which) and I was very struck by your stories.

1) I have a co-worker who is biologically male but identifies as female. I don't believe this individual has begun hormone therapy yet, and is still presenting as male as they haven't come out as trans (is come out an acceptable term?) to our workplace. I'm under the impression that I should refer to this person using male pronouns in front of other co-workers, but in person, should I still do so? Should I ask? As someone who is very unfamiliar with proper etiquette in these situations (this co-worker and I are friendly but not so close that I'm not worried about offending them), I usually let them offer whatever information they want and am a bit wary of asking questions as I don't want to make them feel uncomfortable.

2) I've been seeing a lot about that NC law that bans trans people from using the bathroom for the gender with which they identify. I have no problem with this, I wouldn't be bothered by my co-worker (the only trans person that I'm aware of) being in the same restroom as myself. However, I have seen cases of straight, cis men posing as trans individuals to get into the womens' bathroom. I won't lie - I would be uncomfortable to be in a restroom alone with someone presenting as an adult cis man. Are there protections within the law for this? How does that work? As I said, I have no problem with trans individuals using a women's restroom if that's the way they identify but my impression is that trans individuals can present in many ways - how do I and how does the law interpret between someone who is genuinely going to the appropriate bathroom of their gender vs. someone who is taking advantage of this inappropriately?

Those are the clearest two questions I've had on my mind lately. However, I'm interested in any sort of brief resources you all could recommend to learn more about appropriate etiquette - as I said before, this is all pretty out of my realm of familiarity.

Again, I truly apologize if I this post contains anything offensive - I absolutely do not mean it to be. Please let me know what you all think and absolutely correct me if I've worded (or conceptualized) anything inappropriately. As a straight cis female, I know that I have a lot to learn about differing perspectives and I struggle with finding wording to ask about those perspectives without accidentally being offensive.

Edit: replied, thanks for all of your help!"
myaltaccount86,asktransgender,I just came out to one of my roommates.,"Sorry no question. 

I have a roommate who's awesome. He's a really caring person who is always letting people know that if you ever need someone to talk to that he's there for you.

After making sure that my other roommate wasn't home (I'll go into why I didn't want him there later) I said ""You're always saying that if I ever have anything to talk about I can come to you. Is anything I say to you just between us?"" he said ""Unless you're hurting someone, self harming, or committing a non-minor crime."" We talked a little bit after that, and eventually I told him that I was transgender, and that he's the only person I've told besides my therapist. He actually interrupted me to say ""wait a minute. Male to female or female to male?"" This made me chuckle.

He was great about it. He said that he was honored and grateful that I trusted him with that knowledge. He asked questions, I gave answers. I told him that I'm comfortable with all of those questions, but that some of them most people would not be comfortable being asked (example: he asked if I planned on getting SRS at some point). He said that there are many things I do that he sees differently now. He used to think I joke around about somethings not realizing I'm serious about it. For example: I love my hair, and I'm always talking about how beautiful it is and how I love to take care of it. He always thought I was just joking, but he sees that in a different light now. 

Over all it went exactly as I expected, but I was still scared shitless to bring it up. All in all though, I'm happy to have him in my life. 

The reason I don't want my other roommate to know is for two reason. 1, I'm not sure how he'll take it, and 2, He's a coworker (specifically my boss [we were friends before I started working there though]) and I don't want that information going around work until I am well on my way through transition. I don't think he would just start blabbing about it, but as my boss/a manager, I worry that he might feel obligated to tell other managers etc.

Eventually-Alexis,asktransgender,The Danish system is broken.,Well the title really says it all. In Denmark we basically have one big clinic in Copenhagen that deals with all trans people. And as you can imagine that makes the waiting excruciatingly long. As of right now I'm still waiting for the letter that will determine everything and it can take up to a month before I even know if they are going to treat me. I hate this. And things are just going backwards because we at least to my knowledge used to have informed consent didn't we? This is all because the health department decided that they wanted to monopolise on treatment for trans people. They placed the only clinic in Copenhagen but they didn't give them their own budget since that was the regions own responsibility so they are underfunded and that in turn gives 10-12 months of staying in the waiting line. Sorry for my rant. I just had to get my frustration out.
[deleted],asktransgender,Only have AA breasts after 4 years of HRT. What gives?,"I started hormones at 16, having had almost no puberty effects before then. I'm now 20 and only have AA cup breasts. My regimen was 4mg estradiol and Depo Provera injections quarterly. Now it's .6ml of 5mg/ml weekly with no testosterone blocker because I'm post-op orchiectomy. My current regimen started a year ago. My estradiol range is around 150pg/ml and testosterone at 45pg/ml at day 5 of my cycle.

My stats are 5'5, 130lbs, AA cup bust. I have a skinny build and small hips. 

Have any of you seen this either in your own transition or someone else's? This is very confusing and painful for me to deal with and I feel ugly and unfeminine over it, despite passing just fine otherwise. 

I really appreciate any help, suggestions, or answers. Especially from people in similar situations. Thank you all so much.

jdpiano,asktransgender,Fantasies of transforming into a woman have been the central conflict of my life. Nearly 7 years of therapy/medication and I'm no better.,"Cliff notes:

-My earliest memory was trying on my sisters' clothing at around 3

-At age 5, I would daydream at nap time about physically transforming into a girl.

-At puberty, the fantasies turned sexual. I began crossdressing in secrecy.

-Although I developed crushes on girls, I could never get sexual feelings directed at them. The sexual object of desire was instead the idea of me becoming a woman, followed by having sex with faceless men.

-At 18, I said, ""Wow, this is problematic. I need help."" and sought a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist diagnosed me with AGP and referred me to a therapist. Also placed me on anti-depressants.

-Also at 18 I was diagnosed with low-testosterone. I was not very masculine looking, had poor muscle development, poor body hair development, and so I went on testosterone replacement therapy.

-Since between 18 and now almost 25, I have seen well over 10 different therapists, each of varying educational backgrounds, certifications, and specialties, all in different geographic locations as I traveled the country for my education. (including a gender therapist)

-Basically I would approach therapy like this: I would describe the situation to the therapist, and desperately hope he could tell me if I was ""really transgender"" or not.

-I wished so badly there was a questionnaire or checklist that could be used to determined what all of this meant. And if I met enough tick boxes, I would be a female, and if not, I would be an ordinary male.

-Well, not surprisingly, no therapist has ever been able to tell me if I'm ""really"" trans. Only I would know that.

-And yet, I have not been able to find the answer within myself. I have never been able to reach any satisfying conclusion. So I remain a guy, and I remain miserable.

-I cycle through all of the possible lifestyle choices: transition, be gender neutral, crossdress part time, etc. I obsess over what I should do about my internal conflict.

-I next tried HRT...four times in fact. Each time I quit, because I had doubts and something kicked in and said, ""well, maybe I do kinda like being a guy."" When I started feeling the physical changes began, I became terrified I was making a mistake, and quit. I want 100% certainty, but that's something that we almost never have with anything in life. But I feel like if I grew breasts and later regret them, it would be both embarrassing and costly to have them removed.

-It's problematic with intimacy, because I can only reach arousal by fantasizing about being a woman.

-I obsess over and over about what it all really means, and how I should live my life. But since no one else can tell me, and I don't know myself, then I feel perpetually stuck in a rut.

-Currently I'm in Massachusetts seeing a PhD from Harvard as my therapist. He specializes in depression and gender. I'm also seeing a psychiatrist. He thinks this might all just be OCD and recently placed me on OCD medication.

clayleviathan,asktransgender,Trans clothing swap app?,"Hey folks, I'm a trans lady and I've been looking around for a decent clothes swapping site, but haven't had much luck. I've found some, but they all seem out of date, or like there isn't much involvement. So I got to thinking: wouldn't it be nice to have a service that organized the swaps?

One of my first thoughts was: What about privacy? Sure, were all part of the same community, but that doesn't mean that we want to give our addresses to strangers. Maybe a middle person might be a good idea. Someone who could hold swaps until both parties have sent theirs in.

My next thought was: why does this just have to be trans people? Wouldn't it also be great to promote donations for trans folks from cis folks? Wouldn't that help raise awareness and give people a way they could easily and directly support the lives of trans folks?

I dunno, I'm an ideas person. I have at least one idea a day that I with I could put into action, but as a trans person (and one who's struggling to build a new wardrobe), I feel personally invested in this one. I know there are other folks out there trying to do this, and that encourages me even more. It means that the idea already has a little traction, it just needs the right folks to come together to make it work. So, I was wondering if anyone else might be interested in turning this idea into a legit project."
my-other-accounts,asktransgender,I'm not sure what I am. Should I start transitioning?,"Backstory:

So, I'm amab, I didn't question that until, maybe a year ago when I was 18. I had experimented with crossdressing when I was a kid and I remember thinking about how much better girl's clothes were than men's in high school. I decided that I didn't really identify with masculinity although I didn't think anything of it beyond that, maybe 2 years ago when I was 17. When I was 18 I had interest in experimenting with feminine clothing and attempting to feminize my body but I didn't plan on transitioning or anything I would still be a man but I was interested in experimenting with gender nonconformity. I started to identify with nonbinary identities after that and was particularly interested in genderfluidity. I didn't plan on doing anything about it still though.

Current Identity:

So, at this point I can't decide between whether I'm a trans woman/feminine, nonbinary or making it up. I don't experience dysphoria, although there are certain things I would like to change. I didn't even think about transitioning until I talked to a trans woman about it who recommended that I do so, I agreed that I wanted to in the moment, but now I don't know if I want it or not. What if I just liked the support? I adopted the perspective that hrt and ffs would just be a form of body modification and not actually transitioning and I liked that idea and thought that I would go through with it like that but idk now. So I feel like I'm sitting on a fence while not being completely interested in going on either side. I don't feel connected to gender at all, I don't care if I'm called she or he or they and I look at both men and women as people I would want to be like. I was called miss by a stranger recently and I didn't really care, although I rationalized it later thinking that was probably a good thing because I was thinking of myself as a trans woman at the time. 

Why I'm Unsure of Transitioning:

Something that make me unsure is the fact that I've filled my internet experience with trans women, kind of inadvertently over time. I now think that sometimes I'm just trying to fit in with them, but I also think that if I find something that is attracting me to them then there must be something there, as it's not a sexual or romantic thing just comfortability and a feeling of emotional commonality. I also feel some level of emotional commonality to fem gay guys and want to be both sort of. I feel like I need to start hrt now so that I prevent further masculinization and it seems that androgyny is easier to maintain as a woman but I'm particularly nervous about my genitals, 'cause I'd prefer to keep functionality as I have no issue there. 

tl;dr- I don't feel connected to gender as a concept. I feel identity with fem gay guys and trans women, emotionally. I'm nervous about starting hrt because of a fear of genital utility loss. 

Any advice on how to proceed? Should I start hrt? Should I come out? Is my questioning of gender identity real or the result of trying to fit in?

Edit: None of this was meant to imply trans women and fem gay guys are at all the same and not completely different genders, I'm sorry if I offended anyone. It was my personal emotional aspect, although I think I might identify with trans women more, idk. I think it points to gender fluidity.

Osricthebastard,asktransgender,So I think Ive finally settled in,"There are some of you over the months who may have witnessed a few of my crisis's of identity. Basically I struggle sometimes with feeling partially or even wholly male despite pursuing a strictly binary transition to female. Every few months I make a desperate post on here because Ive got it in to my head again that Im something other than a trans WOMAN. Well... I think Im over it. Some of you have suggested Im genderqueer/fluid/whatever but honestly I no longer think thats the case. As breast growth firms up and as I love more and more of my life as a binary woman (and its about 90 percent of my life right now) the more content I am with that. I still go to band practice as male right now. Its one of the very few places. Im out to my drummer but Ive left that part of my life male for the time being with the explicit understanding that eventually it will change. Well I decided to try and genderqueer my presentation last night. I just wasnt feeling it. I wanted to be in a pretty dress, not in a mish mash of genderfuckery. It really drove the point home that while there are still going to be days that I feel a little or even totally male, thats not an indication that Im genderqueer but an indication that Im still struggling with the internal transition. I moved quickly. From my coming to terms moment to starting hrt was a month and a half long then after only 7 months of hrt I was more or less full time. I didnt give myself a lot of time to adjust or struggle with my identity properly. I dont think I made the wrong decision with transitioning at all, but I do sometimes wish Id taken more time.

I guess this is a cautionary tale."
silam39,asktransgender,"How do you get used to boobs? (aimed at cis and trans women, mostly)","I've been on HRT for maybe 7-8 months now. In that time, my chest has mostly just gotten a little larger and fairly sensitive. I think they're at Tanner Stage 2 right now.

However, last month my endo doubled my estrogen prescription, and since then they seem to be growing rather faster.
In any case, I've been feeling increasingly aware of them, and as much as I want them to grow and am happy to finally have something a little noticeable, I also feel a bit removed from it all.

Along with my larger hips and surprisingly smaller waist, the boobs don't always feel like they're ""part of my body"" and I don't know how to get used to them. Is this a normal thing pre-teen/teenage girls go through when their boobs start growing out? Is this something you went through if you started HRT late?

But am I blowing this out of proportion in my mind? Probably. I'm very anxious. But did any of you pick an at all unconventional name and get negative reactions to it?"

She doesn't accept this and keeps praying(or at least she says).

People are suggesting it may take some time, but I'm highly doubt she'd accept me as a daughter rather than a son.

This is a recording of some time ago but it basically gives her opinion on it and it's reason enough.(sorry for quality/language, it's a mix of Dutch and English, I also had to hide the recorder somewhere on me)

She knows this for about 1-2 months now."
Bryom,asktransgender,Eating well in preparation for semen cryopreservation?,"Not sure if this is really the best place to ask but it's at least somewhat trans related and I'm sure some others have gone (or will go) through semen cryopreservation.

I'm 20 years old and MTF. Me and my (cis female) partner have decided to store my semen for any future children we might have before I start HRT. So far we've found a place and all is well, but I've read online that certain foods will help increase sperm production etc. Would it be worth it to go on a special diet in preparation for the storage, and if so, how long before the storage would I have to be on such a diet for it to have any kind of real effect?

Also, I doubt it's anything to worry about, but I may as well ask: such a diet might boost my testosterone levels, should I be worried?

Also, if there's any advice anybody has to offer about sperm storage, or if there's anything anybody feels I should know, please say.

Thanks :)"

pablofam,asktransgender,Is this a symptom of being transgender?,"I made a post yesterday on /r/sex about my unique issue with my sexuality. I am a 20 year old male, who can only feel sexually aroused when I imagine myself as a female. To clarify, I do not feel aroused by being a man turned into a woman, or any of those sorts of fetishes, but rather I fantasize about already being a female.  

Outside of that, in the context of me being a male, I'm essentially asexual. I can't feel aroused when I think of myself as a guy having sex with anyone.  

Anyways, one of the posters in that post brought up the possibility of being transgender. Now, I think it's worth consideration that this may be due to at least some gender dysphoria, but I'm not entirely convinced.  

Growing up, as a kid, I often did fantasize (non-sexually, just daydream) about being a woman when I was older. I think that began around the age of 8, and when I was 9 I secretly wore my sisters clothing in private a few times.  

However, I never felt distress about not actually being a female. It was just something that thinking about made me feel good. Then, when I was 14, I began to become preoccupied with it and started deeply worrying that I was transgender.  

However, those feelings soon left, and I felt alright again (albeit, still with the sexual issue). I developed a good male identity, and I feel relatively comfortable with myself. And it's not a case of trying to go full macho in response to being afraid of feminine feelings. As part of being comfortable with myself, I've embraced a more feminine aesthetic - like growing out my hair, keeping myself well-shaved, etc - and it makes me feel pretty satisfied.  

I've never felt negative about having a penis, either. Although I'm not really interested in using it for sex, it's a very nice tool to have...  

So, I just figured I'd ask some people who might be able to give me insight and asses my situation for me. Sorry for my English, and thanks for reading."

The only thing they said about skinny jeans on the first day was that they can't be too tight that you can't bend over, which they aren't.  Ive seen other girls at Ace wearing skinny jeans so its not that no one can wear them.  I just pulled out an old pair of jeans that I wore before I knew I was trans and it just made me feel awful.

madmarmalade,asktransgender,What does the trans community think of otherkin?,"Nominally they're not related, but there's a lot of language in common. I walked in on a conversation in the break room that were talking about otherkin, about this dragonkin guy who wanted to try to rearrange his office so that people wouldn't tread on his tail, who ate whole chickens with feral vigor, but who quit his job and was living in his mom's basement. The language they were using to ridicule him could have been heard about trans people; sabotaging his chance to be a ""acceptable and productive member of society,"" and in general how ridiculous it is that he believes he is something he could never be.


I was not... present enough to really contribute or join the discussion, but it did get me thinking. How does the emergence of otherkin effect the trans community? Right now, my feelings are that they are sort of leaching off of the trans community, co-opting our activism and terminology. While there are hypotheses of biological components to transness, with genetics. uterine hormonal washes, anatomy, or neural patterns, there is no biological basis to otherkin - no wolf chromosomes or hormones, and certainly no dragon DNA. And there really is no treatment for them; the best way to accomodate GID is to facilitate transition, but there's no way for otherkin to transition; no hormones, no fur transplants, maaaaybe surgery. Believe me, I spent most of my childhood believing I was turning into one sort of critter or another, but I grew out of it; now most of my animal identification is solely symbolic, like snakes, snow leopards, or herons. Maybe that's a possible solution? I don't know. But the parallels between us makes me uneasy, and I'm unsure how to address them. "

It just went on and on, and he kept asking me what I knew about him and him telling me I knew nothing about him.

Saying I'm a jerk for calling him names. Saying it was just a joke. Then other people chime in asking if a black person finds a racist joke funny, does that make him racist? It just went on and on. It was exhausting, so in the end I just stopped and blocked him. Its over now.

I guess all my good points were deleted, but don't other people see the good points I made against his transphobic remarks?

Laouadiva,asktransgender,what's the likelihood of being allowed to star HRT without socially transitioning?,"Full of questions today. In the process of getting a private consultation at a gender clinic and so far a lot of what I've been hearing is they're only likely to start you on hormones if you've socially transitioned. HRT had kind of been step one in my mind, I'm so irrefutably sure this is right for me so the plan was to start on hormones just to FEEL better mentally etc then tackle the difficulty of coming out when I was at a stage where I'd feel comfortable presenting as female. I'm aware it could be jarring for the doctor to have someone who is to the naked eye completely a boy say they're ready for this treatment but I am I know I am this is just the easiest way of doing it in my mind. Did any of you transition this way ie. hormones before changing anything else? "
boyfrienddysphoria,asktransgender,"My boyfriend is experiencing intense gender dysphoria. He says he's still attracted to me and wants to be with me forever, but he has stopped wanting sex. How can I be sensitive to this while still feeling desired?","My boyfriend [30M] and I [25F] have been together for about 2 years. Early on in our relationship, he was pretty aggressive with sex, always asking for it and taking a lot of initiative - in short, it was great. I felt very sexy and sexually satisfied. However, in the past year or so, it's dropped off -- and in the past few months it has gotten worse, he always has excuses.

I didn't know at the time that he has had gender dysphoria for most of his life; I found out about it about a year and a half into our relationship when I accidentally opened up a facebook tab on his computer to see he had a female facebook page and had messaged someone to 'feminize' him.

When I asked him about it, he did tell me that he has always had a feminine side and sometimes wished he'd wake up a girl when he was a kid, and says that every once in a while, his gender dysphoria flares up and it causes a lot of anxiety and confusion. He has said that past therapists have told him it's possible that his gender dysphoria flares up after he experiences trauma or stress, and it's an 'escape' for him (he had a bad childhood). My first question is, Is there any truth to that? I don't know much about gender dysphoria, but I'm curious if that's a thing that might happen.

My second question stems from the issue we've been having with sex lately. He is no longer anything like his former self in bed, he is often too tired to have sex and when we attempt it, he can't stay hard and he starts freaking out with anxiety and frustration. I will say that he has very low testosterone levels, and he doesn't want to take T, because he says it makes him unable to ejaculate (this is also why he's constantly fatigued) and I'm sure he feels uncertain about T because of his gender dysphoria right now. It could be a big mix of issues - maybe sex has just dropped off because we're two years in... but we are both young and 2 years isn't that long. So something is wrong.

That being said, since this is a complicated time for him as he is going to take some steps to explore his gender dysphoria and see if he wants to live as a woman (I have supported him 100% and told him I will be there with him every step of the way of this exploration, even if ultimately he decides to be a woman and I decide I want to be with a man as I'm straight), how can I remain sensitive to his sexual issues? I can't help it, I know it's wrong, but I often feel like it's my fault - and I don't feel desired anymore. I have a high sex drive, and constantly being rejected takes a toll on me and my self-esteem... especially since he is such a shadow of the former guy I met.

I guess my question is to those who have experienced gender dysphoria or a transition, and remained with your partners, what's the best way I can approach having my needs met when he's going through such a time? Can gender dysphoria cause a lack of sexual appetite? How can I help get his confidence up again and have us be intimate again?

I should say that my boyfriend considers himself a lesbian trapped in a male's body - though he has had some bi feelings before - and he's told me even if he is a woman he would want to stay with me. So it's not that he's into guys, at least I don't think so at the moment, it's what he's told me."
saidgoddamn,asktransgender,Height loss in MTFs?,"I've read in a few places that it is possible to lose some height, I'm 5'9 and ok with it but losing an inch or so wouldn't hurt. Is this even a real thing? Has anyone lost a noticeable amount of height? Thanks :)"
kenitatu,asktransgender,"Bathhouses segregated by sex / ""gender""","Let me state at the top that I think people should obviously give zero fucks about other people's genitals as long as everyone's minding their own business, BUT I wanted to get a broader perspective on presenting / negotiating this issue with a larger public.

When I lived in Korea, visiting the bathhouses (known as [Jimjilbangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jjimjilbang)) was a regular occurrence - for many monthly, others weekly, some (like seniors) daily. They are divided by sex (or often claim they are divided by ""gender""). Analogs of course exist in many other countries as well. American cities with large Asian populations (the bigger Californian cities, for example) also have versions of these.

In a perfect world, nobody should really care who's in their bathhouse with them, but if you've ever lived in one of these communities, you'll know that's not going to happen overnight. I also know that it'd be nice if everyone lived in an area with more LGBTQ-friendly business owners, but for 99% of the Korean population as well as most other people in communities with these sorts of institutions, that's also not going to happen soon.

So the obvious question: What's the strategy here for  a trans person who wants to use these bathhouses? Again, not exactly asking how the world *should* be (though that could be a useful discussion as well), but more on a very practical level what trans folks should be doing in these real current situations. 

Side question that I hope isn't inflammatory but I'm just asking because I can already foresee objectors bringing up this question: since some of these societies arguably have even higher rates of unreported sexual assault against women than in the States, how do we continue to ensure safe spaces for people who identify as women (both trans and cis) in these very vulnerable situations? Again, NOT saying that trans people are the who might perpetuate these kinds of assaults, but that some men in these very overtly patriarchal societies would almost certainly exploit a new setting in which to harass women - in this case, a bathhouse not segregated by sex.

Thanks for the insight!"
Sepol818,asktransgender,"Argentina, Denmark, Malta, Ireland - Gender Identity laws versus access to physical transition?","Hi, everyone!  
  
During the last few months there has been a heated debate in my country (Portugal) between trans activists about our gender identity law, and about how it should (or should not) be updated. Our current law states that we need to present a clinical diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria in order to change our name and gender marker in all official documents (no hormones or surgeries required). The major debate centers around the requirement of that diagnosis.  

There are two sides:  
1) people who say that the current law we have is fine  
2) people who say that trans people should not need a Gender Dysphoria diagnosis on order to change our name and gender marker  
  
People in side ""2"" say that we shouldn't be dependent on the doctors' approval. They say that it's a violation of our human rights and that our identity should not be a diagnostic. This side is pushing for a new law that would allow any person to change their name and gender marker without intervention from any doctor - people's declaration that they are the gender that they are should be enough. Their arguments center around the idea of total depathologization.  
  
People in side ""1"" are worried that this depathologization will result in a withrawal of state-funded transition related healthcare. Currently, all psichological support and surgeries are free, and the medication for HRT is partially paid for by the state. People are afraid that all of this will be taken away once the condition of being trans is no longer seen as a pathological condition by the state.  
  
The kind of gender identity law that people on ""side 2"" are pushing for resembles the laws in Argentina, Denmark, Malta and, more recently, Ireland.  
  
Which brings me to this question: people from Argentina, Denmark, Malta or Ireland, how has the clinical transition process changed when your gender identity laws were passed? Did the state provide any kind of finnancial support before and/or after the law? Would you say that the clinical aspects of transition became easier or more difficult (or didn't change) with the law?

I want a different experience to life and how I am perceived, treated, and what my body limits me to. Its kinda hard to explain, I kinda picture this stuff as customizing your charter in a game. There was a study to give humans wings and that is stuff I want. Even if they don't won't it's just something that will make you look better.

Ijustdontknow93,asktransgender,Not sure I can go on.,"life seems bleak. For the longest time, I've had these peaks and valleys of emotion. That's life obviously. Be this valley that I've hit seems so deep that I'm not sure I can navigate my way back up. I know what I want/need out of life. I need to be the woman I was always meant to be. But, I'm not sure I can't muster the courage to continue. My whole life has been a balancing act of mataining appearances and acting as the normalizer of my family. I was the golden child, the ""son"" that my parents always wanted. I stayed out of trouble and did what was expected but slowly was rotting away on the inside. My insides were starting to show on my outsides, I was noticbly stressed. Losing weight due to not eating. But finally I managed to admit what/who I was. I was euphoric, but that feeling was fleeting when I managed to see the summit in front of me. Claiming this Everest of bullshit was going to be a fight but I know I had to attempt. So far the climb has been treacherous, doubts aplenty. By at the time I've made great strides. HRT, therapy, groups, and even bought my first girl clothes. life seemed to have purpose, but coming out has been the struggle. The family who I love very much , raised me and brought me int this world, I feel I was betraying them. Like I said earlier, I lived a juggling act. I didn't want to make life about me but the others around me. So trying to tell them I had to do this for ME was insanely difficult. To much chagrin, my mother and sister accepts it. But on the other hand I am mortified/ashamed to tell me father. My father is very alpha and obviously as the oldest we raised me to be his successor in a way. I was always told to be the type of man that would provide for his family, the type of man who take of my mother after he died. He also suffers from high blood pressure, and has very stressful position at work. I honestly feel like me being dead would be an alternative to him ever knowing this. I want to be happy, I need to be happy but im not sure I can this at the expense of my family. I don't know guys I'm floundering bad. If you were an only son how did your father take it? I'm afraid that I'm not going to be able to get out of bed anymore. Or even worse just end it.

Rockpup5,asktransgender,How do I start?,"Hi Reddit, I'm 20, afab, and I've been questioning seriously for ~2 years - basically the end of high school. At this point, I'm fairly comfortable with myself that I want to be viewed in a masculine way, and I would like to explore testosterone/etc. I can't really pin if I'm nonbinary transmasculine or straight-up FtM because no rainbow fairy has appeared from the sky with a 100-question survey that will tell me exactly what my gender is (shocking, I know), so I don't know how to tell people about my transness and I'm not sure how to come out to my family. I have supportive friends who tell me that they'll start using whatever pronouns I wish to use whenever I tell them, but /I/ don't know what I want beyond ""not she/her/hers"" so it's kind of difficult. 

I've had a rather stressful day (got asked to be a godmother! basically just non-specifically came out to my sister via text!) and my mom has urged me to go to counseling - but I'm not sure where to start. Beyond oversharing on Tumblr, I haven't done any kind of therapy since middle school. Do I just walk up to any ol' therapist and say ""Hey, I think I'm transgender, can we talk about my issues?"" or do I need to find someone who specializes in gender-related stuff? There's a LGBTQIA+ resource center on my university campus, but I'm rather intimidated by it and haven't gone there since last year, probably for the same reason that I haven't sought counseling before now (it's not real if you ignore it, right? That's obviously not working for me, though). I know trans people, but I don't want to burden them/invade their privacy by storming into their messages and asking. 

I'm not sure who to turn to, at this point, so I figured this reddit might be a good place to start. How did you all get started on your journeys? How do I figure out where to start mine? "
singlegeranium,asktransgender,"Not passing because of fashion choices, not feeling like yourself without said choices... Opinions please!","Before transitioning, I was the type of person one would consider traditionally very feminine. Part of that was that makeup and fashion were my hobbies, and I wouldn't want to leave the house without a clean, well coordinated outfit. Most days, I'd get up a hour and a half before I needed to for hair and makeup, and it was something I took a lot of pride in.

My taste in fashion didn't change much when I came out, and getting rid of some of my favourite pieces was probably harder than it should have been. I still like to dress nicely. Which brings me to the present issue- looking more put together gets in the way of me passing. Most of my peers can just throw on some t shirt and some shorts and not care; I need to have a properly ironed shirt that fits me well for starters. 

Looking different makes me really stand out, and I've been told before that I look ""too nice"" for a guy my age. I've heard that next to my feminine (obviously!) face, my clothes make me unpassable. I don't wear clothes made for women. I don't use makeup anymore. I buy everything from the men's section of the store. But I can't bear to go outside dressed like my peers dress, it would make me too self-conscious.

Jenmensions,asktransgender,"Today I got assigned female in an online game I play, and I felt so validated :')","So I sometimes play this game called Rust. Rust is a multiplayer online survival building game, mostly focused on building a base and then defending it from other players. But, there's a special twist: Rust assigns you a character which is tied to your account; you can't change who your character is (just like in real life). The devs introduced this a year ago by assigning the race of characters: players were assigned a race by the game that they couldn't change.
That was what prompted my interest in the game - before, it seemed like a fairly boring MMO, and obviously some the communities within the game can be quite toxic, but now I genuinely interested in the game. Anyhow, I played it for a few days, but after that I stopped playing, and I hadn't looked at it for 6 months. Until...
The devs implemented a new assignment: the devs had reassigned 50% of the players to be female. I heard about it, and was sooo nerviouscited to see who my character was. And.... I got assigned female!!! I was so unbelievably happy to be a girl in Rust, and I started crying... I felt so validated &lt;3
And I realized something much greater than a video game today: I am so grateful I am at being able to transition. I'm starting to realize just how emotional transition is going to be for me, and how much my own life is going to change by transition. I'm feel so emotional now tonight, I'm just overcome with joy.

""It's just nice, now that you can live without worries about money, you can finally become who you want to be, and change what needs changed.""

And like...does she know? Am I just stupid? I haven't come out to her at all, and I'm still SO scared to do so, but from what I've mentioned, does she sound like she knows. And also, does it seem like I'd be fine coming out to her? I know, it looks obvious, probably. But I can't shake the anxiety of it despite everything I typed being a positive. Heck, her being so supportive through life makes me even more afraid, I think. What do?"
_CKS_,asktransgender,Coming Out,"Hello, Im a 14year old male, and I have recently come to terms with my want to be a Female. I have not told anyone, but im worried at how I will be treated like at school, will I have to move schools and start fresh? I really need some advice. Thanks. "
waythrowagay5,asktransgender,"How do I go about affording college without parent's support/those of you who did/are, how?","I started T on Friday last week. Came out to parents a few days ago. Reaction was as expected, horrible. They haven't said they're cutting me off yet, but I'm expecting it since my mom said I wasn't allowed to do any surgeries/hormones while I was in college because they wouldn't support it. My dad has not called me yet, but once he does I am planning on telling him I am on T and expecting him to then cut me off.

I will be applying for on campus summer jobs in the hopes that I can stay here and make some money. If not it isn't a big deal, my friend who lives in Houston has already offered to take me in over the summer and discussed it with his parents. He can also get me a job working for his dad. If that falls through for any reason, my older sister lives in Houston and she has also offered me a room to stay in over the summer.

Now I wasn't completely stupid about this, I saw it coming so I've been preparing for a long time. My school costs $60,000 per year. I have a scholarship that covers a substantial amount, so this year my total cost of attendance has been $24,400. I applied and was hired to be an RA next year, which will take about $15,000 off my expenses. I'm going to round the numbers just to make the math easy and say that means I have to pay about $10,000 per year. 

I'm planning on going to my school's financial aid office and telling them my situation in the hopes that they can help me out a little bit. Even if they do, I'm certainly not expecting them to cover the remaining $10,000. So this leaves me thinking about loans. I am pretty sure I would need a cosigner since I have no established credit, and as of right now, do not have a job. I have not asked my sister about it yet, but will ask her if she would be willing to cosign for me, and I am pretty sure she will say yes. I am just feeling anxious about how I'm going to find/get approved for these loans. I don't really know much about how different loans work, and if for some reason my sister won't cosign, I don't know if I'm totally screwed. If it's worth anything, I have $2000 in my bank account right now (completely separate from my parents), and should have a second on campus job starting fall semester.

So I guess basically I'm asking for help on how to go about covering the remaining $10,000 so I can keep going to school here."

Fairlady31,asktransgender,Could I have changed into non-binary without knowing it?,"Okay, i'll explain a little bit about myself.

I wish I was a cisgender woman. 100% no questions asked. If there was a button I could press that would turn me into a cis woman I would have pressed it 1000 times by now.

I've been on hormones for a brief period and i'm loving it so far. It feels completely right to me and i'm loving myself a little more every day. I look feminine, but still a little odd, kind of like the uncanny valley. I don't have the voice of a man, but I have a boy voice. 

One thing has changed since I started transitioning though, and that is that I no longer care if I end up looking like a conventional woman or not. I see videos of these transwomen on youtube, and they're all so beautiful you would never even guess they're trans. They have the perfect voice and everything too.

I feel like early on in transition I really wanted to try hard to be one of these people. They seemed so perfect. But now, I don't care how people see me anymore. I'm trans, this is a part of who I am, and if someone wants me it's a part of the package. This thinking has taken a lot off pressure off of me. I no longer feel like I have to live life hating myself because I'm ""not there yet"" in my transition, or seen completely as a woman by others. 

For the record, not that it matters, I am planning on having SRS and FFS eventually, FFS later on in life when I  can afford it because it's not an immediate need to me. I have pretty bad genital dysphoria and hate my bulge, often resorting to wearing gaffs and running to the washroom when they get untucked.

Does this make me non-binary? The fact that I no longer care if I'm seen as trans, or not as a woman by others ? The fact that my transness has become a staple part of my identity? Does my stupid boy voice alone make me non-binary, even though I wish I was a cis woman every second of every day?

Don't misunderstand me. I totally wish I would be seen as a ciswoman. But it doesn't seem in my future and so I've moved on. Instead of trying to be seen as a conventional woman, i'm my own unique queer girl. I love my female name and using female pronouns, I feel those are key parts of my identity as well. But i'm fine with being trans and not a ciswoman, because I understand there's no other options and so there's no point fretting over it.

What do you all think? Am I binary or non-binary? Or are labels not appropriate for me?

Help would be nice, doing some questioning

WisteriaXYZ,asktransgender,I changed my name and gender marker with the DMV today!,"So I went to the DMV with a friend today to change my name and gender marker. My friend just tagged along to support me in case anything dumb happened. 

When I got there the lady at the front desk asked what I was there for and I said I needed a new license because my name was recently changed and needed to update it. She then smiled and asked me if I had my marriage certificate with me. I was sort of confused at first then realized she just thought my name must have changed because of marriage. I smiled at her and said ""I have everything I need."" She then handed me a number and beamed at me and my friend and said ""congratulations you two!"" and sent us on our way. 

We walked into the waiting room and we both started laughing. I'm not used to being placed in a heteronormative box. I'm a lesbian and my friend is gay so we were both kind of surprised by it and thought it was really funny. I'm also generally pretty self conscious and think I don't pass well even though everyone says I do, so the fact she clearly recognized me as a woman and then went on to presume I must have gotten married gave me a huge confidence boost.

Anyway the rest of the process at the DMV went well, everyone was nice to me and I have the correct name and gender on my license finally.

Anyone else had a similar experience to this or a funny story they'd like to share?"

turningintoronto777,asktransgender,I don't know if I'm trans (Warning: some ignorant comments inside),"I wanted to throw up that disclaimer so I don't put anybody out. Some of the stuff I need to say are against my better judgement, but I need to be set straight. I'm tired of questioning.

I'm a 22 y/o cis girl. I go to a college where I'm meeting a lot of queer people and making friends for the first time, and it's comforting. It makes me feel like a real person, but it also puts me off.

I've been dysphoric about my gender for a long time and the amount of people who identify as male at my school-- but don't try to pass, or do not want to transition- makes me wonder. I think this is a shitty sentiment, and people can use whatever pronouns they want, but there has never been a moment where I felt like changing my pronouns the way I am. I am not entirely comfortable being female, but I am not disgusted. I like makeup and dresses and though I know those aren't gender exclusive, something feels right about wearing male clothing, and if I could snap my fingers and look the part, I would. But I can't. I don't pass at all.

I wonder it's internalized misogyny. I worry I haven't explored my sexuality, so I couldn't know for sure. I worry I'll lose my hair, which for a girl, is already a little thin with anxiety. I worry I'll go from an average looking female to a bad looking transmale, and find I am still unhappy, and be trapped. I worry that my parents won't love me, and if i haven't been comfortable entering a relationship by now, I definitely won't then.

There is no way to promise what I look like, or how I'd feel. I feel trapped in between, but I know I'm not a they. I assume that, when you know you're trans, you know. The reservations aren't so severe. There isn't so much hesitation.

A few months ago I visited my father, and found a sketchbook in my basement from at least 7 years ago. It was from my most depressed state, and a page read ""I want to be a boy, I want to be a boy,"" over and over.

I want to be a boy, I've thought many times. ""I'm a boy"", never. 

I don't know if it's my upbringing, how my Mom made me feel like it was not ok when I told her at age 11 I liked boys and girls, how she pretends to be an 'allie' but asks stuff like if she's going to get a baby out of a test tube. 

For the summer, I'll be living in an apartment in the city for the first time. All my roomies will be lgbt, and one is going on T for the first time over these four months. I keep daydreaming... I could ask them for resources. Before my final year of college I could come back, with some hold on who I was. I'd have people around me who wouldn't be weird about it.

I really don't know. Maybe it just isn't my time yet.

sweetcrutons,asktransgender,Feeling sad for no reason,"I know that sometimes emotions can get overwhelming for us MtF people that go on hormones, but I don't know if this is that.

First, I'm not on HRT yet, except for taking 5mg Finastride daily for hair. (5mg instead of 1mg because the 5mg ones are cheaper and I'm too lazy to cut those tiny pills :p) so the only hormonal effect I have from meds is the minor anti-androgenic effect of Finastride.

Second, I started getting really emotional after I came out of the closet with my transgenderness even to the point that when I was on DIY and got emotional easily, it was nothing compared to how I reacted on things without any hormones and just being me and accepting it.

But now this has gone for a few days and I'm worried. I am usually pretty positive and even when depressed I have had a laugh and been upbeat (and not really completely faking it, either) but never like this.

I want to specifically talk about one of those imaginations (however, once I'm comfortable enough I will soooo talk about the other stuff) for me because I'm wondering If that is like the automatic indicator that says, ""Duh, you're a woman,"" or, ""maybe you're bigender or multi gender.""

My issues lies with my family.  Now, half of my family will definitely accept who she is, and be happy that she makes me happy.  But the rest, including my mother, I don't think ever will.  I'm not sure how to deal with this.  It certainly can't change how I feel for this woman, and it won't keep me from being with her.  But I love my family.  Unfortunately, even if they come to accept us being together, that she makes me happy, they won't accept her as her, they will always see her as the man she never was to begin with.  And I find that upsetting, as they won't be accepting the same person I'm falling in love with.  Should this bother me or should I be happy that they would even accept the relationship in that way?

She asked if I wanted it just kept between us, without telling my father (he's a nice man but often has a hard time empathizing). I told her that I'd prefer it just between us. I asked if I could see a gender therapist in order to figure out for sure whether I am or not. She's agreed to help, and she asked if I'd like to talk to her about it to see if she can directly help.

I'm happy that I've now got someone to help me figure this out. Except, now I need to find a therapist in Brisbane, Australia. I haven't a clue as to where to start looking for one. My mother thinks that we need to find a good therapist that knows how to work with adolescents, which is a great idea, but I don't know who to get.

Is there a list anywhere of how good the therapists in Brisbane are? I'd just like a good outcome out of this.

lost_melody,asktransgender,Two days ago I posted here saying I was too scared to buy women's clothes and received 70+ encouraging responses. Today I went to a store and bought a top with a built in bra.,"Thank you everyone. Although I didn't have the time to reply to all 70 comments I want you to know I did read through all of them many times! You have made this a very special day for me, I've bought my very first piece of female clothing, and spent my very first dollars on transitioning. Most importantly, my **depression which has lasted for years** has reduced significantly today. None of this is possible without your support. 

Heres a photo of me [wearing it]

[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4f5dhy/how_am_i_supposed_to_walk_into_a_clothing_store/) to original post if you're interested.

My experience at the store today:

I picked another store because Ive gone to the previous one three times already and I'm still afraid someone might recognise me.

Initially when I arrived I was very nervous but I kept repeating to myself all the things you've told me, so I went straight to the women's section on the third floor.

There was a special section that sells tops and camis with padded bras attached inside.  What I wanted to buy most was lingerie but of course I was not brave enough to do that, so anything with a built in bra was perfect for now.

So I walked there and held my phone up to chest level pretending I am buying for someone else. I was very aware of the situation around me, there were a lot of other customers (all female) and a young female assistant was standing quite close to me. I was on an emotional roller coaster all the while, going from very scared, to slightly convinced that no one cares, and then again to thinking someone is going to call the cops.

The most frightening moment was when the female assistant came up and asked if I needed help to clip a cami back onto the hanger. Obviously she's alarmed and has been keeping an eye on me since I arrived, but the clips were weirdly designed and combined with being nervous I had trouble clipping it on. I told her in my very masculine voice ""sorry yes please"". And she helped me with it. I felt like a fetishist and a pervert (so did she I think, she seemed startled by my very masculine voice) but am glad she took a few steps away and didn't say anything more afterwards.

I am an indecisive person and had been standing there choosing for more than 10 minutes, but right after she talked to me, my nervousness reached the highest point and I quickly picked one randomly and went to the cashier.
 
It was an XL sized top with a gender neutral colour. 
(still too afraid to pick camis or stereotypically feminine colours like pink)

I picked the largest size available because I remember a commenter told me ""everything looks bigger on the rack"" . After trying on at home it fits very comfortably and I love it but I think I could try a smaller size to look even better.

Anyway thank you everyone this was a very special day for me! You have proved to me nothing is impossible. Now I even think maybe one day I could really transition, after years of doubt!"
clgqtw,asktransgender,Literature with trans or non-binary characters,"I think this isn't the kind of question this sub seems to normally get, so I hope it's ok to ask here...

Does anyone know of any good books, comics or webcomics with trans or non-binary characters?  I'm really craving something where the not-cis-ness isn't the main focus of the plot, if that makes any sense.  Not a ""real life story"" where the character spends the entire book agonizing over gender.  Just a good book that happens to include non-cis folk or handles gender in a way unlike the way it's handled by the bulk of modern media.

I know about Ancillary Justice and The Left Hand of Darkness.  I've read Beyond Binary and some of the Tiptree award book collections.  [O Human Star](http://ohumanstar.com/comic/chapter-1-title-page/) is absolutely delightful (though unfinished).  [Validation](http://validationcomic.com) isn't exactly my cup of tea but it's not terrible (too ""real life"" for me).  Some other physical books I've read include: Distress by Greg Egan, Bone Dance by Emma Bull, the Inheritance trilogy by N. K. Jemisin, the three triolgies with the Fool by Robin Hobb and the Sandman comics.  I know the universe created for the Dragon Age video games includes a couple non-cis characters too (though I always debate bringing them up because video-game tie-in novels are *always* questionable).

So what else should I read? Please and thank you!"
HanaeN,asktransgender,Is there a way to help my parents get it?,"Heya Reddit, my name is Sophie and I'm a transitioning MtF. I'm struggling a bit with my parents and I'm not really sure how to get them to understand.

I came out to them last year, around September when I first wanted to start socially transitioning. The problem is, even now they won't use my new name or pronouns. They insist on either no name ( this isn't too bad ) or deadnaming me which makes me feel awful.

I've tried bringing it up a few times and I've heard some valid reasoning such as its hard to change etc, but recently I got told what I am expecting is minor and that it is just a sound. Have tried to explain that it is basically rejecting my new identity by refusing to try and adjust but no luck ):

The weird thing is they seem to tolerate and support the fact I'm doing this, I've had fashion tips, been spoilt a little with some gifts like makeup or dresses and they aren't against me bringing up the subject, being full time or medically transitioning. It's obvious they want me to be happy, but missing the point on this particular area.

So my question is have any of you had this problem? What kind of things can I try to help them adjust?

Thank you for reading,

AutumnFaeri,asktransgender,"Apparently I have body dysmorphia, according to a friend.","A friend of mine, who has completed a course in psychology, and is a trans woman herself, told me not a few days ago that I have body dysmorphia towards my facial features instead of dysphoria. 

I typically don't like my face, others usually do, and find me very feminine. I'll admit that I'm not the most unluckiest when it comes to genetics, I have a rather feminine hip figure, and I acknowledge that. 

I've been set on obtaining FFS ever since shortly I started HRT. I started saving up pretty early and even put up a fund, where I've made most of my money from... Granted I will try to pay back as much people as I can if I somehow change my mind, but I find that to be very unlikely.

Now this friend of mine, said that even if I do get FFS, I'll still dislike the way my face looks, and I'll see it different than it actually appears to be.

She told me that, even with my hair up and all that I still look feminine, whereas I think I look like some sort of grotesque masculine monster. 

As far as my passing goes, it typically works out... I haven't been called sir in atleast 5-6 months in public, only on the phone sometimes, when talking about my current legal documents of course. People call me ma'am with little hestitation, I even got asked out... twice, by two random guys and none of them had a weird look on their face when I told them I was a lesbian. (without, or barely any make up on my face) But I also raise my eyebrows a lot in public, usually a little bit though.

I do sense a lot of people generally look at me, but I have terrible social anxiety and I'm 6,1 with blue hair, so that could explain it. 

I've asked people whether or not my face looks really masculine, some say fem, some say andro, however most people who knew me before I started HRT, all point at my chin, and I've always hated my chin as long as I can remember. 

My friend also told me not to go to places like this, because she says they're very biased, which I agree with in some aspects. Transpassing is usually where they are biased. Because let's be real here, if you tell someone you're trans, most will start to look and point out things they would never do if you say you're cis, and somehow ''clock you''. 

So yeah, some of the places here are very biased and also go by extreme gender conformity and conventional attractiveness. 

Anyway, I've gotten a bunch of pics together of my face. Most of the time, I can find it plausable that I somehow pass, but more as a masculine looking cis woman. But when I put my hair up, lower my eyebrows, I just can't stand it.

What I want done for FFS is, obviously my chin, my brow ridge/bone/eyebrows, my lips, hairline and nose potentially. Some might not be required instantly because I always wear my hair down and have bangs, but all would be nice if I had the money.

I know that if I ask an actual FFS consultant, and they'll obviously want more money from me and try to make me think that I need more done than I think, because they're generally very heavy on conventional attractiveness and forget that not all women look perfectly ''female''.

Anyway, here are the pics, sorry about the long message.

I have a tendency to look up women and wish that i had there bodies and wish that i looked like them. Now i read this back to myself it seems 'obvious' that i'm maybe trans but i just don't see it.

I get rather jealous this time of year as i see women around in tight clothing with there bodies, does this mean i might want to be those women? I honestly wish there was just some kind of test that i could take that would just tell me a straight yes or no.

I struggle alot with dealing with big decisions especially ones that are as permanent as this. I know that i would rather have been assigned female at birth and as an experiment i have asked cis people 'if you could have chosen to be the other gender then would you' then most of them said no.

This should obviously clearly indicate to me that i more then likely trans, but no. I cannot afford therapy at the minute or that would be my first move. 

If you want to know more the please ask. Do i even sound like i am even gender dysphoric? Do even sound like i could be a transgender/transsexual person or am i jusy being a stupid cis guy in some kind of delusion?"

But, here in the real world, I'm a very heavy afab woman with big breasts. I can't ever present the way I want to, no matter what I did -- T would make my unhappiness worse because it would give me facial hair and my ""ideal person"" is extremely feminine and doesn't have any facial or body hair, and even if I were to have top surgery, I'd just look like a flat chested fat woman. I have no interest in looking like that, or in presenting as the type of trans man that could be crafted out of my actual body. Basically, I can ""dress up"" like my ideal self, like a bad Halloween costume, and get the style elements, but people will still see a fat lady in bright colors, not the person I want them to see :/

Does it mean that I'm not really trans, because I'm not willing to accept any appearance as long as I read as male? Does it put it in the realm of ""nazel-gazing/head in the clouds"" stupidity? "

I also have a lot of gray hair that was not zapped with laser so I don't have any other options but to go see her.... ugh. Has anyone had any luck with having insurance pay for this?

katie-elizabeth,asktransgender,Do you think the American Family Association is projecting their own pedophilia onto others?,"*“Everybody knows it’s wrong for men to use the same bathrooms and fitting rooms with little girls,” Wildmon told me. “Target has decided they don’t care about the vast majority.

Let's take this all the way: what if there was no gender at all associated with bathrooms and everyone used the same one?  What do you imagine would happen?  Do you think it's a normal thought to be preoccupied with what a small girl does in the bathroom?  Are you aware that millions of fathers help their daughters in the bathroom every day with no instances of abuse?  My question to Mr. Wildmon would be, ""Are **you** in fact preoccupied with such thoughts to the point where you are projecting that guilt onto others?""  
  
Because I sure as hell know I have no interest or worry about this issue at all.  I just want to use the bathroom in peace.  My counter-issue to these people would be that a normal person does not spend hours thinking up fantasy scenarios about men trying to gain access to young girls.  *That's the creepy part, and it has nothing to do with us.*  "
caitlynjconklin,asktransgender,Transgender and primary care at Mount Sinai on 14th St. in NYC,"Hi,

I'm interested in transfering my medical care to Mount Sinai at 226 W 14th Street in NYC. For over a year, I have been going to Callen-Lorde for my HRT and primary care. I'm tired of the long wait times to get medical appointments and to see doctors there. Also, I'm looking to a find a doctor who has knowledge about and has experience with diabetes care. I'm a transwoman, and Type 1.5 diabetic. Therefore, I'm looking for other LGBTQ friendly places for my medical care as alternatives to Callen Lorde. Does Mount Sinai generally have shorter wait times to meet with doctors? Can anyone recommend a particular doctor there? I'm in the process of switching over my health insurance from Fidelis to HealthFirst.

Sincerely,

DaltonHex,asktransgender,Am I gender dysphoric?,"I don't know if I am gender dysphoric. I don't hate my body but I would rather have been female at birth. I don't mind my male body in the least but when I measure my measurements and when they are of the average female, I like it. Are these really things that a cis guy would want.

I have been Googling very curvy celebrities and when I see there bodies I save there pictures to my photo gallery and every couple of hours I go back and look at them. Why do I do this?

I even look up cosmetic procedures that I can get to get a body like the women in these pictures. But then when I start on thinking about my transition I get scared and I don't know if I want to do it. I remember all the bad things people said that I will regret it, that I'm not really trans, that I'm irrational, that i don't know what I want, etc.

A seed has been planted in my head and now I believe that if I medically transition I would regret it. I don't mind having a male body, but for some reason I get so jealous of women when they get attention from men. Is it because I want to be the woman getting the attention?

I always say to myself if I don't mind having a male body then why is there any need for me to transition. And this what always gets me. 

If you were in my place, would you go on HRT?

caitlynjconklin,asktransgender,Genital electrolysis for SRS,"Hello,

On April 1st, I had an informative vaginoplasty consultation at Mount Sinai in NYC with Dr. Jess Ting, who recently trained and performed his first vaginoplasty under Dr. Bowers. While examining me, Dr. Ting was astonished that I don't have a lot of hair down there. (I've never had genital electrolysis before.) Moreover, I seldom shave and trim because I have very sensitive skin and develop red bumps, after shaving. I'm surprised that Dr. Ting said I only need one session of electrolysis before GRS. Has anyone else had a surgeon recommend only one electrolysis session for vaginoplasty? Dr Ting's recommendation of one electrolysis session in my case is somewhat comforting as I'm worried about getting electrolysis because I have a low pain threshold. That said, having vaginoplasty is a very important life enriching procedure for me. I hope that I can aclimate myself to the pain of electrolysis. I will be getting the electrolysis done at Mount Sinai.

Sincerely,

Caitlyn

Laouadiva,asktransgender,Waiting list...,"Hi everyone,

never posted here before but thought it would be a great way to start learning a little more. About 3 months ago I went to my GP and got a referral for gender therapy (in the UK). Doctor said it would take a couple months to get a response. Time passed and I started to grow impatient. Phoned up today and have been told that the waiting list for even just a consultation is 12 months. I can't get seen till a fucking year from now. I'm pre-everything and not out. I guess I'm just really dissapointed because I'd been getting excited about finishing uni and starting my journey. How have you guys dealt with this sort of thing, are there any other options? I knew it would take time but I'd honestly thought I could be living openly by around november. I don't really feel comfortable starting to present without the support of medication. I'm 21.

CharlieThePaperLady,asktransgender,Hey! I'd need help choosing a FFS surgeon... I'm really lost in this subject,"/Wall of text inc/

My parents have agreed to help pay for FFS, and adding their help to my own savings I should be able to afford it. If not, wait until after this summer and I'll be set.

But that means I have to really start looking for a surgeon and stuff: I'm working this summer so no possibility of having a break for post-surgery recovery, and this autumn is my last semester of school before Uni. Since I'm finishing just before the winter holidays, I'll have to wait until the next autumn to start Uni.

That means I have a perfect time for surgery this next winter: no school and no work :D

But since this is so close (like, around 9 months from now), I have to choose and meet surgeons and stuff. And I'm really, really lost as to who to go with

I live in Quebec, so that means I have two surgeons right next to me (Brassard and Bensimon)

I have also looked online for the US surgeons and saw that Zukowski and Spiegel seem to be respected for their work.

I'd rather do the surgery close to home though, as the staff speaking French would be a lot less stressful for me and because my friends could come visit me after the surgery.

So, what are your opinions on Brassard's FFS? I've seen a lot of talk about him for his GRS, but almost none for his FFS. If you could give me your opinions of Zukowski and Spiegel, that would be great too! I'm personnally against going with Bensimon as of all of his results that I have seen only ONE was acceptable in my book, whereas all the other surgeons had consistent good results (but then again, that's my opinion). So if someone has gone with Bensimon and has had good results, please tell me as his prices seem to be pretty competitive.

And if you have any other surgeon to recommend, to tell!

If it can help, I'm looking for fixing my nose and brow, and possibly a small area of my chin, but not much more. I don't know if some surgeons are better for these surgeries either &gt;_&lt;

I guess I worry because even though I just started 2 months ago I look identical to my former self before HRT which makes me think it's not working...

Also maybe someone could clear this notion up...I'm not cerrently at my target weight. Do I have to loose all the ""male"" fat before I will see changes in HRT? Will I have to re gain weight or will it just shift over time even if I stay at the low weight.

SecretOfficerNeko,asktransgender,So I guess I have to change my flairs now. A few questions. xD,"So today, after waiting 2 hours at the pharmacy, I was able to get my hormones, and take the first dose of my transition. I'm so happy! I've been working at this since November of last year, an just finally got everything set up. Now I just have to change all my flairs around.

With that said, I had a few questions. For context, I take my hormones in two doses (on morning one night), each of 0.5mg Estradiol and 50mg Spirolatone, 1mg E and 100mg S every day. I'm supposed to take each dose around 12 hours a part.

Here are my questions. I'd ask my doctor, but their offices are closed:
1) Because of the long wait, I was unable to take my hormones at a time where I would likely have to take them in my daily life (11am instead of 7-8am). I was wondering if there were any negative consequences of taking my hormones at 11pm, and then immediately switching to my new 7am schedule.
2) Should I just stick to every 12 hours, so 7am, 7pm, 7am, and so on, or can I vary it a little. Ideally, I'd have something along the lines of 7am, 9pm, but I can definitely adjust to a 12 hour cycle.
3) If I oversleep, or miss a time, what are my best options. If I say, sleep until 8am instead of 7am, should I still take my dose at 7pm, or move that up until 8pm, and if I move up to 8pm should I wait until 8am to take my next dose.

I'm just really confused with the time stuffs, and any help is appreciated."

SausageToBun,asktransgender,Can I talk to someone please? : Many questions!,"I hope this ok to post here, but I don't really know where else to turn...

Sorry for the long read as this is a bit of a confessional, but I really need someone to talk to.

Ok some background: I'm a 24 yo Male with a partner (24F), I have  a very good relationship with my parents and they're fairly open minded.
I've never been overtly masculine and so I so throughout school I was accused of being gay by close-minded Neanderthals (you know the sort I'm talking about).
I've never been in denial about my sexual attractions, I'll comfortably openly discuss the attractiveness of men and women alike, though (currently being male) I have no interest in M-M intimacy.

I openly discuss gender and sexuality with my partner and although she would consider herself bi when it comes to attraction, though she doesn't consider herself as ""out"" as she has never had a female partner and doesn't publicly express her female attractions.

I have always enjoyed more genuine and emotional (not pervy and excessive) lesbian (especially POV when I can find it) pornography.
More and more though, I have been exploring more M-F female POV clips, though a lot of it is off-putting where the man is going at it like a dog on heat...

Anyway, I've been opening up to fantasies of being penetrated by a man as a female.

I have openly discussed with many of my friends that I often feel like a ""male lesbian"" though it's often brushed off with a chuckle and many joke that in ten years I'm going to turn up to a reunion as a woman but I don't think any of them would imagine that I have given it any serious thought.

My partner being quite open is happy in taking a more dominant/male position but more often than not my penis is the last thing I think about and I imagine I'd be just as happy with a vagina and a strap-on (for me that is).

I definitely want children with my current partner and one of the questions I've not been able to find and answer to is post-hormone pre-orchidectomy fertility?
I'm quite comfortable in presenting as a not overly masculine male and I think my elderly grandparents and my partner's parents would prefer this to stay the same, not because they're closed minded but rather because I wouldn't want to put them through the turmoil.

I I'm not overly attached to my penis, but generally I'm fairly utilitarian and so I'm more attached to it's (and as a result my) ability of being able to make (or at least start the process) babies with my female partner.

One of my main thoughts is that I'd be quite happy to physiologically transition but keep my public (government recognised) identity as male and then present as male/female as and when I wish.
Essentially, I am happy with retaining my male identity but I would like the freedom to also present as female.
I don't even know if gender reassignment is available on the NHS (oh yeah, I'm in the UK) or whether I'd be offered treatment if I weren't overtly presenting as female.

And to be honest, I've been able to find so few details about gender reassignments carried out in the UK, I have no idea what it'll look like and whether it'll just look like a dog's dinner :-/ . I know you probably get loads of perverts asking, but if anyone would be willing to share what your new bits feel and look like (especially from UK surgeons) I would unendingly appreciate it!

TLDR: I'm very confused, people have told me if I'm having these sorts of thoughts, I should find some kindred spirits to talk to."
MoonlightCrab,asktransgender,"Sorry if you get this post a lot, but I'm confused if I'm trans or not.","Now, my apologies for what is probably a redundant post, but I've been really confused for two years now. Pardon me as well because i suck at writing. A little background on me, I am fifteen years old, almost sixteen and currently a sophomore I'm high school. I was born as a male, I guess, but I've felt for a long time I'd be happier as a female. While that may sound like proof that I'm trans, I worry everyday that I might be faking it in some way.

I've only really accepted that I might be trans at the start of my high school career, but before that I used to fantasize about being a girl since the start of middle school, I'm afraid that since that was close to the start of puberty for me that this might be some weird fetish. I've also been afraid about possibly wanting to be trans because I simply don't like myself, and find myself uninteresting. Like, maybe being trans is a way to make myself unique? Though if I worry I'm not something, that means I really want to be that something, yknow? I've also never really hated my body, but that could be because puberty spared me and gave me decently feminine features. I've always been kinda meek and not a fan of making big decisions, so I want to be 100% sure I'm trans.

I feel I have a lot in favor of me being trans, such as occasionally acting girly and posing a lot when I was young , I even have some pictures of that time. I've also crossdressed before, and I found it to be very enjoyable, it also gave me a confidence boost! On many online forums, I say I'm female, and it really makes me feel like myself, while when I say I'm male I don't feel bad, just empty. Also, when I envision myself in the future,  I can't see past 18 as a male, but I can see myself being old as a female. But even with these supporting facts, I can't fully accept myself. I think I really know that the answer is yes, but I can't accept myself for some reason. High school is a very confusing time. x_x

Sorry for the text wall, I feel like I may have missed some facts as well. I don't really know if I got across what I wanted to, but I needed to say it somewhere. I have an (online) friend that I talk to about these issue to, but I felt like I should ask here as well!

MumbaiConfusion,asktransgender,Am I really transgender if I don't experience any social dysphoria,"Hi guys,  

I'm 19 years old and born male. However, since my earliest days I've spent a lot of time desiring to get to experience life the way girls experience it. When I was 6 years old I tried out for a part in a play specifically because that character wore female attire; when I didn't get the part I was so devastated that my mum still talks about it to this day.  

Then, when I was 9 years old I first began wearing my sisters clothes secretly, and I absolutely loved it. After that I began to dream about being a grown woman and just doing mundane things like going about life. Eventually, at age 14 my gender issues began to consume me, and I first identified as transgender.  

To this day, my body dysphoria sucks. I hate every masculine aspect about my body - it depresses the shit out of me. I really want to get on HRT and stop my body from further masculinizing.  

However, I really don't have any social dyphoria about my gender. I don't care what other people call me, or how other people perceive me. All I want to be seen as is a person - my gender is irrelevant in this aspect of life to me.  

Now, I know you'll probably say that you don't need to be socially dysphoric to be transgender. But when you think about it, is my situation really any different from other non-transgender people who are upset about the way their body looks? What if I'm just a guy who really wants a feminine body?"

TransClusterhead,asktransgender,I probably can't start transition...,"So, for context, 24, pre-MTF (hopefully), I've been consulting with Dr Webberley about my pre-existing conditions and medications in relation to transition, and the severity of the conditions meant she said that, understandably, a letter from my neurologist would be needed to state he was comfortable with transition before she would proceed. Thinking about it in more detail, however, I don't think it's likely he will agree, because the two conditions interact with each other and I'm a complex case. It would require a substantial change to my medications, that takes time and is a worse outcome if it goes wrong than not transitioning (because estriadol interacts negatively with at least one of my medications, and I have contemplated suicide over the severity of the condition when it was untreated, whereas my gender identity has never given me that, only feelings of confusion/disorientation).

1) I didn't have any issues or anxieties during puberty. None at all, I found people expecting me to do so somewhat silly. From the trans people I know or follow on the internet, nearly all said they had fairly miserable experiences of puberty.

2)I have a beard, and a very deep voice and during parts of my life I've been proud of both. This just doesn't seem to sit easily with the idea some suppressed disconnect between mind and body. Now I suspect the beard is somewhat just another result of just the reduction in care for personal maintenance which sometimes comes alongside depression.

3)The periods where I'm really sure about me being born in the wrong body coincide with my deepest periods of mental illness. Why should I listen to discomfort with my body brought on by depression any more than my mind telling me I'm a repulsive worthless, lying, cunt? The only real rebuttal to this I can find is not all the focus I have is upon hating being male, the more positive elements where I recognise some of the elements of femininity which I feel more akin to.

4)Of my flaws one of the most prevalent would be my infantile over-focus on earning the attentional and approval/sympathy of others,(I recognise the irony of asking a collection of people for advice and therefore attention). To a degree where I have lied before and will again in moments of weakness to feed my ego. I can't but wonder if this is my brain just conjuring a new way with which I can become a, ""special snowflake."" 

Or if I'm simply seeking desperately any way to change from being the, ""me,"" which I hate so much.

Just lots of doubts pushing me against my instincts at the moment and wondered if any of you had any similar experiences?

dani_i90,asktransgender,why me? TW,"so, i'm trans i doesnt have any problem with that i'm proud and i going to stand tall to being my self, but. i dont know from my family in about 3 years, my only real family it was my father his partner and my brother(my mother dia while i was a todler), they leave the city with the excuse of finding a better job, i dont hear from them never more, i was left in first year of college alone, two weeks later i have to return the house where we leave since nobody was paying the ren,t i had to find a job an quit the college. i survive for 4 years until now, i'm old (26) with no carrer, no stable job because i dont hide my transness (even when i'm still presenting as a male for survival reasons, and no money for HRT or anything)  and now with no home i have been living in a ""friends"" room for about a year i started to prostitute my self, and now i'm tired. i'm writting this while for firt time considering suicide even when i know its not the solution, i really dont know what to do. i even consider making a kickstar pledge for finishing my carrer, like a hail mary or something. so my question its why me, i hate being trans, being trans leaves me with no family, no carrer, no job, no self esteem and no life worth to live. i, sorry. "
Notrustanymore,asktransgender,What am I suppose to do!!!,"I live in Canada, and since the age of 18 have been trying to get on HRT. Ask several family doctors to help, out. Had one say he called up doctor riess for me. I called every couple of months to be told to be patient. 

Then it turns out, he never made the fucking call. I had to learn this by calling doctor riesses building two years later.

Ok, put myself on the waiting list again. And waited, and waited and got committed twice for trying to commit suicide. 22, Still nothing. Start seeing fucking rip off artists in Calgary that will put you on HRT if you could afford it. But about 1500$ a month. Puts me on the fucking streets. Can't get any work offered to me other than blowing people(I'll blow my brains out before I blow anybody).

On the street, been off Spiro and entrace for six months, and no one wants to fucking help.

Five fucking years just to decide to kill myself. Thanks Canada. "

ekarp,asktransgender,Why?,"These are all genuine questions, so if I offend anyone I'm sorry, that was not my intention, I'm honestly just curious as to the responses I'll get.

Why do some people become transgender and then complain about being oppressed, and if your answer is ""they feel like they're trans so that is what they identify as"", than why is it better to be a trans than being homosexual? Saying this I know you feel more comfortable as the opposite gender, but does that really make it a better alternative to just being gay or lesbian? Plus, if trans people are oppressed, wouldn't it make sense to wait until the whole thing dies down to have a surgery?"

nothingyoucando2,asktransgender,Things I wish I did differently in transition:,"Maybe this will help someone just starting, IDK.

I wish:

I took some ""me"" time before integrating into the local trans community

I took some time to be with myself while presenting male instead of just presenting female right away and seeing how stressful that is.

I had been a tad bit more pragmatic and little less idealistic, as painful as that is.

I TOOK IT SLOW AND PATIENTLY****

I wish that I kept my E dosages steady, rather than fucking with them too much in the first year. Varying hormones appear to be worse for you than just a steady dose, even if it's low. 

I wish I did my FFS in steps and went to one surgeon for my forehead, then another for my chin, then another for my nose, rather than putting myself in the hands of one person who appears to be rushing through surgeries because of the uptick in trans people coming out. My friend did it in stages and her face is FLAWLESS.

I wish I didn't date anyone. My instincts were pretty good about telling me who to avoid, who had pain that might interfere with my transition, but I started dating this guy who I suspect is a closeted trans woman in a TON of pain and they were really stressful. That relationship really drained me of the energy I NEEDED for my transition and almost killed me, luckily I had support.

I wish I hadn't expected HRT to do much, but wished for the best. I'd rather be surprised than disappointed.

I wish I got a job as a male, grew my hair out, and then slowly came out at work. I still haven't gotten a job as a transgender person. The only reason I have an apartment is because I got it as a male.

I wish I did more research.

I wish I slowed down and sat with my emotions more, with my pain, with my sorrow, with my grief, with my anger, rather than thinking that transition was going to fix these emotions for me. No matter how well your transition goes, you still need to do the emotional inner work all on your own and if you don't, it can really interfere with your thinking and stress levels. 

I wish I trusted my instincts more, even the little things that may have seemed trivial. Why not just listen to yourself?

I wish I was a little bit more aware of how women treat one another/trans women.

I wish I came to some realizations before transition (like, it doesn't matter if other people think they're better than you, let them think that... they aren't *actually* better than you, we're all just doing our best). 

I wish I was a little bit more cautious listening to other trans women on the internet (I see the irony here).

I wish I did more research on the local neighborhoods in the city I moved to, rather than assuming that because it was a trans-friendly city overall that every neighborhood would be O-K (they aren't, the one I'm in sucks).  

I wish I banked my sperm and then just got an orchiectomy. AAs suck, I've tried all of them and they all have shitty sides.

Basically, I just wish I slowed down a bit, took my time, let my hair grow, did some internal emotional work, and listened to my instincts. 


Hope this helps someone!

romeonohomeo,asktransgender,Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm making a mistake.,"I get this weird anti-dysphoria sometimes where I think ""maybe I'm making a mistake maybe I'm not trans"" because as of late I've been trying to think less about gender. I'm currently pre-op and pre-T but I do want to get top surgery and go on hormones if I can. Sometimes I don't feel male and think that being trans was a phase and other days I know I could never be comfortable as a girl. I don't like the world seeing me as a girl, but I do like being seen as a boy. Maybe I'm some type of genderfluid? I don't know. Labels are hard. Gender is hard. "
Ringhal,asktransgender,Anal experimentation,Hi I'm a mtf and I have per my therapist's suggestion starting experimenting with inserting small diameter objects in my  butt. Last I got something all the  way  in and masturbated a little. When I was  done I farted what seemed a rather large  clump bloody something and had to wipe about 5 times to clean up more watery blood. Should I be concerned?
beabettermetoday,asktransgender,Where can I learn more about other people who don't experience dysphoria or who still struggle with gender roles and expectations?,"I'm 26 and started questioning things in high school; it was around 18 that I felt I had a handle on who I was, and that who I was wasn't a man. 

I feel that I've lived my entire life playing a role, trying to live up to standards that, if things were how they should be, wouldn't be for me at all.  Sometimes, 26 years in, I feel like sometimes I fall into the role even when I shouldn't, and sometimes I feel I've been too immersed to know how to behave outside of it.

Sometimes my partner tells me that she has trouble relating to me because I was raised as a boy and live so much of my life that way, that sometimes the things I say or do are hard to reconcile with my femininity now.  The fact that my feelings of dysphoria manifest as longing, depression, hopelessness rather than disgust or rejection of my body as it stands introduces another stumbling block; sometimes she asks why I would want to lose the benefits of being a man if it doesn't hurt.  I don't know what to say other than ""because it isn't me.""

I'm just looking for things to read from people who have dealt with similar things?  Struggling to fit expectations of their gender roles or questions about the validity of their gender, etc.  I know that I have some habits and stuff that carry over from living my life on the wrong side of the line and I want to lose them, but does it reflect badly on me that I've picked them up at all?

Talvi7,asktransgender,About genitalia in MtF hormone treatment,"I've recently decided that I want to transition and take hormones so I can be a female. The thing is, even if I love everything femenine and I would kill to be a girl, the only thing I love about my masculinity is my penis, and I want to keep it.

I've researched about this and about all the effects the estrogen does to the male genitalia and I'm kind of concerned. No more semen? Difficulties having or keeping an erection? Less sex drive? (which I don't know if that's actually bad because I ALWAYS want to have sex)

I know and love many transexual porn actresses who don't seem to have trouble and even have big dicks. How natural is their sex? Do they even take hormones? Do they use viagra? Is their semen fake? 

This is the only concern I have and these answers will probably be my final decision about the transition."
imlostinmyhead,asktransgender,"To those who have completed transition/stealth, does your voice ever just ""stick"" and stop being an effort?","So I'm still pre-everything MtF, but I know that nothing about our transition inherently changes our voice, unlike how T can deepen an FtMs voice. However, while I can pull off a fairly convincing female voice, I have to attempt it, and it's too easy to relax and fall back into my ""standard"" talking voice (which is in the upper middle of the standard male range).

Does there come a point after going full time that it falls into muscle memory and just becomes your standard relaxed tone, or is it a conscious effort for the rest of your life?  If it does go into muscle memory, do you then have to make a concerted effort to speak in your old voice if desired? 

Thank you all, you absolutely lovely people :)"
autumnnora,asktransgender,What's causing this resurgence of dark body hair?,"Hey all,

Over the past month or so I feel like I've regressed a bit in my HRT progress. I had seen significant body hair reduction and was having decent breast development. Unfortunately, I've suddenly had a resurgence of dark hairs over my entire body (pre-HRT I was very hairy). It's causing me a ton of renewed dysphoria and I'm not really sure what to do.

I've been on HRT for around 1.5 years. Dosage for most of the time has been 200mg spiro and 5mg estradiol per day (half in morning, half in evening).

I had my levels checked by my doctor, as my first suspicion was that I had adapted to the spiro or something. There was no shift in my T levels (low teens) and my prolactin levels have remained steady. My doctor has never done a specific test for E and my understanding is that generally that's not necessary.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any suggestions for how I can identify the problem or things I could try?"

throwaw543210,asktransgender,Question About Going to the Dentist,"So I have to go to the dentist for a regular checkup in a few days. Nothing besides a teeth cleaning basically.

Anyways, I know you're supposed to disclose drugs to the dentist, but I don't see how Estradiol is relevant to a dental cleaning. I really don't want to tell my dentist anything as I've known him and many of the staff for years now and I'm not ready to come out.

I'm not on Spiro yet. I was considering starting in the next day or two, but then I realized that could be problematic because of the Potassium issue. For instance, the dentist might be using a lot of K in the tooth polish stuff, which might be bad.

Anyways, does anyone know if Spiro (or Estradiol) causes any issues for a regular tooth cleaning? I'm thinking of just waiting to start Spiro in a week instead and avoid the issue altogether, but I really don't want to wait that long."
KatherineDuskfire,asktransgender,Poem I wrote dealing with depression.,"I've been dealing depression some. Just wanted to share. My therapist recommended I share this with some people. 



Alone here with my thoughts I sit.

They berate me and insult me.

Why does my inner dialog hate me so?

But I say I do not hate myself.

So is it me or some demon!

Am I possessed by some evil who tortures me all day and all night.

Is this why I have lost vision and never dream?

----

This my Demon.

I created it when I didn't believe in myself.

I let it control me.

I let fears and worries build.

I never showed them and let them out.

I had to be strong.

But by doing so IT grew stronger as well.

Every micro-aggression I internalized,

and it fed. Oh how it fed.

------

It would feed on my fears

My anger

My frustration

Then it causes self doubt

and self worry.

Which then makes me feed it more.


-----


So this Demon of mine.

I know what you are.

You are me, but I am you.

I am in control.

Be afraid for I will be stronger than you.

I am not going to let you control me any longer.

There maybe days that you have the upper hand.

Guess what, those days will be numbered and soon,

You shall be sent back to oblivion, the void.


------


I have already fought through so much.

I thought I had conquered my personal demons.

But when one is removed another manifests.

Healing takes time to purge out every plague of the body

I am not going to let IT get in my way.

So be gone, and let me believe in myself."

DisposableTGirl,asktransgender,"My pains, let me show you them","My transition has been going for a few years now, I've been on HRT for two and legally full time and living as female for one. 

I think I pass and blend in? I live in a rather conservative area and I haven't been harassed yet.  People always seem to use female pronouns for me. They tell me I'm attractive, that they like my voice. Frequently they compliment me on stuff from my shoes to purse to hair.

And I feel like shit warmed over. I have difficulty seeing what they do. I feel like a god damn freak. I'm rapidly approaching middle age, well past when hormones are most effective. My chest is pathetic, I barely clear an A-cup and have to stuff my bra to have anything at all. I still have to shave everyday, and that shadow never goes away. I've got damage from acne and years of what testosterone did me. I'm lucky I have my own hair, but it's thinning on top. I definitely have male brow bossing and my Adams apple isn't exactly tiny either. Nor is what I have to tuck, which drastically complicates what I can wear. So I can push the anxiety away for a while, delude myself into thinking people can't see this shit, but it always catches up to me in a day or two. And it wrecks me.

My transition has cost me nearly everyone in my life - my spouse, my family, my friends. And I'm struggling to make new ones. It's very lonely. My only support is coming here and a small group of local trans people I barely know. And I can't even see them anymore because my work schedule conflicts with their meeting. While I do have a therapist, 'm not sure she's helping and I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep affording to see her. 

So I meet guys on dating sites. All they want to do is fuck me, or worse have me fuck them. I've hooked up with a few of the former. It occasionally ends in me in tears on the drive home. At times I feel little more than an attractive fuck toy. It's not as cool as it sounds. Not sure if people should believe the marking hype. 

I work a barely above minimum wage job with shitty hours. I struggle to afford things like clothes and cosmetics and my wardrobe is pathetic and barely functional.  I can't afford my medical bills. No laser or electrolysis. No FFS or BA. No GRS. Just doctors visits, blood work, meds, and non-trans related care. The bare fucking minimum, and I'm struggling to afford it. I have little hope of ever seeing anything else on that list. 

I'm at the point of considering illegal or questionable activities to get by - camming. escorting. dealing pot. I don't know how else to get out from under, though it's not like I know how to start whoring myself out either. I just can't make things work. I can't get out and it's crushing me to death. 

It's hard not to feel like transition has ruined and destroyed my life. 

It's hard not to want to go get the gun and just end this farce like I'm supposed to. 

It hurts so much and I don't know what else to do."

isabellethrow,asktransgender,Has anyone had success banking sperm while already on anti-androgens?,"I started on cyproterone acetate about a month ago, and at the time I knew it would be a good idea to bank sperm before starting on it... But I was so excited to get started that I just thought 'fuck it'. Anyway, the problem now is that I *do* want to bank sperm, but obviously I need my sperm to be swimming for that to be worthwhile. My endo reckons it takes 3 months off anti-androgens to fully start producing sperm properly again (if you're not permanently infertile), and going off them for 3 months would just kill me.

So I'm wondering whether anyone has any knowledge or experience with banking sperm while already on anti-androgens. I'm aware that this will be a bit case-by-case but is 1 month long enough to kill your fertility completely? Worst case scenario I will go off them for 3 months and get it done, but I'd prefer not to obviously.

moon_priestess,asktransgender,Dr. Gary Alter for MTF SRS: Any experiences?,"Greetings, all!

I recently reached out to Dr. Alter to set up a consultation. He's asking $500 just for the consultation and said the cost of the procedure can be *up to $75,000*. I've never heard of such a high cost for SRS so I was very taken aback.

There is a chance my insurance would allow me to afford him if he is truly a wonderfully marvelous surgeon, but I haven't been able to find much evidence that he's any better than the others. I'm also not willing to drop $500 just for a chance to see recent examples of his work.

Boob-a-saurus-Rex,asktransgender,So today was interesting.,"I had the doctors appointment today and I was right. He had no idea what to do. So he rushed through a physical and prescribed me 9 months of Spiro and E. I was out in less than 20 minutes.

And he referred to us as trangenders. So I was irritated the whole time. Cuz I couldn't tell if he was bigoted or just ignorant. Though he was a little flustered, and not rude or anything

But whatever, I got a prescription for 9 months of stuff. That's crazy. I just have to go to the pharmacy every month. I don't have to see him anymore. Hopefully he doesn't rescind it or whatever.

Mimiopins,asktransgender,How do I destroy this analogy of my mother's?,"Basically, to give context my mother doesn't think I'm feminine enough and fears for my safety so won't let me present female in sixth form (kind of like post 16 high school) even though I have the protection of a wide group of supportive friends.

One thing she says is that teenagers go through phases, and true it is a very volatile time of neural development, and she appreciates I'm having a hard time and hate my body. That being said, the analogy she uses pisses me off.

She compares it to going through a gothic phase. She says that a teenager who is going through one believes they are a goth whole heartedly and that they hate all non gothic things and then when they grow up and mature, they become normal people. I think that's a bad description of goth culture in and of itself, but oh well.

So how can I disprove this and legitamise my struggles to her? I'm not very feminine however I've always fantasised of being female and have felt harsh dysphoria since beginning puberty, and I don't think I can take another year of presenting male.

Thanks. 




Edit: thanks for your responses, they all sound like a good idea and I definitely want blockers. I should mention I have exams until the end of June so I'll wait til then to bring it up; don't need conflict in the house. That and getting blockers will be a living hell as I'll have to fight the godless bureaucracy that is the NHS. Thanks once again

horriblekids,asktransgender,"Has anyone else had to put a pause on their transition and then picked it back up again years later? I want to, but scared it's too late.","So to make a long story short: I came out at 16, started transitioning at 17, had a really long uphill battle for about a year before starting T thanks to living in a really conservative, rural area and getting bounced between doctors before finding someone who would prescribe for me. Was on T for about a year before I stopped being able to travel to my endo appointments the summer I turned 19 due to abusive parents preventing me from traveling. (Toronto, during the G20 conference and ensuing riots FYI. My endo was on the opposite side of the city.)

Basically I had to make a choice: either stay with my parents and be financially stable but emotionally devastated and forced back into the closet lest I ""embarrass"" my mother, or be too broke to afford hormones and lose my health insurance and live happily. It took everything I had, but I got out of that g-d town and spent a year and change finding my way.

I got married at 20, wasn't expecting to fall in love but I did, and then the next 3 years were just us surviving as money was still super tight. All told I haven't been on T in about 4 years now and we're finally in a position to be able to pay for prescription meds out of pocket again. I feel like I'm in limbo and I feel a bit hopeless about it all... This isn't where I saw my life going when I turn 25 and if I had known I would be off T and still haven't had top surgery at almost 25 I would have made entirely different choices in life. I guess I feel lucky that T changed enough stuff for me early on that I generally pass as male, but being misgendered frequently enough that it's devastating each time it happens. 

I want to go back on T, but I'm scared it's too late. I'm scared it won't change anything and that I'm going to be stuck looking and feeling like this forever. I've also built up this whole toxic idea in my head that my wife is going to leave me if I go back on T or have surgery, and I'm aware that it's totally in my head and something I need to work through but the fear is still there. There's just that voice in the back of my head nagging me saying that the only reason she stays is because of my body... It's really starting to cause problems in my marriage though because I've been neglecting my hygiene on top of everything to avoid the inevitable dysphoria that comes with showering and just, like, acknowledging that I have a body. 

Obviously I know I need to do something... I'm just afraid it's totally hopeless and I'm struggling with a weird feeling of finality. Part of it is that I'm scared this will totally alienate me from my already estranged family, part of it is that I'm (irrationally) scared my wife will leave me. I'm scared I messed up my body by going off T at all and that it won't have any effect or that I'm too old or something... but every day the calendar creeps closer to 25 and I don't think I can live like this anymore.

Has anyone else had to go through something similar or had to pause their transition for similar reasons? I'd really like to hear from people who've been in this position so I don't end up convincing myself this is totally hopeless."
purplepariahhood,asktransgender,How long should I wait to test levels with new dosage/method?,"The doc is perfectly comfortable testing my levels once every 3 months, and I can understand that. However, she's really letting me drive my HRT, and I sort of *need* to figure out a correct method/dosage in the next few months (before September, at the very latest).

 I got my first injection on the 8th, and I want to know as soon as possible if I need to change the dosage. When can I test my levels to see if I need to change it? I was planning to do it in ~2.5 weeks, or the middle of my 4th week on injections, but I'm not sure when the levels stabilize. If I could take it this next week, I would, but I just guessed a month.

*HRT history, in case it matters:*

I started a very small amount of Spiro/sublingual E this last January to test for issues, and moved up to a full dosage (100mg Spiro, 4mg E) in the middle of February. I asked to be tested around 3 weeks ago, and turned out that I had low free T (6.2 pg/mL) but only 51 pg/mL of E. I moved to IM injections (estradiol cypionate, 2.5mg weekly) on the 8th."
LaurenRhymesWOrange,asktransgender,How to deal with harassment at work?,"I'm gong through a rough patch ever since I went full-time in January. I'm harassed non-stop at work. Non-stop. I work as a low-level coordinator/analyst at a tiny consulting firm in NYC and I'm purposely not invited to happy hours and purposely denied access to client sites. When people from HQ in Charlotte, NC come to town, they purposely do not shake my hand. I'm singled out. It's terrible.

Seriously, I'm the only employee without a client site access badge. It took them two months to update my email address. My female coworkers are completely hostile to me. Like, there's a fucking Harvard grad and MBA who sits twenty feet away from me and she refuses to interact with me or speak to me. Another lady has ""misplaced"" the bathroom key on days when I had to work really late. Twice! It's terrible. I didn't do anything to any of these people. I've never had more than small talk with any of them.

How do you put up with the nonsense at work? I'm just minding my own business each day and I wear noise cancelling earplugs all day long unless I'm in meetings (which are just gigantic misgendering clusterfucks every time) and I swear, outside of work I pass as female at this point. I really do. I just have like ten egos thrown at me every day and it's made me take off six days already this year from the stress. I throw up and cry in the bathroom at work at least once a week. I used to be able to deal with this shit but now it's  clearly discriminatory in nature.

How do I cope?  How did you cope? I don't give a shit about this place or this industry long-term, I just want to maintain sanity for the next six or so months to get through transition.

What are the coping mechanism I need? How do I just get the fuck though it? You ever see *Office Space*? Do you know how the main character just wants to zone out at work every day? That's me right now. I just need to zone out for like six or so more months to get through transition then it's adios to telecom-fucking-consulting for good. I just need to stay sane in this time.

Any advice helps. It really does! I'm dying here and I could use any advice from this community about staying the course at a job.

Also, she thinks that since I have an Aspergers diagnosis, that I can't deal with my pubic changes (a symptom of high-functioning autism).

At any rate. I've been going through non-binary stuff lately (I identify as ""eh""), and the thing that I hate more than being transgender and becoming a spectacle or making people uncomfortable, is having to be someone who'd have to pull out a pamphlet if someone asked me my gender.

Is there a way to alleviate that? Perhaps this question's along the same lines of ""how do I not feel embarrassed"" type ones, I'm not sure - embarrassment is my life.

RachaelShaw,asktransgender,"Thinking of starting hormones soon, but getting weaker is a major issue.","So, I finally have a source of income, which means I can afford things like hormones. And I really, *really*, want to look more feminine. However, multiple sources all seem to be unanimous that taking hormones makes you weaker, and this *cannot* happen.

I am a very physical person: I have to bike a good 3-4 miles to work everyday, which doesn't count how much I bike for fun. And once I'm at work, I generally have to lift multiple, very heavy crates/boxes/tables/equipment for hours at a time. And then there's the issue of self defence: Being obviously trans makes me a target for god knows who, and If I become substantially weaker the idea of doing krav maga or mma both go out the window. (I won't be old enough for a handgun license for another 22 months, and tazers/mace don't work against more than 2 people at a time, if that.)

Is there anything I can do to avert this? Work out for 2 hours per day, or something like that?"
ts_curious,asktransgender,"If you are a transgender that realized it as an adult, how did you feel emotionally after you found out in the days, weeks, months that followed?","Hi

I have been dealing with the thought that I might be transgender, and wrote a bit about it here (https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4ccbnn/any_mtf_transgender_and_ftm_for_that_matter_that/) a few days ago. I am just wondering a bit how other transgender folks felt emotionally when you found out. 

Its has been a almost 2 months since the thought that I might be transgender came to the forefront of my mind, and as I wrote in the other post I was struggling for 2 weeks with feeling anxious, down, and with little appetite. As I also mentioned in a weak moment I shared my struggle with my wife, and after a lot of turmoil for a few days, I retreated to my old thought that I was just a transvestite fetishist, but in hindsight I feel that it was more as a security mechanism in order to gain some control again.

Since then I in the beginning felt a bit peaceful, until I started wondering again, and since then I have had times when I have felt down, anxious and stressed, and I find myself at times letting out a stressed out kind of anxious sigh. Mind you my wife and I have already been under a lot of financial stress for the last 5 years, and I made myself believe that it was just the transvestite feelings acting up.

But I cannot shake this feeling that I am transgender, but since there is a waiting list to see a therapist where I live I feel I have to do something to keep it together until I see him. Might sound stupid, but I am not sure how else to go about it in order to keep it together until I see him.

Everything leads me to believe that I am in fact transgender, and especially reading these 2 posts, and especially the last one, where expect from the first point I can so identify with the others. I have never focused a lot on it before but it seems that my body is hiding secrets here and there.
http://www.annierichards.com/skeleton.htmhttp://www.annierichards.com/skeleton.htm
http://heartcorps.com/journeys/beginners/how-to-tell.htm

What I am struggling to pin point is whether the feelings I am experiencing are just stressed feelings related to not knowing, still being in denial I guess, or if it is in fact Gender Dysphoria sneaking in. I find also that things are more of a chore, and I get grumpy easily. Not sure if all this is just me feeling the burden of what all this could lead to with my wife possibly leaving me.

I do find myself imagining how I would look like as a woman, and at that moment I am happy. When I was younger I got told that I had model legs.... I don't think it was meant as a compliment back then, but now I kind of feel that it is. My wife mentioned a while ago that she was jealous of them. I am also studying my body, and my face to see if there is any signs that my face might feminine. 

Does any of this makes sense? It feels like there is a lot of mess up in my head. 
Thanks for sharing your experience. And if anyone has any suggestions with how to keep focus until I get to see the therapist that would be great.
Take care"
transthrowaway114726,asktransgender,Skull the size of Texas. Should I even bother?,"My skull is massive. Like really fucking big. You ever watch the tonight show and notice just how big Jimmy Fallon's head is compared to all his guests? That's me.

My body is actually quite slim and slender, due to years of anorexia (the bigger I am the more dysphoric I feel). As a result, I look like ET. If I were to get my body in proportion with the size of my head, I would look like an NFL linebacker.

There is no surgery to decrease the size of skull. HRT doesn't change bone. Obviously makeup and the right hairstyle can do a bit to give the appearance of smaller skull, but not enough to get me remotely close to cis-range.

Passing is everything to me. If I can't pass and blend in then I don't want to transition.

And as a matter of fact some trans women do have XX chromosomes amongst other things that Cisgender women have so if these transphobic people are just saying women like Carmen and me are not 'real women' just based on that then everything can be contradicted!

So after dealing with hospitals etc, I started dating her on November 7th, 2016.

I still love her to death though, she is the only person I want to marry her one day, but apparently the only reason she dated me was because she didn't wantme to kill myself, and that her talking about marrying meone day was just a lie...

I desperately want to transition fully. I NEED to have a body that matches my mind and spirit. But, right now HRT and surgery aren't viable.

My goal is to hit about 170. I'm 6'2"" but I have a smallish frame, so a little underweight should be okay. I know it's a long road, but I'm SO EXCITED to finally be on it!

[deleted],asktransgender,"How do you deal with dysphoria while ""secretly"" transitioning?","I've been on T for almost 5 months now. I am out with my family and most of my friends but not at work, and am trying to keep it that way as long as possible. I have long hair I keep hidden under a hat most of the time, but when my hair is visible I am consistently read as female.

On the one hand this is what I want. I am not ready to come out fully yet. I went to a party with a friend who was not aware I wasn't ready to use my new name or male pronouns, and all the confused people hearing him refer to me with male pronouns while I still look female gave me a minor panic attack. So. Just coming out is out of the question for now, but every day I feel a little better and a little closer to being ready.

In the meantime, any tips for managing dysphoria? I bind, I actively seek out gender neutral restrooms as much as possible. I work out as much as I can. I try to keep myself busy. Going out socially where I can hide my hair and act/attempt to pass as male helps me a lot. But it only goes so far.

I know some of you (especially mtf folks) don't have the luxury of being visibly trans while you are in hormone therapy. How do you deal with it?

Edit to add: my dysphoria is usually based around my body but I've been getting a lot of social dysphoria lately. In a way I think passing publicly on occasion has made my social dysphoria WORSE - I know how amazing it feels to be gendered correctly by someone who actually believes it (vs people merely using my name/pronouns out of respect, which is awesome but doesn't feel the same) so going back to being read as female is even more of a kick in the chest in comparison."
RileighY,asktransgender,Doubts I'll ever pass?,"hey, I've fairly recently come to the realisation that I'm trans (mtf) but I'm pretty much terrified of making the decision to transition. my face is what I tend to feel the most dysphoria about but I currently have a very masculine face and so I'm worried that HRT will not be enough and I'll have to get FFS, I'm open to it although anything other than surgery to my nose seems terrifying, especially surgery to my chin or forehead but I feel like it might have to be something I need to just get over. I understand that there's a lot more to passing than just how your facial features look but I have huge doubts I'll ever pass. My dysphoria isn't particularly crippling so I constantly fool myself in to thinking I'll be fine not transitioning or just presenting as non-binary without HRT but I know I will probably regret not transitioning in the future and I was just hoping for any advice anyone might have? sorry for the crappy pictures, look a bit depressed and scruffy, I'm also far from photogenic but http://i.imgur.com/0KDGpCf.jpg"

sonoramona,asktransgender,Does it make a difference?,"Hey there. 17 y/o mtf here. (Apologies if formatting looks dumb. I'm on my phone.)

So I just started hrt like, 4 days ago which is awesome. I have noticed a few subtle effects but not much, which I expected since I know it takes time to start seeing actual stuff happen. But one worry of mine is that the mg of E I'm taking may be too low to see real changes in a reasonable amount of time.

For reference my T levels before hrt were average (600ish.) I'm on 100mg of spiro (which I think is plenty for now) and 1mg E daily. Does this sound right? Would it make any difference if I was on 2 or 3mg rather than 1? My next appointment isn't until late May so I just want to feel reassured.

TransClusterhead,asktransgender,Worried about my grandfather when coming out (though not how you might think),"He's not a bigoted individual, far from it. He's one of the kindest and most honest men I've ever met, and my dad has the same honesty. He has vascular dementia. And it's progressing, as you'd expect, though we're quite early in the stage at which he does things (he's perfectly able bodied, just gets things mixed up ocasionally).

Our most recent trip to visit them had a couple of things that make me wary of what may happen once I take the decision to undergo transition. They have a TiVo box and a PVR, and the PVR isn't actually used any more, but my grandfather flat out refused to have it removed because it was so confusing to him to not have the box there, it's always been there. He even insisted that my dad re-tune it (Freeview channels) such that everything was working. Once he was using the PVR again, he was then even more upset that BBC News wasn't the right channel, because he was remembering the button combination for the TiVo box. It ended up causing my dad and grandfather to have a row over it, for a short while.

My grandmother and dad also had me upgrade my grandparent's machine to Windows 10 (I'm a Comp Sci graduate, as is my dad). I ended up disguising the Start menu for them such that it looked like the Windows 7 Start menu, such that my grandfather didn't feel uncomfortable with the changes, because he doesn't like sudden change (you can see the recurring theme).

Now, I'm not out about being trans to my parents. I likely won't be out to them until I have confirmation from my neurologist (or I get a good relapse from my symptoms with the cluster headaches unmedicated if the neurologist is reluctant at the appointment I have with him at the start of September). But in the event that I do, I'm afraid that my dad is going to use my grandfather's dementia as a worry he has, because it would be too much of a change for my grandfather, to try and guilt me into not transitioning until my grandfather passes (along with my medical conditions, using something like the ""what's a few more years?"" line).

So, any ideas? Apologies for the wall of text, but I'm stuck, and I was wondering if anyone had any input."

Vonannia,asktransgender,Hormones and sexual orientation.,"Just to preface, I am not on hormones yet. I have little to no dysphoria. At least, that's what I think. I've always liked women. I don't like men. Up until recently that I've come into terms that I am transgender, I see myself as a man that liked women like any typical guy would.

I've seen some trans women who liked women during their male lives and have liked men now that they're well into their transition. So, do hormones somehow influence sexual orientation?

I don't like to believe that it does. But I somehow think that that will be the case for me because a couple of reasons. As it is now, I am still male. I present as one. I like women and I don't like men. But because I identify as transgender and have strong desires of being a woman,... When I am in deep thought that I am a woman, being with a man is not that bad. They're not strong thoughts but I see my head resting on the shoulders of a man... simple thoughts like those. But as a man, I am disgusted by the thought of it. 

I've always said to myself that if and when I transition to being a woman, I would embrace everything that comes along with it. The thought of my sexual orientation changing is kinda scary. Boobs and booty are too awesome. Just sayin'.. :D

Thoughts?"
ThrowawayOpCi,asktransgender,Can I Make it to prom? (My Cinderella Situation),"So here's a little backstory:

I am pre-everything MTF senior in high school. My parents did not react well and are doing the expected: religious classes, digging through my room, dismissing everything I say, etc. Our masquerade-themed Prom is 2 weeks before school ends. Ehem... my publicly FTM friend is banned from using the restroom or drinking water (I know it's illegal). Though, I am still closeted for the most part. Only a few of my friends at school know. I'm very thin and tall just under 6ft so I *somewhat* stand out. Small school: atleast ~50+ I believe are going

So here was my friends' plan dubbed *Operation Cinderella* (cliche, I know). My friend picks me up and drives me to her house the day of prom and we get ready. Go to prom with another friend as moral support, us acting as her +1's to enter. Don't talk the entire night; hopefully not get clocked and cry in a corner with my friend while I'm gossiped about. Leave in time to change and return home.

So here are my concerns:

* Is this a feasible plan? Should I just not go?
* How easily will I be found out if I'm wearing a mask, light makeup and extensions?
* Is it worth trying to change your voice &lt;1 month? Or is staying silent the whole night my best option?
* What are the most essential ways to avoid being clocked?

Edit: I'm just very anxious to go to prom. The whole school could end up spreading around gossip. I don't have a high self-esteem and dysphoria is already a factor in my depression. Some clarification, I live in the US. My school is on the edge on the borders of the ghetto and suburbs. It's not overtly terrible, just that the students don't care much about school. Ontop of this it is a charter school... Hope no one I know reads this cause this would be very conspicuous..."
Sayoria,asktransgender,"Does getting a sex change ASAP sound like a good idea for me? (Yes, I've had my years under my belt. Different reason.)","I have terrible dry skin. Like.... Hellish and it drives me bonkers. It started practically when I started on HRT.

http://i.imgur.com/zPubTdu.jpg

Now I know what people would say.... ""Drink more water!"" .... Well, I do, it's hard, very very hard, but I do, or try. I use hand creams as well. I don't do well with the Winter at all. All water I take in too seems to just be peed out 20 times as fast as I put it in.

Now here's my thing...... Spironolactone is a diuretic, yes? .... Diuretics make you pee a lot, yes? Well, being trans, I need these pills. The only way I an think about dropping spironolactone is by getting the surgery so I can stop taking my pills and hope the water in my body would even out again. I plan to get the SRS anyways, but was planning to hold off a while longer because I want to get my facial hair gone first completely.

Does this seem logical? Would this help my drying-out issue? I feel as though it would. I've been on HRT for two and a half years now, so not like I wouldn't be ready if I could get things going, but I just want to know if anyone thinks getting it and stopping spironolactone could make a strong difference for me."
e776534789,asktransgender,Wake up call or normal fears?,"I am reading a lot of stories since finally realizing the whole topic affects me in first person and I perfectly fit in most of them. I would rather be reborn female, yes. I always wished my body was female since as long I can remember.

Finding out that it doesn't have to stay a fantasy was quite traumatic and is giving me ups and downs to extents I can barely represent in words. 

I've looked up all the effects of hrt and every single change from physical to mental is precisely what I want... I am not even too concerned about losing the ability to get erections BUT for some reason I am scared shitless of the actual damage I will be doing down there.

I know I intensely want to live as a woman and unfortunately it does not stay confined to arousal time. I know I am so thrilled and happy to imagine my own body being slowly feminized that I daydream about it constantly and I am more and more comfortable at the thought.

I look at my face and I also find it pleasant to daydream about how it will look like when hrt does what it does, but here is the problem: I look at my perfectly functioning (yet unused) genital area and I feel physical pain in imaging getting things like bilateral orchiectomy and penectomy. It's no trivial matter, I am scared to no end and I can barely think about it.

I personally cannot find myself doing a transition without said transition being complete. This is an hard limit for me. 

It's at this point that I wonder why I am feeling like this. Does this mean I should question myself a bit more about what I really want or is it just fear of 'letting go'?

I am also very scared by the fact I will be messing with my own body in ways which I fear are going to take a toll on my longtime health.

I am about 30 so I feel like I cannot really waste any more time if I want to achieve something remotely similar to my standards, yet I am probably unprepared yet.

I mean, I would do everything on the spot if I could just enter a box and come out of there in perfect conditions with a perfectly functioning woman body, but if you ask me wether I am willing or not to risk my health and do major surgery on myself to destroy otherwise healthy tissue, I am left unsure about what to tell you. I know it's not a no, I know I get a little annoyed if you tell me 'ok, do not transition then', yet I wonder if my inability to still say yes at this point without having the nasty fear come to my mind means that I should at least delay the whole thing. I am currently pre everything.

So one of my best friends husband is going to transition. I just found out today. She seems pretty ok with it and is very supportive of her husband. I am friends on facebook with him ( he is still Ok with us using he) but not exactly friends. He was always quiet and a typical guys guy. 

He is in a support group already. I am just here because I want to gather more infomation for them to help. They also have kids under the age of ten. They want to know how to explain it to the children ?

We live in Sydney/Australia if that helps. Since she lives overseas and will be moving back here ( he is a fly in fly out worker) she can't be here for him all the time and only a few people know. How ca  I show my support ? I am worried his friends will ditch him too. I cant imagine what he is going through.

As supportive as my friend is, I think she will need support too.

Dakkon177,asktransgender,"Self Important, Immature, Sympathy Fishing Post.","Yeah...

Does anyone have anything uplifting to say to a Non-Transitioner stricken with both depression and periods of chronic heartache derived from dsyphoria, to the point of begging for death, who isn't inclined to commit suicide and feels that the days are much longer than they really are? Sorry for the mouthful.

For the past year I've tried my best to give a helping hand to a few who suffer from depression or other problems on and off the internet and generally do well by other people. But I feel I'm starting to crack. 

I've helped the people I have because these people were ""asking"" for help in the same manner that I was ""asking"" for help from others and I didn't want to ignore that as others have , subtly at first and subsequently escalating into becoming more obvious. The difference being though, is that those who I've ""asked"" for help have been too unobservant to notice or not sufficiently concerned to act on their observations. The few people I've helped have started to to pull through, as far as I can tell, and are starting to stand on their own two feet again; but I'm still no better off, I'm actually getting worse. It makes me feel like the future has nothing for me except to bandage the wounds of others while these same people either ignore or fail to notice my own wounds until I succumb to them. And it's not as if I can pull myself out of this alone, I do need help; not from any therapist though (in my opinion they are a poor substitute for a true friend).

I'm very tired, yet I'm always trying to make progress on things that I would do if I were my preferred gender (building a house, sewing, baking, being healthy, etc.) and I'm doing what I can to put myself ""out there"". Nevertheless, I know these things wont fill the hole of being transgender anymore than transitioning would. Having a single friend would surely help, but I'm semi-passive by nature and tend to make friendships slowly which makes the timetable for relief from the heartache induced by both loneliness and being trans seem like years. If you will, I'm doing what I can, but it doesn't seem to be enough; the universe or some trickster god wants to string out the torment as long as possible.

Sorry for the [""woe is me""](http://i.imgur.com/gZtGVT4.gif) theme of this post when [other people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwOBRH56Ic0) [have it far worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yeKlAdJ5RE).

It might be helpful to read some information on BIID from clinical studies. Check out this paper I linked elsewhere in the thread:

http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034702

From the paper:

&gt; The main rationale given for their desire for body modification is to feel complete or to feel satisfied inside. Somatic and severe psychiatric co-morbidity is unusual, but depressive symptoms and mood disorders can be present, possibly secondary to the enormous distress BIID puts upon a person.

&gt; Amputation of the healthy body part appears to result in remission of BIID and an impressive improvement of quality of life. Knowledge of and respect for the desires of BIID individuals are the first steps in providing care and may decrease the huge burden they experience."

Ive started seeing a physiologist specializing in transgender issues and i can see myself starting HRT within a month or two. Because of this recently it got me thinking about choosing a female name for when  i go 100% fem in the open.

Agentjayjay1,asktransgender,25 year old assigned male questioning gender,"And getting nowhere fast. Except, perhaps an asylum. 

I came here a while back on an anonymous account with no email. I think the name was leconfuse? Not that anyone would remember anyway. 

Long story short, I'm way deeper into questioning now. To the point where it's making it hard to function. Almost every waking moment I'm preoccupied with trying to figure out just who the hell I am. I'm trying to get some information on non binary stuff that isn't formatted in an entirely baffling way, but increasingly, I'm feeling like I'm merely grasping for what I see as the easier option (probably wrongly, by the way) and that I'm in fact full trans. Just typing that makes me feel so nervous I have to pause for a second. I'm not ashamed, at least, not yet. If one of my trans friends was ashamed I'd reassure them, and if someone else implied they should be ashamed, I'd be sorely tempted to knock their block off. This, whatever this is, is not a choice, I know that much. It's the consequences I struggle with. The years of treatment that might be ahead, the discrimination, the very real threat of making myself even more of a target than I already am, being autistic, anxious, and depressed. I'm getting ahead of myself, though. I'm not sure yet. I'm pretty sure I'm not cis, it doesn't fit and I can't believe I let myself be pressured into thinking it did. I always thought myself an individual, but I let the powers that be force me to lie to myself for a quarter of a century. That I do feel ashamed of, coming to think of it. I'm starting to realise there May well be no way to be sure. I can just seek out advice. Right now, I suppose my focus should be on getting my head straight enough to talk to my doctor about it. Get myself on that undoubtedly long, long, list to see a gender therapist. My every step is impeded by my fear, though. I'm terrified of anyone finding out. I'm not sure how many of my friends would object, but I don't have enough to risk losing them, and I ain't exactly the most sociable person. I can't easily make new friends.

I suppose my point is this; how can I get anywhere with questioning? And how do you cope with this fear?"

_Shaana_,asktransgender,"How to define what is a ""man"" or ""woman"" as gender identity?","I just read some online discussion about gender identity. And someone asked ""what does that mean to feel like a woman or like a man? In the sense, what does the words ""man"" and ""woman"" mean here?""

It make me think a lot. Because I admit it's a kind of circular reasoning to say ""i am a man/woman because I feel like a man/woman"" without further informations about the terms ""man/woman"".

I don't think that what is defined as a man/woman (as gender identity) rely on gender stereotype. After all, there are feminine transmen and butch transwomen. And usually people don't transition because they prefer male or female activity, because they want to wear dress or because they are more ""delicate"" or ""assertive"". I'm sure there will still be transgender people in a world where it's totally OK to be a feminine guy or a masculine woman.

I don't think that gender identity is only a matter of look or physical characteristics either. I mean, there could be cis men that would want to look like feminine women without asserting that they feel or are women and vice-versa (I don't know if this is a good example, but I think of people like Kaoru Ishimaru: https://visualioner.com/2014/07/10/im-a-boy-so-theres-nothing-embarrassing-about-this-photo/).

I know about transgender people brain's studies. But can we really say that our gender identity is only defined by these studies? Couldn't we consider that the biological aspects are some sort of predisposition? Maybe I'm wrong, but in this case wouldn't gender identity just be defined as ""particular sets of biological elements in the brain""?

It's hard for me to give a plain answer to the question. Abstractly and theoretically, to speak about me I could say that I want to be a woman, in the sense that I want to have physical characteristics considered as ""feminine"", to belong to the group of ""women"" and to be perceived as ""female"" by society. But concretely, it's more because I sometimes feel ""female"", in the sense that I gender myself with female pronoun and I imagine having a female body and be perceived as a girl, which make me happy inside. 

The problem with what I just said is that I feel like I didn't really described what are ""women"" (and men). So what do you think? How would you describe what is a ""man"" or a ""woman"" when speaking about gender identity?"

bluetopink,asktransgender,Has anyone else lost interest in long time hobbies?,"I am or was a car collector. Most of my life revolved around collecting and restoring cars. It's the only thing that kept me sane over the years of dealing with gender dysphoria, sorta kept it at bay to some degree.

That all changed about a year ago as my acceptance of my true self took over. My mind switched that part of me off and I lost most, if not all of my interest in working on cars. Haven't touched one in a year, with the exception of occasionally taking one for a spin on a nice weekend.

I really have no interest in any hobbies at the moment. I feel that part of me is dead and I don't know what to do about it. Part of it may be an incorrect thought that liking cars is a man's hobby not a woman's, even though I know that is irrational...I know lots of women that are into cars. But deep down maybe I feel it invalidates me as a woman.

Maybe depression has taken over. I've been battling that the last couple years, although it has gotten better the last few months, after I came out to a few people.

CheshireHats,asktransgender,Will I find any place without bigotry?,"After receiving some awesome advice on here, I started looking around for some trans forums and communities. As I started looking through them, I noticed an overwhelming amount of hatred toward those of my particular political and ideological line of thought.

 I'm a libertarian, and the basic idea of the party and mindset is that freedom and equality are not something that is given by the state, therefore can not be regulated by the state. The concept that all people are the same in terms of worth and rights.

But to see some of the extreme disgust over misconceptions about what it means to believe this way, I started to feel extremely insecure. Political beliefs are somewhat fluid, but are usually unchanging  in the grand scheme of things. Almost no one just decides they feel a different way about any topic one day. I can't cange that part of who I am, just like I can't change who I feel I am on the inside.

It somehow seems that if I'm not waving the democrat flag that I must be some kind of hateful person who doesn't believe in equal rights.

So I can't live among the ""traditional"" community and be the woman I feel like on the inside, live and be happy without being judged. I apparently can't live among the trans community and be the person who believes ideologically as I do, live and be happy.

That seems to narrow it down to either not being happy or not living. What did I do that was so wrong to make so many people hate who I am?"

Darthnerdster,asktransgender,It feels as if people are just humoring Me,"TL;DR Literal Block of Sodium and angry transwoman about misgendering

The question that I keep finding I ask myself the most is are the people around me just humoring my transition. Do they just use she/hers because thats what they know is what I go by, but in their minds they are always using he/his and change it at the last second for my benefit. I end up having to ask myself this way more often than I would ever care too. This past week has been especially bad and I have been full time for pretty much 8 months now and still people around me do that dreaded word slip and just immediately change it back to her/hers. 8 months and people are still slipping, 8 months and my list of people who have missgendered me keeps getting larger and larger and honestly it is more practical at this point to just keep a mental list on who hasn't. And one of the worst parts is none will give me any suggestions, no one ever even apologizes after they do it they just give this sad eyed look if even that. I sometimes even try to ask these people what I could do better to be more “womanly” in their eyes so they just fucking stop, but its endless “omg nothing you pass beautifully” or any other seemingly hug boxing BS. Listen you are saying one thing but your actions and words and “just accidents, but I swear normally they see you as her/hers all the time” say so so so much differently. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/HDQETWJ.jpg) is a great picture of me and how I wished I look all the time [here](http://i.imgur.com/q6LA3O5.jpg) is pretty low effort and kinda masculine attire, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/ReIjZbF.jpg) is an atrocious picture of me that someone snapped from my profile, it shows every male feature that makes me hate myself every time I look into the mirror. So people please tell me if there is a single one of these photos that warrants missgendering once every two or three days as it has been for months now. Even that last one I obviously am not presenting male so just wth. Sorry world, sorry family, sorry friends I am so SORRY that my pronouns are this difficult thing that none of you seem to be able to take to heart. I am SORRY that I am angry about it as well. I am SORRY I just must not convince you that I am a woman, maybe ill act better in the future, now here… let me console you because you feel bad for making me feel bad, let me just make you feel better for hurting me. I would be such a bad trans friend if I just let you sit in that for a while, I would just be the worst if I had wanted even the slightest apology, and I would literally be Hitler if I asked you to just respect my presentation or at least not hugbox me. Fuck.

[deleted],asktransgender,What is dating like for non-passable transwoman?,"Hi, I'm trans myself (28 mtf). I'm passable while being out and about but I think it's still easy to clock me once I start a conversation - either when a guy comes up to me or if I start talking to someone new at work. I don't really mind - as long as I feel safe on the streets and respected by whoever talks to me.

I was wondering though how does dating work for transwoman that don't pass all the time? Maybe it's the voice, maybe something about your body but you just know that your average straight Joe will most likely not date you because usually straight cis guys are very fixated on 'passing' and usually - from what I've read on Reddit so far - they can love and accept a pre-op girl as long as she transitioned super early in life (preferably before puberty). Well... I wasn't on hormones until I was 27 so realistically speaking I don't pass as well as some trans beauty gurus on YouTube :D (not a biggy, I love myself :3)

There's just a difference between being 100% passable to the point where his friends and family don't even need to know and being the 'trans' girlfriend that everyone was able to 'clock'. I hope I'm not offending anyone here, I'm just wondering about my own situation.

So girls, do you end up finding yourself on dates with Chasers? 
Or when going on a date with a straight guy met online do you feel insecure about not passing and scaring him off? I know I do, so I always try to make it crystal clear that I may look good to him on pictures but I still don't pass 100% and he needs to be OK with that.

Last month was the first good month ive had in a year or so and now im going back down.  I'm considering suicide on a daily basis, I know most of the issues I have are just due to my run of the mill depression.  However this time around I get to add dysphoria to the mix.  

My life isn't necessarily bad, I have an okay job and a better career being lined up.  I have parents that, while not overly supportive, are still loving and accepting of me.  I have a brother who I currently live with who is very supportive. I have been on HRT for a little over two months now.

But everyday it's the same, that horrible numb empty feeling with the constant nagging sadness.  Looking at a pretty girl now has completely different effect on me (depression). I live in north carolina where I get to hear people loudly tell their reasoning behind hb2.  

I have an online friend who is my main contact for all things I need help with.  I think my constant depression and talks of suicide may be driving her away, she has similar issues and I can only imagine that our friendship is not healthy for her.

Ive attempted suicide along time ago and I remember how it started.  I am already starting to think out reasons as to why I should or shouldn't.  The main reason that is bogging me down is that my best friend just lost one of her best friends, I couldn't hit her twice with something like that.

When I got in the car with her she told me he doesn't think I will ever pass as a girl and that I should be put on an antipsychotic for depression. My eyes are sore from crying.

abbytron,asktransgender,So I have a job interview on saturday. How/When should I come out?,"It's an interview at Walmart, I've worked there before but I never really heard anything about LGBT related scenarios during our workplace equality training. I've been applying at some places for a while and things seemed to go well until they saw my license or found out I was trans. After that they pretty much just avoid calling me back or sending me through loops to get back in for more interviews.

I'm still pretty early into my transition and although I do look pretty feminine I still feel like It'd make it hard to land the job if I told them I was trans. My main issue at the moment is that I haven't be able to afford legally changing my name yet and I want to go by Abby when talking with coworkers.

Also I'm not sure what Walmart's stance is on a trans person using the right restroom, there's no protection in my state for it (Kansas).

I was thinking of trying to wing the interview as best I can in guy mode but my voice sounds really feminine and doesn't really have a ""gay"" tone to it. So I'm thinking that might raise some flags. (I actually tried to shop for new shoes the other day in guy mode at a converse store and tried talking with my old guy voice and I literally can't anymore xD)

TL;DR - I don't want my boss to know I'm trans before I'm hired, but I'm not sure when/how to come out."

ruler_gurl,asktransgender,there are so few trans people...huh?,"I have a hard time understanding why every time I get into a debate with someone that thinks trans people don't deserve rights, they inevitably toss out the fact that the trans population is so small and inconsequential that everyone else shouldn't need to be inconvenienced for their sake.  Some people have actually told me that we're selfish for even suggesting that all of cis-dom should have to change for us.  They make it sound as if there are like 70 of us in the whole country.

The simplest google search immediately returns [700,000](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+transgender+people+in+the+us&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8) people.  Why in the world does that seem like an inconsequential number to people?  It's greater than the [population of Seattle](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/a0763098.html).  Would people say that it's cool to strip rights from everyone in a medium sized city?  And if you point out to people that there are this many, they say *That's a lie.  It's all made up*.  How far down the rabbit hole do people need to go to feel content to continue believing we don't exist?

I'm obviously just thinking about the US right now because we're so embroiled in legal trauma."
Sigaft,asktransgender,Should I get a fat transfer to my breasts instead of breast implants MTF?,"I'm a 18 year old trans woman and i want bigger breasts. I've looked into fat transfer to my breasts and breast implants and personally I prefer the idea of having a fat transfer to my breasts. I can go up one whole cup size. I know that not all of the fat will survive but never mind. Are there any pros and cons I should know about before getting this? Has anyone else who is MTF had this done? I have heard there is sometimes a cancer scare with this procedure because it Is in the breast and not all of the fat will survive and the fat that doesn't survive can sometimes cause lumps, etc. Is this safe at my age?"

[deleted],asktransgender,My dysphoria started very late at age 17. Is it just a phase?,"Hey, I've been racking my brains for more than a year over whether transitioning is actually what I want or not. My desire to be a girl only began about one and a half years ago after turning 16/17 and that's making me anxious due to the possibility that perhaps I'm just going through a phase or something along those lines.

In this short time I've developed intense feelings of trauma that envelop every masculine feature I have, primarily my thick body hair that unfortunately grows at a fast rate as well as the way my face looks. Whenever I see an attractive girl the only emotion I generally feel is jealously whereas previously I never had a care in the world about my masculine features or even the slightest desire to be feminine beyond curiosity.

Now I can't even step outside without wiping every hair on my body out of existence and lathering my face in make-up. The idea of short hair almost terrifies me. Every sexual fantasy I have revolves around being submissive and under someone's spell. It feels like I've subconsciously been projecting a more feminine inflection onto my words also, and I've dabbled in wearing girl's clothes here and there.

I've been very depressed lately due to my boyish figure and relentless body hair and I'm really confused as to what I should do. I'm already on the NHS waiting list in terms of clinic referrals but I feel so anxious and afraid of what it is I really want. I'm uncertain about everything in life right now and it's practically tearing me apart and making me bed-ridden.

I've had identity issues for years now without a doubt but it's all come crashing down on me from 2015 onwards. I dropped out of two colleges and quit an amazing career opportunity despite being employed against all odds, and now it just feels like I've hit a dead end. 

I don't even know who I am let alone what I want or who I should be with. I've moved on from school and my friends are seemingly long gone, and now I'm carrying a huge burden of uncertainties that are steadily chewing away at my head every hour of the day.

I'm sorry this turned into such a rant but the need to vent has been overwhelming lately. I barely even know what I'm asking for at this point.

"
Queerventions,asktransgender,Trans in the workplace.,"I recently found out that all my coworkers have been outing me and calling me a boy when I'm not around.
I am a transwoman who can pass in the binary fairly well; both through vocals and presentation. However, when I go to work it seems I get clocked so much. Maybe that's due to the neutrality of our uniform: all black everything, button-up shirt, and apron (I work in a restaurant). Perhaps even the fact that I don't think about all the little feminine things I normally do; such as walking and talking. Either way it really shakes my confidence and makes me hate going to work when I used to love it. I lost the small amount of confidence in my trans identity I had and now I don't know how to get it back."
wistfulStargazer,asktransgender,When should I expect stuff to start happening?,"Hello, everyone! So, I started HRT (pills once daily with 2 mg Estradiol and 50 mg Spiro) a little bit over two weeks ago. I've been really excited and generally super happy, but I've barely noticed anything happening. My face has dried out a little bit (bonus question: what should I do about this? I've been applying a little bit of moisturizer wherever my skin gets especially dry, but I don't think that's the most effective method), and my areola has grown a tiny bit (I think), but other than that pretty much nothing is different. I've heard of cases where people my age are already having breast development at two weeks, so, like, is there something wrong? Am I just freaking out? Should I talk to my endo?

madmarmalade,asktransgender,Hormone breast development; development of large lumps in the skin?,"Hello!  I was just a little nervous about a trend I've found about breast development with transgender women, and I was wondering if it was a common experience. 
I've been on hormones for about two years, but on my most recent visit got prescribed a more potent mix and dosage.  Since then I have noticed that I have largish, firmer than normal areas of tissue inside both of my breasts, centered on my nipple.  In the course of sleeping with two other transwomen, I noticed they have those too.  
I've become more concerned about this because my endocrinologist said to examine myself routinely for breast cancer, and I of course don't necessarily know what to look for. Has anyone else experienced what I have?"
Thefanoodler,asktransgender,"Any other stories of "" not much happening ""?","I've been on HRT for 7 months now and it's just been getting hard to feel good.  At about the 4 month mark I had found out my T levels were lower than when I started but still entirely within normal male range and there was no comment on E levels.  So I just thought "" well okay that's been interfering with progress "".  And now at 7 months I find out my T levels are "" good "" or at least that's what the doc said on the phone, I'm going in on Tuesday to actually discuss in person.  But she said my E levels were only at 104.

katie-elizabeth,asktransgender,Did you realize that internalized transphobia caused you to be in denial about your condition for years?,"Growing up in a religious, conservative community I saw a mountain of jokes directed at anyone not conforming to traditional gender roles.  The consensus was that these people were the worst freaks of society and barely qualified as human life.  Shockingly, seeing and hearing that growing up doesn't change your gender dysphoria.  It just causes you to be horrifically confused about it.  
  
Despite the classic 1,000 signs, I just had no idea that it could even be possible that I could be trans.  Even in adult life, *fully admitting to myself and others I was a woman in a man's body* I didn't consider myself trans.  That's like building a closet inside of a closet.  Perhaps you've experienced the same.  
  
I lived a lie for my entire life, and got so good at it I even convinced myself of the lie: 'all boys secretly wish they were girls; this is normal and it is a desire that must be fought so we can succeed in life.'  
  
I really wish I had seen more positive examples of trans men and trans women growing up, and seen the community accept them open heartedly.  Forget being born cis; at least then I could have accepted what I was a lot sooner and felt comfortable with my options long before I was firmly entrenched as an adult.  "

I just always considered myself a crossdresser, and as bi. Because well I find women to be very attractive, I am jealous of any sexy lady. I want to be a sexy little delicate thing as well. But that is not going to happen for me sadly. I live in an extremely violent country and as a result of that my survival depends on me being able to fight. So being in a male body is a blessing and a curse. Hell yeah, I am strong, fast and big enough to beat damn near anybody in a fight. 

But I also paint my toe nails, wear panties and stockings, etc. I am horrible at makeup and I don't have a girly face, so I look like something from a comedy about a guy crossdressing. Not even as good as Miss Doubtfire. Also scars. I have a lot of scars.

I signed up for a college course to do over the summer, it'll be for a month and starting July 3rd. It's out of state so I'll be part of a housing program for it, rooming with people between 16 and 20, with like 3 people to a room + an RA or some shit. I'm going to be just over 4 months of hormones when I show up, and starting 5th a week before I leave. 

I'm absolutely horrified because of this. I'm scared of how I'll look in 2 months because I don't know HOW I'm going to look, I know damn well though I'm not going to be anywhere near passing, but I know I'll be at that in-between where you don't really fall into either category. I don't want to make other people uncomfortable because I doubt any male roommates want to deal with some faggot playing dress up and I doubt any female roommates would be comfortable with someone that looks so blatantly masculine in their room :&lt; 

I don't know how to list myself on the papers because what I am now, I may not be in 2 months, and I don't want to ruin this I don't want to fuck it up like I do everything else. I don't want to do the wrong thing and not be able to change and be stuck with this choice. My dad already filled out all of the paperwork for me and said I just need to sign it, but he listed me as male and I don't know what this even means anymore and I can't talk to him about this issue because the only way he even tolerates my transition is by no one ever mentioning it and 'accepting' things as they come, pretending it was always like that. I don't want to talk to him about this i don't know what would happen, I'm scared I'm going to ruin this because everyone wants a black and white answer for something that isn't even grayscale

And even if I do end up 'passing' to some extent by then, my voice will give me away, ive been practicing for months and I've gotten no where, it's always raspy and sounds strained, and I can't even get it that high without every syllable cracking i dont know how to do anything i cant figure anything out and i cant do it myself but theres no trainers or therapists even remotely close to me im scared and i dont know what to do because everything is starting to matter but I dont have any control over my own life and the things that i do have control over i just fuck up because im bad at everything i do, i need help i dont what to do, anything at all because I just want to sleep and never wake up at this point"

 I sometimes get heart palpitations/pain and sometimes I have poor circulation for example one leg could be cold the other could be hot. Are there any DEADLY risks of starting HRT and getting SRS at this age?"
CaptainRyn,asktransgender,Coming out and completely overwhelmed,"Ok I will keep the life story short.

I am 27, and want to transition to become a woman.  I knew something wasn't right as even a child, have cross dressed in private off and on since the age of 11, have been flirting with transitioning since I first learned about Transgender stuff since the age of 17. I live in the deep south (North MS and Memphis TN area) and am a Software Engineer. Spent the last 4 years in a major depressive funk and have decided that if I don't want to become a mental health statistic, I need to start moving forward with my life. No real need for secrets now.

I have started looking for Therapists to help get me started and do HRT.  I have done the web thing but I feel like I am going in circles. There is a support group at the MGLCC that meets every Monday for transitioning folks, but frankly I am terrified of being seen as a fraud (even though I know that won't be the case).  There is also a clinic that does no questions asked HRT as well.  But I don't feel comfortable doing HRT until I can at least talk to a therapist.

Need input.  I have friends living in another city, ones I would be comfortable coming out to, but none in Memphis (just don't know HOW to do the come out). Family i frankly dont even know how to approach.  I dont have kids or a partner, but my mother and father i honestly dont know how they will react, and i am afraid how i would broach the subject to my more countrified kin like my grandparents. Sexuality has been with women but lately I cant stop thinking about men (I am okay with being Bi).  Have been deeply asexual for the last 4 years, to the point I don't know where to begin getting back into the game let alone what to do with guys (I just can't do it with someone unless I can build a personal connection with).  If I can find another job, I will move to New Orleans (dovetails with my love of sailing and maritime stuff).  In the immediate term, move out of my parents house so I can spread my wings and then not be terrified about getting some women's clothing in my wardrobe. Have also spent the last year losing weight and am 195 from a high of 247 last year and am hoping HRT will get me psychologically and physically over the last hump.

Wow I spent three hours writing all this. Sorry if it is a rambling mess.  "
vkavreis,asktransgender,How can I come out to my parents?,"I'm seventeen and FtM. I've told a couple of my friends, so it's not like I've never tried to come out before, but when it comes to my parents I'm not really sure what to do.
My dad is very liberal and I doubt he would mind, especially considering he's often mentioned he'd have liked a son. I'm pretty sure he's fine with trans people, given he complains about the North Carolina issue a lot. My only worry with him is that I don't have a history of telling my parents anything about my mental state, we're not emotional people, which makes me a little afraid that they might not take me seriously.
My mom is relatively religious and kind of anti-social; to my knowledge, she's never spoken to a trans person. I don't think she knows very much about any of this. I've heard her confuse being trans and being gay before, and I'm concerned that she won't believe me because I'm a gay male (or rather, she sees me as a straight girl). I'm not even completely sure she knows FtMs exist. So I have no idea how she'll react, and I don't know when the right opportunity for going through all the facts about FtMs with her might be.
The last issue is that both my parents have it very well entrenched in their minds that I'm female; they refer to me more as ""your daughter"" or as ""her"" far more frequently than they use my actual name. I don't know how I can make sure they remember that I have different pronouns.

Basically, going by my guess on who would be okay with it and who wouldn't, I'm not sure if I should call a family meeting type of thing, or tell them casually, or tell them separately, or how I can educate my mom on what being trans is, or how I can get them to really take this to heart and remember what I am. I feel I have to tell them, though. I can't keep lying to them like this."

She's severely depressed and anxious all the time, and if they kick her out she's got nowhere to go. I myself really want to help her, however I'm not sure how I can, aside from letting her live with me (my parents are very understanding but we're in a very precarious financial situation right now so we couldn't let her stay for more than a week or so) I really am not sure what I'm supposed to do at this point... They're slowly killing her and I have a right mind to tell them what despicable, disgusting, heartless human beings they are, but I don't want to intervene incase I make things worse. I'm pretty confused and want to help but I don't know how. If this information helps, we both live in the north of the UK, I'm 21, she's 20. I hope you can offer some advice on what I can do to help.

n8_da_g8,asktransgender,Is this Genital Dysphoria? [ NSFW ],"Hello all, I am mtf 19 and there's something that I've yet to answer for myself (well I think I know but yet again, idk lol) and it's genital dysphoria. I think I have it but yet again I think I don't. This might be pretty long and weird so here we go!


Firstly, whenever I read about anything involving the penis or the testicles, I get disgusted, I simply hate reading it. Whenever I read about the effects of HRT on the penis, I also get disgusted, and I'm talking the effects of shrinkage. I'm not really disgusted that my stuff will be ""ruined"" if I go on HRT, I'm just disgusted with anything to do with the penis.


Second, I'm gonna be blunt about this, I hate touching my penis. Whenever I get horny and feel the need to touch my stuff, I don't touch it with my bare hands, I usually use a really soft blanket to do it and I still feel disgusted more than half the time when I do it. This has been going on since I was like 12, so before I even thought about being trans. 


Third, I just got on Spironolactone (yay) 3 days ago, and I've already noticed a difference in myself. I've yet to get an raging erection (lol) and if I get horny, I don't feel the need to touch my thing anymore. Surprisingly, even though I don't like touching my testicles, I don't feel too disgusted about touching them now, but yet again there's times when I don't even want to think about my stuff, like in the shower, because sometimes I get really disgusted washing my stuff.

So yeah here is all the things that have been on my mind about my genitals and whether or not I have dysphoria. Can anyone relate and help me out?"
transthrowaway3145,asktransgender,How do you deal with dysphoria killing your motivation regarding school/uni stuff?,"What I've found to be perhaps one of the most annoying aspects of dysphoria for me at least is that it makes me tired, stressed, anxious and therefore completely unmotivated to work, and/or makes me go on long MMORPG etc. sessions to overcompensate to feel more like my gender (which still results in work not being done) or makes me want to constantly read about transgender-related stuff (again, no work).

This isn't usually an issue due to the ""deadline effect"" or when being supervised, but when neither of those are present, then getting stuff done just feels impossible, I feel paralyzed.

Somehow I just can't bring myself to uninstall the games and to add in extensions into my browser that blocks reddit, youtube, etc. And there are no libraries nearby to reduce distractions. I don't even think that getting rid of those distractions would help since it's not them directly but dysphoria that is the problem, and I feel like just going back to bed or just staring at the wall when thinking of how I would spend the time without them.

I can already ""crossdress"" and use make-up at home for years, but it's not enough anymore to alleviate dysphoria, and hormones are realistically many years away due to family, medical, financial, gatekeepery and other reasons.

Any suggestions?"

The process strikes a hell of a lot of fear in me, and I'd really appreciate some advice or personal experiences from other people who are more familiar with this stuff.

LongBeachVero,asktransgender,Spiro vs Cyrproterone Acetate vs Androcur - One Better Than Rest?,I've been reading a lot of info re: HRT and Estrogen seems to be the one thing everyone agrees on but testosterone blockers is where there is a big difference in opinion.

V5RED,asktransgender,What does it mean to identify as male or female?,"So, the trans people I have met tell me that trans is when you are born with a male or female body but an opposite brain. I can gramatically understand this, but I have no idea what it means.

This question is directed as follows:

For F2M people, what do you think it means to be male?
For M2F people, what do you think it means to be female?

I have never gotten a sensible answer to this question, I have just been told that nobody can tell someone how they identify. That response makes no sense since I never implied I was telling people how to identify, I asked what they mean when they use the words ""I identify as X"". I mean if you refuse to explain what a word means, what was the point of speaking?

Now the followup question is to ask whether the answer to the first question is sexist. To my mind, the only difference between myself and a woman is my penis. Men can do things like wear makeup, dresses, and heels. Women can like power tools and boxing. If identifying as female or male means falling into gender stereotypes, it would seem that accepting such identities requires one to accept gender stereotypes.

Thank you for your time if you give me answers and engage in discussion.

Edit: For the person who could not read between the lines and ranted at me for ""cisplaining"" when I say that the only difference between myself and a woman is my penis, I thought it was obvious that I was referring to the outward bodily traits including secondary sex characteristics like beards and breasts. Don't be a jerk to someone who just wants to understand."

I haven't been able to put much work into transitioning due to still living at home (though I still shave religiously or wear sleeves if I can't).

The thing is, I go by female online, but every now and then it'll just feel...off. It's weirdly difficult to say to someone, ""Yeah I'm a girl"". I alwyas substitute it with a wishy-washy word like lass or gal or something dumb like that.

I dunno if it's because I feel like I'm lying to people or if it's not what I really want (I feel like if that were the case, I wouldn't be so upset at getting called sir or hearing my own name)"
Lexybaby,asktransgender,Does Anybody Plan On Getting SRS Even Though They Have Absolutely No Genital Dysphoria?,"I was browsing online to see if I could find any stories of Trans women getting SRS even though they do not have any genital dysphoria, and I came across this. This one women said  'The WPATH guidelines require ""Persistent, well documented gender dysphoria"" as a requirement for SRS.Suppose someone were happy with life as it was, but wanted genital surgery. Someone who met all the other criteria, living as a woman, competent to make decisions, no overriding health concerns, etc. They want SRS because they want their gender and their body sex to match, or because they've always thought it would be cool to have a vag, or maybe they're intensely curious. Or maybe it's all of these, but there's no documented dysphoria present.Should someone who meets the all the other criteria but does not suffer dysphoria be eligible for SRS referral?'

That's what she said and it got me thinking, why do I want SRS if I don't mind having male genitals? Is anybody else like me? Do you want SRS even though you have absolutely no genital dysphoria what so ever?"

Or so I thought.

I just got off a call that while he didn't misgender me and call me sir, killed any confidence I had in my voice and my appearance. My dysphoria got so bad I literally almost puked.

This guy *would not* take his phone off speakerphone despite repeated requests that he do so. The issue is, there was a reverb between his mic and speaker that echoed my voice in a way that amplified all its worst qualities. I was confronted with what my voice may actually sound like (I have recorded myself and like how it sounds, but I've never heard it over the phone) all day. 

Every time I spoke, I wanted to curl up in a ball and just cry. Now I wonder if all those people I've talked to could tell and just played along. 

That's just a one off, right? Surely not all those people would just play along?"
xasdqd,asktransgender,Brother Transgender? Not really sure looking for anwsers,"Not really sure if this is the appropriate place for this topic relatively new to reedit but heres my story. I have a twin brother, his whole life he's been into video games.  Recently he's been doing live streams of his video games.  It started out as him just like putting a wig on then it moved onto him putting on nail polish and now he puts like eye liner wears spandex a bra a tight chick shirt and goes all out.  My other family members thought it was weird and didn't really say much until one night someone commented like how weird or gay what he was doing (not me).  That night he had like a total break down, and we didn't really understand because we thought he was just doing as a joke not that he actually enjoyed doing it.  So i talked him down and he ended up leaving with a friend for the night.  Not sure if this has to do with anything but like I've said before he's a total introvert I've had friends over and he won't even acknowledge them his one close friend is a lesbian.  Fast forward we went out to dinner the other night and i was in a rush to get out of the house and he was in the bathroom taking for ever and i had an idea of what he was doing.  Within 2 days my mom was doing his laundry and found a pair of panties in his room and showed me and I'm like what do you want me to say.  Anyways what I'm looking for is how should i handle this situation should i openly ask him or let him come to me about?  For the record i don't know what he is transgender could be just cross dressing but then again my mom has told me that she was looking over his shoulder while he was on his computer and he was looking up how to transition. 
Any thoughts or comments to what i should do or act feel free to respond"
[deleted],asktransgender,"I don't know who I am, what is my ""gender""?","I was trying to make my t-shirt look like one of those female clothes that shows the shoulder, that was very pleasent in a sexual way. I was 4 or 5 years old. This literally, is my first memory. That kind of fetish, was always in me. ""There is something wrong with me"", always thought that. Pretending to be a girl, looking like a girl, always aroused me, even when I was a child. My whole childhood was like this. Every time, I closed my eyes, I imagined myself as a girl. I thought that I was homosexual for a long time, until I was 13-14, I came across the term ""transsexual"". That was me, that was who I am. I begin to think that I was a female trapped in a man's body. Everything indicated that, for example, I get along with females more than I get along with males, I actually don't have any close male friends. I could write for hours but, let me get to the point.

""Being female"" is my only fantasy. I can never think myself in the male role during sex. I get aroused by men, by the thought of being a girl. Always but, I still like girls, when I see a beatifull one, I still can't turn my head around to another direction. I can't think the idea of marrying a ""male"". That only arouses me. 

I feed that sexual fetish, everyday, If I don't, I begin to behave in a very feminine way and, in where I live, that would never be considered as something good. I'd be bullied, beaten... I can't think of a solution. I always wanted be a female, I said the phrase ""I wish I was born female"" for a million times to myself, but I don't know who I am. I couldn't even explain myself.

Everything about being a female arouses me. In my masturbation fantasies, I am ALWAYS the female. I am attracted to both men and women. Physically (sex), romantically (falling in love with a man, or marrying - arouses me). I wouldn't want to have sex with a woman, but I guess, I would want to marry with a woman. About men, I would love to have sex with a man, marrying too but, only sexual. Fuck, I just can't explain myself. I don't know who I am. Only thing I know is that if I masturbate too many times everyday that my inner female is being kept under control.

I can't find a solution, what would you recommend? Nowadays, I am thinking about suicide more often..."

ConfusedEntity,asktransgender,"Feeling like coming out to everyone, but family","I am 21, MtF pre-anything with a very loving and supporting SO. Been together for over 4 1/2 years. She has known about my transgender side about half way through our relationship.

She has mentioned if any of her family isn't welcoming she isn't afraid to cut them out / not visit until their opinions changed..which feels great in the sense that she loves and cares for me that much...on the other side I think that is me affecting her relationship with her family.

I know most of my family will be accepting, like some of hers, but I don't care if my family member doesn't like it because it isn't somebody she knew her whole life and talked to all the time like her family. 

I am lucky enough to pass if I shave fresh and wear a nice wig..I have been wanting to 'come out' if you will to close friends and what not..go out 80% of the time as female, other 20% not female around family, work, etc. 

So I guess my question is...has anyone else come to close friends and not family first? I just feel like it would be SOOO awkward that first family function where everyone knows 'ConfusedEntity' is trans and I am sure everyone talked about me before it and will once I leave..I don't care about random people on the street or really cool friends who I know will be ultra accepting. It is just being around everyone that I have known my whole life and I am different in their eyes. Even though I would be most comfortable and myself if female full time.

katiecakesss,asktransgender,Coming out. Again.,"This is my nth post here, so I'm keeping it short.

I accidentally came out to my parents in January.

I got a lot of responses like ""why do you think you want to be a girl?"" along with a lot of negative anti-lgbt rants/stigma. I've tried to run away from my family. There hasn't been any talk about lately, they think I've ""grown out of it"".

I'm basically a girl everywhere but real life. My art is signed with my name. I'm openly trans and pre-everthing online, so no, I'm not ""catfishing"". The internet is the only place I have to be me.

I'm turning 18 very soon and I got into a college to study animation. My family disapproves. They want me to join the Army. I've been hiding my art from them because all this ties together. My dream job, the furry community (yes they've helped me the most in everything), and me as a transgender person. I would consider staying with them and taking online courses (which would be much more financially stable, I don't know how I'd survive considering that I'm moving with my family to another country right now) if I no longer had to hide, or if I could just get help.

I've created a folder with the work I'm most proud of and I'm putting together a few points to talk about. I don't think I could start this myself considering what's happened before, so I'm writing them by hand and putting them in the folder to open a discussion.

I'm also confessing my online presence - I'm not really supposed to be anywhere online (the pedophiles) but I post my art anyways. I've gained some following and I've met some great people along the way.

the_omega99,asktransgender,Advice for convincing doctor to start HRT sooner rather than later,"&lt;insert long, generic sob story about how shitty GD makes me feel here&gt;

I've got an appointment with my doctor tomorrow. It's the second appointment with her. She has some experience with trans patients (I don't know any of them). First appointment disappointingly turned out to be more of a ""meet and greet"", where she asked many questions about me, my family, and the feelings of dysphoria. Then was told to setup another appointment (which turned out to be almost two months later).

When I inquired about a timeline, she mentioned a 6 month figure. I'm not really sure exactly what she's waiting for, whether it's an estimate based on the number of appointments she needs to make her diagnosis (which I'm worried would take even longer because she told me to setup an appointment in a month, but reception couldn't get anything like that) or if she insists on ""being sure"" or what.

Anyway, long story short, the wait is mentally killing me. A big thing I had to look up to in the past month is that I could start DIY in the mean time, but now I'm unsure if I can even get access to that. My dysphoria seems stronger, I'm more depressed, and a lot more distracted. My work suffers, and so on. Point being, I hate, hate, hate this delay and it's frustrating me like nothing else.

I'm looking for advice on how to convince her to cut it out and help me instead of leaving me untreated for however long it takes her to be sure of herself (while here I've long since been sure of myself, but that apparently doesn't matter).

Would it be a good idea to pretend I've already started DIY in hopes that she'd switch me to a legit prescription? Is there an ideal level of frustration I should exhibit? While it feels wrong to lie, it feels far worse to leave this untreated, so I'm not against lying. Please help.

**TL;DR: Appt with doctor tomorrow. Looking for ways to convince her to accelerate her HRT timeline.**"
Mimiopins,asktransgender,"I made a mistake, what now?","Alright, so to get the backstory out of the way I'm 16 MtF pre-everything, known since I was 15, Mother thinks it's a phase, thinks I'm not feminine enough, out to all my friends, all accepting, female friends call me by my girl name, live in the UK

Now, onto the meat of the matter.

So I go to a senior version of scouting in the UK once a week. I love it, and a lot of my male and female friends go there with me feeling like I can trust everyone there. So one of my friends brought some of her rejected clothes to the meeting. I put them on and came out to everyone not in the know, saying no photos don't spread etc. and it all went well. Sure I got a couple of odd looks and some people were a bit weirded out, but no one was abusive or anything. Issue was that my mother noticed my wig and several socks were missing and turned up practically in tears.

She was worried that it would spread, that I'd be bullied into the ground and is just being so pessimistic. Also says I'm not feminine enough so how can I be sure, etc. etc. My method was so botched, I could've done so much better, and now my mother is never going to let me do anything feminine in the next couple of years until I turn 18. All my female friends are probably going to have their access to me limited and I'm already being prevented from doing things, and she is SO convinced it will spread and I've ruined all my chances in life, and I just want to know how the hell I'm going to cope for these next two years with that bitch of a parent I have looming over me, judging my every move. She just thinks I'm her little autistic special snowflake (not even officially diagnosed) who can't understand that he's going through a phase and is being egged on and misled by his slutty friends that she needs to protect and guide.

She then found my hormones in the drawer of my side table and started researching them while I was gone. 

I came home this morning to see that she'd cleaned a bit and I immediately began to panic. She said that she'd needed to speak to me, which she *never* does so I immediately knew she'd found them. 

We spoke about them on her bed. She started going on and on about how she was worried about my future, how the family would take it, how it would've been easier if I'd've just been gay. She started asking about my sexuality as well and I initially cut her off because she was confused with the terms. Eventually I explained to her how sexuality would work in regards to being a trans woman that likes other women and I think eventually grasped what I was saying. 

She said that she was worried that people would make comments/judge and that the family wouldn't take it well, and that she didn't think she could know me as anything but her son, she wanted me to see a second doctor for safety but also that she still loved me regardless and that even know she didn't fully accept/understand what I'm doing, things wouldn't change. 

I'm still trying to process everything that just happened this morning, and I came home exhausted with the intention of getting rest so I think that honestly made things a bit easier. Also sorry for all of this, I just needed to vent and this is the only place I really can. "

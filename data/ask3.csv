starshipsolar16,asktransgender,"I feel like i'm stuck in a weird middle ground, need advice.","Hello, so i'm a trans woman that just started HRT around two months ago, and i wanted to share some thoughts about some things that i don't really know how to deal with.

First of all, it's about my name. I haven't picked one yet, and i'm still somewhat clueless on how to pick the one right for me. I never felt any connection between my birth name and myself, it feels like my ID it's just a tool to deal with bureaucratic things, it does not represent me at all. If someone tries to call me by my birth name i have to consciously remind myself ""oh right that is my birth name, i should answer"", and at the same time i feel like i'm in this weird void of being a nameless human. It just feels so weird like if i had amnesia and i'm on a quest to find what is my true name, and i have no idea what it's gonna be or how to deal with this.

Transition is so scary. Honestly, it just recently hit me that i feel a huge mix of happiness and fear. I wonder what's gonna happen from now on, will i pass or not. Is possible to pass as a guy even after a year of hrt? I feel like i need to take things slow and adjust my life accordingly. To me it's so incredible that transition is even possible, it blows my mind every now and again. I don't even wanna get started about SRS, it scares the shit out of me even though i don't like my genitals, like it's not like they're are going to gradually change, it's a sleep-wake up and ta da you have a vagina now. It's so, like, wow, it would be amazing but i can't help but be scared.

I honestly feel ashamed of my body. I don't really go to places where i have to take my clothes off, like beaches or pools. It just doesn't work, i get too uncomfortable. Will this change in the future? I honestly don't know.

I also feel like other girls are carrying way more baggage than i could possibly have since they were able to grow up properly. Like i accidentally skipped life's tutorial and went straight to the real game, and now i don't know the controls. All this time if something happened i always thought to myself ""how should i react to that? i'm gonna see how other people react and copy accordingly"" like i'm creating a small rule book to interactions so i don't actually express myself legitimally, i'm just following the protocol. 

Now i know i can finally express myself truly and i'm honestly anxious. I feel vulnerable, like all those little rules i created were a huge shell, protecting my inner self, that i learned to be comfortable inside because it was so fake and nobody got in touch with my true feelings, and now i'm out and raw. What the hell.

Thanks for reading."
potatochocolate,asktransgender,Swimming as MtF trans?,"I've only recently started HRT so I my body hasn't changed much yet and I'm not out to anyone. But I do shave all over and have a pretty slim/feminine body as it is, but hide this with clothing. This summer is super hot in Australia and lots of Christmas presents have been stuff for the pool... I know friends or family are going to suggest going to the pool/beach. How do I avoid this without seeming antisocial?"
ReimiS,asktransgender,"Dammit... I really need to cut my Mom off, but I have nobody else close to me... (explicit language)","So, yet another argument, her telling me to lay off the ""Liberal Propaganda"" and shoving my opinion down other's throats because I am fucking terrified of a ""President"" Trump and a Republican majority, she is one of his biggest cheerleaders, and fully buys into the propaganda that Obama is a Muslim that destroyed America. There is no reasoning with her, anything to prove otherwise is just a Liberal lie.

So I flat out told her to look through every site she shares a post from, every person and look for transgender stuff, and if it is negative, cut them off and stop listening to them. Her response ""It's not accepted in America, what you are doing is not accepted..."" I fucking hung up at that point. 

I'm not getting into a shouting match over my right to exist, and she honestly thinks she is being very supportive of me, and I can't tell her otherwise... and I'm just crying my eyes out right now because I want to just pack up and leave for a better area, but I have no means to, and I am still mid transition, legal stuff is just a week away if things go well, and I still need her to help with that...

cdortrans,asktransgender,Crossdressing doesn't excite me anymore?,"I've been into crossdressing since I Was 6 years old. Weather I like doing it constantly varies. 


I started crossdressing again when I was around 12 years old, but I always liked crossdressing in outfits rather than undewear, but it was more than a fetish or anything.


When I started to think I might be trans a few months ago, I've lost interest in crossdressing. Sure, I'd like to wear a dress or something in public, but doing it in private isn't the same, and it doesn't turn me on either.  I like trying on dresses, tights, makeup, etc. but it isn't sexually exciting, nor can I really be bothered to do it anymore.



Did anyone experience this? I worry that I am a crossdresser and not transgender."
confusedasktransgend,asktransgender,What does this all sound like? PLEASE READ!,"I've been struggling with this for a VERY long time now (OVER TWO YEARS). I don't know whether I want to transition anymore. I don't know whether I am a transgender woman. I'm scared to go forward in my transition because what if i'm wrong? But, then i'm scared to not go forward in my transition in case i'm wrong aboutthis too and this would mean further masculinsation, which would mean it would be even harder to pass!

I am living as a woman and have been for over two years (and please don't say that I am definitely a transgender woman because cisgender men would not do this),I have a HRT letter (I can start HRT whenever I want, but like I said, I just can't!), I didn't hate living as a man and I have been contemplating going backwards and living as a man again because i'm so unsure and confused (but this would not go down well because of my living situation, so I don't think this is an option, I don't think!), I have very bad stress and anxiety and possibly have OCD and I cry whenever I think about this because I am just so confused and I don't know what to do!!

I always have fears of regret of things like regret of surgery, fears of what after years of irreversible surgery and hormones I find out I am not a transgender woman but in fact a gay cisgender man (which I happily and confidently came out as and I never, EVER doubted my sexuality), what if after marriage and children I discover I'm not transgender?

These thoughts are so overwhelming I cried earlier because I have no one to talk to and I've only seen my gender therapist once and got a HRT letter there and then and i don't feel like I can tell therapist's these things!! 

What should I do? What does this sound like to you?"
SeithDarkwraith,asktransgender,Do testosterone blockers feminize your body on their own?,"My current situation won't allow me to take HRT for another few years while my parents are adjusting to the fact that I am their daughter, not their son, (I'm stuck at home if I want a college degree career because I can live here for free) but sometimes testosterone in my blood drives me crazy, so would blockers be safe to take while waiting for HRT or would they cause me to look more feminine?"

I often feel like if I go on HRT and then come off it because I regret it or find out I'm not transgender then some people will probably give me a hard time because of it. And this stresses me out. I often do think I'm not transgender you see and now I'm concerned....

joiesnoi,asktransgender,Am I actually transgender or it this just a phase?,"So basically, I've been depressed since puberty. I was depressed and hated my body, but could never pin point why. I tried to lose weight to straighten my body and lose my breasts when I was 11. Also around this time, I would always wear my hair up and wear ""boys"" clothes. I went through a really girl stage at around 13, which was coincidentally the time when I felt the most self conscious. I hated myself so much and I wished that I could just be normal like all the other girls, which is why I started acting and dressing like them in the first place. At around 14, I was still very depressed and didn't know why. I got a boyfriend and felt SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE with him touching me ANYWHERE. I hated when he touched my hips, I hated when (he was also very manipulative and got me to do many things with him that I really regret) he would touch my boobs and ""down there"". I absolutely HATED IT and I had no idea why. I realized also that I had no interest in touching him, so that's when I came out as lesbian. That was an ok title for a little while, but it didn't quite fit. Now I'm 15. In late September, I saw a short film about a transgender boy, ftm, and thought,""nope, definitely not me"" and left it at that. I didn't even think about it again until I got my hair cut, boy short. I loved how it made my face look so angular. So...masculine. That's when I started researching and researching and watching YouTube videos on the subject. I had always been a HUGE tomboy for as long as I can remember, but never thought about gender, so this was all new and weird to me. At first, I thought I was lying for attention. Then the more I though, the more I felt like it was me. So about a week ago, stood in front of the mirror and said ""I am transgender, i am a boy"" and I smiled and laughed and cried and felt this tingling in my fingertips and UP my spine that told me it must be true. But now, I don't feel anything. The loathing I felt for my chest and my hips is gone. When I look at my body in the mirror, I just think that it's my body and I'm perfectly fine with it, why wouldn't i be? I don't know what's happening, has this happened to anyone else? It's like all the things that I classified as dysphoria are gone. Could this be because I worked on deepening my voice, grew out my body hair, and started dressing like a guy? I honestly feel like I made all of this up and I don't know what to do now..."
OverlordGearbox,asktransgender,Gender dysphoria caused by a fictional character?,"I was wondering if this happened to anybody else. Every time I see one particular character, weather officially as a part of the show, or fan art, I keep thinking I want to *be* her. She's so beautiful and in charge and generally awesome. 

I'm pretty sure this is genuine dysphoria.

Or I'm probably crazy, but a lot of people here say that. Is this just a simple case of projection?

Anyway, has that happened to you? What character?

matsumotokiyoshi,asktransgender,Specific questions about informed consent in NYC,"I used the search bar already and the answers I found were not consistent! I'm thinking if I can get informed consent I might as well just dive in or I'll be sitting on my feet for the rest of my life. Problem is, so poor! My insurance is worthless for this kind of thing, and I have practically no real income. 

My question is, is there any one place that is better than others for sliding scale informed consent stuff? One of the topics I found said they paid less than $100 for their first visit at Callen Lorde, but another post said to expect to pay at least $1000! So which is it!? 

I know, I should call them again. I plan to, but in the meantime I'm asking here. I know there are other places like IHI, cklife, apicha and mount sinai. Is there anything to be said about the startup costs at any of those places that hasn't been said in a million other threads? I'd really just like the have the option to start HRT right away once I have more money coming in, but I realize I'm probably asking for the moon. I JUST had blood work, can't I just give them the results from that? It had nothing to do with hormones though, so obviously not...

[deleted],asktransgender,Am I a crossdresser or a transgender.,"For many years since about the age of 10-11 I have liked to wear womens clothes, they make me feel more alive and like I'm my true self, but I done this in secret. I'm now 22 and still secretly crossdress, when I am left alone all I can think about is dressing up and being a woman and don't even think of a being a man of which my current sex is. 

I get easily aroused when in women's clothes and to ejacuate but then the feeling goes I undress but within minutes I want to be that same female I just was, I'm straight and don't look at men the way I look at women but the thought of being a woman attracted to woman gets me aroused and sometimes feels normal. I have been out once or twice as a woman and I really enjoyed it. 

Just looking to see if any one could help with some answers, I felt like there was something different about since it all started just seeing if anyone could shed some light on wether I'm just a crossdresser or I'm a transgender. I still haven't told anyone due to not knowing how people will react."
SynthiaNguyen,asktransgender,Should I come out to my friend online?,"Hi, mtf here. I've recently made a female friend about a werk ago playing games online. When we met, i told her that I didn't own a microphone due to my fear of her hearing my male voice. Over the course of the week we spoke alot about life and other things. (Using text chat of course). Point is, i feel like she treats me better than my friends in real life and I genuinely think of her as my best friend, despite knowing her for a short period of time. So last night after our usual gaming session, she starts talking about her love interest and starts ""venting"" to me. Afterwards she says that I'm the first girl shes spoken to that won't makes her tear her brains out. This got me to feel guilty, knowing that i would never be a ""real"" girl and was debating whether to come out at that time or not. In the end i didn't, but i have this sad feeling of wanting to speak and be honest with. I genuinely want to stay as her friend, but am unsure of how she would react. What should i do?

Gothrenapp,asktransgender,T-blockers/supplements,"When I first discovered myself as transgender I was told that T-blockers and hormones could be bought online or from drugstores.

Scummydog,asktransgender,Bad calculations; transition =/= math,"I've been mtf for......something, years now, I can't remember. In the past few days I've reflected on my own mental shortcomings and I wondered to myself if it were mathematically feasible to say to myself ""yes, my goals are cleared.""

**NO WAY!** 

Obviously there's too much about transitions that make it as simple as pi. Or is it? What can I quantify and what can I leave as a variable?

Now I'm not here to present any useful theories, this was just a moment of boredom that should've been killed but survived and mutated into a I don't even know. I considered as many factors as I could; starting with getting someone's opinion. This is going to be a problem area of course as every person is subjective, so I asked an older MtF friend her opinion, asking about surgeries, voice, and anything she could think of and here's what I got:

*""You're very feminine. The only thing is sometimes when you walk you look like you're marching.""*
&lt;insert fist shake at service history here&gt;
*""And your voice sounds like an old Jamaican woman.""*

God dammit I'm not even 35 yet. But when I mentioned fixing my walk she said it's not relevant and I'd just end up overdoing it. On cosmetic procedures she shot down every single suggestion, which my hairdresser also did. Both of them insisting that I'd just ruin myself/not needed. Now I really don't know what they hell they're looking at cause I can't see any such thing. Which brings me neatly into the following: self esteem = 0. There's our first number. Although zero is a bit annoying to use. If the other stuff equates to 1 for good and 0 for no good then appearance + voice - self esteem = 1. No more zero!

What about non friendly factors? When was the last time I was clocked that I'm aware of? That would be July 2014. Sounds great and all but the event was a child, and kid honesty is pretty savage. I'd say that's worth more than 1, it's worth 5. So now it's 1-5? Not quite. The little boy actually said, 

*""are you a boy or a girl""*

Ok, but maybe that reduces it to 4? Not sure about that, he did ask while I was wearing a swimsuit. I'd say this is now a variable: 1 - f(x)^2. Squared for the potency of kid honesty.

Now for the absolute values: measurements. For this one I ""borrowed"" a friend who's a fitness instructor and did comparative measurements, which is really not mentally healthy. Mostly because she drank all my vodka. Surprisingly though I came up with either matching or similar numbers, I found it surprising that the thigh circumference was the same for both of us. Her conclusion after all this was that she could give me some of her clothes, a nice gesture except that there is a height difference. So her stuff is tight on me. In fact it's unusable. And at 6ft, the measurements aren't as visually clear as they are for her 5'10"" level. So then that gives me measurements at 3, for the 3 sizes, multiplied by height, but at a factor of 1/6th. so 3 x 0.6? Ummm no. I'm actually not personally satisfied with my waist measurement, and although I used to be very upset that I'll never have any hips I've come to terms with that fate. So it's  1 - f(x)^2 + 2 * 0.6 = y

Finally for the absolute goals. I've never done any knife work for my transition and I don't want to have male genitals. So at some point I've got to get the reassignment surgery done. If only it was cheaper. Because that's an absolute goal that's not done that leaves with [|1 - f(x)^2 + 2 * 0.6| / 4 - c] = y

So I had my math. I mentioned all of this to my younger sister, who isn't a fan of math at all, and she said simply, 
*""you look like and sound like a girl so shut up and stop comparing yourself to some Photoshop crap. Grow some self esteem for fks sake.""*

**tl:dr** In the end there's no math to help you be happy with you. But rather than be happy can I just be comfortable? I don't know where I went wrong. Besides the terrible mathematics. I'm not having an easy time of breaking the way I think either, and it's starting to get to me. Changing the way my mind works, though, is a bit extreme. But I can't follow the usual uplifting statements about having confidence, you're your own beauty, etc. I've become too used to using numbers. 

Sorry if I tread on any toes here with this, I'm not subtle enough for most things. That's my crap excuse!"
Jadetsu,asktransgender,Has anyone come up with transpuns?,"Basically just post any trans-related puns you have made up or heard from someone.

My personal favorite is ""transwarmer"". Because my signifigant other uses me as a warmer a lot xP"
squigglydash,asktransgender,Broken record,"As I'm typing this I'm worried that I have asked his question before. I don't want to sound as if I am repeating myself but I have something to say.

I very frequently ask myself if I am happy the way I am... in this body. I crossdress occasionally, I even came out to some people as genderfluid. The real problem is: I can't tell if what I am feeling is the same as 'being trans' or if this is a mood-based thing, or a fetish, or if I just like crossdressing. All in all, I am comfortable staying the way I am. There is nothing that makes me feel like I NEED to transition, I only feel that my ideal self is a woman. Maybe it's a vanity thing. I have quite low self-confidence in general, maybe I want to be a woman because in my eyes it will make me pretty or desirable. I have trouble opening up about it to the people I know because I feel embarrassed to talk about it. I feel like if I call myself trans I have to transition or be 100% sure about myself. The truth is, I doubt I will ever 100% know what my gender is. 

I would be more open about this stuff if I knew that dressing as a woman would help me. In my eyes, when I'm wearing a dress, or leggings, or anything at all feminine, I come across as a creep or a weirdo. Not because I think everyone hates trans people, but because I am not sure, it just doesn't feel right to me and I project that feeling onto those around me. To summarise, I am not confident enough to confront my fear and open up about how I want to present myself, trans or not.

Any response would help. Tell me your stories. Thanks"
armageddontomato,asktransgender,Has HRT made you feel lazier? (Unrelated to mental health),"MtF here; pre-HRT I had a real difficult time relaxing. Always felt the need to be up and moving, to be productive even on my days off, or if I already had a ton on my plate. I would feel guilty if I wasn't doing something. Even if I told myself, ""okay on day X you are just going to veg out,"" it would never happen and O would be mad at myself over it.

I've just hit my 3-month mark on 100 mg Spiro and 2 mg Estrace (recently bumped up to 200mg and 3mg, respectively. Yay!) and the notion of ""chilling out"" has come a lot easier to me this month. I can wake up and lay in bed for another half hour or so, flop on the couch (or floor) and just play video games for a while - no guilt attached. 

Essentially, feeling as though it has now been easier to ""live in the moment"" than stressing over what's not getting done. 

Anyone else have similar experiences here? Should be noted, I've also been doing a lot of spiritual work (mindfulness meditation and self-awareness training) alongside my transition, so that may have played a factor, also.

Looking forward to your perspectives. :)"
Dani_Anna,asktransgender,Have any of you experienced hesitation prior to starting HRT?,"The answer is probably a yes, but im curious to what severity.

Transitioning is something I always dreamed about but I never thought possible.  However, tomorrow im likely going to get a prescription for hormones from my doctor and im starting to get cold feet.

I worry that doesnt make me ""trans"" enough, and that maybe I should just live as a guy...

I'd like to hear all of your stories. :)"
BrightEyes04,asktransgender,To be or not to be?,"Hello.  
 I have been on gender therapy and HRT for a year now, at first it was a low dose and gradually it went higher, I started with gel, then patches and now i am on estradiol valerate injections. The only changes I am seeing so far is a development on my breast.  
But beside all of that the problem for me is that I am still not sure if I am transgender. As a kid I liked to imagine that I had a vagina and a couple of times used to wear my mothers clothes, but that is it. I still present as a male and live as one and think as one. I am quite hairy and my mannerisms are pretty masculine. I don't feel quite uncomfortable with that most of the times.  
I know a lot of this is or could be related to gender construction but what confuses me the most is that i *think and feel* as a male most of the times.  
 I don't feel the necessity to wear make up or to dress as a girl even though I love how girls look and sometimes I feel jealous but I know that will never look like that and I really don't feel part of that.  
I feel really fucked up, I been depressed since puberty (I am 27 now). I had a very traumatic experience when i was 9 years old. I was with a neighbor of the same age and talking about kissing males and his father hear me and started yelling and insulting me and how he was saying that he was going to tell everyone about it and I came back shaking to my house really bad but that was it. I never heard another word about it from anyone so I tried to cope with it trying to fit on what he told me and society tells you.  
Now I don't know what reality means for me. I know I am not an hetero cis gender male but I don't think that I can live as a female either, maybe something in between. I always had trouble getting hard when i m with a girl but I love having sex with them though in a lesbian way. With other trans girls I am passive.  
I just don't want to live like this anymore, I am so tired of everything and not knowing who I am. I feel that the experience I had on my childhood fucked me up so bad. Maybe I am just gay since I used to fantasize with men when I was a kid and i completely blocked my desire and I am trying to express my self in a mistaken way.  


Sorry for my shitty english.

transpunk93,asktransgender,Quick question to those that go to Callen-Lorde and got their gender change letter from them,"So I have an appointment with my doctor at Callen-Lorde next week and I was originally planning to ask her directly about getting my gender change letter in the hopes that she can get it done right then and there so I can get started on updating all my things. However, I recently checked their website and saw on [here](http://callen-lorde.org/care-coordination-services/) that gender change letters can take up to four weeks through a case manager.

My question is: those of you who go to Callen-Lorde and got your gender change letter from there, did you have to go through a case manager or were you able to directly ask your doctor for one? And if you did go through a case manager, how long did it take for you to get your letter?"

I've never liked it. I know this question, or some form of it, has likely been asked a plethora of times before. I think some kind of styling might make a difference. But am I pretty much stuck with what I've got or is there some way for it to grow longer/straighter?

cdortrans,asktransgender,"Strange dreams about being trans, almost like they are saying something to me?","Hi, 


In my dreams I often find that I am:

* Cis male, nothing about being transgender 

* I joke with someone about being trans, but I'm not actually. 

* Someone else comes out as transgender in my family 


I do not lucid dream. I have no control on what I dream. My dysphoria is a lot worse in real life than my dreams. The dysphoria in my dreams is either so minor or non-existent. I'm yet to dream about being a girl. 



For example :


Type 1 -  no dysphoria. Generally I wake up and I have no dysphoria for about 30 seconds until the thought that I might be trans comes into my head

Type 2 - Last night I dreamed that I was coming out to my sister about being transgender, except I was joking and making it up. 

Type 3 -  the other day I dreamed that my cousin came out as FTM (I'm MTF). In the dream I actually did have dysphoria. It was almost annoying having someone come out as trans, because it would make it harder for me to come out. 





Do you think these might mean anything? I find it weird that I have no dysphoria in my dreams whatsoever, like it's almost non existent.

DeadliestTulip,asktransgender,My estrogen is too high,"So my doctor just called me and said that my estrogen is really high. They can't order more until it gets lowered. I can still take my Spiro tho.

I still have some estrogen pills left too. Qty 3, 2mg a Qty 3 1mg pills left. Should I reduce my dosage to spread it out some?  I would normally take the 2mg and the 1mg plus the 200mg spiro.

I would think this would be a good thing tho because  doesn't that mean my body is like absorbing and accepting the estrogen? I dunno..."

I've been seeing a therapist for three sessions now, and when I asked about prescribing any HRT stuff he said that he couldn't do that. Not really that he doesn't want to; he agrees that I'm trans as hell. But apparently he doesn't have those credentials... or something? He couldn't even really tell me where to go, aside from saying I should ask people at the trans support group he referred me to (which doesn't meet for another 3 weeks...)

Kind of feel like I'm wasting my time, especially since this facility was one of few I found that treats people with ""gender identity disorder."" What the heck am I supposed to be looking for?

EDIT: Thanks for the responses, guys. I do so much research about this stuff, and it just gets frustrating when I still make a mistake on what I'm looking for :/"
maddiethehippie,asktransgender,I am forming a assistance group for Trans /Queer souls. Things I should think of?,"Good Day,

I am working on starting a group specifically for helping Trans / Queer souls that meet a set of criteria. Looking for things to do to go forward, things I am not thinking of, etc. Here is where we are at now:

Facebook Page up for notifications:
admin, publishing, and editor's tasked. 
Daily post's with tips and tricks for when you are in times of need. 
When there are people in need (case's) we can post for people to visit the group and they will see it on their feed. More of a public face, unlike the very closed group. 

Group: 
Closed and Private group with multiple moderators and administrators. 
Test case's have been run for different situations in multiple states to prepare the current group. 
One currently active case of a homeless FtM being worked, he is being advised decently. 

Current Group Rules:
Must be Trans/Queer/Ally
Must be Trans / Queer to ask for assistance and open a case. 
Must either be invited or administrator approved to join. 
Situations are worked on a Case by Case basis
Privacy of each case is maintained by a very small group of administrators. 
No posts for personal assistance (go fund me for surgery for example).
No Political or News type posts allowed. 

Administrator Group:
Where the administrators can talk and share information about the current case's, goals/ tasks, and links/procedural stuff. 

The basic idea is that I have been homeless and people helped me, but there wasn't a central place for me to reach out. I got very lucky to find the people that helped me. I want for there to be a place people to start, that's sole purpose is for relocation and safety. But we want to do this right, and the 120 member current group participants seem to be going about this the right way, so I am curious what kind of thoughts you all have? 

I will not post the name of the group as I want it to stay private and word of mouth for start. But gosh golly I would love tome feedback!

Jazz8680,asktransgender,How to approach posture? (MtF),"I'm pre HRT and have been trying to explore my identity as much as I can. How do you approach posture? I think I have a very masculine posture and it's bumming me out. How do you go about studying posture? What are some things I can change about the way I hold myself to make me look more feminine? Like, if I'm just standing somewhere doing nothing, what do I do with my hands? How do I hold my back? Like, I don't know how to study posture "
babeunderseige,asktransgender,When crossdressing should I stuff to give myself bigger hips and butt?,"I am pre-HRT. 

I'm thinking of stuffing and taping fabrics underneath some yoga pants or something to give myself wider hips and a bigger bum.

If I can make it look realistic is it worth going out in public? Or should I try something else?"
AnaBanona,asktransgender,Lots of debilitating doubt right before HRT appointment,"So today at 3 I'm supposed to see a specialist about getting HRT. If I understand correcrly, I may even walk out with hormones. I've spent these past days and weeks so proud and happy about coming to terms with my identity, so why am I feeling so many doubts now?

I keep questioning to myself stuff like, ""what if I want my own kids?"" ""What if I'm not ready for my gentiles to shrink?"" ""What happens if I start and it feels so wrong instead of right?"" ""What if I'm wrong and I've got some sexual hang up and I've been distracted with three wrong issue?""

But then again why would I spend nights crying into my pillow because all I want is a feminine body and I hate my own? Why do I feel strong un-ignorable envy of pretty women? I get upset that people treat me like I'm a guy and wish they assumed I was a woman. 

I mean, I can go on and on with the list of typical ""you're trans"" stuff, but why all this doubt now? I used to be so scared because I knew this would be hard. Now I feel scared cause I'm not as sure it's right any more. 

Should I just go to the appointment, get the hormones, and see what happens? I'm a bundle of nerves and questions. I guess mostly I'm just venting but I'd really like to see some discussion of similar feelings around this point in transition. 

I love you guys so much  &lt;3"
MahoniaCrotalus,asktransgender,Do any bodyparts shrink on hrt?,"I've always been particularly dysphoric about my hands, they're really wide. I'm also curious in general I've heard is possible to loose some height but I assumed that was due to your pelvis rotating.

misscitylife91,asktransgender,YESON Voice Feminisation Surgery Questions.,"When people talk about the surgery being risky...is there any recorded case of surgery going bad and resulting in damaged speaking abilities? It just seems as I've read it only happens that people don't experience any changes after recovery not actually have any other issues.

Is there any publicly avalible statistics that shows how many times surgery goes wrong at YESON?

Also...does this surgery when performed sucsessfully have a lifetime lasting effect or does over time voice drop back?

Did any of you have the surgery and what were your expectations and the end result?"

RobynAgain,asktransgender,How has your thinking evolved on SRS?,"I'm almost a year into transition, all is well. I do not suffer from genital dysphoria, although I'm fairly ambivalent about what I have. I notice that I've recently felt a shift in how I feel when I consider SRS.  I feel more connected to the sensations in my body when I imagine having a pussy and being penetrated. 

When I talk to my friends who have had SRS, they are people who have had genital dysphoria since they can remember and for them SRS is a huge relief. This certainly makes me question my own motivations. I also know many non-Op trans women who are quite happy. 

As I look ahead to living a life as a woman with an external phallus diminished by HRT, who also likes to be penetrated, it starts to look like an attractive and logical choice to have vaginoplasty.  I've never written it off completely, but instead set aside the idea for my future self after a few years on hormones and living as a woman. 

Certainly the current political climate and the tenuous nature of health insurance, even in my state of California, makes the question more urgent. But I'm loathe to make life and body altering decisions for fear of a GOP future.

So how has your thinking evolved as you transition?  "
TheWalkingSadness,asktransgender,Why the heck should I care about my gender?,"Sorry for this. but I'm going crazy. sorry for the long thread.

The thing is. these days both woman and men can do the same. there's not much of difference between them.

Let me tell you a bit about myself:
I don't care about clothes even a tiny bit. I spend 10s choosing my dress before going out. I don't even style my hair. I don't care about my appearance even a tiny bit. about other's appearance either. I only care about the inside. I have no interest in cross-dressing. I would love to dye my hair purple btw :D
I'm more like chloe price in terms of style anyway.

all my clothes are literally gifts from others. I never shop for clothes. I usually tell my dad to buy me a pair of jeans like the current ones on his way home if my current ones tear apart or something.

I don't know how make up would feel but I assume it would be the same as clothes. (on a side note, it may sound weird, but I think make up barely makes cis girls look better, If anything it makes them look ugly, I don't have a huge preference in type of women other than how they think, but I think they look much much cuter naturally! unless they're really unlucky and are ugly, I have yet to meet an ugly girl in real life :) )

I don't care about how others see me as long as they don't pay much attention to me.

I like all colors so there's nothing girly even there. I don't have a favorite color

The way I feel about... well my physical attributes are not good. I hate body hair and I think my body parts are super disgusting, I also always felt weird about having a flat chest (weird, I know... even as a kid)  but come on. that's not a pretty part. I'm sure many guys feel the same. and who cares? I'll see it once a day during shower! that's not a huge problem.


also, I used to think I'm asexual during my teenage years (I'm still 17... so I'm talking about 12-17) and thought it was gross but now, I never thought about it but sex couldn't be bad if I was the girl! that's weird but it's also a side note. but anyway, If my partner is intrested in sex I would just deal with it once a week and pretend I like it! but anyway. Help me I'm burning alive! 

yet.... I can't get rid of this feeling. I have tried everything you can imagine (from accepting myself as a feminine man, just being who I am without thinking, or forcing myself to be masculine) and non of them work. I still can't get rid of that sensation.

TL:DR
I wake up and the first thought I have is gender dysphoria. I turn the TV on I see a movie called ""mother"" and get incredibly anxious. I go outside and feel bad that all the other people and girls are having fun without having to care about their gender. I can't get rid of this feeling. Why should I care about my gender? this is an illogical feeling. yet I do feel it.


I say to myself ""well there's no reason to be a girl! good case solved go take a shower"" then when I take off my clothes I see the cuts on my shoulder.... and struggle to take my well... clothes off. how can I lie to myself? everything is wrong! but why!?"""

installgentoo69,asktransgender,I have a trans-exclusive health plan (ibx personal choice hsa) and want to get down in the trenches to force them to cover srs. Is it worth it?,"The plan is administered through IBX PA. It boggles my mind that this is legal, and from what I can tell the ACA is very explicit that any plans that receive fed3ral funding *must* offer trans inclusive care. How do I find out whether ibx pa gets federal money, and if they are violating the aca, how do I get them to change their policy? I wouldn't mind court, but I don't have the money for a lawyer. I called them previously and was told that SRS would not be covered, and use a prescription discount card i found in a doctors office to get hormones affordably."
kernalmustache,asktransgender,Weight Distribution Question,"I've been on estrogen since September (so about 3 1/2 months) and I've started to gain weight on my belly. Is it normal for trans girls to gain weight on their belly and then later have it move to other areas of their body once their hormones levels get into the female range? I know I haven't been as active as I should have been over the past month, but I can't imagine that would cause so much of a change because I was barely more active before."
lanadara-coco,asktransgender,A question about Progesterone (Prometrium) side effects,"Five days ago I started taking 100mg of Prometrium twice a day. The second day is when the ghastly side effects kicked in. It felt like I was sick; mild nausea, fatigue, drowsiness, achey, headaches, and I had crazy nightsweats the other night. But yeah, I'm not even functionable because I feel so awful, I've been staying inside this whole time. Not to mention I look like absolute hell too. 

Has anyone else had these side effects with Prometrium? And if so, do they ever go away? Because at this point, if they don't, this isn't worth it."

Regrettably i currently i work for my dad (who is not okay with my transition) and i cant stay here much longer. I am just unsure if i should look for jobs as a guy or a girl. My voice still sucks and i don't exactly pass well so i scared shitless that job hunting will be too difficult in girl mode and would be much easier to get a job as a guy. 
 
Just wondering if anyone has any advice on:

1. If i apply for work as a guy how do i inform the interviewer that i would be going full time hopefully soon after?
2. I know job hunting always sucks but is it impossible if i haven't really gone full time yet? 
3. As i haven't changed my name yet if i apply for work as a girl how do i deal with my name on my resume when i apply and official documents if i get hired?
4. How do i deal with my voice if applying for jobs as a girl?

lordthadeus,asktransgender,My plan to self-med - will it work? aka How long does estradiol stay in the body?,"Hey guys I have a crazy plan. I recently started on injectables with my doc but I think my dosage is too low. I'm doing 0.5ml of 20mg/ml every two weeks. My doc set the dosage to try and replicate the 4mg daily oral I've been on since the beginning. For the record, my last estradiol levels were 84pg/ml. My doc thinks this is ""perfect"" but I think it's way to low since I've only been on HRT for 15 months and want a higher level to boost feminization during my second puberty. It pisses me off because I've been wanting to be on a higher dose of E since forever but none of my doctors will do it. Btw, I'm only 29 and fairly healthy. So here is where my self-medding plan starts. I have 6 refills for estradiol pills from my old doctor - I want to supplement my injectables with oral pills to get a higher estradiol level in my system. But when I get my levels tested again in January I don't want my levels to reflect my extra supplementation so my doc doesn't get suspicious or lower my already low dose. So here's my question: how soon before my blood gets drawn should I stop taking the extra pills in order for my levels to get back to what they'd be from injectables alone? Does that make sense? 

Thanks ahead of time!"

cloudydrearyday,asktransgender,I (a cisgender person) have a question about identifying as a femme transman.,"Hello, I'm a cis woman who has a question about the male transgender experience. I am a bit ignorant and want to be more understanding of genders other than cis, thank you to anyone who takes the time to educate me.

Recently I watched a YouTube video of a femme trans man. He wore jewelry and clothes in a feminine style, had a feminine name, had female sex organs (he spoke about getting an abortion and had breasts) and a feminine voice, and overall had a strongly feminine presentation – as you'd expect from someone who identifies as femme.

I know that a man can do any one of the items in my list above while still being a man, but I guess what I'm wondering is, if someone, overall, presents strongly as feminine (and feels most comfortable doing so) and has female biological markers, what is it about the male identity resonates with them vs. a female identity? "
amon_erin,asktransgender,Should I even bother taking my pills?,"Well, I'm pretty sure the reason I've been feeling the way I have for the last couple weeks is because my T is spiking. The way I've been feeling the last couple of weeks is basically how I felt pre-HRT, and pre questioning.

So I guess this probably means I am a cis guy. Nevermind the facts of everything I've experienced and felt, even while on HRT. 

When I had my levels checked a month ago they were good. And then a week later I changed pharmacies and hence manufacturers of my Spironolactone and Estradiol. I've felt different since then. 

I'm trying to get ahold of my doctor to get my levels checked, but yeah. I'm not sure if it's worth taking my HRT meds tonight because this has probably all been a waste of time. 

For the record, I'm 15 weeks in. 

So what do I do? "

QCAlexis,asktransgender,Blindness and dysphoria?,"I've been contemplating blinding myself lately as a method of alleviating my dysphoria.

I would never have to see myself in the mirror again. Never have to see another photo. Nor would I ever see the visage of another cis woman, something that triggers my dysphoria almost as much as my own body. After a while even my own memory of these things would begin to fade.

Obviously I would be making my life infinitely more difficult in other ways, but I don't have any real hope for the future anyways.

This probably seems absolutely insane to most people, but keep in mind that the only other alternative I am seriously contemplating at this point is suicide."

VioletJane,asktransgender,Questions about name changes!,"I saw the old meta thread containing the guide for having a name and gender change done and I've gone and filled out the name change document in my local circuit court. Something is really unclear, though, with two of the next steps.

The first question is about getting the gender change done with my social security card. I of course want to have this done, but I may have trouble getting the gender change form from my therapist in time for that. She is faxing one form to the DMV, but I may not be able to get to physically see her before I go to the Social Security office like next week. The other form is filled out and ready to be faxed and we are just waiting to put the date, and name(next question), on it for when the court document comes in the mail. So, is it super important to get the Social Security one done before any others? It doesn't show gender on the card, so I was going to put it off until after my next appointment with my therapist in 4 weeks.

Second question is about the DMV. I have the form [here](https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/webdoc/pdf/dl17.pdf) and the first line is the full legal name. This gets faxed in so it will be done before I go in to the DMV to get the new license with my name change. So, do they need my deadname on this form since I won't have changed it through the DMV yet, or do I use my new name since it will be my new legal name via the courts?

Thank you in advance and I hope all of you have the best New Years of your lives and a beautiful next year! I love you all on this sub!"

MisplacedLegolas,asktransgender,Body hair changing much faster than expected?,"I'm 29 MTF and six weeks into HRT, I'm on a really low starter dose (50mg Cypo &amp; 1mg E) and my endo told me not to expect much at all (if anything) until my dosage is increased.
  
It was quiet for the first few weeks, then I had a few weeks of extreme mood changes followed by breast buds developing over the weeks after that and things are moving quite fast there now.. I had mild gynecomastia as a teen, so I figure that's affecting that..
  
The biggest change was over the last two weeks.. one week I had dark thick chest hairs as usual (ew), the next week, it grew back really slowly as tiny blonde hairs, or not at all?! It's starting to happen to my arm hair now as well. I am beyond happy with this as body hair has been one of my largest sources of dysphoria, but now I am just worried that this is some weird response to hormones and the hair is going to grow back again all gross in a couple of weeks :( Does this happen? am I being stupid?

themaritimeman,asktransgender,"DAE lose their drive to transition whenever they ""let themselves go?""","So I've been on HRT for 2 weeks as of tomorrow, and I'm super happy and feel good and everything. I've been noticing something interesting for months that happens to me under certain circumstances. If I get really lazy and don't bother to shave for a couple of days, the drive and euphoria I have for transitioning fades away. And then once I catch up and clean myself up and look pretty again, it's all back to normal.

It's happened a few times, and every time it happens the feelings I get feel so genuine that I do a double-take and worry if I'm doing the right thing by transitioning. Then once I clean myself back up, I feel totally normal again, and relieved.

It happened this week, and it was the worst one yet. I'm an engineering student and had a huge report due today, and I skipped showering and shaving for 4 days while I got it done (yeah I know, disgusting). For the last couple of days, as I gained a full beard and everything else, my gender dysphoria/euphoria/whatever totally went away, and I became genuinely worried and started wondering if I should talk to my endo about lowering or eliminating my dose of E. And then when I finally showered and shaved this morning, I felt totally normal and pretty again and took a bunch of selfies, and all is well. It's so weird.

Repressing who you are and burying your self expression only to have it manifest into this dark destructive force.

Although It didn't help that the Obscurious character was (seemingly) killed in the middle of the main characters trying to calm him down and talk through his pain. Yet they didn't seem too upset about it. I wasn't sure what message the movie was trying to send. ""Whoops, this guy's damaged beyond repair. Fuck him""

Something no one tells you/observation: I have never felt so connected to someone in everyway. Like honestly I felt so emotionally good after it was amazing.

To expand a bit: 

No we do not normally go 3 months without sex, with me starting HRT and being extremely busy at work we just honestly haven't gotten to it. This wasn't a point of stress for us and we were still close and spent time together. 

I orgasmed twice, something that has never happened.

numlock1,asktransgender,"How to reduce testosterone, but keep weight up?","Right now, my body is far too masculine(16 y/o),with muscles bulging a lot( arms at a 90 degree angle without flexing has biceps bulge about a inch.) and I have a metabolism issue( I am 104 lb, and muscle makes up a very large amount of that weight) which means I have to have huge intakes of protein, and meats and basically everything else that dumps testosterone in my body. ADHD medications make the need for protein intake supplies more intense. Also, my parents are super transphobic, and would kick me out of the house if the found me out(yeah i'm a real handful, I know). Basically, I need a way to discreetly intake larger amounts of estrogen, and slow down the colossal testosterone intake/dampen it so HRT/FFS is more smooth in the future. Also, a way to lessen the hunks of muscle all over my body, or workouts, or ANYTHING will work here, and my goal is to make HRT easier in the future. Possibly a way to gain fat?

Ps-Sorry if the main idea is distorted and hard to read. I have ADHD(PI) to deal with on top of all this.

TLDR- I need a way to discreetly modify my diet and lifestyle to make HRT easier, and trim down muscle, all without losing too much weight, maybe gaining fat.

emveesprelude,asktransgender,I just want to be who I am.,"I'm crying so hard. Why did it take me 21 god damn years to realize this? Why did I wait for my body to fully masculinize before even questioning my gender seriously?

I didn't even grow facial hair for the last 20 years and now that I've realized I hate it and never want it on my face ever, I begin growing it. 

Why didn't I see all the signs that were right in front of me growing up? Why didn't I ever discuss this with anyone ever? Why do I suppress myself so hard that when I show even the tiniest bit of emotion I break down crying because of how amazing it feels? Why am I still not doing anything about how I feel?

I feel so stuck. I'm too chickenshit to ask my therapist about hormones for fear of them telling me no and me having a nervous breakdown. I'm hopeful in some regards that I have small bones and I'm short and still young, but then I hear my voice or look at my brow bone or my hairline and I'm scared that the rest of my body will follow suit and become a big ole masculine mess before I've gotten a chance to stop it, and my dreams of being a girl will be crushed forever. :(

Sorry for the rant, folks. Just having an emotional breakdown. I just want to be a girl and wish I was born one and I'm super pissed at myself for being so deep in the closet that I've practically been living in fucking Narnia for 2 decades.

TransOCD,asktransgender,"Any trans people on hear with OCD? Do I sound like I have OCD or am I just transgender woman who is also a lesbian, as I'm so confused?","I've had to keep deleting the post's because I kept misspelling the title, sorry!

I've been living as a woman for the past two years and I've always doubted if I was actually a transgender woman. I've been using female pronoun's, using a female name, basically just living like a cisgender woman for the past two years. But, I'm going to be starting HRT soon and I keep getting these doubts of ""what if I'm not really transgender"", ""what if I regret transitioning later in life"", ""what if it's just OCD making me think that I'm a transgender woman"", things like that. I have never been diagnosed with OCD because I've never thought to see someone about it, but I also have been doubting things like my sexuality. For example I keep getting thoughts of ""am I a lesbian"". An example of this is when I look at a woman and I look at her boobs for example I think ""why am I looking at her boobs? Am I a lesbian"". The lesbian thoughts started when Gigi Gorgeous who is a transgender woman on YouTube who is also a lesbian came out as a lesbian (well I had them a little before, but they got worst after this, i think)! That's when they started! I was thinking ""what if my sexuality changes on HRT? I want to fall in love and be with a man. How do I know that I might think that I like men or even marry a man and think I love him but subconsciously I am a lesbian"". I also struggle with the admiring vs being attracted to women thing. For example, I don't want to have sex with women or have a relationship with women. I don't really get along with many women (is this a bad sign? Maybe I'm rejecting I'm a lesbian since I don't get along very well with many women? Is that possible). Do these intrusive thoughts mean anything?"

luzinnie,asktransgender,"The more time I spend around women IRL, the more my ""transness"" goes away.

I didn't have a sister, my mom wasn't a big part of my life, I've never really had any girls who were friends let alone girlfriends. 

But lately since I've started losing weight and I got a new job, I've actually been talking to women way more than I ever have in my life. I'm nowhere near to the point of dating one, but I've made a lot of friends. And every time I come home from hanging out with a woman, I start to feel more manly and i lose an urge to crossdress.

throwaway_norge,asktransgender,Scalp Scarring after FFS.,So I've pretty much decided to have FFS with Facial Team. I am planning on having the forehead recontouring plus immediate hair transplant.

sloppyocelot,asktransgender,An open letter to the cashier at the grocet store.,"Hi. 

You just checked me out. In multiple ways. 

Sure you rang up my items. 

A can of Arizona Mucho Mango juice (tea?) and a bag of Pepper Beef from PF Chang's home menu selections.

But you were also eyeing me up. 

And I liked. 

Your akward flirting was quite endearing. 

The small talk on one hand was boring as fuck.

 But I didn't care. I found it easy to talk to you. 

That doesn't happen all that often. 

5 minutes passed until I remembered that I left my car running in the parking lot with my sister in it. 

The best/worst part came next when you asked me for my snapchat. 

21st Century Romance(TM)

Then I knew I had to leave. 

I left very quickly after that in a cold stifled curtness.

You looked dissapointed.

I looked it too. 

It could have concievably be interpreted as rude.

You might have known I was trans. You might not have.
 
But I was scared of the reaction you might have when you eventually found out if the path that I imagined things happening materialized. 

Because you are a man. 

That's an unfair prejudice I am aware.

But it's hard to not be scared sometimes. 

You were sweet and I would have liked to know you. 

I'm sorry.

Also I am wondering if you are pleased with your results or if there were any problems for you from starting on it early.

I have started transition almost 3 months ago, and I would really like to add micronized progesterone to the mix, but I am wondering if I should still wait, or if there is no harm in starting soon.

Thank you :D!

FTMAimingHigh,asktransgender,FTM wanting to join the Air Force?,"I've tried to do some research but I'm not finding much out there. Sorry if any of these questions seem stupid, I'm hoping somebody here has some knowledge on the subject.

Here's some background information: I'm a 19-year-old FTM transgender living in TN. I've been living as male since the eighth grade thanks to my awesome parents. I have been on Testosterone for 1 year and plan to have top surgery sometime in 2017. Bottom surgery is strongly desired but not currently feasible. I live my day-to-day life relatively stealth, with only close friends and family knowing, and IMO fit-in well with the guys. I've been wanting to join the military since I was a young lad and the Air Force appeals to me the most.

1. When would the ideal time be to enlist? I was thinking I could attend community college for two years (with the scholarships available to me I'd be going basically for free so I'm not worried about anything financially), work on my transition (especially top surgery and gender markers), and prepare myself physically (I can definitely pass the female PT standards but I want to perform exceptionally as a male). Doing this would also allow me to see the imposed guidelines on incoming transgender troops, whenever released (if they haven't been already? I read a small article on transgender troops that are already serving but couldn't find anything about new recruits). However, I'm worried about all of this being reversed and transgender troops no longer being allowed to serve before I even have the chance to try.

2. I currently have a misdemeanor for possession of a Schedule VI drug. After successfully completing one year of probation (I'm currently three months in), my sentence will be deferred. Will this, plus the entire trans situation, disqualify me?
 
I believe those are my only two questions for now. I appreciate any and all help and if anybody just wants to throw some advice my way please feel free!"

thr0wawayjdjeiiek,asktransgender,"Recognized stealth co-worker from online, should I (also stealth) say anything?","I'm changing some details so don't worry if this sounds like you, it isn't!


A new co-worker seemed familiar to me but it wasn't until now, two weeks later, that I realized I recognize her from an online trans community (I'm 100% certain it's her).  I've never spoken to her directly but I've read her posts and found some of them really helpful when I was in the middle of transitioning. My question is whether I should say anything to her, because I don't want it to be awkward if it comes out further down the line that I know. She's stealth at work and so am I. I would be fine with outing myself to her. 


In addition to that, I like working with her  and think there's friendship potential, too. Work friendships tend to be common here. And for background about our workplace, it's extremely accepting and several people have transitioned on the job, and a ton of people are openly queer, some are openly trans. Also my job and hers are like on the same level, so neither of us supervises the other or has input on the others job. 


I'm torn whether to say anything? Especially because I am more of a lurker online and paranoid about showing face or personal details, so she would not know me from online, whereas I recognize her which feels a little awkward but idk the best thing to do. Any thoughts?"
lyaa55,asktransgender,Coming out keeps making me start questioning again...,"So I've been on HRT for the last 3 months or so.  I feel pretty great about it and my life has improved markedly basically.  My dysphoria was always pretty subtle and it's been easing quite a bit.

I'm also basically 100% out at this point, even though i'm still using my old name with most people.  I told my mom recently and she was very accepting, way more than I had expected.

A lot of people I come out to seem to immediately just say ""OK"" in a way that it seems like it makes sense to them and they start treating me as like, their girlfriend and we probably get a lot closer.  

But a lot of others, mostly just my family, have had kind of ""are you sure"" reactions that make me respond like, ""oh shoot.  Am I sure?""  It doesn't help that my dysphoria was always quite subtle and is now very slight, on hrt and living how I want.

So there I was last night, scrounging my personal history for more definitive indicators.  And the evidence always seems both overwhelming and inadequate.  Like, I didn't ""always want to be a girl.""  I still don't feel like I want to be a girl.  I feel like I currently am a badass transsexual feminine dyke.  And I feel like I was a little kid who was waiting to be that previously.

I don't know.  Anyone relate?  Any advice?

coolmeia911,asktransgender,"I'm transgender, so why do I keep slipping up on others' pronouns?","I have a friend who is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns. They are biologically female, use a female name and always present very feminine. I aways try to use the correct pronouns around them, but when my mind thinks about them, it automatically connects to ""she.""

I am a transman who understands how it feels to be misgendered. I never want to misgender ftm or mtf, so I refer to people by what gender they choose to live as. However, even though they are nonbinary, there isn't enough of a difference for me to easily tell. I want to fix this. I hate having to correct my thoughts every time I think about them.

katiecuon,asktransgender,i forgot my hormones,"hello /r/asktransgender,

i'm amab and 4 months on hrt (and hiding). i'm noticing no changes yet save for a slight difference in my nipples/breasts.

both last night and this morning i forgot to take my hormones, which are hidden inside my pc case. how will this affect my transition? will this permanently hinder it?

i've always had the thought that changes are made in a certain time (1-2 years) and there's a point in time where development just stops (say, i'm 1.5 years in hrt, do my breasts just stop growing?). is this true? "
FindingAmberMae,asktransgender,How do you deal with people?,"So, for context I've been on hrt since the start of september, I don't ""pass"" all the time but I'm starting to look more feminine than masculine and usually people will assume I'm a girl up until I talk. I'd say I'm pretty visibly trans, regardless I have my name embroidered on my apron. 

Anyway, lately I've run into a wall. Since coming out, I'd say I've become reasonably comfortable with being openly trans. Like I said, I have my name on my apron and my coworkers call me ""she"" and ""her"" to customers. Generally speaking, people have been pretty cool about it. A lot of customers have picked up on it and have changed the way they talk to me, use my name and pronouns, etc. Some didn't know, and I've told them, and they've since stopped using any pronouns, and stopped using any name for me. But the group of people I'm talking about, are the people who are seemingly okay with it, but continue to deadname and misgender me. 

I have three specific examples of this happening. One time when a very privileged cis-male exclaiming ""Is [that] really this GUY's name?!"" From the front register, loud enough for everyone else in the store to hear him. This was humiliating, but I got to make him feel worse than me by telling him if there was a problem with it, he can address it  with me right there and then. He quietly collected his items and left. I won this round.

Also, one of my regulars saw my apron, said ""Amber mae? Haha you gotta see the humor in it, see ya later deadname"", and continues to deadname me after telling him there isn't humor in any of it. He isn't malicious, and I keep interactions short with him, because I know I can block out hearing him use my old name. I'd like for this to stop though, as I've gotten to the point where a lot of people haven't met me as old me, and only know me as Amber.

This last one happened today, and I'm still floored about it. A regular, that WAS one of my favorites (we shared stories every day, and was one of the only people I'd carry out a conversation with) noticed my name on my apron. To greet me he said ""Hey deadname, or Amber... It's kind of like you have split personalities"". 

I'm not sure if the last customer was trying to be rude, but at the least it was kind of ignorant. Being someone who suffers from mental illness, and feeling like my identity wasn't valid, or my presentation isn't good enough, I was pretty hurt by this. I just didn't say anything, and now I'm wishing I had...

Also, I've been asked which bathroom I use now, to which I had the pleasure of responding ""Why do you think our stores bathrooms are gender nuetral? I haven't used a gendered bathroom since 2013"".

So how do you deal with clueless/rude/hateful comments like this in a retail setting? I have worked in my current store since it's opening (more than 2 years), and we're reasonably high-traffic. I don't want to just up and say that I'm being harassed because I understand that these people have known me for 3 years (complete time with company, all in the same city) as someone I presented as, but I'm starting to become extremely uncomfortable with such high visibility that I can't find the words to defend myself. 

Tl;dr
How do you deal with cis people's clueless/potentially rude reactions, questions, and comments? (Bonus brownie points for dealing with it in a retail setting)"

I'm 36 and have a receding hairline. The hair is one of the things that bothers me the most. It's close to waist length and the hairloss situation is advanced enough that it's obvious when I've got it tied back. Basically it's getting hard to hide the ""triangles"" of hairloss.

bashfultransboi,asktransgender,There's a first time for everything but this one's got me all fucked up,"I’m going to do my best to not ramble about this issue and just lay out the skeleton as point blank as I can:

Met female friend about 2 years ago. We’re gonna call her Princess. Princess is a bigger, thicker girl, punk lesbian, into kinky stuff and mild pet play.

I have this issue where I cannot identify or perceive the difference between someone’s affection being friendly or romantic. 

Went to Princess’s Halloween party, known for its debauchery. Partcipated in a very tame group sex type thing (really just a few couples sharing the only room in the home where they could screw in peace). Ended up screwing a different friend and her boyfriend, and later Princess, too.

Princess really enjoyed that.

Princess wants to do it again. And again. Not in the same night, but she wants to come over to my house to do this, spend the night, cuddle.. I let her because she’s my friend and I don’t mind THAT much (except I really really dislike cuddling or being cuddled) and its really no big deal. She comes over a lot but I make it clear that I don’t wanna screw all the time, I just wanna kick back and watch cartoons, maybe smoke a few bowls?

Fast forward here’s the tl;dr Princess is trying to cuff me, she wants a relationship with me, has apparently always had a crush on me and wanted a relationship but do you think any of my other friends thought to mention this to me or warn me? Do you think I had any idea she felt this way?

I cannot do relationships. I cannot. I compartmentalize. I have one romantic interest and it does not extend into the sexual with her. I would marry and raise kids with her but i wouldn’t have sex with her.  I can have friends who know they’re only my friends and have sex with them. I can have sex with strangers. But I cannot be romantically and sexually and friendly involved with one person, it’s too much. 

Princess has been so kind to me lately, helping me get to the doctors in other cities to try to get my hormones and stuff and now I think she was doing it just to get to me instead of caring for me as my friend. When I think about her now I just want to cry. She’s out of town so it’s okay but I feel like she dirtied me? I feel very dirty, disgusted with myself. How could I let this happen?

Why is it happening? When I think about anyone feeling about me like that it makes me nauseous, I just don’t understand, why do they think I’m like that? Why do they look at me like that? Why after 2 years of me explicitly stating that I do not date or do relationships, is she trying to cuff me and trap me? 

And Princess is a cryer. She will bawl her eyes out if I try to address this and I already asked my boo friend (the romantic friend) to please help because she has ALSO been with Princess, and Princess caught feels for her too, but she won’t help, she says I have to do it and I don’t know how I just wanted her to be my friend and now shes not and I feel ruined and filthy"

Bujeebus,asktransgender,Trying to get info on Dr Maurice Garcia (UCSF),"Thinking about going to him for bottom surgery because I've heard a couple good things about him, and that his waiting list is pretty short. He hasn't been doing it for that long though, so I'm wondering if there's anyone here who has or knows where I could get pictures of long-term results, at least 6 months post op. Also interested in any other info, or experiences of people who have had him.

Thanks!"
AstrosCat,asktransgender,Middle name,"I've already settled on my first name, but recently I've been trying to figure out a middle name. I want my middle name to have meaning to it, not just a simple name. I thought about making it my grandma on my dad's side's name as she's always been a kind of ""guardian angel"" so to speak and she's always been one of my best friends. Would it be weird to pick her name? I gave up on making my initials the same as my ""dying"" initials, and this is a name that has a lot of sentiment."
giverupper,asktransgender,Have you ever had someone refuse to call you by your preferred name/pronouns?,"So, today I asked everyone in my family to make the switch from my given name to my preferred name. My sister, grandma and cousin were all accepting and took to trying immediately. My granddad, however, refuses to call me by my preferred name ""until it's legally changed,"" in his own words. Needless to say, I don't understand.  I've been out to him and presenting differently since June of this year, and he was accepting/supportive initially - even when I said I wanted to change his name. Tonight was like a slap in the face for me. I just don't understand how you can deny someone something so simple... to say no to something that would help them be at peace with themselves. It seems cruel and unnecessary, honestly. I mean, my grandma is a Christian and even though her religion is against this, she's still willing to be on board with it because she doesn't want me to hurt. 

So, I guess I just wanted to reach out to everyone here and ask if anyone else has had a similar experience from friends or family or otherwise. I'm sure some of you have, even though it's not right. How did you deal with it? I'm thinking of not answering to my legal name anymore, but I don't want to be petty. I'm just... not comfortable, and he doesn't care. "
chloeAndProud,asktransgender,Hair Growth Stage Laser question,"So I hear this that laser hair removal must be done in intervals of like 4-6 weeks-ish so that it can target hair in the growth stage. Just wondering, what happens if I have to move an appointment out? I can't make one and need to push it back 2-3 weeks so it will be 7 weeks after my last laser instead of 5. Is that bad? Does it mean I'll potentially lose out some of the ones that would have died and have to wait 6 months for them to go into growth stage again?

**Trans? What’s That?**

As of early January 2015, I had no earthly idea what a transgender woman was, or what transitioning was.  I was as ignorant as you can be about the topic.  If I saw a beautiful woman who happened to have genitals that usually are found on a male, then the only way I could process that thought was to think ""Oh, I guess that's a crossdresser who's really committed to crossdressing and got lots of surgery"".  Yes, I was ignorant.  Not knowing what transitioning was, of course I had no plans to transition.

A year later, as of January 2016, I was a passing trans woman whose male had failed.

I liked that [my voice had never masculinized](http://vocaroo.com/i/s1vnuLxJLqxj), and so people who talked to me over voice chat addressed me with female pronouns.  In January 2015, I found this subreddit, and went looking for advice on my voice.  I wanted to feminize it more.  I didn't think it was unusual at all for a male, as I thought myself to be, to want to have a very feminine voice.  Surely, I thought, everybody, male or female, should want to have a very feminine voice, and as many feminine features as possible, no? The obvious illogic of this was lost on me.  I ended up talking to many trans people on a transgender Teamspeak server.  I immersed myself in it, spent all my free time talking to trans people there.  I learned some new words that I had not known before: ""cis"", meaning cisgender, a person who identifies as the gender they were assigned at birth, and ""gender dysphoria"", which is a medical condition in which a person feels distress at having the features of the gender they were assigned at birth, and often seeks treatment to medically transition.  I had no idea that gender dysphoria existed.  I soaked up as much knowledge on the subject as I could.  One day someone pointed out to me that the hormones that trans women take cause them to grow breasts.  I was [dumbfounded](https://media.tenor.co/images/6ef94b41a00590a246d67218ba67ec3b/raw) to hear this.

The trans people I talked to asked me about myself.  Am I a trans woman or a cis female ally? they asked, going by my voice.  Neither, I said, I'm a cis man.  Oh, they said, confused.  So why are you trying to learn how to have a more feminine voice, and not a more masculine one? They asked.  Because I thought it would be nice, I replied.  They pressed further.  Do you wish that you had been born a woman? They asked.  Of course, I responded, what cis man doesn't? All of them, they responded.  Cis men might wish they were female for a day or so, but for life? No cis man would want that.  That seemed odd to me; I had assumed that all cis men wished that they were women, and that one sign of adulthood in a man was learning to overcome your wish that you had been born a woman, and become masculine.

I felt very good, hanging out with trans people on Teamspeak.  Trans women told me that they enjoyed my voice, and that made me feel, for the first time in my life, that there was something special about my body, where before I had felt only shame about it.  Thinking on it further, I wondered if I had some sort of intersex condition, and thought back to a time when I was nine years old, and my father had wanted to inject me with masculinizing hormones because he didn’t think that I was becoming masculine enough.

**Could I be Trans?**

I began to wonder if I was transgender myself.  I knew at the time that I certainly didn’t want Sex Reassignment Surgery, but the rest? Having a female body? That would be wonderful.  I thought of all the things I would have the courage to do if I had a female body that I had been too cowardly to do with a male body.  One day I took a walk in below-freezing weather, thinking it over, and wanted to shout for all the world to hear, “I’m a girl!”.  But surely, I thought, I must be crazy; I had only known what being transgender even was for a few weeks, and now I thought I was transgender myself.  My thoughts were thrown into turmoil.  I would wake up crying.  I became locked in a loop:

*Am I trans?*

*Yes.  Wait, no, you must be crazy, this is insane.*

*But if I had a button I could push that would turn me into a girl, would I push it?* 

*Of course.*

*So then I must be trans, surely?*

*Yes, or you’re crazy.*

Finally, I reasoned that if I thought I was trans, but I had made a mistake and it turned out that I was cis, then there were only two things about hormone replacement therapy that couldn’t be undone: breast growth (though you could surgically remove them), and possible lifelong sterility.  The first didn’t seem to be a problem; I would be happy to have female breasts, even if I changed my mind about taking HRT.  As to the second, I could mitigate the risk of sterility by banking my sperm.  With these comforting thoughts in mind, I settled in to the idea of transitioning, though the fear that I was crazy kept on returning for a few months.

I bought a woman’s cardigan and a wig, and a few camis, and some women's t-shirts.  I put them on, and took pictures, and became euphoric at the results; [with a little imagination, I could see that I looked a bit like a woman](http://imgur.com/yKMZW6F).  I stared at the image for six hours, crying happily, and wanting to have a fully female body.  My trans friends told me that I had just experienced ""gender euphoria"".

**Beginning My Transition**

I made an appointment to see my doctor, and told her about my issues; my voice had not masculinized, and I asked if the size of my breasts was normal for a “man” who at the time had a BMI of just under 30.  She examined my breasts, and said she couldn’t feel any breast tissue in them; they were entirely fat.  She then gave me a referral to see an Endocrinologist, and I took the elevator to another floor and saw her immediately.

I told my Endocrinologist about my issues, that my voice didn’t seem to have masculinized, that my body seemed to enjoy storing fat in the breast area (prior to starting HRT my bra size was 36D), and wondered if I might be sterile.  I told my Endo that I thought I might be transgender, and that I was going to start seeing a therapist about it.  I told her that I planned to bank my sperm, to preserve my fertility (if indeed I had any fertility at all) and that I would start laser hair removal.  I asked her about hormone replacement therapy, and she corrected me, saying “the correct term for transgenders is ‘hormone therapy’, not ‘hormone replacement therapy’”.  I asked her a question about testosterone blockers, and her eyes grew wide.  “Are you on blockers?!” she asked, angrily.  No, I said calmly, I’m not on blockers, I only asked the question because I was curious.  She told me that I would need to see a therapist for 3 months prior to starting hormone therapy.  She ordered hormone tests for me, a chromosomal analysis, and a semen analysis.

**Struggles with Natural Sterility**

The hormone tests showed that I had normal male hormone levels.  The chromosomal analysis showed that I had 46, XY normal male chromosomes.  The Crude semen analysis (there are two types of semen analysis: Crude, and Kruger Strict, with Kruger Strict being more accurate) showed that I had a normal sperm count, while the 3 follow-up Kruger Strict semen analyses showed that although I had a normal sperm count, my sperm were not viable due to poor sperm morphology and poor motility.  Together, the results of my hormone tests, chromosomal analysis, semen analysis, and undermasculinization pointed to some form of partial androgen insensitivity syndrome, where although I had male 46, XY chromosomes, my cells were partially immune to male hormones, as though my body naturally had a low dose of a testosterone blocker.

I banked my sperm, knowing that this was the only chance I might ever have to have offspring who were related to me.  Each semen analysis showed that I was banking poor quality sperm; the quality indicator ranges from 1 (poor) to 14 (normal), and sample after sample that I provided showed that my sperm were 1s.  Desperate to do something to bank semen that was not of poor quality, and cognizant that my biological clock was rapidly ticking, I asked my doctors if there was anything I could do to increase my semen quality.  Take your multi-vitamin, they said, and maybe stop using Rogaine.  Aside from that, not really.  I did so, and I sent in my last sperm sample.  Another 1.  I spent a good deal of money to bank sperm that was nearly useless, but which perhaps could be used in conjunction with tens of thousands of dollars of In Vitro Fertilization.  I cried and cried at how my body had betrayed me; I had had a fantasy that one day I might have three children, and carry on the family line, and my hopes for that were now dashed.

By the time that I sent in my last sperm sample, months had passed.  I had been seeing a therapist, and I asked her if it seemed to her that I was crazy.  She said no, I seemed very aware of my actions, and analytical.  I laughed inwardly, and wondered how I could be an analytical person if I was so unaware of my own gender dysphoria for so long; I had known since age nine that I would have preferred to be a girl, yet knew nothing about being transgender, or the possibility of medically transitioning.
I felt some comfort in knowing that, even if I had sent in poor quality sperm that could likely never be used, at least now I could start taking hormones.  I asked my therapist for my HRT letter, and she gave it to me.  A week later, I got my hormones from the pharmacy.  On the way home, with my hormones in my backpack, something lucky happened to me: the bus driver called me ma’am when I asked him a question, but he didn’t turn his head and see me, so I reckoned that he was just responding to my voice.  When I got home, I quickly took my Spiro and applied my Estradiol patch.  It was June 29th, 2015, I was thirty-two years old, and I had just taken ownership of my body and my life.

**Time Becomes my Ally**

Things moved quickly after I started hormones.  I continued to question whether I was trans even as I took the hormones, yet I knew that I would never want to have a masculine body.  I began to enjoy looking at myself in the mirror.  By November, my hormone levels had inverted themselves, going from male norms to female norms.  I bought female clothing to try on and see if I looked female yet, but was stymied by my facial hair.  Nature had, strangely enough, given me dark facial hair that remained as a beard shadow even after I shaved it off, and it would take more laser hair removal to get rid of it.  I guess it had to make me extra masculine somewhere, after giving me a voice that didn’t masculinize, and breasts.  I discovered EMLA cream, and soon was back on track getting lasered.  I made fun of myself, taking selfies in which I had facial hair, [pretending to be a man of the night’s watch](http://imgur.com/WgtGSXE).

On January 21st, 2016, for the first time, a year after I had learned what being transgender meant, a stranger looked me in the face, while I was wearing men’s clothing (as I had since I began HRT), and called me ma’am.  I was confused, then realized what had happened, then when I got home, happily freaked out that I had failed at guy mode.  Since then, no stranger has addressed me by male pronouns, much to my delight.  But for a couple of months more, I thought that strangers addressing me with female pronouns was merely a string of uninterrupted flukes, and that at any moment they might go back to calling me by male pronouns.  I worried about where to find unisex restrooms, sure that if I were seen entering a women’s restroom, the women inside would scream at me to leave, and that I might be even worse off in the men’s restroom.

**Changes to Legal Identification**

By March, I had decided that perhaps strangers calling me exclusively by female pronouns (even calling me Miss [Boyname]) while I was wearing men’s clothing meant that I must look like a female, and replaced my men’s t-shirts and men’s jeans with women’s t-shirts and women’s jeans.  My therapist and doctor had been telling me for a while that I needed to start wearing a bra, and so I did, eventually settling on a 34DDD bra for women with very shallow breasts like my own.  I went to the courthouse, and filed a court order to change my unambiguously male first name to one that was on the female side of androgynous.  After receiving that court order, I went to the Social Security office with my name change and a doctor’s letter, and 5 minutes later, walked out with a receipt showing that they would mail me a new Social Security card.  A couple of months later, I was given a female driver’s license, and finally, 4 months after strangers started exclusively referring to me with female pronouns, I very carefully used the women’s restroom, and silently freaked out when a woman used the stall next to mine, instead of any of the 15 other empty stalls.  A month ago, I went to the post office to get a passport card stating my correct name and gender, and a friendly lesbian there helped me out, giving me a free passport photo (usually a $10-15 charge).  2 weeks ago, I received my new passport card in the mail.  The only document that remains to be changed now is my birth certificate; I chose unwisely when I decided to be born in a red state, and have been in contact with lawyers at my local LGBT center for months now, and gone to court a couple of times, trying to get a court order that my native red state would accept, in order to get a birth certificate stating my updated name and sex.

**A Bright Future**

It’s now 18 months since I started taking hormones, or at least it was when I started writing this.  I can’t imagine my life without HRT.  I consider my life to have truly begun on June 29th, 2015, when I began taking my magic beans.  I curse my own ignorance at having not understood what being transgender meant, not understanding that I could medically transition, and not starting to transition at 18.  But I’m grateful that it seems to have all turned out well in the end.  I’m also grateful to the asktransgender community, where I’ve met many friends who helped me along the way.  I continue to enjoy looking at myself in the mirror.  A few days ago, I turned 34 years old, and I find myself in the unusual position of looking forward to aging, knowing that with every passing day, I become more the person I’ve always wanted to be.

If you've actually read this whole thing, then thank you.  I hope that my experience will provide some form of guidance or hope to others who might be considering transitioning.  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/FTH4urC.gif) is an animated gif of a cat being used as a broom.

BlackSajin,asktransgender,Startup Costs?,"Hi, first time poster and long time lurker here! I've finally come to the conclusion of transitioning (mtf) and am wondering what I would need to at least get the process started.

For a little background I'm currently 20 and have just gotten my first job and have pretty good hours and pay so far. I live with my mom and she is supportive for the most part so I don't need to worry about being kicked out or anything. As for insurance, I think I'm covered under my dad's insurance (not living with me but still supportive!) but I think he just switched jobs so that's up in the air. For this case let's just assume I have no insurance.

I intend to visit an IC clinic so I don't need to worry about therapist costs. But from what I can tell the upfront costs I need to prepare for are the visit, blood work, and the costs of hormones themselves.

I've done some basic research and understand that the exact prices are different for everyone but I was wondering what you guys would consider a good budget to get things rolling. Do you guys think $500 is enough to go visit a clinic or should I save for a few more weeks before scheduling an appointment?

But whenever I bring up the subject of how I want FFS to fix a few bones that estrogen cannot, they drop all pretense of polite ""Are you sure hon?"" shit and go straight to the ""No, you should not do that."" statements.  
  
It's the same with SRS.  If it gets brought up I usually say ""I'm not really dysphoric about those parts at the moment, but who knows how I will feel after a couple of years.  I'm not ruling it out."" and then they feel the need to insist that I definitely should not do that.  
  
Like, is this idea personally threatening them in some way?  Obviously, it's my body and I'll do what I like, but this has happened enough that it doesn't seem to be limited to one or two people.  Thank god for the girls who are like, ""yeah whatevs sometimes a girl's gotta get work done"".

code_away_the_pain,asktransgender,[Serious questions] Is being transgender genetic or learned subconsciously?,"Hi trans-community of reddit.
For starters, please excuse my ignorance. I have no issue regardless of the answer to the title question. It makes no difference to me. 

This has been racking my mind for several years. For context, I am a cis male that has never had a transgender friend to talk about these things with. First let me explain why this is a confusing topic for me:

Edit: I am not making an argument here. This is simply giving context on what my beliefs were prior to making this thread. You can skip to the end if you don't care about that.

I have never heard of or seen a transgender person who did not display stereotypical behavior for their true gender. For example, every MtF I have ever seen behaved extremely feminine. And one FtM that I took a class with behaved like a boy. (Unfortunately this is the limit of my real-word experience). This has led me to believe that transgender people WANT to be their true gender, rather than they ARE that gender already on the inside. Because I am a firm believer that your gender should not affect your personality, meaning I try to take gender out of the equation in as many thing as possible, in an attempt to treat people equally. 

So if you define gender as a physical thing, then your personality should have no bearing on what gender you are so why would you get a sex-chang? Likewise, if you define gender as a personality thing, then why must you have an operation to physically alter your body if you are already your gender based on your personality? Since people get sex-changes, both of these ideas are false to those that get the sex change. Meaning gender is BOTH mental and physical. This is what I cannot understand. If your mental state is that of a &lt;opposite gender&gt; what is wrong if you keep your body? Why not just be (presumably) homosexual?

From my perspective, my body is just my body. I was born with it and use it to interact with this world, nothing else. It is not a central part to my identity (although admittedly, I take it for granted.)

I guess I am just trying to find the answer to these questions:

* 1. Is your gender based on your mental state? And if so, why must you change your body to ""match"" (If it is based on purely mental state there is no matching of body to brain).
* 2. Are there transgender folk who are gay? Meaning a FtM who likes men or vice versa.
* 3. What is it that draws you so strongly to change your life? What feels wrong?
* 4. And finally, based on all of the above is being transgender a genetic disposition or a psychological thing?"
TotallyNotStealthAcc,asktransgender,"17 years old ""male"", searching myself","Hum, well first of all, thanks to anyone who clicked there with the thought to help someone. As the title says, well I'm born male, but since almost two years, I don't really know who I am. I've done research on the subject, such as prices for the different transitions, how everything works, other people's experiences (and pictures), etc. But after all that, what always comes back to my mind is just ""How do I tell my family and my friends that I'm not sure about my gender?"". My mother always loved me and I know she will always do, she's a really nice person. She is really emotional tho, so it would be something big to tell her. I think to it a lot at the moment because of how people say ""The earlier is the best"". I've been fighting these thoughts for a while also, but I think searching answers is better than fighting it.

I guess I also wonder things like.. Would I look okay as a female? I don't look bad as a male, but I don't like looking at myself, and my smiles are usually forced. I don't really know what I'm exactly looking for, honestly. I know the trans community is awesome, so that's why I'm posting now, I think. So yeah.. maybe I should ask.. what should I try to search for about myself at this point?

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read, and I hope I can get at least some minor things figured out..

SRS_BKK_Chettawut,asktransgender,I had SRS with Dr. Chettawut in Bangkok a few weeks ago AMA,"Everything went very well and the surgeon and nurses say my surgery was a success. I did not need the extra skin graft. So far dilation has been fairly easy. The nurses did an excellent job of controlling my pain when I was in the clinic. Walking down the stairs is difficult and painful - but they will help you and it is definitely nice to get a little exercise in during the five days of bed rest. 

Now that I'm in the hotel things are going even better. I can walk around a bit although I do get tired easily. This is definitely not the time to walk around too much or push yourself. One thing I wish I had done was stock up on a lot more high calorie snacks to supplement room service.

The bowel cleaning procedure was not difficult at all for me. I just drank a ton of soda and apple juice and the Swiff really isn't a big deal. YMMV of course.

Aesthetically the result seems like it's very good and everything seems to be healing rapidly. Obviously it's way to soon to say what it will look like once it's fully healed but I expect it will be well within cis-normative standards. They touched my clit with a q-tip in the clinic and it's fully sensate. That was a weird experience!

Ask me any questions you'd like. So far, based on what I've seen and experienced and what I've learned talking with other patients, I'd highly recommend Dr. Chettawut for SRS."
Seras930,asktransgender,A Myriad of Emotions,"I don't even know where to begin or if this is even the right sub for this, but I could use the support.


Eugh...where even to begin...


I'm mtf, 23 and in a relationship with a cis 21 y/o girl. We've been official for about 7 months, known each other for about 8-9. She has ADHD, I'm an Aspie, and we both have severe depression and emotional scars from prior abuse. She's having an awful tough time, she's tearing herself up for having ADHD, fretting over little inconsequential mistakes her jerk coworkers keep telling her will get her fired. She's being eaten up by this. Her siblings and a history of being told ""she's a looser"" and ""she'll never amount to anything"" her 'dad' (no blood relation, father of her siblings but not her.)


I'm not without struggle, either. I've been without a job for almost as long as we've been dating. I got sick, had to go without my Effexor for a few days, and conflict arose when I was going through withdrawal. For reference, my boss was a transphobic that had continually ignored my pronouns (but not my name, oddly enough) for long enough for me to realize it was intentional. She'd disciplined me for ""rudeness"" (correcting her on my pronouns in meetings. Sooooooooo rude.) Anyway, we got into an argument, I quit. Not even more than a week later, my gallbladder decides to try to kill me. I was hospitalized, emergency cholestomy after having to wait 2 hours writhing in pain on the floor in the ER.


My newly minted GF at the time made a hefty trek (for not having a car) to see me and comfort me when I was in the hospital. We had literally went official a night before....


Anyway, all of this keeps weighing in me and I simply don't know what to do.


I have my abusive family that has LITERALLY pushed their way in past one of my roommates before, guilting me and telling me that I have to spend Christmas with them because ""Christmas is for family, and your relationship is too young,"" [paraphrase] My GF is saddened, as am I that I can't spend Christmas or even at least my birthday (a few days after Christmas) with my significant other. My family are the kind of people to dismiss my opinions as ""hippie liberal mainstream media garbage"", while spouting casual homophobia and transphobia in my direction. They've accused my roommates of being ""faggy"" and in the past when I first tried to come out, treated me like a head case and told me to ""stop going to that gay club (uni GSA), they're brainwashing you to thinking you're a transsexual."" That was close to five years ago, now. I'm now out to them, but it took mention of why, years ago I forcibly ejected myself from the gun hobby for them to get it, well, my mother at least. I wonder why... (Freshman tear I spent a lot of time staring down a gun barrel.)


My family are the type of people to drive two hours (120 miles) bimonthly to pester myself, my girlfriend and my roommates alike. They don't much take no for an answer. They just invite themselves.


I feel so dirty and shitty for the way I let my family manipulate me, but what choice do I have?


I have a broken car, every job I apply to finds someone else, someone cis... etc. They support me. Said support is conditional... My roommates hate me. I've let depression take control of my life. School has routinely kicked my posterior, I don't have the drive I once did.


I just feel broken, and I don't know why. I don't even know what I hope to accomplish with this. Surely I don't deserve much... I'm immature, irresponsible, forgetful and I seem to fail at everything I set out to do. "

throwaway8473276437,asktransgender,I feel like I'm being gaslighted by my own brain. [long],"[19yo / afab]

Earlier today, I was suicidal, violently angry, and on the verge of crying all because my chest isn't flat, my voice isn't deep, my parents constantly addressing me by feminine pet names... I felt trapped in my body and life and completely hopeless.

Now that I've calmed down, I feel indifferent/apathetic towards my gender. I almost feel numb and empty and don't have a clue what I want anymore. I'm able to say to myself now that really, I *could* live as a cis girl and that all these feelings are just a cover up/coping mechanism for an actual problem I don't know I have. And this fantasy of having a male body/living as a male is just that. A fantasy. Or it's part of a mental illness I've yet to be diagnosed with and my mind is fucking with me. But I also know the feelings from earlier are going to come back... they always do eventually... And in the moment, I want nothing more than to give up because I know I'm never going to 1. come out 2. transition 3. have a family that loves/supports me regardless.

I'm a diagnosed agoraphobic and currently it's  basically as severe as agoraphobia can get. Every time I try to get therapy (last time was over a year ago and I basically gave up since), I shut down and stop going because I realise I'll never get better because I can't get past the gender issue and I refuse to tell a therapist about any of it in case it goes on my record or something.

I get so jealous (like I regularly get upset about it) when I see guys my age with their facial hair, masculine jaws, adam's apples, deep voices, broad shoulders, flat chests, straight hips... Like I want that/I should have those things. But then there's times when I look at the same guys and don't feel that way much. I feel the indifference/emptiness towards them and my own body instead. Cue doubt and confusion.

I can't accept that these feelings aren't normal feelings for a cis girl even though I'm pretty sure most cis females don't think like this? I can't accept that I might really be transgender. Every time I've tried, I end up like earlier. And then I calm down, tell myself I'm too young to know who I truly am or that I have no personality so I'm using this to feel like I have some sort of identity, I just want a skinny body androgynous asexual body, I'm confusing this with lust I really just want to fuck them (even though a lot of times I don't as they're not my type), etc. Rinse. Repeat.

This is incredibly hard to talk about sober (I've been clean for 2 weeks now so I'm actually having to deal with my feelings rather than just take some pills to numb everything and shut my brain up). The only time I feel even remotely okay with myself is when I'm high as shit on opiates or drunk. I don't really know why I'm writing this, it's technically not even a question. I suppose I just want validation I'm not insane. Or for someone to tell me I am not trans but in fact actually crazy and I can ""fix"" myself. 

I don't think I'm a girl? but it's hard to say I'm a boy when everything about my physical self says the complete opposite. I have no idea how to even be a man?? What does being a man even feel like?? I'm just /me/. All my interests are unisex if not leaning on the ""girl"" side... I know nothing since I've had almost zero male influence in my life. I feel like I'm the poorest excuse for a man in existence and people would never take me seriously. I just want a male body and voice and it's killing me that I don't have either.

It's 3AM right now so sorry this is all over the place I can't sleep because my head won't shut up. But I can't talk to anyone IRL about this and if I keep all this in my head any longer I'll probably end up smashing everything in my room"

Zoey21,asktransgender,Spending spring break living full time female while contemplating transition?,"Hey everyone, like a lot of people here I think, I'm going back and forth between contemplating hrt + transition. I have spring break coming up in March, and I'm thinking about spending a week in a city where I can just get a private airbnb and spend the week living as a woman. Nothing flashy, just waking up every morning, shaving, doing my makeup, putting on a complete outfit and wig, getting breakfast at a Starbucks, and doing some reading in a library. Maybe get a session with a professional crossdressing studio to try some styles and get some photos. Maybe go out to a gay bar in the evening. Depending on how things go when I pick therapy up again in a few weeks, I may even be on hrt at that point. I'm leaning in that direction, but not totally there. 

Is this idea totally crazy? I'm skeptical about my ability to pass, as I'm super tall (6'5) and have a large, broad build, and zero voice work. I expect I'll get clocked basically starting the moment I leave my place, but maybe that's okay? Trying to get better about disentangling my desire to pass and the increasingly clear need to transition. 

What would you do with this week? Any recommendations? "
joe1up,asktransgender,Erm is being big gonna be an issue?,"I'm 14 and have recently thought about transitioning sometime in the future, however my hands and feet are pretty big. My shoe size is like 7(uk) and I'm currently 
five foot six-ish. I also have a pretty big nose and broad shoulders. I don't plan to start anything until I'm like 18, as I am not 100% sure yet and I have my gcse coming up and I need to focus on that for now. I do not even want to consider hormone blockers, I don't want to do anything irreversible unless I am 200% sure I want to do this and even then I will wait until I'm a legal adult. If my size will stop me from being ""convincing"" I may not transition, I'm not unhappy with being male, but I would prefer being female. 

Also, would hormones be able to rectify some of these issues? I know they arn't miracle makers but I haven't done a lot of research into what exactly they affect."
Mousanonly,asktransgender,Coming Out: 2.5 Week Update. Wherever shall I go from here?,"It's been two-and-a-half weeks already? It feels like a year has gone by, but at the same time it feels like 10 minutes have gone. I get flashbacks of me sitting down, unable to move or speak, with my mom crying. Nothing of note has happened in the last week. My therapist appointment was canceled. The hope that I might eventually be happy is the only thing keeping me alive right now, but the light is fading. Even death seems pointless now.

My therapist wants to put me on antidepressants, even though they know that I want hormones/blockers. My parents are plenty willing to help my depression, but not anything else. The fact that I'm under 18 means I don't really have a say in anything, and any attempt to voice my thoughts on things to my parents results in either getting hurt or ignored.

Nothing has seemed to change after sending my letter. I can't speak up for myself, and the only thing keeping me alive is that one day, [the dawn will come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p497e6MX1co&amp;index=16&amp;list=PL1FohRYdWClBTT8U3uFDXTdc_nz4Sdleu)

Anyway, here is what I have received:

""1. Refer early and swiftly to a reputable Gender service
Support the treatment recommended by the Gender service

Get pronouns right; if in doubt, (discreetly) ask

Be particularly mindful of medical confidentiality

Avoid misattributing commonplace health problems to gender.

Handle name change professionally (there is a process of sending the notes away
and getting new gender record envelope)

manwoman1990,asktransgender,How do y'all deal with the separation between before/after transition?,"Hey, all. So just wanted to preface with this: don't think I'm trans, have thought a lot about it since learning back when youtube first got popular (~2006?). TBH, I was ready to jump on hormones when I was younger, but my mother questioned it and made me question it. Now a lot of time has passed and I wonder what it would be like, at an older age (I'm only 26, but the older the better as far as experiences I'd like to hear about), to transition. 

How do you all with the incongruencies of being called one pronoun repeatedly from x to y age, then from y to z age being called another. Not just that, but a lot of my own experiences feel like they'd be lost, that I couldn't talk about my own past because it would require a bit of untruthfulness. ""When I was a little boy..."". Not being a TERF here (I don't think?), but the past isn't malleable (only how we explain it). All of us were called a name we didn't choose at birth, pronouns we potentially didn't like, and a ton of other unchosen things that, for me at least, would be painful to throw away. I say this not because I particularly liked how much backlash I got for liking what I liked and wanting to do what I did, but because our past turns us into our current selves, and to let that go feels like it would be very hard to do. I imagine for a multitude of trans folk it is as well (unless you transitioned earlier in life). Just curious because that seems like the hardest part. "

if i was born female, i wouldnt feel dysphoric, i wouldnt feel like i was in the wrong body, i wouldnt feel like i need to transition.

because of moral or religious objections, we do
not need to give you information on how and
where to obtain these services.""  Moral or religious objections are more valid than people being mentally healthy and not feeling suicidal in their own skin?  More important than people being free to LOVE who they want?  I cannot believe that this is the world we still live in.  LGBT are NOT HURTING ANYONE by living authentically!  Religions that prevent people from expressing themselves are no less than hate organizations.  Seriously.  I just literally can't believe that with the technology, science, and communication abilities we have in 2016 that people are so hateful.  How is this acceptable to anyone?  This is like saying ""No blacks allowed"".  I wish I was younger so I could have gone to law school to eventually straighten this all out.  When I was a kid I thought Christianity was about love, but then I grew up and realized its more about hate, divisiveness, and power over peoples sexuality (which is possibly the greatest power of all).  Nonetheless...religious freedom means you can think or say whatever you want, not majorly oppress someone else's life who is hurting NO ONE.  How does ANYONE in America accept this?  I'm usually a very calm and reasoned person.  I can understand being excluded healthcare services or rights because someone just wants to make a buck because I am resigned to the capitalistic reality of the world...but religion?

Thatonegirl233,asktransgender,Do I sound trans?,"I saw another post with this same name and I figured sense I've really been questioning it lately I would give it a try too. I'm pretty sure I'm trans because I've always wanted to be a girl. Anyway I'm going to get to the point.  Also this will be a long post. 

Recently, like the last month, I've really been questioning if I am trans or not. I have fought I was for so long and I wanted to come out this year but I could never get myself to do it.  I haven't got myself to do it over the last few years.

I've always liked girls. I wanted to be one when I was little and would play with some but not all girl toys. I don't remember much of elementary school or preschool but I remember times in preschool when I would want to play dress up with a girls. I would try on the shoes but the teacher would never let me dress up. I also remember wanting the big Barbies that was just the head because I thought it would make me a girl lol.  I wasn't smart back then but I was young. I didn't have many friends then but mostly where girls besides the 2 guys I played with until elementary school. 

Elementary was odd for me. 2nd grade is what I remember the most with wanting to be a girl. That's when I really wanted to do girly things. I would always talk to girls and want my nails like they had them or hair like them. In my neighborhood it was pretty slip to where all they guys did things and girls did things and I didn't fit in anywhere. I wasn't sporty and didn't play I preferred to play with animal or my toy animals and if I was at my grandmas I would play with her jewelry if she would let me. I didn't fit in with the girls because I wasn't a girl and ""guys are gross"".  I always wanted somehow for the girls to just take me and dress me up in a dress and stuff when they would play dress up.  I wanted a whole make over with jewelry and everything. Around this time is when my neighbor who use to live behind me, he is way older than me btw, would let me play Xbox with him sense I loved video games. I don't remember how it got brought up but I went over and he was playing some game , world of Warcraft or might of just been Warcraft or even runescape, on his computer and he was play as a girl in the game and that he could change his character for a boy to girl and I said I wanted to do that. He told that people could in real life and googled it. It was my 1st time learning that it was possible to change. I knew from that point it was going to be me, that one day I would do that. 

Then I get into middle school. I finally found out what it truly meant to be transgender and I actually saw myself most of they time as a girl. In my head I would count how many girls girls there where in the class and I would count myself as one and I was happy with it. But it didn't change the fact I was seen as a guy and it really hurt me when they split into teams during review games and be boys vs girls. I wanted to be on the girls side so badly. I felt so alone and that I had something wrong with me for feeling that way considering I didn't even have any gay friends at the time and that my dad had a talk with me about how being gay was wrong. I didn't know how to bring up how I felt with anyone at the time. I would later online and start to feel better about it but I was so scared to tell my parents how I felt.  

While in middle school I tried on girl clothes for the 1st time.  I was at a persons house and I tried on their sisters clothes and I knew at that moment I had to find a way to change. The skinny jeans and tank top and the skirt felt so right. I got some clothes for my gf I had at the time because I talked to her about and she was really accepting of me at least experimenting with it especially with my nails.  It felt so right to have the clothes and wear them when I could. And I loved painting my nails but I always ha d to take on the off. I loved it so much until my mom caught me with painted nails and found my clothes and got really mad. I should of told her how I felt then. 

And that leads me to now in high school. I'm in my junior year and turning 18 soon.  Nothing really has happened with the me wanting to be a girl thing sense I know my mom doesn't like the fact I had and still have girl clothes. Only major things that have happened in high school is I told the girl of my dreams about it and we are good friends now as well as coming out to 3 other people i talk to at school.  I even had a plan to tell my parents this year(2016) but it didn't happen.  I don't know how to come out but I want to. I just feel stuck and alone and confused. I'm positive I'm trans but I'm still questioning it.   

Do I sound trans to you? 
Thanks for reading and I'm open to any tips you have or talking if you want. I'm 17 turning 18 and I'm confused on what to do about me being trans.

Gatemaster2000,asktransgender,Questions about hrt in switzerland,"Hi, basically I am from Estonia and I have long range relationship whit a guy from Switzerland.

I am planning to visit Switzerland for a month in a year or so and possibly move to Switzerland(my profession is IT, finishing school atm) in future.


How does the hrt gatekeeping system in Switzerland work?


If I get on hormones in Estonia(gatekeeping is a year' half of it is done) will I get access to them in Switzerland if I give authorities contact whit local gatekeeping professionals and do some paperwork(I know how you swiss have like a addiction or fetish towards truckload of paper work :) )?


What is the cost of hrt like every month? 

And in what form hrt does exist? Pills only or even needles?


Sorry, I am sleepy, its 1 am here...


Its not likely I will become legally(like nationality wise) a Switzerland's national citizen so when I get my sex changes in Estonian national systems and documents+get srs, I should be set sex marker wise in Switzerland legal system, right?

verasgunn,asktransgender,When I think about being open with my family I think about how my family joked about only Transgender person I've personally known behind their back. Am I being too sensitive?,"So I haven't known a lot of trans people in my life. I've met a few online, but by and large the only other person I've known who was trans is my Aunt's former son-in-law. He, who for the sake of this story I will simple call Jack, used to be a woman, let's say Jill(this will be relevant later), and was my aunt's second husband's child from another relationship. Jill came out to her family as a lesbian, and then later as a Transgender male. His family supported him, but they lived on the other side of the country and visited only on rare occasions, perhaps once or twice a year. I didn't known him much, but I never quite cared for him as a person from what I knew, either before or after he came out. But when he came over after coming out we treated him as we did before he came out, just used his new name and that was about is. 

The problem is this: my aunt, would refer to Jack as 'Jill-Jack' behind his back. It was this little 'joke' that she explained every time she called him that. And it irritated me, because it seemed disrespectful, but I said nothing and just gave an understanding half-hearted smirk and nodded. My aunt divorced Jack's father, and I haven't seen or heard of him since, but whenever he comes up it's still 'Jill-Jack', and even with people like Caitlyn Jenner it's 'Bruce-Caitlyn', because it's so hilarious!^^^^sarcasm

But I find myself coming more and more to the belief that I'm transgender myself and I don't want to live in the shadows with this knowledge around my family. They're fairly understanding and progressive, so I hope at least my closest to family will accept it, and they're probably the people in my life who are most important to me so I'd like to be able to be open with them and have them for support. But then I think of this, and I fear how my aunt, or the rest of my family for that matter will mock me for who I am. I've never been a strong individual, I cry very easily, I get flustered and depressed with little effort. I know other people won't be as kind, but I don't want to be around my family and have them mocking me like that. But maybe that's my sensitivity. Am I making too much out of this?"

Now I think a reason why anyone comes out of plastic surgery disappointed is they have too high expectation for what the procedures can do. expecting to look like Angiline jolie.  Also another reason they are not satisfied is they did not communicate their want and needs to the surgeon effectively. So the surgeons will do it one way and when it may need a different approach and the amount of aggressiveness need. Also expressing your concerns is important too.

I have been studying the Techniques and what can be done. and Also I have a look that I think will fit my face(Anne Hathaway) that I want to use as a guide and model. While I dont expect I will look like her, I will hope have features that resembles her.

And I have my concerns too. Is this going to be not aggressive enough or too aggressive. More isnt always better, see Micheal Jackson's nose. Which also is my most hated part as well as gives me the most dysphoria. 

And Yes, I have run in to a few people who are post ffs and have BDD. It happens. They confuse the point off FFS. Which is to be more passable not be prettier. To reduce dysphoria not to increase their attractiveness. 

While it can increase your feminine charm because more feminine normally equals sightly more attractive. And the same goes for the boys, more manly is seen as more attractive.

  If you are doing it to be ***just*** more attractive, stop. You will need more surgery then just FFS most likely.

***If you want to do FFS to reduce dysphoria***, thats why you should have it.

Thats why I am going to get it. **Having less dysphoria is the ultimate goal here.**

Heres what my suggestions are for any procedure:

* Talk to a few different doctors to get a feel of what your options are.

* Read up on it to learn what to expect.  That goes for doctors too. We have so many experiences now to learn about docs.

* Communicate with your surgeon about what you want and what you can expect. As well as your concerns. 

* Have realistic expectations of what it will do for you.

Lastly make sure you are doing it for you and not anyone else. While even I would like to use FFS to improve my attractiveness by looking more feminine.

 I am doing it so that I like the person I see in the mirror everyday. Inside I love me. Outside is a bit beat up and could use some work. So that it hurts less when I see them in the mirror and so that person is easy on my eyes. Yes, I am vain.

So make sure you are doing it for you first and for most, everything else will fall into place."
ultravegan,asktransgender,"How I get my blood tests for 67$ and how you can too. (If you are in the U.S and don't live NY,NJ,MA,MD,or RI in With Pictures!) (Repost from like a year ago)","So I made this like a year ago but I feel like enough new people are here that it may prove useful. You can use this to get your results faster (about 48 hours), get your levels without a Dr.s requisition, or just to pay less money. This is a direct copy and past from before, I really hope this can help some people.

So one day while I was talking to the receptionist at my endocrinologist office about how high my deductible is and how much it sucks paying out of pocket for everything he told me about this website called www.privatemdlabs.com http://imgur.com/UIYOlsC.jpg where you can buy lab tests and got them redeemed at a labcorp blood testing place. All you basically do is go to the site and select hormone panel for females http://imgur.com/f3HoW8L . The hormone panel for men is a lot more and I think both MTF's and FTM's get what they need tested http://imgur.com/k145mnX.jpg FTM confirm? So then you just confirm you got what you want   http://imgur.com/53S5AGI.jpg . After that it will ask your zip http://imgur.com/ccduj9b.jpg , and give you a list of places you can get your test done http://imgur.com/YgflDoI.jpg . Just select one and finish your order. at some point it will ask you to set up an account and than it send a confirmation AND another email linking you to the paper you have to show the person at the lab. I usually get my lab results the next day, they send it to your email and than you have to send it to your doctor. I really hope this helps some people! I know it was a game changer for me, I went from spending 200$ to less than 70$."

Teejsaurus,asktransgender,"Need some help/advice/reassurance about this straight cis guys behavior, as well as my own... (prob a wall of text sorry)","So I'm ftm and am pretty darn gay (I like guys). I'm stealth at work, and have a crush on a coworker, but according to his fb he's straight. (I know fb status' aren't the end all and be all of stuff like that, but it's all I have to go on.) He's about 30, and we live in a decent size city, so I'm sure he's known gay people before, and possibly even had friends who were gay. I also have no intention of pursuing a relationship with someone at work as loads of people in all sorts of places have advised against it, I'm just curious about how my behavior might be perceived by him. I know cis straight guys on this sub might be the minority, so I'm looking for any advice or words or wisdom from anyone of any sort of identity, but am especially interested in what people who have gone through living as a cis straight guy (whether you still consider yourself as such, or at one time considered yourself those things before discovering you were trans) have to say, as well as anyone who has lived as a gay guy and has experience in these sorts of situations. 

Basically as far as I know, he's straight. However, I've had moments where I've tried to joke with him in an accidentally flirty way (not physical joking like shoving him or anything, but like just trying to make him laugh), and have given him compliments and then instantly realized guys don't really talk like that to each other. Then there was the day I couldn't stop blushing at him. Like just wow too much blushing lol. He needed to get in my till at work (he's a shift sup, another good reason why I have no plans to pursue anything with him if it magically turns out he might be into guys too), but I was in the middle of using it and we just kind of looked at each other and I wanted to say something like ""oh hey wait a minute, then you can get in here"" but of course flustered me had to stumble over my words, so mostly gibberish came out, and he just kind of looked at me with a smirk, which made me blush so bad, and I don't think I turned away quick enough, so I'm sure he saw it. Then later I went to go ask if it was cool if I left since it was the end of my shift, and he jokingly was like ""no"" then gave me the same smirk and I blushed then too, and was kind of speechless cos I wasn't expecting him to joke with me right then. Then today, after some joke with another coworker that I was too busy with customers to hear, he started getting mad teasy at me. Like the kind of teasing little kid boys do when they like a girl. He was jokingly calling me a jerk, then when I left and went to get water the first thing of water was out so I went to the sink, but when he saw that he was like ""haha it doesn't work, loser"". (This was all joking, he wasn't being serious, it was easy to tell he had to force himself to say something even slightly mean sounding lol.) I just smiled at him like whatever, and he returned the smile. I wasn't raised or socialized at all as male so I totally have no idea if this teasing is the same way a guy treats other guys he considers friends, or if it's something generally only done toward people they have a crush on. Any insight here would be great!

I'm also wondering something else. So when you like someone, and your sexual identities match up (you're both gay or both straight, or someone's bi, etc) when they behave like I do (albeit on accident) with the blushing and stumbling over words, it's usually pretty easy to connect the dots and realize they might possibly have a crush on you. However, for a straight guy experiencing this behavior from a gay guy, what would he think? Would the thought that I could have a crush on him not cross his mind, since being interested in guys himself isn't really on his radar? Since he's my superior at work, would he just assume my behavior might mean I'm intimidated by him because of him being my superior? I know we can't be together romantically (we work together, he's my superior, our sexual identities don't match up), but I do really like him as a person in general, and would like to become friends with him (I haven't been working there long), could my behavior possibly scare him off/put him off to the idea of us being friends? Besides him and myself, there are only two other guys I work with (the rest are women) and they all act differently towards me, one doesn't ever talk to me (or really anyone for that matter lol), and the other treats me like his younger sibling, which I totally feel lol (I've never had a brother figure, always wanted one, and so it's really nice to have one even just slightly like I do with him). With this guy though, I can't tell if he's trying to befriend me, or if he's trying to let on he likes me (unlikely), or if he thinks I'm intimidated by him being my superior and is trying to be a bit more buddy buddy with me and break down that barrier. 

Sorry this is all one random ramble. I'm just mostly concerned that he can tell I like him. Until this year I had always been perceived by others as a straight female, so if I were still as such and it was obvious to him I liked him, but he didn't like me back, it would be super easy for him to just casually tell me. But I'm wondering if a straight guy encounters that behavior from a gay guy, do they usually feel too awkward about it to just politely tell them they can't return their feelings? And as a gay guy, when you like a straight guy and have a hard time hiding that flustered behavior, can you tell if the straight guy notices or catches on? And to the straight guys on here: if you noticed another guy acting in that flustered manner towards you, what would you think was the reason? I don't think this guy knows I'm gay...I haven't said to anyone at work that I am, and I have no idea if it's obvious by my voice or appearance that I am, so am unsure if he assumes I'm gay or that I'm straight. (I'm friends with another coworker on fb, where it says I'm gay, so she could have told them all for all I know lol, but she's not the type to do that, and I don't care if her or anyone else at work or elsewhere knows I'm gay.)"

guicrith,asktransgender,Is there any way out of this disaster?,"My life for the last 2 years has been a chain of disasters.

I attempted suicide at school since I could not be a girl.

I quit school 2 weeks later and have been hiding at home ever since.

I started the process of getting hormones and when I started I was hopeful but then the endocrinology team ordered unneeded tests for money and I still get called he 6 months in so I still rarely leave the house.

When was in school I had started to visit an lgbtq support group but it just made things worse and I stopped going a few months ago.

At the group they would just talk about PC nonsense(that straight white men are bad) and how cool it was that we where all ""queer"", I dont want to be queer I want to be a real girl!

My fears,hatred and boredom are likely to torture me to death soon.

I don't believe in trigger warnings and that an inability to handle information is defective.

I despise capitalism and refuse to ever get a job,and will starve to death.

I live with my parents but will likely be kicked out soon because I won't do chores because there boring.

At school an autistic student got away with laying on the lunch table and singing frozens ""let it go"" song in math class and after that I hated the disabled because they got away with whatever they did.

My parents are sick of my behavior and said they would no longer drive me to appointments if I won't help around the house.

I feel that I am permanently defective because I am trans.

Because of these feelings my thoughts sound like there taken right out of Mein Kampf,about euthanizing the disabled,and that I am ""a defective faggot that should be exterminated""

This is my self hate,I never say that to other trans people, I just wish it didn't happen to me and feel that it is like a terminal illness even if it doesn't kill me I will die with it.

I am 18 and find very few things meaningful.
*Emulators(I am a RetroArch developer)
*Animals(there cute and don't hate me)

Other than this most of my free time is spent thinking about suicide.

I am also now thinking I should discontinue therapy and hormones because they cost money.

If you are offended,this post is not against you,it is me descending into insanity.

This is not a feel bad for me post,I am asking if there is any way to make this better."

- I've only been able to crossdress handful of times (all sexual, which has confused me)

- age 14-15, would pray to wake up a girl every night, pray for brain transplant machine, want aliens to abduct me and change me to girl, wishing I was put in witness protection so I could get a sex change disguise lol, curious about reincarnation

- always having had sexual fantasies as a girl

- took gender tests and got ""female"" a majority of the time

- fascination by gender bending themes

- majority of time choosing female avatars, including female names on some email accounts

- Seeing attractive girls, wanting to be w/ them and imagining being them at same time

- Maybe felt some jealousy of women 

- most dreams in past few years as female, feeling very happy in them, hoping to go back asleep to continue them. Also lucid dream to try to be female in them

- possibly having ""phantom breasts"", feel something missing in chest area at times



Against Trans:

- not really having dysphoria, at least body dysphoria i think

- enjoy lots of typical ""guy"" stuff

- not depressed/ in fact pretty happy"

I want to be able to talk about this stuff, but I just CAN'T. It paralyzes me just thinking about it. Nothing is going to happen unless I ask for it, but I just can't do ANYTHING about it.

Gwenandorchloe,asktransgender,"Something that made me put things into perspective (and really helped me at least) (Trigger warning, kinda anti-Christianity [I'm not anti-Christian, just read to find out what I mean])","So my biggest hardship since I realized exactly what I was going through, was dealing with my internalized transphobia. I live in a VERY accepting community, one of the, even MORE, left parts of California. But as anybody who is transgender knows; internalized transphobia is a serious hardship. I am extremely lucky to say that everybody who I am close to has been very supportive, but I have still had trouble accepting myself for who I am because of the barriers American society has built up.

I decided to take a look as to why this is, because many other cultures such as India, Native American cultures, native Hawaiian and plenty of others not only have indigenous words for transpeople, but they are also accepted members of the community. So why is it that the United states of America, supposedly one of the most open and progressive countries in the world, has such an anti-trans (and lgbqt+ in general) nature? I think the answer lies in our Christian roots.

England was built on Christian principals, and those principals have been passed onto the US. Christianity tells us being gay, bi, queer, trans, etc, is a sin, and therefore wrong and shameful. Whether or not we consider ourselves,  our community, our friends or our famly (again, in the English/US cultures), accepting, our overall community says that we are heathens, abominations, perverts, rejects, etc.

THIS IS WRONG. We are natural. We are Humans. We were born the way we are, and we are exactly the same as anyone else in the world; be them straight, bi, pan, or whatever else they want to call themselves.

My realization was this:
My internalized transphobia was nothing more than Christian values making me feel bad about who I am. I'm not even Christian! I don't even believe in god, why am I letting Christian beliefs make me feel bad about myself? It's ridiculous! I am who I am, and anybody that says otherwise, I don't need in my life.


Basically what I'm saying is this:

If you are trans and having trouble with internalized transphobia, it's not because being trans is wrong, it's because our Christian culture believes it is. Don't let outdated, religious views dictate how you perceive yourself. Be who you are, and screw the people that think you're wrong. You don't want them in your life anyways. You're you, you're human, you were born the way you are and nobodies beliefs can change that. Be proud, be trans, and be you. Love yourself, because you are the only person who TRUELY understands you. 

TLDR: Christian values shape our society, don't let outdated religious views dictate how you perceive yourself!

Honchkrovv,asktransgender,MtF HRT and concentration issues,"Hello guys!
I'm a person who's currently debating internally whether to go on HRT. I'm 18 and I'm just entering adult life. My family is rather poor and I'm afraid of my future. I've read that HRT's possible side effects are absent-mindedness and forgetfulness. As I'm already a person with a messed up concentration I'd like to ask: did you get such problems on HRT? Please answer truthfully. Thank you"

Mine has been a bit of both. I started my HRT journey 4 months ago and it's going to be a hell of a ride. Already some of it is amazing and some of it is hard as fuck.

But I just wanted to say to everyone, wether you are ringing in the new year with friends and family, or if you are alone this year, you are all amazing.

Be strong, be the beautiful people that you are. And if you are struggling tonight, don't give up. You've gotten through everything in your life up to now and tomorrow brings a new year with unlimited possibilities.  It's all going to be ok

Some of it will suck, some of it won't and some of it will be amazing. But we'll all get through it together.

The nurse looked at me weird and said insurance companies generally don't permit that anymore, but I could have sworn I heard after the election that this was a common thing for people who were traveling out of state or country.

anonblarg,asktransgender,Question for mtf's regarding muscle mass and exercise.,"Hey!

I am still in the process of discovering if I am trans or not (pretty sure I am), and I have been researching as much as I can on the topic.

One question that has come to mind is this though: How did your muscles change after you started hrt? In the sense that, if you exercise regularly and have muscle mass, will that make you drastically more masculine looking as normal, or after awhile on hrt does your muscle shaping and definition become more feminine?

I ask this as starting to believe I may be trans has finally motivated me to start exercising properly and reach my ideal weight, which is a problem I have always been putting off for my whole life btw, not that I am that fat, just unfit and a bit pudgy.

As I am doing an intense exercise program (Rushfit), I expect to gain decent fitness eventually. But this does worry me a bit though, as while I want to be fit, I don't want to be super muscular and what I would love to have is the lean fit body that most fit woman have. Is something like this possible?

Thanks in advance for any help you may give!

Also, on a side note, has your realising you were trans ever motivated you do something you were struggling with before? In my case, I am motivated to lose weight now as I want see what my body and face will look like at their best and see what I have to work with passing-wise before transitioning."

Jazz8680,asktransgender,"When I don't feel dysphoria, I feel like I'm not trans. But when I do feel dysphoria, I feel like I am trans. Which feelings do I trust?","I'm early and new to all of this. I think I repressed these feelings for years. They're only now starting to surface again. 

Like some days will be perfectly fine. At the bare minimum, I'll have a little voice in the back of my head whispering that I wished I was being perceived as a girl. Like while talking to someone or outside the house. It's like a background noise that I can easily distract myself from. I'll question why I even thought I might be trans. 

Then the next day (usually at night when I'm alone) it'll hit hard and I'll just be miserable because I wish I looked and felt like a girl. Like that voice is speaking at full volume. I've been trying to keep my thoughts written down in a journal but sometimes within a single day I'll feel fine, but I'll feel dysphoria later in the day. 

And, like, I'll have dreams where I'm a girl or that I'm out as trans. Then I'll wake up and feel horrible because it wasn't real. 

How do I reconcile these opposing feelings? I can't be trans and also not be trans. I'm trying to understand the difference between myself and cis people, if there is any. Do they really not obsess over this? They never wished to wake up as a girl when they were little? 

I can't see a therapist right now due to many different factors. But I'm hopeful for the future. Right now you guys are all I've got. "
ScarlettMaeBottom,asktransgender,Came out to my parents last night. It went pretty well.,"My parents stayed with my wife and I over the holidays and Last night was the last night we'd have that was just the 4 of us. I was super nervous during dinner, I felt like i was going to throw up. So after dinner we just sat around the table chatting more and me getting more nervous until it reached a now or never point. And I told them. I told them I wanted to talk about something thats difficult to talk about, and how I've felt depressed or anxious, and how I think I'd be happier if I was girl. They where taken a back at first, but said they loved and support me. 

We talked for over an hour I think, its kinda a blur. I talked about How my wife and I still plan on having kids. How there are good LGBT health clinics in our area and how I plan on talking to an Endo there in the beginning of the year as well as a local physiologist just to have someone as support, since our area is informed consent. My mom cried a lot, I can understand that, its a lot to take in and she's an emotional person. This made my wife cry to, she's a very epithetic crier. God Estrogen is gonna make me a crier isn't it?  My mom asked my wife concerned questions. It was hard for her to articulate what she was trying to say. Stuff Like ""You see your life in certain ways,"" ""We'd understand if you couldn't"" I think she was concerned my wife might want to leave me. My parents Love my wife. Up until now she has been like their Daughter. But like my wife told me when we talked about this, ""I married you because I love you. In my vows I didn't say anything about what gender I want you to be."" I think another point my mom tried to bring up was that my wife would be unsatisfied sexually but thats just what I'm inferring because it was like a question about if she could be with a woman, though I never mentioned that I plan on keeping my toy. But my Wife reassured them that what she actually likes about me is my feminine qualities, and the first time she noticed me i was wearing eyeliner and nail polish. And she had a crush on this girl in college that she might've explored if she wasn't dating me. My Dad talked about how he was concerned. Concerned for my safety since there are a lot of people out their that are bigots and just awful. He just want me to be happy and healthy, and he said he was sad that I'm starting this as they're moving away and they won't be close by if I need support. It was very nice. He mentioned that he worries that I might just be trading one unhappiness for another. And that I might be unhappy with all the way people would treat me now. This is understandable, he concerns are all the things I think about as well. But we talked about how me working in the tech industry is good because most people in it tend to be liberal and most areas where I would find work are liberal. Or my wife and I could quit our desk jobs and open a little LGBT shop in orlando near them. Joking, but we might actually like that more then desk job. 

They asked questions bout what my time table is, if I'm going to change my name, etc. I didn't want to overload them because this is all a lot to take in at once and I've thought about this for a while were as they've know for like an 30min. So I told them that for now I just want to go talk to an endo about my options and go from there. As for the name I told them I'm not sure. Which isn't a lie. I haven't decided on one yet. I told them I do like that the combinations of my wife and my initials spells JEM. So I have been trying to think of a cute J name, though my wife thinks my birth name works. 

After all the talk and tears there were hugs and we moved on to talking normally about them visiting my Borther and his new baby girl in a few weeks. I couldn't really sleep that night. I just wanted to go back in the closet. I just want everything to be normal. I just want everyone to be happy and not worry. And I felt like this morning my parents did talk to us much, but I think thats just cause they also are working on prepping annoying chores like talking to movers and going to the DMV. 

I'm sure theres more I could say or missed saying, but I feel like I'm rambling now. I do feel better after writing this. A little less anxious. Thanks for reading. &lt;3"

secondaccount42,asktransgender,Boatload of Questions...,"So I've been popping in with a lot of questions recently as I'm trying to get a start on my situation, and I have even more questions, might as well get em' out of the way in one big post, right?.  
To start, what is a reasonable price for me to look at therapists before, and, on average, how many sessions should I be attending, and how frequently? I have found some in the area, and will be doing a bit more detailed of a search.  
Once I've started HRT (a long ways away I'm sure [maybe I'm wrong]), how long should I be capable of guy-mode? Being in High School, I don't want any information going out about me, and I doubt I'd be able to last long trying to switch my identity between school years (someone would notice). I'm paranoid enough about secrets leaking as-is, if my use of a double account, and lack of pictures of myself (or even mention of my first name) doesn't make that obvious.  
How should I be dealing with friends who I know wouldn't support me? I have numerous who I'm sure wouldn't support me (one wouldn't even accept me as an asexual), and would rat me out in a heartbeat... I guess this correlates with the last question, is it likely that I could keep myself hidden until college? I'd probably be able to just kinda disconnect myself from there.  
As a final question, what kind of workout routine should I be following leading into HRT, as well as throughout? I'm way on the heavy side right now, and I should probably be getting a head-start, having constantly heard that HRT makes weight-loss harder.  
I think that about covers it for now, if more questions come up, depending on when they rear their head, I may edit them into this post. Thanks in advance!"

Happy being male, but there's something inside of me that's definitely female, and I don't understand it, why it's there, or what it means.  I made [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5iwvw1/other_than_porn_what_in_your_browser_history/dbbmxe9/) in an AskReddit thread a few days ago, and it got a fair amount of attention, and a couple of folks suggested I follow up by posting here.  Long story short, I don't have much classic Dysphoria in the DSM-V sense, and what I do have, arose late in life and is mild. 


I suppose here are some of the questions I have:


Is it possible to be ""somewhat"" transgender?  Or is ""gender variant/fluid"" the preferred term?  (Or something else entirely?)


In the case of MtF feelings, does the psychiatric community still cling to the ""anything that's not Classic Gender Dysphoria must be autogynephilia as a pathology"" way of thinking?  I ask because my feelings are largely non-erotic.  I have no interest in fetishistic transvestism, for example.  I know that the autogynephilia model has been criticized in recent years (trans scholars like Julia Serano come to mind), and it's a label I'm definitely uncomfortable with. 


I present strongly as male (starkly masculine clothing, full beard, etc), and I don't think much of that needs to change.  Still, it feels like I'm *dying* to express femininity somehow in a way that wouldn't ""out"" me or look ridiculous.  :(  What do I do?  Would welcome any suggestions at all.  I'm just...lost, and feeling so alone.  I can't say much to my wife, even though she's tolerant and loving.


Thank you for your love and support."

Ragnellrok,asktransgender,For those of you who take Progesterone,"So a bit of preface before the question here.

1. I am 25, been doing HRT since 24.

2. I started HRT over a year ago.

3. My last E/T levels were very good according to my doctor who said that the E was ALMOST too high, so score!

4. I take 8mg of E and 200 spiro daily, half in the morning, half at night.

5. I just got Prometrium 100mg added to my scripts Monday right after Thanksgiving (was supposed to be Friday, but Walgreens was being a moron and not getting the faxes).

6. I have been taking Prometrium in the morning, though I decided that night would probably work better, just from what I've heard other trans people say about when they take theirs (wasn't given a specific time, just thought it might be better that way).

Now to the question. How long did it take you all who take Progesterone to see results? How drastic has it been overall do you think? I especially want to hear from people who got it added after their normal HRT stuff, like they pressured their doc into it and got it approved half a year or more after the start of HRT.

Please note, I mention my age so people don't assume I'm super, super old or super, super young and mention my time HRT so people don't keep asking that for responses. I really do want to hear from everyone taking Progesterone, so please do let me know. Thanks~

letempsbleu,asktransgender,i have a hard time wrapping my head around gender identity,"so i try to explain about my experiences to my therapist, about how i imagined to have a female body and how i couldnt match with the male culture around me. but due to lack of information on being trans , i cant explain it deeply. i didnt see myself as woman , i still dont . i rather try to understand what being a woman means. some claim that it is in your brain. i am not sure i understand that how can a brain have gender. how can be sure they are trans without needing to change their body. 

- what is being a woman to you
- what part of being a woman you wouldnt give up
- have you always felt ""womanness"" in you or you gained it slowly
- can i desire to have a female body without seeing the true ""womanness"" in my brain.

Kimberly_GR,asktransgender,Can anyone help me by submitting trans art for a PSA?,"Hi everyone, I'm new to Reddit (I literally just made this account) but I figured it might be a good place to search for volunteers in a PSA project I'm working on.

My name is Kimberly, I'm 20, and I'm a pretty kickass trans girl. I live in Michigan and go to school in Grand Rapids. 

So, onto the project. I got tired of seeing all of the boring PSA's aimed at cis people, so I decided to create something targed at inspiring our community. Basically the PSA is an idea for a crowdsourced showcase of all the cool things trans people are studying/creating/being passionate about. The goal of the project is to show how trans people all over the world are surviving and ""Leaving their mark"". 

For anyone into filmmaking out there, the format will be a one-minute montage of crowdsourced footage, spliced with some B-Roll I'm shooting myself. Each shot will end with a shot of the 'trans logo' so that I can match cut to another clip. If you don't quite know what that means, I've also put together a quick transparent overlay that you can find [here](http://imgur.com/a/CL55L) to help with the framing. 

Onto the specifics: 
If you would like to participate, all I need from you is an email with

*Your Name

*Your Location (State/Country)

*A photo or short (up to one second) video of something you've created/are passionate about.

FAQ's: 

*Q: Do I need to have the logo on my art/in my photo? 

A: Not at all, but by sending it to me, be aware that I may need to edit the image and place a logo over the image. 

*Q: Do I need to be a binary trans person to participate? 

A: If you consider yourself a part of the trans community, you're more than welcome to help! 

*Q: Where can I see the PSA? 

A: The project is due to my professor for critique on Dec 18. I might need to re-edit some things to polish the final piece, but when it's done I'll edit this post as well as a make a new post providing the link!

*Q: I'm wary about sending anything/why do you need this/can I send copyrighted material?  

A: It's just for a school project, where it will be non-profit, and fair use so anything you send will be much appreciated. "
potatochocolate,asktransgender,"Transgender, non-binary and the use of pronouns","Throughout my post I'll be using Oxford Dictionary definitions.

Gender: The state of being male or female (typically used with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones).

Transgender: Denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex.

Gender dysphoria: The condition of feeling one's emotional and psychological identity as male or female to be opposite to one's biological sex.

Gender is a state of being male or female. Gender dysphoria is the condition that transgender people have, wherein they feel that their gender identity is the opposite of their biological sex. These definitions do not include non-binary identities, and I'm not being bigoted or somehow ""transphobic"" for making this distinction clear.

I'm not saying non-binary identities don't exist - they must exist since so many people are claiming to have them. What I'm saying is that people with a non-binary identity, who aren't transitioning, shouldn't be squeezing themselves into the transgender label by twisting medical definitions to suit themselves. Even if the person with the non-binary identity IS transitioning medically, I think it's quite narcissistic and contentious to demand the rest of the population learn and use special new pronouns for a group that likely makes up no more than 0.1-0.2% of their respective country's population.

I'm male-to-female transgender and I don't care what pronouns people use for me. If they're nice, they'll use she/her. If not, they won't. I can't dictate the language that others use around me, because our society was founded upon free speech. The people in the transgender community demanding special pronouns and condemning anyone who doesn't use those special pronouns as ""transphobic"" or ""bigoted"" or ""truscum"" are so toxic, that they're making transgender relations with society worse for the rest of us.

Pronouns are not the be-all end-all of your gender identity. The pronouns people use are out of your control. Stop worrying about other people and what they do or say, stop worrying about identity politics and things that you cannot control. Just worry about yourself: have you alleviated your gender dysphoria via transition? If you have, then you needn't worry about what other people think.

Please, can we stop with the ridiculousness of demanding special pronouns and screaming ""bigot!@!!"" and ""transphobic!!@!"" at everyone who thinks differently?"

whatifiwassomeone,asktransgender,"I've had ""transgender"" thoughts and feelings for a long time. What should I do?","Hi everyone. Not sure if this is the right place to post, and I hope my post doesn't offend, and that someone can help guide me in the right direction.
  
I'm a 25 year old male, and for all my life I've had thoughts and feelings that I'm not sure what to do with them. I've asked the question ""am I transgender?"" at several points in my life, but I guess I've never really found the answer. If I try to take an objective look at myself, I guess some of the ""tells"" of being transgender are there. But I'm not sure if I'm like those other biological men who took the difficult step to become the gender they feel they are on the inside.
  
As a young boy, I was always fascinated by the thought of being a girl, although I can't really say that I've really felt like I *was* a girl, or that being a boy felt wrong. I loved pretending to be a girl, and when playing with toys or video games I always chose a female figure or avatar. I was attracted to girls' clothes, felt like I wanted to wear them. There was a longing there, and it never went away. As a young adult I sometimes crossdress, as long as I'm in a situation where it won't be discovered.
  
But I'm not sure if I have the right to call myself transgender. The feeling of crossdressing feels more like it's a sexual thing than an emotional thing. Sexually I'm entirely attracted to girls, but when I fantasize, I feel like I want to *be* a girl, not have sex with one. That's something that puzzles me, though I can't deny it. I've had girlfriends before, but when the time came where we were going to have sex, I noticed that I had no interest in intercourse at all. I didn't feel aroused at all. However, the thought of being a girl and having sex as a girl does. I notice myself ""checking out"" girls very often, but I'm not really thinking about their body, or interacting with them, but about their clothes and shoes and how much I'd like to be able to dress like that.
  
I often think, if I had been born a girl, would I feel more comfortable with myself, would I be happier? And my answer is: I don't know. I never really liked my own body (I'm 6ft tall, skinny but strongish, and have a deep voice and poor posture), and I often wish I was shorter, more graceful, and had long hair. I don't often meet people who are taller than me, but when I do it kinda feels good and I feel attracted to such people. I sometimes catch myself using body language that could be perceived as girly, and it makes me feel simultaneously good and guilty. But would I want to be a girl for real, permanently? That question kinda scares me actually, and I often avoid thinking about it because it depresses me a bit. Even if I wanted to become a girl, I'll always be stuck with this gorilla body and voice and I'd never pass as a girl.

But there are long periods where I hardly think about it at all. Most of the time, I accept the gender I am, and I feel fine with being a man. But on a purely sexual level I always long to be girl, and every once in a while (say, a few times a year), there's an emotional part that comes into play as well. So what am I then?
  
So, I think about being a girl in a sexual way, and on an emotional level it feels appealing, but deep down I know it could never happen and I sortof avoid thinking about it for that reason. So I guess, I don't know. What should I do? I'll be thankful for any advice or suggestions you can give me."

pinkchips,asktransgender,Did transition change your sensitivity to temperature?,"As a MAB I am reasonably warm natured, which is nice for cold days and cold theaters, not so nice when I have to crank down the AC in the room to 67 to put on makeup under a time limit without fucking it up by sweating.  
  
However most cis girls I know usually are quite sensitive to the cold, and I'm now wondering if transition can affect this.  
  
Did you notice that a ""comfortable"" temperature for you, and/or your tolerable temperature range changed?  "
DaveUnknown,asktransgender,Just wondering...,"Maybe I'm overthinking things too much these days, so I'd like to share with you some thoughts about dysphoria.

Virginity. Is it possible that the need of experiencing sensations of the woman body is a way of overcompensate the lack of female companionship?

Clothing. If all kind of garments were considered unisex by society, wouldn't be any reason for cross dressing? Would the difference between male and female be blurred?

Sexuality. Is it incongruous to have zero sexual attraction to anybody and at the same time to have the need of venting when an attractive woman came across wearing some clothes of your desire?"
QuestioningMtF1,asktransgender,What are my options?,"I've decided to finally see a gender therapist after about 5 months of questioning. I need to do it secretly, however I'll be home in a few days after finals for almost a month until next semester. I don't have many options if any to sneak to visit someone under the cover of doing something else, since I live in a small town. It's hard to imagine putting of getting help and answers for a whole month. Are there any online services that I can email or chat w/ a therapist through messaging, etc? What are my options?"
Rbull13,asktransgender,Why am I thinking these things... am I really trans?,"I am writing this because I really need advice.  I apologize for the length.  I am just letting my thoughts flow.  

When I was little, my parents tried to put me in dresses and pink and gave me dolls to play with.  I always resisted.  When I was forced to wear them, I was always self conscious and uncomfortable.  I didn't understand why I was being offered or expected to like these things.  I used to be incredibly jealous of the things my brother was given.  I used to steal them from him and try to convince him that it was my stuff all along.  When I was 7 my uncle bought me this huge barbie dream house for my birthday...I started to rip the wrapping off and was mortified.  I couldn’t even finish unwrapping it all the way.  I ran over to the other side of the house and cried.  

Other than that, I don’t remember much of how I was up until about 4th or 5th grade.  I think I was pretty normal.  I had both male and female friends at school, though my best friends were always girls until I was about 10.  Then everything started getting weirder.  In 4th or 5th grade,  I took up ice hockey and played on boys teams until I finished high school. Every time my parents tried to switch me into girl's hockey, I resisted.  I always thought that I just liked the boy's game better, but in all honesty it was something more than that.  I felt uncomfortable not only in the locker room and interacting as one of the girls, but I somehow felt in my heart like it was beneath me and that I didn't belong there.  

I also lost all my friends.  I still wanted to play video games and sports, but they all of a sudden wanted to do teenage girl things.  I felt isolated and alone.  I did my best to try to fit in, including getting clothes from the trendy places (which I never wore), and getting highlights in my hair.  I ended up cutting the highlights out with scissors in the bathroom.  My teacher caught me and I told her that people were bullying me about them, but as far as I can remember, that didn't happen.  All that happened was some girl pointed out that I had them.  Either I blocked out something crucial that I can’t remember now, or the problem was something in my own heart deep down.  

Something similar happened again when I was a sophomore in high school.  I got my mom to let me get my hair and makeup done for school pictures, but I barely made it to the picture station, much less actually look at the prints when they came.  I told my mom not to give them out to people, but she did it anyway because she thought that I looked beautiful.  It broke my heart.  

My teenage years were very painful.  I got depressed at around 12 and my grades tanked, but I thought at the time it was because I was all alone and my parents were getting divorced.  I dated a few guys and always had problems with our personalities clashing.  They wanted to be the guy and wanted me to be the girl, but I don’t know how to be the girl.  I started dating women after that and it really helped.  Not because of my sexuality, but because of the relationship dynamics. 

I am sure that I missed critical parts of my life, but moving to recent years... when I was 19 I started going to university.  I still couldn't make friends and wore nothing but baggy clothing and sweatpants all the time.  I stopped being able to think clearly about anything and all of my desire to do anything melted away.  I didn't leave my apartment for probably 3 or 4 months and just ordered in subs and pizza and played an online video game.  It was more than just immaturity and laziness because I wanted to do well, I just couldn't force myself to do anything.  I even gave up hockey.  

I told my mom that I had started to feel like I didn't want to be alive anymore; I was sent to inpatient where they diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and threw me on some meds.  I took all kinds of different medications that did strange things to my moods and personality for the next 5 years, but nothing made me any less depressed.  My diagnosis changed from BPD to clinical depression to SAD to PTSD from child abuse, but no matter how much therapy I had or how much I talked about any of these things, nothing got better.  

I stopped associating with my dad over a year ago and that helped me a lot.  I have been able to start trying to figure out who I am deep down without worrying about whether or not what I do will piss him off.  All of my life until now has felt almost like I was walking around in a cloud.  Hockey is about the only thing I did that ever felt real, and the relationship I’m in with my fiance has a similar effect, yet something in my heart still doesn't feel right.  

I started seeing a gender specialist in November of 2015 and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria.  She offered me a note for hormone therapy a few months later.  The problem I have now is that I still am not sure what I should do. I'm 25 now and I think about whether I am really a man deep down almost every day.  When people say that I am like a woman or mention anything about my body other than how muscular I am, it really bothers me.  I work out a lot to make me look more muscular.   It helps, but it’s still not enough.  Some days I feel fine and I manage to convince myself that I can live just fine as a super butch woman, but some days it feels like someone punched me in the gut.  I obviously don't know what it's like to be a man because I have never been one, but I don't feel like a woman.  I have never felt like a woman. 

My body doesn't bother me all that much, especially when I am with my partner because I feel like she sees me for who I really am deep down.  The thing is, she’s a lesbian and I am deathly afraid to lose her if I transition.  I have been with her for almost 3 years now and I love her more than anything. She lets me be a macho idiot which feels so good.  It’s part of who I am.  She rolls her eyes, but I know she loves me for it. I keep trying to convince myself that I don't need to transition, that her happiness is worth more than anything, and that I would be nothing without her, but I still have days where this eats at me.  

Am I just depressed about something else or am I really transgender?  For those of you who have transitioned, did you experience just straight up dissatisfaction with your life, like nothing you do is good enough or nothing you do could make you happy, like you’re living in a cloud and you wonder sometimes what the purpose of life really is?  I know the obvious signs of gender dysphoria are things like body dysphoria, but I don’t really get a lot of that.  Is hormone therapy really that much better?  I feel like people will know I’m trans anyway, and not having a penis will bother me.  

I wonder a lot if I’m trying to convince myself that I’m trans for some reason.  Like maybe just 1 more thing to try to fix my depression.  I don’t know. Is this a common thing for butch lesbians to feel?  Maybe I am just not happy that my masculinity is not being acknowledged vs being trans?  I am seeing an endo in about a month for my testosterone levels being too high and I almost WANT them to find out that I’m intersex so that I have a physical reason for feeling the way I do.  I sometimes can't help but feel that if it’s all in my head then it’s not real.  Other times it’s so real that it’s terrifying.  What do you all think?  "
ThrowawayMtF15,asktransgender,Am I really experiencing chest dysphoria?,"(AMAB) I've been considering the possibility I might be experiencing chest dysphoria but I'm not sure. I've woken up a few times and have noticed my flat chest. When wearing a light jacket I'm often conscious of something that feels ""missing"" between my chest and my jacket. When I lean over it feels like a weight should be hanging on my chest. However, when I have my shirt off or when I'm standing where my shirt makes contact with my chest, then I don't feel that way. Also I lift weights regularly so maybe the soreness is causing this? Am I really experiencing dysphoria or could it be something else??"
AstrosCat,asktransgender,Therapist?,"Okay, so, I want to speak to a therapist about this stuff cause my head is a labyrinth right now and I just wanna slay the Minotaur already (was it a Minotaur? Idk, doesn't matter) there's just one problem: I'm 16 and I'm too scared to come out to my parents.

Okay, so, I guess what I'm asking is are there any tips for how I can get my parents to let me see a therapist without coming out? My best bet would be my mom because she already had me going a few years back, but now she'd probably keep asking until I spilled (or made something up but that's a can of worms situation). 

I just need to understand what's happening before I do something I might regret or worse.

Hylian,asktransgender,How to tell super religious parents?,"Just as some background, I am 30 and am not living with my parents. I have been on hormones for a little over five months now. So far I am only out to a few friends and two of my family members and so far they have taken it well (I did select ones that I thought would be best at receiving the news of course). I want to tell my parents and my sister so I can stop hiding this part of me but I know that my parents won't react well and I don't know about my sister although I am afraid she may ban me from seeing my niece and nephew if she disapproves. 

I could probably hide the fact that I am on hormones for at least a bit but even that is uncertain. I only see my parents maybe once every other month and I see my sister and niece and nephew about twice a month. They haven't said anything yet but I think it's getting pretty obvious. My face is less angular and I am losing muscle mass (although not as quickly as I hoped) but what I think may give me away is my breast growth. At the five month mark I am already right around a 40D and while I can hide it with a sports bra and doubling up on shirts or coats it is getting noticeable. 

My therapist says it is up to me when to tell them (obviously) but she encouraged me to tell them sooner than later. I want to tell them but I am just so scared. I have always been disconnected from my parents and anytime they find something they disagree with they go into denial mode. But I am sure this is one area they won't be able to stay in denial on. I have a good idea how this will go down because I was raised to believe that Trans people where in their words ""men in dresses"" and that anyone who was LGBT was possessed by demons and needed them cast out (my parents are Pentecostal pastors). I have slowly been doing more feminine things around them to try and get them accustomed to the idea (ear piercing, nose piercing, growing my hair out, painting my nails, etc) and each time they have complained to me about it (mainly my mother). 

I remember the first time I showed up with painted nails she grabbed my wrists and shook my arms and said how ugly I looked with them and how she couldn't take this. She did that twice in one day and it was on mother's day of all days......

So I pretty much know they won't take it well and I fear I may lose the ability to contact my niece or nephew when I come out. but I also am tired of hiding myself from them and I just want them to love me for who I am (even though I know that is unlikely). I know that I should tell them sooner than later because if I don't they will find out from someone else or they will start noticing changes (I am far from passing but it is still getting quite noticeable that something is up). So does anyone have any suggestions on if I should wait or just come out and if I should come out now how should I tell them?

**TLDR**: I want to tell my super religious parents but I am also scared beyond belief.

I usually can't eat more than one piece of pizza or more than a $1.00 burger at McDonald's. Its been that way for as long as I can remember however for the past week I've been super hungry last time I went to McDonald's I ordered a Large Grand Mac Meal and finished it all!  This is very abnormal for me.  I usually eat often but small.  Now I eat only 5-6 times a day but a lot.  Is this normal for second puberty?  Maybe because the hormones want more fat to distribute(which I have VERY little of).   I wouldn't call it hungry as much as I would call it I have the ability to eat a lot more.  "

Futurist110,asktransgender,Would it be a good idea for a cross-dresser to grow some muscles in order to deal with the risk of getting beaten up or killed?,"Basically, I am not transgender; however, I *am* an aspiring cross-dresser and my question here is about transphobic violence (since I strongly doubt that idiotic, violent transphobes actually differentiate between trans-women and cross-dressers). Thus, here goes:

Would it be a good idea for a cross-dresser to grow some muscles in order to deal with the risk of getting beaten up or killed by some violent, transphobic idiots?

Also, for the record, I am talking about growing muscles to the extent that one is still able to look good while one is wearing female clothes, et cetera.

Anyway, any thoughts on this?"
SphirosOKelli,asktransgender,Detransitioners - Did you know some of them support us? (Also - proof that transition is not targeted at eliminating lesbians),"I recently engage in a discussion with some random stranger - I know, I know - who is hell bent on insisting that children, specifically ""female"" children, are being transitioned during childhood against their wills.

She, naturally, had no evidence to back her claims. She made a couple of attempts, but ultimately she lead me to this video:

https://mariacatt.com/2016/10/18/dont-try-to-convince-people-to-detransition-with-my-videos/

Maria experienced major trauma growing up and as a result felt a disconnect from her femininity. She started transition but realized that being seen as a man was not what she wanted and she started seeking healing from her trauma. 

She has found that people look to her for support and as a reason to invalidate transition - which she says she will not offer. (Note she doesn't agree with adolescent transition but that's a tricky subject.)

I wanted to talk about a couple of things here...

First off - transition is both mentally and physically difficult. It has amazing benefits, but it is work. And transition is NOT FOR EVERYONE. Let me clarify... Medical transition is not for everyone.

Taking hormones, going through surgery - these are not requirements for being trans. And if you find yourself living a life where you are happy simply cross-dressing, or changing your name - AKA social transition - you should never feel pressured to move beyond that.

Secondly - if you are exploring your gender and you feel like it is not really what you want - Stop. Take a breath. Take a break. Talk to a counselor. The community as a whole will not hate you for choosing to make your needs a priority. We don't need your ""success"" story - we have plenty of those. But apart from that - we don't want you to do things to yourself that you A) don't ultimately want to do but do because of peer pressure, and B) you then go back and use as a reason why people like me shouldn't transition. It hurts you, it hurts us - what we want is for you to be safe to explore your gender without repercussion. So if you are making decisions that you are uncertain of or do not fully understand please try to take time to evaluate before moving forward.

Now, that being said, I have found a few talking points that are *excellent* rebuttals to the whole ""Girls are being forced to transition and detransition is the proof"".

""Lots of people detransition so this shows that the treatments don't work."" False:

Gendertrender (I think that's the blog?) showed an internet study of 200 people who detransitioned.

Of those 200, 26% stopped transitioning because they realized they could never achieve what they really wanted so they decided to focus on other ways to cope with dysphoria. 18% claimed that they never saw a counselor and determined that their issues were related to some other issue. (People - GO SEE A COUNSELOR)

Others, and I don't remember all the stats - said that they were unaware of exactly how much was going to change and the changes startled them so they stopped. (Again - see a counselor and do your research. You should never make a major health decision without knowing all the repercussions!!) Others began transition and felt uncomfortable with the way the hormones affected their health, they often indicated that they didn't feel their doctors understood what they were doing and so they chose to be healthy rather than transition. (I don't blame them... I cannot tell you how many times I hear a transguy talking about how his super insane T levels are ""spot on my doc said so"". (Don't just assume your doctor knows what they are talking about - DO RESEARCH!)

""Transiton is targeted at gender non-confroming girls because people are trying to get rid of the gays"".

This study here (and yes the link is safe to download I tested it) discussed the rate of FTM vs MTF transition in adolescents between the ages of 13-19:

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCzvihxvLQAhWXdFAKHfxpDLEQFgghMAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediafire.com%2F%3Fwoq6edhbnfk6u64&amp;usg=AFQjCNEscoBrULVDPFchCcIgxWgsL6lY1A&amp;sig2=3iHJvMsf7zjs2aoMBNMeyQ&amp;bvm=bv.141536425,bs.2,d.eWE

It's a hefty read, but it basically says that they think that more FTMs between the ages of 13-19 (about 18 a year compared to about 11 MTFs per year) is most likely due to the fact that it's socially more acceptable for a ""girl"" to adopt a male identity than it is for a ""boy"" to adopt a female identity. The study also clearly indicates that transition produces LGB people as well as straight people - so it's a real twofer!

This is probably stuff people already know... But having access to scientific studies that prove our points is always handy when attempting to shut down naysayers.

In fact, when my fellow debator couldn't prove her point she descended into calling me a narcissist who thinks girls getting raped is ok as long as there aren't too many...

Sigh... Cisgender people can be so delusional sometimes... Hopefully this can help you bring some reality to their clouded minds...."
askjfikn,asktransgender,"did anyone else go through a severe depression, and how are they doing now? uplifting stories please","I keep feeling like an idiot for a lot of the choices I made, namely the decision to stay at University and complete the first year of my course, despite the fact that I was battling severe suicidal depression, constant anxiety and stress, and insomnia so bad that for two months I could only sleep for a few hours one night out of every four or five. It was without a doubt the worst experience of my life, it was constant pain and torture, literally like being in hell. And I'm still kind of in it, I still take antidepressants BUT after over a year of waiting (I live in the UK) I will hopefully hopefully be starting HRT at some point within the next few days, maybe even tomorrow.

I just feel so sad that depression basically took away a year of my life. I have learned a lot about myself in this time but it really wasn't worth being that ill and although I completed my first year with incredible difficulty and only with my mum basically writing my essays for me despite me being 19. I am 20 soon. I just feel so sad about so much. Sad that my University experience was such a nightmare, sad that I stayed because of my extreme perfectionist personality making me stay even though every time I looked at the essay paper I wanted to slit my wrists, its just so fucked.

Basically now I am at home and finally sleeping and eating properly and being looked after and don't have the pressure of academia breathing down my neck I can look back and realise how horrifically fucked everything was. 

I think its because from the age of like 15 I wanted so badly to not think about my sexual orientation/gender identity that I invested all my energy into my studies. I am an intelligent person, I was predicted almost all A grades in school but that monumentally fucked with my mental health because it meant there was this constant perfectionist pressure voice in my head that told me unless anything I did was perfect it was shit and this caused me to have a mental breakdown.

I'm just so sad and need help. I am getting better though. I am seeing a counsellor, taking antidepressants, trying to go out and spend less time staring at screens. Its just so hard :( sorry this was so long I needed to vent."
elonnealon,asktransgender,Coming out: before or after the holiday?,"Hi

I'm 21, ftm, 1 month on T. Part time employed, full time student, still not 100% financially independent, but getting there. Basically, I think the benefits of telling my parents outweigh any potential negative consequences, and I feel like I should do it before I get further along on T and start to really look different, just for politeness.

In December, I'm visiting my folks from the 20th to the 27th. I'm trying to decide if it's better to tell them on, like, the 21st or 22nd and risk ruining Christmas or making it all about me, or if I should do it on the 26th, which I don't really want to do because it'd be like ""Mom, I'm trans"" *hops on a plane and comes back with a beard a year later*. I feel like it's better if I'm around for a few days while she's processing so I can support her emotionally, ya dig?

I dunno. What do you think seems like the most diplomatic way to handle this? I feel like even though it's far from ideal timing, it needs to be over Christmas break because I probably won't see them again until the summer, by which point I'll be 6 months on T and it seems rude to wait that long."

lyaa55,asktransgender,Feel like i'm driving myself crazy...,"So I think this is just cause I was alone a lot today.. I'm about to go see a friend.

So sometimes I start feeling really ambivalent about exactly TWO of the effects of hrt.  I feel a little weird about breast growth and ball shrinkage.

Lol which makes it sound like, ""wtf, get off that stuff.""  But-- I like that I can wear girl's pants now and there's no lump.  I do have genital dysphoria.  I get v. annoyed sometimes when I remember I have a penis.  I don't like to use it or think of it as such during sex.  I do like my breasts.  But sometimes I'm like, noticing my residual chest hair, and I'll think ""what am I doing?"" or ""i am just slating myself for harassment.""  And these two things are revealed as internalized transmisogyny and fear of harassment and discrimination.

I love that (with laser) I hardly grow facial anymore.  I could never feel happy with what I looked like or how I dressed all my life.  But now (dressing in only women's or gender neutral clothes and a few months on hrt) I am like pretty ecstatic leaving the house and am super excited to be getting new clothing.  I feel happier, more energetic, more functional, and more social in general.

Gawdamn.  I expose myself to fucking trans misogynistic hate and it drives me crazy if I let it.  I need to develop a thicker skin, or try to limit my exposure to bullshit that I know will only work against me.

On the ""am I trans part 2"" YouTube video I identified w/ 5 of the 7 ""signs"" of gender dysphoria

- I've only been able to crossdress handful of times (all sexual, which has confused me)

- age 14-15, would pray to wake up a girl every night, pray for brain transplant machine, want aliens to abduct me and change me to girl, wishing I was put in witness protection so I could get a sex change disguise lol, curious about reincarnation

- always having had sexual fantasies as a girl

- took gender tests and got ""female"" a majority of the time

- fascination by gender bending themes

- majority of time choosing female avatars, including female names on some email accounts

- Seeing attractive girls, wanting to be w/ them and imagining being them at same time

- Maybe felt some jealousy of women 

- most dreams in past few years as female, feeling very happy in them, hoping to go back asleep to continue them. Also lucid dream to try to be female in them

- possibly having ""phantom breasts"", feel something missing in chest area at times



Against Trans:

- not really having dysphoria, at least body dysphoria i think

- enjoy lots of typical ""guy"" stuff

- not depressed/ in fact pretty happy"

OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,How did you come to terms with your sexuality after coming to terms with your gender?,"As soon as the holidays are over, I'm having a serious talk with my dad and I'll hopefully be on the road to HRT very soon.

I'm accepting of the fact that I'm a girl, and that starting next year I'm going to start living my life as one. But, god I can't help but feel ashamed about my sexuality. 

I thought I liked girls, and at the start of accepting being trans I thought I was a lesbian. But the more I think, I realize I've never been attracted to women, ever. I only wanted to be with them because it was an obligation I felt as a guy.

And, for as long as I've been questioning my gender, I've been battling ""homosexual thoughts"". I always knew I wasn't a gay guy, that just wasn't it. But I don't think being a lesbian girl fits either. 

This is so embarrassing to type for some reason, but also exciting and good to get off my chest: I think I'm a straight girl. I think I like guys. I want to have a boyfriend, I want to be a guy's girlfriend. 


But now, I'm worried that im convincing myself of this. That im going to start becoming attracted to my guy friends(who I'm NOT attracted to) because I said this. 

I know, internalized ""heterophobia""( I guess?????) or ""homophobia"" or something like that. But I'm legit concerned. This is something my therapist cant really help me with. 

I just don't want to start liking my friends. "

Rhydge,asktransgender,"Quitting HRT, a few questions[minor nsfw]","I thought I was transgender for quite some time, and decided to go on HRT for a while. I've been on HRT for 8 months and feel no difference. I haven't gained weight, nothing feels redistributed, and I have grown very minimal breast tissue that you really can't see at all unless I'm not wearing anything. [nsfw part] It just made my nipples a little puffy and very hard.[nsfw end].  I didn't really notice any changes and I think I'm more of just gender neutral or something instead of trans. So I'm going off of HRT.

I want to make sure quickly that there's no serious health issue I'll encounter from quitting basically cold turkey from 2 doses of 2 mg estradiol and 100mg spironolactone.

Also, I know breast tissue doesn't really go away, but is there any chance it might disperse since it's been such a minimal effect over 8 months? Would developing chest muscles more hide it, in case it doesn't disperse?   Will the tissue just soften over time with the lack of estradiol?"

I live in Wisconsin, in a liberal family(baby boomer parents and an older brother), most of my friends are liberal and my school is extremely diverse both racially and LGBT-wise. Well, LGB-wise, as far as I know. Yet I am just so crushed by the prospect of coming out. Well... I technically came out like a year ago to my mother and my psychologist. My mother responded with baby-boomer-ish wishy-washy-acceptance, but promptly forgot(She has bipolar and doesn't have that good a memory), and my psychologist moved to Florida and I haven't had one since. 

I already feel extremely isolated; Just like my mother, I have bipolar, and I also have OCD and generalised anxiety disorder, *and* I am partially deaf.

Hi guys and girls,

I'm a 20 year old amab but I'm bigender and I go out part time all the time and I pass ok, I'm happy. But I'm super worried about Male Pattern Baldness because I currently have a feminine hairline and I love my hair. Does anyone know if going on a low dose of spiro will prevent any recession? Like 50mg a day?

And I can't take finasteride because of a medical condition that it doesn't get along with. And I've also heard finasteride doesn't help at all with hairline but mostly crown baldness which I'm not worried about. 

And I'd honestly love the feminization effects of spiro so it's not a concern to me.
So yeah I'm just wondering if low dose spiro could prevent hair loss or if I need it to bring T to zero (bad for bones so I won't do that) to stop or prevent hair loss.

Thank you and please don't hate me for being a crossdresser. I know it gets a lot of bad rep but I'm just like all of you and I wish I could have been born a girl but at the same time I am super dysphoric of growing breasts so I can't really transition. I'm not ok with my feelings yet and I have a therapist. So please just don't be mean."

* You can do so with a deed poll

* You have to send some documents and pay £30 to some HMRC office thing

* You need a gender recognition cert. from the gov.

* You need a gender recognition cert from your gp/therapist/counsellor/psychiatrist/ect.

Gender answers so far:

* You can't change it if you're a minor

* Your deed poll should serve as adequate proof for schools/colleges/unis but not your passport or anything official

* You need a gender recognition cert. from the gov.

* I'll try to make this short as possible(Sorry if I fail), but over the past couple years I've come to realize that I'm probably not cis. I keep flopping back and forth over whether I am actually trans, or merely not comfortable with my assigned gender simply because I was raised to NOT like it and I'm not an actual man or male-leaning person. I won't get into that looong journey but the point where I'm at now is: I have a lot of things that could be dysphoria: I hate the femininity of my body, I wish I had a deeper voice, puberty felt like my body betraying me and taking away who I was and I'm uncomfortable with my genitals and much more. It doesn't help that on some level I know some of this would be considered internalized misogyny and sexual repression I guess(?) in a cis woman, so I'm left wondering which angle I should approach this from. When I think of the body I'd want and everything I'd basically be a guy with nothing down there, but I'd still have my name and I wouldn't mind if people called me 'they', 'she' or 'he'. But I'm a very short, feminine looking and sounding person in every way and I can't tell if I hate all that so much because I'm trans or if I just have issues. I know you can't help me decide, and I know I should probably see a therapist. But I don't have the money right now and I really need some perspective in the meantime...I'm really alone in this and really lost.

And preferably I'd like not to have to shave since the epilator is so awesome.

I'd like to transition, but I just don't feel like it. I mean, I can live as male fine, it doesn't bother me that much. I'd like to live as female, but at the same time I don't know if transitioning will be worth it.

I'd rather live as a trans-woman than a man. But I dunno if I'd like it or not. I mean, living as male would be easier, less effort, and no one will ask me about being trans. But I'd love to live as female, wear dresses/skirts, high heels, long hair, makeup etc etc... 


My family will NOT be accepting of it. No-one in my family knows I'm trans. They hate transgender people in general, and my brother has posted trans-phobic stuff on Facebook. 


Basicly, this is why I want to be more trans:

* It will make me transition easier
* I can live as female and never want to be male
* I will feel more feminine
* I will understand myself more
* few more (I will add them as I think of them)


Do I make any sense to anyone? Or do I just sound completely stupid and out of my mind? It's just being trans seems better for me, but I don't feel that feminine inside.

I recognize this and have been trying to give her as much space as I can to process all the changes. 

The problem is that every change, no matter how minor that makes me feel good, makes my wife feel bad. So it makes it hard for me to talk about things I'd like to do with her because I don't want to upset her or make her feel bad and that in turn just makes me feel bad. 

But she is the only one (other than a therapist) that I am out to. So when I need support she is the only one I can reach out to. For example, I am getting ready for laser hair removal and had to shave everything (I was a Wookiee in a previous life apparently).

Like every morning, The fact that I might be trans isn't even in my head. It's like it has completely gone. Within the first 60 seconds though I get this thought about being transgender, and now I will get these transgender feelings.


I don't appear feminine, I don't have a feminine personality, I only have very mild gender dysphoria that varies. Sometimes I feel extremely trans, and I just think to myself ""am I stupid, I am trans!"" Then other times I think ""Why do I think I am trans? I'm just stupid"".


It seems like I am just forcing myself to be trans. I cross dress in private. For example, the other day I was in a shop, and there was this woman, probably around 18/19. My inner voice kept saying ""You want to be like her, don't you?"" and it was like my brain was trying to make my dysphoria get worse. I just didn't feel like it, however.

The feeling of being trans is always in my mind, however how ""strong"" it is.

I know someone who is FTM who is the same age called Harry. Harry started transitioning about 2 years ago. Before he started transitioning, he was always very tom-boy, and was quite manly anyway. I feel like if I come out as trans, people will think I'm lying as I've never really appeared that feminine, like harry has.
 

I've always had a feeling of wanting to be a girl. Before I started thinking I was trans (or even know what it really meant), around February time, I remember saying to a friend that if I could chose what gender I was born as, I'd choose a girl. Looking back this was a sign. I've also been cross dressing for years, and when I was younger me and my younger sister used to do clothes swapping (I was the one that always started it, however).



It's like I am making this up in my head and I'm not actually trans, I just trying to do this so I have an excuse to crossdress or something. I'd love to be in public, wearing a dress, tights, nice pair of boots, hand bag, but I know I can't. I'm thinking of just self medicating HRT and forcing myself to transition, if I feel like I am regretting while on it up my dosage.

It's easier to just say I'm a guy and cisgender at this point. It feels like everything transition related is just causing distress. I've reached the point where I don't honestly know what my gender is. Ideally it would be female. But everything seems so damn scary and anxiety inducing. 

I don't even know what I want anymore. I try to stop and then I feel dead inside, but calm. I have been contemplating suicide many times in the last week. I probably wouldn't actually do it, but it sometimes feels like a better option than stopping HRT.

Maybe this is just fear because everything is also getting super real.

abbyjames327,asktransgender,"A co-worker asked ""Are you transgender?""","Those were her exact words, and I was stunned. I am only out to 2 people, my wife and my best friend, and as of right not I am no where near ready to increase that number. I deflected the question and never gave her an answer because I hate lying to people. We had a discussion about that it means to be transgender, and as I explained to her that its not simply a man who wants to be woman or vice versa, her eyes got wider and wider.

I should mention that for Halloween this year I did go to work dressed as a woman, and it felt amazing. I work with the public and I had people who see me everyday that didn't recognize me as a woman until they heard me speak (my voice needs work). This same coworker who asked if I was trans, for about a week afterward, kept asking me if I wanted to be a girl. I think she suspects something is up with me, I know she doesn't mean any harm by asking this stuff, and if i think about it, maybe there are some signs she is picking up on.

I was wondering if anyone else who has had this kind of thing happen, and how you handled it."

"
art_10,asktransgender,Confused about both gender identity and sexual orientation: insights needed/mental illness involved.,"Before I start, I cross-posted this entry on OCD, BPD and porn addiction subreddits to get comprehensive and appropriate insights since all these factors are involved. This is going to be a long post so please bear with me.

I have been mentally ill for almost 10 years now (I am roughly in my mid twenties). I have been previously diagnosed with depression, OCD and bipolar disorder, and had verbally and physically abusive childhood and teen years. However, the limited medical treatment I previously received failed and therapy was never an option (I live in the third, or fourth let me call it, world). I firmly believe that, in addition to my primary illness of OCD and the desire for ultimate perfectionism, I suffer from borderline personality disorder (BPD) (extreme mood swings over external matters, identity confusion, chronic emptiness and splitting, mainly) which my previous psychiatrist refused since 'I had insight and don't cut myself' (lol). All in all, I led a hidden life all this period but I survived to appear as productive in the society and managed to get an advanced university degree while holding steady jobs from time to time. I have been addicted to porn for 12-13 years(!!!) and I am currently going through tough time due to a strong OCD episode of obsessively dwelling over past mistakes and catastrophing the entire situation such as 'I deserve to be punished and killed for my mistakes'. This introduction is just to set the tone of my post and judge it accordingly.

In the past few weeks and months, I increasingly became extremely confused about my gender identity (I am biologically a male) and also about my sexual orientation (more on that later). Before I try dissecting the link between such a confusion and my mental illnesses, I will elaborate on both my gender identity and orientation. At 'my best knowledge and healthiest me', I believe I am a male (like I have always been) and I am generally attracted to females. However and here starts the confusion which is still grounded in a healthy version of myself, I don't think of myself as a 'regular male', but more like a 'female male' or at least an atypical male. Here are the reasons why I think I am not a male (don't want to say 'transgender' in order not to increase the confusion):

1. I hate regular guys stuff such as cars, muscles, short hair, cursing, sex talk, etc... I also hate the 'male gender' in a sense like I feel different (and sometimes disgusted) when being near them. Although I don't do 'apparent' female gestures, I have mid-back long hair and a skinny body. I always wanted to have long hair from my early teens, it was like a 'cool' thing to do. Later on, my reason changed to reflect my musical style and life approach (metal baby!) but, as of late years and deep down inside, I love it because it really makes me more feminine and separate me from males. I am taking a balding medication and I am even ready to take female hormones to preserve my hair! The only thing I share with men is my love for beards as I have always been bearded. However, now I think of it as a social defense mechanism like: 'oh look at that guy who looks like a girl', me turns my face, 'nahhh he has a long thick beard, he can't be ""gay""' (here used as an offensive word to reflect my 4th world society - no disrespect intended). I would like to try a cleaner look and always wear my hair down to appear more feminine but I will have the aforementioned anxiety of appearing 'girly' in front of people in a traditional society.

2. I remember when I was a child feeling 'as a girl' and happy when I once wore a jeans styled like a girly one. In particular and during my late teens, I had a dream that I grew small boobs. The next day, I felt really happy and more feminine than ever. Right now, I love cross-dressing and wearing lingerie. When dressed in such stuff, I usually admire my body in front of the mirror and say that I can be a beautiful girl. Luckily, I have a skinny body so my body can 'pass' (minus the beard). Whenever I see an attractive girl down the street, I'd feel sad and depressed because 'I wanna be like her'; have boobs, an attractive body and a healthier hair. I was mistaken for a female (due to my hair) in a few incidents, I loved such situations and continue to do so.

3. How I feel towards my own body: I really don't hate my penis in the way that is often described by transgenders. However and despite having a slightly below average penis size, I wish I can decrease it even more to have a micropenis because it will simply make me feel more feminine. I sometimes pass through hard and sad times because I want to have a smaller one. This brings me to my next point: sexual orientation.

4. Let me put it in this way (and this is triggering for me): I love females (both emotionally and physically) and my body (i.e. penis) tells me that I will enjoy penetrating them but my mind doesn't like the fact that I will be a top. I am not. I don't like to be the dominant partner. I want to be the recipient and the submissive/passive partner. Now, I don't consider myself to be attracted to males but I also love penises. This is what confuses me. I would never imagine myself in an emotional relationship with a male and even a physical one is not appealing to me, except for the penis. That leaves me to transwomen (or very attractive cross-dressers) who like to use their penises. Porn-related material of transwomen is my primary passion (which surpassed genetic girls a long time ago despite continuing viewing porn related to genetic girls anyway). I am still a virgin because if I wanna have sex, I want to do all the possible stuff which triggers my extreme OCD and fear of diseases. Also, I will 'lose my innocence' and become 'immoral' if I do it (yes, that's what I think thanks to my extreme moral scrupulosity and perfectionism. I am not religious at all, mind you).

Now here are my reasons why I think all of the above is invalid and I am just passing through an extreme mental illness episode and I require treatment as soon as possible:

1. From an OCD perspective and although I enjoy my feminine thoughts and feelings, it can be argued that my thoughts are an extension of Harm OCD, HOCD, etc...  by saying that I continuously obsess over the idea, ask strangers on the Internet and reading other posts about this particular topic. I know I can never trust my thoughts because they aren't often real, especially when they are OCD-induced. However, what isn't common with TOCD folks is the fact that I enjoy my feminine persona and I don't hate it and I don't 'wish if I can get back to my real pure male persona'. Last year however, I had an intense anxiety and fear of 'growing boobs' because the medication I take has such a side effect. But now, I desire this side effect if I can hide it.

2. The next reason which is my ultimate fear (if it's true): borderline personality disorder. It is known that a confusion of identity, values, goals, career, etc... is a core BPD symptom. Why not a gender identity and sexual orientation confusion as well? I still haven't researched experiences of BPD sufferers with similar issues but I just can feel like my deep confusion stems from this core BPD symptom of mine.

3. Porn addiction: my worst enemy. Problem is, I really can't take a break to 'sort my thoughts and feelings out' as I am too addicted. As with most porn sufferers, I progressed from regular, normal, casual porn materials into more extreme stuff and almost all kind of fetishes through the years. Why not transsexual porn, in addition to my other fetishes such as being submissive and loving penises, is just porn-induced and I may feel healthier and 'more male' again once I get an appropriate treatment and abstain from viewing such materials?

whoisthisgirlisee,asktransgender,Has anyone successfully moved from shitty male-esque orgasms to actually good female ones with a solution that's not just time?,"It's been 18 months. I'm so tired of this. 

I get turned on, very into the material I'm consuming, play with my nipples and breasts until it stops being super great doing that, then use a magic wand between my legs, slowly sliding it up and down until I find the spot and angle that feels best. I seem to naturally crave it more intensely so I find myself pushing into it. Within a couple minutes or so, tops, I have a not-super satisfying orgasm that's centered in my genitals, definitely isn't dry, lasts in the single digits of seconds tops, and then immediately get completely exhausted and any further touch feels un-arousing. If I try to hold back and/or edge like I did pre-hrt it typically results in just a really shitty faux orgasm and then refraction happens and I have to stop. 

How do I fix this? How do I move past it? 

Is it my levels and delivery method? I'm on 6mg sublingual estradiol and 300mg spiro, I take half of each in the morning and again at night. Unrelated, but I also take 300 mg of Wellbutrin XL and things seem to have improved marginally since starting that a month or two ago (could be unrelated). Last blood test I had I was ~10 hours after my last dose, I had 153 pg/ml estrogen and 33 ng/dl testosterone which are ostensibly pretty much perfect. Is my estrogen not high enough? Is my testosterone not low enough? Would injections or patches work better? Is it possible I actually am taking too much spiro for this to be good for me? Do I need to add progesterone? When I sampled medoxyprogesterone it was very bad for me, but maybe the real stuff would help?

Is it my equipment? I've got SRS scheduled with Suporn in June 2018 so I'm going to be waiting a while. I'm hoping this fixes things.  Would an orchiectomy help in the meantime? 

Is it my technique? Is there something I'm missing about how to masturbate properly? The last time I brought my prostate into play was a while ago, but from my experience doesn't make much of a difference except for being more intense overall and feeling good. 

Is it something else entirely I'm missing? Does my aphantasia and lack of ability to visualize things mean it's impossible for me to be turned on as much as visualizers are when I'm alone? 

I'm just so tired of being moderately to extremely disappointed from every orgasm I have, and it seems every few days or so I read yet another thread here about how amazing and effortless it is to have mine blowing, earth shattering, amazing orgasms. It frankly causes me more distress, anguish, and dysphoria than almost anything, and I just want to find a way to improve things. 

edit: note by shitty in the title I meant quality, good ""male"" orgasms are great for those who want them! I'd be a lot less unhappy if I were getting ""male"" orgasms that were good."
TransMTFOCD,asktransgender,Trans people with OCD: Does this sound like I'm a lesbian or does this sound like it is my possible OCD causing me to have obsessions about being a lesbian?,"

Every few days I seem to think the same things over and over again. This things being three things in particular, those things being, am I really a transgender woman, am I a lesbian and thoughts about religion (but these ones are slowly going away i think). This happens every few days and when I get the lesbian thoughts I think things like, what if I'm a lesbian, what if because I keep looking at that woman's boobs I'm a lesbian, what if i find out on HRT because HRT can change sexuality that i am actually a lesbian.

These are the kinds of thoughts I get. Are these OCD thoughts? I don't want to be a lesbian because I had my life planned out with a man, marriage, kids, etc and I don't want this with a woman. It's gotten to the point where I'm scared to say it i get very defensive when I say as woman is attractive, when before I had these thoughts I would've said it and thought nothing of it!! Do you think this is just OCD because I don't want to be a lesbian?"
Altria__Pendragon,asktransgender,How would I deal with transphobic (?) parents?,"Somewhat unclear situation and unclear of where to post (I'm mostly new to this ""openly transgender online"" thing):

I'm pretty sure I'm male-to-female transgender. I'm Asian, half Chinese and half Japanese. Japanese father defers all decisions to Chinese mother.

I made the mistake of coming out to my mother - thankfully (?) she took it as a joke and isn't going cuckoo-nutjob-slasher on me. She otherwise seems to be a good person - though the strong anti-transgender stance is wearing on me.

Recently, she tried saying ""Oh you'd just end up having a lot of problems socially as an actual girl, blah blah blah it's so much more drama, it's so hard, you'd just get people to start bullying you more, oh and you won't ever be genetically female so don't even try."" Or something along those lines.

What am I supposed to do? At least attempt to change parents' opinion? What should I do in regards to going through with a sex change especially as a minor?

Edited clarification: I currently live north of Chicago, in the United States. Trump might be an issue. If at all possible I'd like to avoid being some sort of half-male half-female with only hormones and never getting surgery - and I'm not sure how I'd be able to do all of this, considering my current status as a minor."

TSLia,asktransgender,Disappointing day.,"So today I was supposed to have a telephone consult with my therapist and he was supposed to confirm that he had added my diagnosis of gender identity to my records as he had said he would do once he got some guidance.

I feel like he is refusing to provide care despite saying he agrees I have GID...my number was right in the system. So I call back after and find out he still didn't provide me with my diagnosis...sadly I can't afford to go anywhere else. I don't know how to handle this..."

Abysion,asktransgender,Is this normal?,"So my feelings of wanting to be a girl just completely went away for like a month, where i didn't think about it at all.

What do you guys suggest, like any advice."
flacdada,asktransgender,"Just came out, just scratching the surface, and am just now realizing just how patience is so crucial but wondering what mental health does for getting hormones.","Being transgender to me is defined a lot by patience.  Patience in getting to a better environment. Patience in coming out. Patience in getting HRT and letting it work its magic. Patience with top surgery or SRS or the like. Etc. It's all a laborious process.  

I just came out to my immediate family full force in Friday with the classic sitdown. I was confident straight forward and blunt. It went swell and they are happy for me and want only the best.  So yay.

Now of course I begin wanting to transition.  Tomorrow or Friday I'm going to bug my mother to help me make an appointment to my GP and try to see what I can do with them about a gender therapist or what have you.  

There is one thing hanging on my mind itching me out.  That is HRT.  And this is where patience comes in.  I want HRT so bad to help me along but I've realized it's a laborious process to acquire it perhaps. So I have to be patient.  For context, 20 MTF live in California.

I've always wondered if good mental health would play into me getting hormones quicker than usual.  The reason why I say this is because I feel like I very much do.  I have supportive family members.  I have a fantastic environment.  I feel happy about many things and feel like my life is very good.  I'm just a girl in the wrong body.  HRT is going to help me get there.

Id be curious as to hear other people's thoughts about this.  Do you think going into therapy sensations with a gender therapist with demonstrably good mental health improves ones chances of a quick letter?  

There is of course informed consent."

How noticeable was/is the scarring to the donor area, after the remaining beard was removed entirely (by either FUE or laser)? Are you able/willing to post before/after pics?

I am asking this for myself, because my hair has been ruined by DHT and genetics, and the hair replacement tech who recently examined my scalp has informed me that many of the follicles in the affected area are already beyond hope of being saved.

I have seen results of chest hair follicles being used, and I don't find the result satisfactory, primarily because they don't grow very long. I'd like to have long, thick, flowing hair again, but that will never be possible with chest hair on my head. I figure that I'm going to have all the beard hair removed anyway, so why not just move it somewhere else instead?"
tgpineapple,asktransgender,How do I escape a self-defeating rut?,"A year ago, I hated my life because I wasn't getting anywhere with HRT and it was so infuriating dealing with external factors that prevented me from getting what I want. Time passed and I eventually started and relieved that.

I realise that at the time, I didn't want to try and move towards a social transition because I was convinced that HRT would make the biggest difference and improve my confidence in trying to live as how I want to live. 

I no longer have that excuse. I'm 4.5 months in with (imo) very sparse changes and I still hate myself for it. A person with more motivation and steel than me could have easily put the time between then and now into practising their voice, makeup and gestures to pass. But I didn't. I didn't do anything because I convinced myself that I'm not ready to do anything.

I think it's self defeating behaviour. I don't want to try because I don't want to fail. I don't want to be harassed for being externally male and failing to be female. I live in a fairly coddled point. My friends tell me I'm feminine and that I look weird wearing guy clothes - but I don't believe them. My peers all accept me and I know for a fact that there is almost no risk to it - yet I'm still afraid. I deliberately read TERF/Alt-Right drivel just so I know that there are people who hate me for being who I am. In short - I want to be oppressed because I want to use it as an excuse to not try.

I have struggles with failing from being propped up my entire life, and I continually try my best in other areas of life just because the standard I put on myself and others impose on me is so high that I am afraid of failing. But when you're born as a mismatched being, you're already below the bar of failing. And if I tried and barely made it over the bar - then I've failed and thinking about that stresses me out. 

I don't know what I need to do. I practise my voice and get discouraged, afraid of asking other people how I sound. I dislike doing makeup - because I know I'm still at the wobbly hand stage and I don't want to be bad at it. I still dress like a guy because failing to be a girl in the eyes of others scares me. 

I'm forcing myself to change my name on Monday, so I can push myself out there and make progress. But as the days count down I get increasingly worried and scared. What are they going to say to me? What if they reject my application? What if they loudly harass me about it? 

I'm self-defeating, I hate failure and I'm afraid to try. I'm afraid of not being good enough. What do I do?

Tl;dr I'm scared of being me because I'm scared of failing and not being able to pass on the first go - even though being able to do that is an incredibly unrealistic ideal and impossible for almost everyone.

amon_erin,asktransgender,More disconnected on HRT?,"I'm going to be at three months of HRT on Tuesday, and my dysphoria has been terrible the past couple of weeks.

Throwaway_343432,asktransgender,How do you go about detransitioning? (UK),"What the title says really. There seem to be very few resources out there over how you're actually meant to go about doing this, so any experiences/general advice would be adored. 



Anyhow. The reason is the 'normal' one of being unable to pass. Started this at 18 and now 16 months later I'm utterly miserable. Hate mirrors. Hate leaving the house. Can't afford FFS. Life feels like constant torture. A whole host of reasons that mean living as a guy for the rest of my life looks like a far better prospect than an openly trans gal. I get it, being non-passing works for some people, but not for me. If anything, this whole process has made me considerably more dysphoric and self critical, so I've made my peace at having to deal with these issues for the rest of my life. I'd just rather not do so openly.



Back on track. I get that I should be able to stop taking E without any problems (?) once the decapeptyl injection wears off in two or so months, but my main concern is my chest. I have no doctor overseeing the treatment anymore because of how horribly disorganized and crowded everything is over here, so I have nobody directly to talk to. I attempted to broach my concerns to the GIC and was immediately discharged back to the GP, who is about as useful as a chocolate teapot. At a loss.



So will I have to register back with them and go through the waiting lists to, eventually, have top surgery? Or will I have to go private once the money is there?




I'm sorry I posted here; I know many people dislike this topic, but I'm not sure where else to ask. I did not use the UK trans subreddit due to the tiny community by the way.



I'd especially like to chat to anybody who has gone through this process, if by some miracle he/she still lurks here.

I loved fishing and hiking in the forest and climbing tress, I loved dragon ball z and hated the girly shows (with the exception of Magical girl anime/power puff girls) I loved transformers and hated barbies. None of this was pushed on by my parents, it was simply my prefence. 
I remember lookign down at myself and flicking my bean feeling like something was missing, something I should have but don't. 

""Mom, why couldn't I be a boy?""
""Dad, why am I a girl?""
""I wanna be a boy!"" 
More often than not I got a ""no you don't, you're a beautiful girl.""
I absolutely HATED my name growing up, and wanted to be called something else - usually boy names. (Daniel, Elliot, Gabriel, Sean are all among the names I took particular likings to.) 

I was bullied a lot in school, I was shy and awkward, the only time I felt I could be myself was at home in my room. 

But then came Runescape.

Yes, Runescape, this game was the first time I was able to really sit down and create and play my own character - the first time I could be and be seen as a boy - and it felt liberating! It might not seem like a big deal to some, but Runescape was my first real expirience with video games and I loved it. And for a 12 (or so) year old girl that was bullied and always felt 'real life' was the dream while her 'dreams' were reality ... it was amazing.

But as time went on, this started to fade - along with this world I had created where I would go on epic adventures as this famous and powerful knight who rode a one eyed black bear for a mount. 

After the age of 16, I just accepted myself, no more research about transitioning, no more wanting to be a boy motr than anything else in the world. The gender dysmorphia went away - I no longer felt uncomfortable in my own body, I no longer hated my name - maybe it was just... acceptance, an old dream that would never become reality because ""I didn't really want to be a boy."" 

I still have body issues, however, the most notable is thinking I'm ugly. 

Then i got diagnosed with PCOS, which is onset by having too many male hormones. BC is supposed to rise your female ones and balance it again. 

Its been just over a year and its been... something.

After 3-4 months, I had a lot of issues - crying at a drop of a hat, severe depression, I felt like a stranger to myself. I was a boy most my life ""boys don't cry."" why was I crying so much now?
It faded too, I felt normal again, as normal as I could anyway. 

But then in the last couple months I've just... felt odd. Like not myself, like a pretender? For the first time I've actually really grown my hair out, I'm starting to have more interest in makeup, in videogames I'm just as likely to play/make female characters as I am male. 
And for the first time since I was 16, the thoughts about transitioning are starting to come back - I'm in some ways starting to once again feel uncomfortable in my own body. 

i don't know thats going on or what to do?"

I don't look on my penis and cry, I did not cry when I first started growing chest, stomach and leg hair. I never hated it, I always just thought it was ugly.

I have however felt this empty void in me going as far back as I can remember. I don't know if that is something that I will always feel. Or if that void is my ""transgenderness."" 

I think I am beginning to accepting that I am trans. It is just that this voice in my head keeps doubting. 

How reversible are estrogen pills/shots? I have seen it described ""to a certain degree."" What about t-blockers? Would my body go back to natural if I used them for several months then stopped?

I am still awaiting my summons to a psychiatrist, as it is was only last week were I realized that if I don't do something about this. I might actually try and hurt myself rather than just it being constantly on my mind. 

I guess this was kinda more of a vent than questionnaire. Could I just be making excuses? Putting transitioning off or something. 

Sorry for grammar mistakes, am ESL. 

Edit:

Also wanna say that, in my country it usually takes up to a ~~year~~ half a year min to get hormones from the public health service. Which means I would have to import I think. Rest assured I would only go through with it after a consultation with my general practitioner. Hopefully he is understanding of this, otherwise I will have to find a new one. "

Teejsaurus,asktransgender,Looking for some advice or guidance about work... (wall of text sorry &gt;&lt;),"Xposting this on /r/ftm

This isn't really trans related at all, but these subs have been really helpful to myself and others with random life things, and with family issues. There's also a sub dedicated to the company I work for, but I've posted there before (with other user names, as I'm stealth so far at work) about my concerns, but no one ever replies to me on that sub, which kind of makes me even more concerned. 

I started a new job at the very end of October. It's my first real job ever (I've done things like baby sitting, pet sitting, working for free on student films, etc, but no restaurant or retail or customer service jobs before this one). I'm 26, so am an adult. I tried at college/uni for 8ish years to no avail because I'm just really terrible at school, and finally gave up on it for good. Even before that though, my parents were really distraught over me not having a job, and especially so after I told them I was giving up on school for good because they want me to be doing *something* productive whether it be school or work. I desperately need a job, and to be making at least a little money right now to help pay for top surgery in a few months early next year. 

Aside from an official on paper diagnosis I'm pretty much 100% sure I have dyscalculia and mild Asperger's (I've been told by doctors and therapists I fit the bill for both, but they never gave me any kind of official on paper diagnosis). I'm pretty sure the combination of those things is what's making my job so hard for me, compared to how it is for my coworkers. Even the girl who started a month before me, so is almost as new as me, is doing just fine. My coworkers and the customers are all really nice and great, but I'm the kind of person who's mind will spiral downward really really fast and easily if I find out I've let someone down in any way. The past week or so I have been making some mistakes. It's mostly because I've always been the kind of person who just does what they're told to do in that exact moment and not worry about what's happening next until I get to the next moment. So there will be times I ring people up a little bit wrong, or leave their food item in the oven for 2 seconds too long, but still do whatever I'm meant to do in that moment, like finish ringing them up, or hand them their food anyway. And then of course they come back a minute later like ""you did this wrong"" and my superiors seem to be getting really annoyed with me about these things happening. I'm going to ask if I can have maybe a few less hours soon so I can be able to find my groove at work without having to get tired out so much like I do now. I'm tired as fuckall after only a 5hr shift, and come home and pass out. And after working two or three days in a row I'll go in the next day and be zoned out, almost disassociating, as soon as I get there because I haven't had any time to recharge after being around people all day for 2-3 days in a row, and I think that's when I'm making the most mistakes. I think I'm going to try and explain this to my manager soon. I think she will understand and hopefully will be able to plan my future schedules accordingly. 

But I'm also thinking of quitting. If it was just my manager who would know I was quitting and would know why (that the job is just too overwhelming for the type of person I am) I think I would be ok with quitting after only just over a month. But I really love my coworkers there, and I basically don't want them to think I'm a big baby who can't handle this job that it seems to them to be so simple and easy to do. I also don't want to quit so soon because of my parents. One of the reasons I was so bad at school is because I kept changing my mind, and giving up on one thing to pursue another, then giving up on that thing for something else. I even dropped out of school a few times, then went back. To my parents, I have a reputation of quitting things early. When I first started this job, my mom literally begged me not to give up on it right away. I know I could explain everything I feel to my parents, and I'm sure my mom at least would understand (not so sure my dad would), but I know even then they would just say ""well just stick with it for a while still"". 

It's also having to wear a binder that makes me grumpy. Especially recently as my side has begun to ache a bit too much because of it, and because it's started giving me heartburn-like sensations. It's generally pretty easy for me to force a smile and be pleasant to coworkers and customers, but doing that when I feel grumpy takes even more energy from me than just being around people does on its own. I really think I will be a much happier person after top surgery, and that doing things like going to work, even if it drains my energy a bit too much, will be a lot easier. If/when I ask for fewer hours or ask for my days off to be after every 2 or 3 days of work, would it be a good idea to come out to my manager and explain about having to wear a binder and how it messes with my mood? 

I really don't want to have to come out at work, I'm really enjoying being stealth. Even when I asked my manager about taking off for surgery the other day she didn't ask what surgery it was or anything, and that made me feel really great that I didn't have to out myself when I wasn't prepared. But unfortunately this other thing has happened, pretty much due to my own laziness. I've changed my name and gender on everything except passport and with the SSA. I got one of those no match letters from my company and finally called them about it today. The guy said that until I change it with SSA I have to make sure my old name is what's in their (the company's) system, and he told me how to go do that on their employee site. I'm scared if I do that then on official things that other people will see like the schedules or time stamps when clocking in/out my old name will show up and my coworkers will come to the group chat like ""who's this person we never saw on the schedule before, was Teej replaced?"" and I'll have to be like ""err no that is me"". This whole thing is another reason why I'm thinking of quitting. I just don't want to deal with it :(. But I'm going to try to go to the SSA this week to change it there so I don't have to have my old name showing up on work stuff. 

I know a lot of people might say things like if quitting would make me feel better then I should do it because you gotta take care of yourself and your mental health first. But aside from that, what advice would anyone give?"

FavoriteColourGreen,asktransgender,Ftm afraid of not liking myself when I transition.,"Hi. I am pretty near to getting my diagnosis which will allow me to go on T and do a top surgery. But now that it's getting closer and more real it feels terrifying. Sometimes like now I have these really loud doubts about the whole thing. Like something I do not want to do rather something that I am forced to. I get intense feelings of just wanting to unmake everything and run away from it all. Some periods are harder than other. But in these were everything seems to suck I get devastated. I get angry at the circumstances , at what might have ""made me"" trans. ""Why did this have to happen to me?"" I think. And I feel like I am some kind of freak or something or that I am about to become one. And for what? Sometimes it's hard to tell if I am doing the right thing. I am afraid that I will no like my voice or that I will never be able to pass. Maybe I'll pass physically but then I am afraid of not passing with my character . That I am to soft to become a man. That it will be hard for me. And since I am so soft why force myself to become hard? I wish there was an easier way for me to be. Just be. But I don't think there is one. "
holdingbacktears,asktransgender,When is the right time to come out on Facebook?,"I know that there’s no real right time, but what does everyone think? I had originally planned on coming out on Facebook when I either passed or was at least closer to passing. I figured that people would have an easier time accepting me as a woman if I looked the part. Hormones can only do so much though. Realistically, I won’t ever pass with only hormones. I’ll need FFS which isn’t something I’ll be able to afford for years. While that sucks, that’s not the point. I’m pretty damn ready to start living as myself now even though I don’t pass. I can’t put off being a woman until I’m finally happy with my appearance because who knows when that will be or if it will ever happen. So what’s to keep me from coming out on Facebook? When is the right time? I’m hoping to start electrolysis and the legal process of transition this summer. Would that be a good time? Should I still try and give the hormones a bit more time before coming out? Is there anything you wish you had done first before you came out to the world?

[deleted],asktransgender,I went to my daughter's school play and it was not the theatergoing experience I might have hoped for...,"My daughter is fantastic. She knows I'm trans and is totally okay with me. But I've decided to not be out at her school because she's in 7th grade and I don't want her to have a hard time of it, so I go to her play today in guy mode.

I have no idea what this play is called, but it goes like this. The protagonists are these two down-on-their-luck actors. They've decided to run a con in which they pretend to be the long-lost relatives of a dying rich lady. But here's the twist: the long-lost relatives, they discover at the last moment, are actually WOMEN. 

""I am NOT wearing a dress!"" shouts one of the protagonist on stage, to much laughter from the middle-school audience.

Oh, but yes, he *is* going to wear the dress, because that is the whole point and so in the next scene, he flounces onstage in a flapper gown. The adolescent crowd explodes in laughter. Look at the boy in the dress! This is literally the joke of the play. Boys in dresses and how funny that is. 

Hilarity, as they say, ensues. When both boys are in dresses it is twice as funny.

Surrounded by this laughter, I look down at myself, at my blue nails and pink Converse. I'm already burning with sadness and frustration. *What if I had worn a dress to this play?* What would I do, how would I comport myself while all around me children are literally pointing and laughing at, let's face it, exactly what they would see *me* as?

When the doctor character makes a pass at the kid in the flapper gown and slaps his ass, the kids in the crowd absolutely lose their minds. That's a *man* in that dress, doc! Everyone knows you can't fall in love with a man who wears a dress!

The play ends with a Shakespearian tidiness of weddings, as soon as the women's clothes are shirked. Gender conformity is richly rewarded. Everyone goes home happy.

I walked out of the play fighting back tears, not just for myself, but for some trans kid that could have been sitting in the audience, wondering, ""If they're laughing at this, what will they think of *me*?"" It breaks my heart.

My daughter was great; she played the ditzy waitress who falls in love with the boy in the flapper dress and marries him once he takes it off. She is a happy little cisgender girl with a winning smile and great comic timing who has no idea that anything untoward has happened, and I don't have the heart to tell her, so I told you all instead.

TheMournhammer,asktransgender,Hair care tips and tricks? MTF,"So I've been growing my hair out for almost two years from a fade.

So here's the question. I have moderately oily skin and hair, so I can go 1 day max without shampooing it.  Should my routine be: 
Washing every other day, conditioning every time?
I use volumizing products because of the flatness and I've experimented with dry shampoos for styling and daily maintenance.

My hair isn't colored, and I want to be careful about losing hair health to strong products like sea salt spray and the like. 

So how do I get thicker texture, some artificial wave or curl, and keep it all healthy at the same time?
And on a budget! Omg.

My parents are coming to pick me up from college (our finals ended a few days ago but I wanted some alone time here to ""decompress""). When I go back home I'll lose the ability to express and deal with these feelings.

If it's affecting MY mental health adversely because my otherwise un-fixable features are causing my dysphoria to run rampant, it should not be questioned if it is medically necessary.

You could go through the whole process, get through their requisite time period of HRT, get letters from medical professionals deeming an ""associated surgery"" like FFS medically necessary, and *still* be denied coverage because some ""clinical board"" looked at you and decided, ""eh, not ugly enough,"" then be sent home with a pat on the back and told to cheer up.

eskanonen,asktransgender,I'm doing a 1 person study on progesterone. I've been on HRT and stable for ~3 years before this so any changes I notice should come from progesterone,"There is a lot of debate on whether progesterone actually does much, causes bad side effects, or is even worth taking. A lot of times people explain away changes people experience on it to the effects of estrogen or testosterone being blocked. I have been HRT at a consistent dosage/blood level for almost three years now and haven't experienced any changes since about 2 years in (excluding some muscle loss). I feel like this puts me in a ideal situation to see what effects, if any, progesterone actually has.

I intend to frequently (weekly) remeasure things (weight, chest/breasts, waist, hips), note any mental or emotional changes I notice, any changes in skin, any pain or discomfort, and take progress pictures that I may or may not post. Assuming it doesn't give me unbearable side effects causing me to stop, I will be doing this for at least six months. I will post a couple updates throughout the time I am doing this. I will be taking 10mg medroxyprogesterone (not micronized and not really concerned about it) daily (before bed) and will not be cycling. I've heard age and body type might play a big factor in what effects people experience from it, so for reference, I am 24 and as of today, 131 lbs, 5'10.

***Obviously this will just be one person's experience and no one should base their decision on whether or not to take progesterone off what I find alone. Talk to your doctor!***

PM_ME_UR_CC_INFO,asktransgender,A relatively small question as a gym employee,"I work for my university's gym on the fitness floor. I'm trained to respond to emergency situations, but my day to day responsibilities are doing rounds, cleaning, and taking a census.

On this census I'm supposed to count the number of people in one area of the fitness floor. E.g.: The number of people using the stretch mats, the number of people using free weights, treadmills, bikes, ellipticals, etc.

However, we are supposed to mark men and women separately. So there's 4 women using free weights and 1 man, etc.

I'm cis but this makes me uncomfortable as an ally who would prefer to normalize the gender spectrum. The data from the hourly census isn't public knowledge to gym goers, but they could see me tallying on my census dry erase board every hour if they paid attention.

Our gym is inclusive in other ways, like having men's, women's , and gender neutral areas for changing and using the restroom.

That scares and sickens the shit out of me. I'm starting to feel like if I'm not a guy I'm not safe. Not happy as a guy but safe. Happy as a women but not safe. 

I can't see myself as an elderly lady. But at the same time I can't imagine myself prior to 60 as anything other than a woman. Currently I don't know what the hell I am.

The parts of a male lifestyle that appeal to me is being able to be an angry muscle bound shit starter that takes what he wants and lays waste to any opposition. Career seems a lot easier. I'd atleast have money. I can protect my wife. I can protect my family. 

A female lifestyle I can imagine being happy but I feel like that happiness is wrong. Like I shouldn't want this. Like this shouldn't make me happy. I shouldn't be happy. I'm wrong. I'm sick. I see others going down this route and encourage and support them. If I do it I'm the fucking devil. I feel too weak to protect anything important to me. I feel like I can't protect my wife or family. That makes me feel worthless.


I don't know what to do. I can't reach my therapist, and I don't know if she genuinely cares or just wants a steady check out of me. If I'm not broken I don't need her. I don't know I don't know.

I don't know what the point of this post is. Sorry."
Zazh95,asktransgender,Stealth is going down but maybe I'll be better off,"I'm a student going to university and I started my first year going stealth. I think I can pass very well, like 90%, but I also think that when people are around me for a certain time they can tell. Anyway I noticed that it's quite stressful being stealth, especially when you are just one year on HRT and you have to ultimate facial hair removal, SRS, legal name change, ecc...
So I'm thinking about the best way to tell my friends. Any ideas?"
stygianZinogre_,asktransgender,Not the usual kind of doubts?,"I'm not having any regrets about HRT or anything else. I just had a consultation for top surgery, just waiting on confirmation from insurance but it sounds like this will be happening in my future way sooner than I ever thought was possible, and I'm unbelievably excited. I feel like I'm about as certain as it's possible to be of what I want in the future, and that this is right for me.

But I still sometimes get these weird thoughts like... ""I can't possibly be transgender. There's only a 1% (or whatever extremely small number) chance of it happening, and things that have a 1% chance happen to *other* people, it couldn't have possibly happened to me. I'm only fooling myself into believing I'm trans because I want to be a guy so much (lol, what the fuck, brain)."" Or, even weirder, ""I don't feel like I'm transgender, I just feel like an ordinary guy."" Even though, y'know, being trans and being ""an ordinary guy"" **aren't mutually exclusive**, AND ""an ordinary guy who happens to have been born with some incorrect body parts and organs"" is basically the definition of being a trans man.

It's like I know that I fit the definition of trans, I'm transitioning and I'm happier than I've ever been because of it, but somehow sometimes still can't wrap my mind around it or accept that it's the case, because it's an uncommon occurrence, or something. I don't even know what the hell this is. How do I stop my mind from thinking irrational things?"

space_less,asktransgender,Too Late to Trans?,"I grew up in what I would have called a liberal family. We voted fiscal conservative but did habitat for humanity. Shopped at the ghetto market and department stores but attended private school. There was the occasional slur and vaguely racist joke, one or two “damn immigrants” comments, but outwardly progressive and normative. No dogmatic rules about race or pseudo-psycho political coercion. Just that common, famous old adage of the shame filled the white man; they come from a different time. But, the Heteronormativity of the third generation American urban family in the 1990′s cannot be understated. Even in my entirely blue state gay and lesbian was not out in everyone’s face and accepted until what felt like the late 1990′s or early 2000′s. Forget about trans. Even in a state with a rich, mostly celebratory transgender history. It just was not openly discussed, understood or celebrated socially at least in my bubble until adulthood.

As I came of age my mother started to say things like “If you were gay I would have no problem with it.” I never believed her though. How could I. We had no gay friends, no gay uncle or aunt. No gay neighbor, no gay friend at the bank. Nothing. In fact, no one in either of my family’s histories had even been gay. Or at least, hadn’t been out. I asked my role model cousin if it was ok to be gay once and he told me all gay people go to hell. My dad had a noted out burst one time about Will &amp; Grace and how he was “tired of that” being talked about in the open. I went to a catholic school with no gay students. I went to a church with no gay members. Attended clubs and leagues, camps and classes with no gay anyone, youth or otherwise. Well, there was one gay youth at my church. He was looked at differently by everyone else and I was his friend, for a while actually. 

How should I believe that, if I we’re gay and I wanted to be out that that would be ok. There were no gay people in our bubble, how would I know how they would be treated. I didn’t even know a gay or lesbian adult, This was the reinforcement I was receiving from my core family unit on what their view of homosexuality was. Now, imagine I come in and say that I’m Trans and I want to change my physical gender to that of a female because that is how I feel inside. Forgot trying to explain the desire to want to be with a man post transition as normal. Forget me even understanding or internalizing what I was feeling with some kind of identifiable label. Some kind of identifiable, tangible life path. Some sense that I was not the only one like this, that the things I was feeling were OK. 

From my current perspective, I can now see how obvious things were. I can now also see, how my acceptable, self-prescribed liberal family, was not.

My childhood is some what cookie cutter somewhat out of left field; infantile/ regressive-ish incidents– Erotic Target Location Error’s (autogynephilia/plushophillia)–same sex sexual experimentation (as early as 5 years old)–crossdressing (as early as 6 years old)--disassociation 

I started getting depressed around this time, doing poorly in school. I had interventions with the teacher and staff. My mom was on the lookout for things when I was a kid (tests for ADD/ADHD I was diagnosed dyslexic,) but I never got caught doing anything sexually orientated, so there were never any conversations about it. I was never sexually abused as a child at least I don’t ever remember anything even verging on inappropriate. I started getting bullied at school after my friend, whom I sexually experimented with moved away (which, turns out, may have been more intentionally related than randomly occurring as I had assumed.) I liked the color pink, used a pacifier until I was 3 or 4 and loved The Little Mermaid. I was on sports teams but didn’t care about them, I was more into dance and drama. I was kind and generous not tough and aggressive. I liked Si-Fi and fantasy, poetry and art. When I was 7 I got asked to join the crips, I said I couldn’t because I wanted to play with my action figures that night. As time went on and no one brought it up, I grew more and more normalized, thinking all of this was a part of everyones experience growing up. I also began to normalize other things I was doing as well. 

By the time I was 18 I could go into all kind of stores, buy things and access pretty much anything online. I used to dress up and play with what I could use or find, now I could have anything I had the guts to walk into a store to buy. Hidden expertly all throughout my home. I had relationships with women, too. Starting at the end of 8th grade I dated 4-5 women exclusively through high school hooking up with several others in between. They were healthy, open, caring, mutually beneficial relationships. Sometimes when I was alone, I would still play. Not because it made me feel better or I didn’t get my needs met. Just when I felt like it. Assuming everyone had their own little secret thing. No one ever found anything. No one ever confronted me about it. No one ever talked to me, questioned me or asked me anything about my sexuality. No one ever even asked me if I have had thoughts like this. No evidence, no crime. 

I was in such as haze, the world was like a vortex; all these swirling pressures and feelings, decisions I had to make, classifications I had to fit. I numbed myself almost the whole way through high school with alcohol and drugs, culminating in my senior year waste land. I became so disassociated, I had no money for college or real help from guidance so I just enrolled in the local junior college and got shuffled along. I was always waiting for someone to come and show me this world, give me the intro, but they never came. Fitting, I assume as a caveat to essentially the next decade of repression, dedication, abandonment, blown expectations, lowered expectations and finally disconnection that was my early and mid twenties. 

Now here I am. 30 years old, one year into coming to terms with the fact that I am not cis/straight and living with that. Allowing myself to feel comfortable asking for my needs to be met by my insanely supportive partner, figuring out my definition of my femininity, allowing myself to be attracted to people and things I would have normally dismissed. Finally accepting myself for all that I am and not just calling myself like everyone else.

But, this is in no way easy. I was found out, when I foolishly left a rather sexually explicit tumblr page open. My own sexually explicit tumblr page that I had made and filled in with some rather suggestive dialogue and narration, not to mention videos and GIFs. Nonetheless, embarrassed I went on to have a very candid conversation about my history, my desires and my misplaced, non-discript fantasy-lust that encapsulated her find. I was honest and forward, more than I had even been with any person on the subject up to that point and thankfully she had a positive reaction to the whole explained mess (3 probably, full days later.) She suggested that I go talk to someone about it. Instead of taking a phycological approach I talked to a social worker. 

She didn’t want to diagnose me with GID or GDD, she just wanted me to acknowledge things and talk about them. She had me looking at my new discovery not as a issue to be treated with a regiment of drugs and therapies, but as an investigation. How do I feel. What do I want. Do I need anything I’m not getting. I decided (after about 6 months) I like myself and where I’m at. I didn’t want to physically transition. I wanted to lose some weight, try and tone my body, maybe look into some hair removal options, but no HRT. Full disclosure; if I have had the type of access and climate people have today when I was 12 or 13 (or hell even up to like 22) I would transition. No bottom surgery, but everything else FFS, HRT, top-surgery full legal transition. 

But the fact is, for me any way, I’m happy with my life and the person I am. For better or worse, I have been this person my whole life. I don’t think I will be happier starting all over again. It has nothing to do with avoiding all the work and upheaval that comes with it. He said, a white visibly cis-male hetro-normo, in a committed, monogamous relationship, adorned with an outwardly privileged life. But honestly, I love my life and myself. I want my life on it’s continued path and all the things my partner and I want for ourselves therein. 

It is kind of tough to see the “glory”-ish days we’re living in now. Don’t get me wrong, it is still super difficult to be trans today, especially a trans POC or trans-muslim or any other marginalized group whom also happen to be trans. But, it is a much more temperate place than it was in the 80′s or 90′s. Kids worldwide are growing up in a place of transgender and LGBQ visibility and revolution. Kids budding on puberty can grow up in the bodies they want instead of the bodies they are given. They can be judges, state representatives, actors, famous athletes. Trans people can be as successful and happy as any other hetro person.    

My discoveries have led me to many revelations. One of them was, if I wanted to be a trans-woman authentically, I would have been pushed much harder at some point in my life to pursue transition or even male intimacy. One of the other things I learned was my experience though rare, is not as uncommon as I once had assumed. Acknowledging my truth led me to understand many thing I would not have in the past. Things that would have destroyed my life had they built up and eventually exploded. There are thousands of men like me all over the world. It is so important that we really actually, authentically value the LGBTQ experience and allow everyone, no matter who or where they come from or what they believe. That 5 or 6 year old kid who’s getting to talk with someone about the way he’s thinking and what he’s feeling inside could be the catalyst that makes that boy into the girl he actually wants to be. 

Still, after all the realizations and self-care/discovery I am left feeling disenchanted. I put through an effort to admit to myself and really allow my true self to be known, and it left me feeling space-less. I can’t really call myself trans if I don’t make any changes and keep cis-presenting, can I? I can’t just wear the pink and blue and white and not constantly engage in hour long info sessions to defend why I look and act the way that I do and get to wear it. I’m obviously not a straight cis-male but damned if that’s not fully, concretely assumed and repudiated by every single person in my life, other than my partner. So would new hair, HRT and a pronoun change make me a happier more well adjusted person?  

There was this article that echoed some of my experience and feelings pretty hard it was called “I am a Transwoman. I am in the closet. I am not coming out.”  It talks a lot about having your budding femininity stepped on by a variety of forces. It talks about feeling like you need to present trans and bash cis-men to be accepted. It’s about someone who would have transitioned given they had access and support, but they didn’t. So instead of transitioning to serve the societal norm or further complicate their understanding of an adults relationship with their own identity and gender, they decided to bury themselves in the baggage that is this unresolved issue, and push themselves into their work. Is that me too? Is that what I should do too?

I’m engaged to a women. I look like a lumberjack. If i start calling myself trans it wont fix anything. It won’t make me feel fulfilled. It won’t give me a girlhood. It won’t give me wonderful, accepting supportive parents, for my girlhood. It won’t give me the chance. That damage is done and nothing can go back to stop it from landing. Call me shallow or spiteful, but I was honest with myself, I admitted my real feelings, I had a revolution dammit. I got delt a garbage hand by life and I suffered for years with no name for my crippling, shapeshifting pain. I want more than a renewed sense of value in what my impact can be. Maybe that’s a poor attitude to have. I can’t even be part time female. Show up to work and answer the same questions about my shaved beard and arms 75 times? Explain to everyone in my life why sometimes I go out or perform dressed as a woman, then live most other days as a man married to a woman? Is it worth it? To live some momentary sliver of time authentically, always scanning the room for face I know, only to spend hours explaining the detailed inner workings of your personal gender and sexuality to your social and work groups. Fuck. No. 

I’m real late to the party, with excuses in tow and it turns out that I might not even be on the guest list. The best case scenario is sexual experimentation within my relationship; which ok that’s cool and everything but, where’s my feminine experience? My time with make-up and clothes and hair and style, where is my time spent pondering my look? Where is finding my feminine voice, feminine confidants, wheres my authentic definition of personal femininity? Where is the part I dreamed of. Where I can walk around in a pretty dress and feel the swelling of pride and satisfaction right in my fluttering heart that only comes with identifying your hand-made, true grit femininity, and reveling in it?

PS: I am seeking advice or direction. Are there others out there struggling with the same things? I'm kind of at a loss and not sure where to go from here. Thank you all. "
genericseltzer,asktransgender,(mtf) Body hair and hormones,"So I know that hormones affect everyone differently, but I was wondering if folks could share their experiences with feminizing hormones and body hair. I have medium-thick chest/belly hair and back hair. I shave almost every other day so that it doesn't bug me. The good news is, I recently started hormones and I'm excited that they will mitigate the need to shave as often. But I'm wondering if I should make an appointment to for laser now, rather than waiting till later when the hair is thinner and lighter. How effective have hormones been for you in stopping body hair growth? Have you gotten laser treatments for your body hair? What are your thoughts? Thanks!"
lrki,asktransgender,"MTF. Buying shoes, online? In a store? Where?","So, I have no clue how to put this and given all the other issues posted here this sounds probably stupid.

I'm MTF, but still pretty much at the start, need to put together an outfit to be able to walk around as female. (Therapists here in Germany seem to want you to do that for half a year here before HRT)

So far so good. Now I hate buying shoes online since I'm never sure how well they'll actually fit and sending stuff back would be quite annoying to arrange. I'm also not made of money and many shoes are quite expensive as far as I see.

So I thought maybe I should just jump over my shadow, go out, and buy shoes at an actual store. That way I'll know they fit and I don't waste money. But then the questions:

* Are shoe stores in somewhat bigger cities normally fine with trans customers?
* If not, how do I find one that is fine with it?
* What would I expect, aside confusion on the side of the clerk?
* (Bonus question!) Sadly I'm not the smallest build and seem to be on the upper end for the normal sizes of women shoes (or slightly out of range, depending on which sizes a shop has), do stores usually have bigger sizes available or should I look for specific ""plus-size"" stores?

Other feedback and/or tips are welcome. Thanks!"

bluerose3692,asktransgender,Letter acquired - next steps?,"Hey all! So after a couple bumps (annoying but necessary) I've finally got my letter from a therapist.

I just don't entirely know how to go about scheduling what's next. I already have the initial blood tests done at a previous doctor visit for ""gender dysphoria"". I was referred to my city's children's hospital because they have a wonderful LGBT space set up for the trans community. However, the age cut off is 25 (which I turn March 6th). So they sent me to the therapist and scheduled something the last week of January for me to come back and start medicating. 

However, I ended up getting the letter after the first visit (turns out I really like her and ended up scheduling more once the transition starts socially). So now I have a list of MD's, Endo's, and OBGYN's recommended from both her and the Children's Hospital to call.

Problem is... I don't know who to go to. I don't have a primary care doctor currently (never had a reason to go), so I need someone to basically oversee and help with my transition. Can that just be an MD/primary care? Should I just start at an endo and only need them? When does OBGYN really come in to play? 



I've spent about 4 years researching and planning DIY so much that I didn't anticipate getting it legit first. "

I really like the changes, better than vitamins :).

violaceous_trogon,asktransgender,This is gonna be my last post. I'm beginning to think being trans is just another delusion and honestly that is probably what's gonna make me kill myself.,"Since I doubt people want to read my shitty story I'll just put the TL;DR at the beginning. **I am currently extremely delusional about several aspects of my life. I am starting to wonder if thinking I'm trans is just another delusion that I can't break out of. Where can I get help? What on earth do I do now?**

I've been very very very unstable for the past two months or so. I've been the closest I've ever come to ending my life, and I think the only thing stopping me from doing it right now is that I am physically unable to leave my parents' home to do it in the method i've decided on. 

I managed to snag a 0.5 GPA last semester in college. F's in three classes, a C in the only class I managed to salvage. I'm not going to do any better next semester unless a god damn miracle happens in the next two weeks and I suddenly stop wanting to die and start wanting to be successful. If I get below a 2.0 next semester i'll flunk out of school, if I flunk out of school I'll lose my job and my apartment, and being trans with very few marketable skills I probably won't be able to support myself without a degree.

I'm like six months into HRT and i've been out for nearly a year. I can ""pass"" with minimal effort. I know I am incredibly lucky that (though I'm not sexy or cute or beautiful or attractive) other people see me as a woman. But deep down I know that I am the man I was born as and I will always be him.

The only person I have managed to maintain contact with is my Big (i'm in a sorority), and even though ze swears up and down that ze loves me unconditionally and trusts me and values me I am incapable of believing that. It's a delusion. I know it's a delusion. But I can't break out of it.  My ex-best-friend is a self-centered controlling borderline narcissist, with a dangerously mentally ill boyfriend who likes me a lot more than I like him. I've met an amazing and witty and smart and awesome girl on this subreddit who I really care about but I for some reason can't bring myself to talk to her anymore even though I really want to (if you're reading this i'm sorry). The other friends I have in real life I have slowly drifted away from. 

I am definitely delusional. 

I logically know that I am loved, but I think the world hates me and is just putting up with me because they're forced to. And I can't stop it.

I logically know that I have a good life, but I think that everything sucks and I'm depressed and I can't stop it.

Everyone I have met in the last four years has told me I'm a kind, funny, smart, altruistic, all-around good person. But deep inside I know I'm a sociopath who will eventually end up destroying everything.

I have so many delusions and even though I haven't doubted my womanhood in two years I'm beginning to think that I'm delusional about that too. I have a boy's parts, in my past there were minimal signs that I might've been trans, I just...what if I'm wrong and I'm deluding myself into believing I'm a person I'm not? What if I snap out of it and see what i've done to my body and just decide to kill myself? What if I never snap out of it and am forced to live with the constant suspicion that i'm just tricking myself?

I'm fucked up. I know. I don't even know why I asked this. I don't even know if I'll come back to my account ever again. Maybe I'll die but i'm honestly probably too much of a pussy to even kill myself so I'm sorry for the misleading title. Maybe I'll just start walking along the highway and never stop until I hit the sea. I'll probably be hospitalized for my instability soon.

I wish someone could do something"
tgthrowawayayayay,asktransgender,[MtF] Can you be on HRT for a LONG time and pass as a guy?,"Hey there r/asktransgender,

20 year old here. I've been recently coming to terms with the fact that the feelings I've had since I was a toddler are never going to go away, so I'm seriously considering transition.

I can't tolerate myself being a guy during sex, and I hate my muscles, beard, and pretty much every other male feature. I undoubtedly want these to go away and have feminine secondary sex characteristics.

Yet, I don't want to socially transition. I might pass, I'm 6'2"" and very feminine (and I know that shrinkage isn't too uncommon), but I like the social aspects of being a guy. 

I don't fear social backlash. I just fear that I won't be a guy anymore... which I've kind of grown used to. 

I'm a very feminine person, but I have grown so used to being a guy that I won't mind keeping this weird sense of brotherhood. 

Please don't flame me! Call me gender non-conforming or whatever you want - I'm just curious if life this way is possible. Obviously, I haven't made my mind up yet.

If I laser off my beard, go through with HRT and grow my hair, can I still pass as a guy outside? Obviously, boob growth will be an issue, but I don't mind wearing baggy/heavy clothes. 

I also get that I might not WANT to keep being a guy if I'm on hormones. I can decide that later, though. 

I appreciate any comment. You guys are freaking awesome. Thanks!"
Fim0458,asktransgender,So I Presented as Female Overtly in Public for the First Time Last Week.,"This isn't really a question so much, but I really enjoy this community 99% of the time so I figured I wanted to share, from the 9th to the 16th I was in the Netherlands on holiday staying with a friend in a small town between Utrecht and Amsterdam, it was a great trip, Utrecht has amazing history and Amsterdam has a super relaxed atmosphere.

On the 13th me and my friend went to an Against Me concert at the Melkweg, for like a week beforehand I was planning to wear this sweet as heck dress I got a week beforehand, shaved everything, had my eyebrows plucked, got matching nail polish, did the whole thing, but when it got to the actual day of the event I nearly decided against it, I'm so glad I didn't.

I spent whole trip there and the first half an hour before the event shaking from nerves, I wasn't afraid so much as just in disbelief I was actually doing it, that all went away after a couple of punts of beer and when the opening act came out (Mobina Galore, by the way, they absolutely killed it), went to buy their album, got complimented on my dress, came back just in time for the second band, who were quite frankly shite, they walked on stage, played 2 songs, left, put no passion into it, then Against Me! were on stage and I just imploded with joy, got really into it, my friend went off stage diving, I stayed at the back singing along and headbanging, my neck hurt for like 4 days, was fun. 

On the way out I got complimented on my dress again then managed to get into a conversation with 2 groups of people while waiting for a lift home, I was thoroughly sloshed at this point so I don't remember much about it, but I remember the people I was talking to were super nice, everyone was really accepting, and then we went to burger king, which they don't have on the island where I'm from so at the time it felt like exotic quinine, even moreso because I got chicken wings at burger king. 

I don't know why I even felt like sharing this because even though i was so overwhelmed with happy emotions writing it down it feels super mundane and shit, what was your guis first experience presenting as female? anything good? bad? feel free to discuss it if you like! or don't.. so yeah if you're still reading, thanks, lol!

Unfortunately i can't go and see a gender therapist due to lack of money :/

Now the reasons I think I'm not transgender are because I think I might have OCD. I think I might have OCD because i obsess over things every few days. For example, I used to obsess over God. Like I would obsess over whether i was a Christian or an atheist. Every few days I would be going on Christian subreddits asking a ton of questions off of throwaway accounts, but luckily this has stopped and I now know God exists and I am a Christian! Another obsession is I used to obsess over if I found women attractive (this has stopped!) even though I didn't. It got so bad that if I looked at a woman's chest I would think ""am I attracted to her"". Then there is the longest one. The transgender one. How do I know if this transgender thing isn't just OCD or that by me living as a woman I'm not just contributing to the doubt?

See I was never uncomfortable as a guy. Ever! I was always very feminine, I have always been attracted to men, most of my friends in my life have always been females (I don't know whether this was because I am transgender or because I used to get bullied in school for being gay and the guys in school just kept away from me, which they did).

I'm fear two things happening in the future and there both regret! The first one is starting HRT, then literally just regretting it, then having to find out all over again and explain to everyone why I am no longer going to transition and live as a woman. And the second one is, not transitioning, then later on finding out that I really am and actually always have been a transgender woman! These are the two things that scare me the most. I'm scared of getting irreversible surgery and getting irreversible HRT effects then regretting it all!

See, the thing is, I don't know if I had not started living as a woman if I ever would have started in the first place. I don't know! I think if this as being a very bad sign. It is isn't it? Don't you think so? See, when I first started wearing women's clothes I looked so feminine and attractive that I got so much attention which I absolutely loved! I never got a single bit of attention before living as a woman because I was so feminine I was just perceived as a very feminine gay man, which I actually was!

No matter who I talk to, no matter who tells me I am transgender, no matter who tells me I sound transgender, etc, I just can't accept it. I just can't. It's been like this for ages. Sure, some of the doubts have gone away, like the one wear I used to believe that if I didn't hate my penis (since I masturbate with it, etc) then I can't really be transgender woman. But regardless of those doubts disappearing, the other ones remain! I can't get them to go away.

I do seem to do something though I'm not sure if a cisgender man with do. That being that when music videos with women in for example come on, I pretend I'm the woman and I pretend the guy is there with me. I know, this sounds stupid! I also imagine myself being a beautiful woman, walking down the street with everyone's eyes on me! It's things like these two things that make me think that this is all OCD, in my head, maybe somehow I've tricked myself into thinking I'm a transgender woman, etc. Don't you think those two examples sound a little bit attention seeking?

I do think I have OCD as I've certainly don't things that are OCD!


Do I sound like I'm OCD, or a transgender woman or just a confused gay cisgender man that I was comfortable with?"
YeahIGotAFace,asktransgender,A question regarding internal monologue.,"I was just wondering how you used to refer to yourself internally before any transitioning took place. As in, I a cis-male will often think to myself, ""Damn dude, nice play"" or, ""I'm just that kind of guy"" or some such sentence. I guess I'm asking if you were born with male parts were there times before your transition that you found yourself thinking things like, ""Damn lady, nice play"" or, ""I'm just that kinda gal.""? Similarly if you were born with female parts would you refer to yourself as ""dude"" or anything like that before your transition?

xDreamsleep,asktransgender,Something spectacular has happened and FtM advice is being requested.,"Alright so something uncommon has occurred recently but I know it does happen. I came out to my parents a few months ago that Im trans (MtF). We were going to wait until the holidays to tell the younger family members that there will be changes in the future. Well without even knowing about me my niece comes out and tells everyone that he is now a nephew. He is 14 years old and is very sure of himself on this. Its already kind of crazy there are two trans people in my family now but the timing of both of us coming out is what blows my mind.

Essentially I can give a lot of advice already from my experiences, knowledge and limited wisdom. The thing is it seems there's a lot less info out there about transmen than transwomen. I want to be there for my Nephew because I know the struggle. 

I know on paper transitioning is the same regardless of where you start and end your journey. In reality there's those bumps in the road you don't know about until you hit them. I guess what Im asking is what are some of the bumps our gentlemen here have experienced and what differences are there in transitioning other than the obvious?

no_way_noe,asktransgender,is writing a trans-coded villain problematic?,"hi yes hello! sorry in advance if this is scatterbrained, i'm a nonbinary trans lady but this is outside of my experience. also i might get some things wrong since i'm not well-versed in The Discourse -- please correct me if i mess up!

so i'm writing a screenplay which'd be best described as a short spy thriller/war drama with elements of urban fantasy. the protagonist -- a mix of a spy, a hitman, and a lieutenant -- is implied to be either a trans man or transmasculine -- like with how the subtitles linger a few frames on the ""they"" pronoun when another character refers to him, the patches (which could be construed as nicotine patches instead of testosterone but they're there), the way he reacts to female-coded words aimed at him, his physique in some ways. things like that, relatively minor but built up.

what concerns me is that he's a villain protagonist, and an often-unsympathetic one. 

so, you know, on one hand i have a penchant for villains and i'd love to write a compelling trans villain protagonist. him being trans would tie in fantastically with many of his traits and i don't think i can see him any other way in my head regardless of how i end up writing him.

however, despite that -- i'm not sure if i'd be putting writing a character i find interesting over writing ethically, writing in a way that won't potentially damage the perception of a marginalized group, particularly when there's not much *positive* representation of us to begin with. because he is, as i said, often unsympathetic, and although his gender identity is as separate from his status as a villain as, say, the fact he likes playing Snake on his phone to kill time, it's still a part of him and he *is*, unmistakably, a villain.

so i guess, getting back to The Actual Point, this is what i'd want to ask:

- are trans villains inherently problematic? 

- if not, how could a trans villain be done well? what would you like to see in one? 

i ask this because i genuinely don't know how something like that would be received. as i've said, i personally don't find it difficult to like villains and i'd like the character either way, and i'd probably be really pleased if i came across a character like him who was canonly trans, but i recognize i don't have the same experiences as trans men and transmasculine-identifying people do. i would much rather write another cis protag than inadvertantly write a very problematic trans protag. since it's fairly recent that i've toyed with the idea of him being trans, i also wouldn't be bruised about losing the trait entirely -- which helps!

i understand i've probably been too vague -- this kind of stuff has always been somewhat difficult for me to write, haha -- so feel free to ask questions if you're not sure what i'm getting at! i completely understand and i'd be happy to clarify. 

and please, be as blunt or direct as you want. if you don't like this concept one bit then i'd like you to feel comfortable saying so.

cheers!"

bartletsthepresident,asktransgender,Social anxiety and same name fears?,"x-post r/ftm

I’m planning to come out fairly soon if all goes well and trying to pick a name before I do. The hardest thing for me is my nervousness around choosing the same name as a guy I interact with in daily life. As a person with social anxiety, one of my worst fears is simple awkwardness and it feels like picking the same name as someone I’ve been talking to for four or five years (not even regularly) would be pretty awkward. This doesn’t seem to be the concern of many I’ve seen on Reddit, but I thought I’d bring it up anyway to see if anyone can relate / offer advice.

Reon98,asktransgender,What is the difference between genders?,"I bumped this question over to r/nonbinary last week and someone said this is a pretty common question from terfs so let me preface that I am nothing of the sort. For context, I'm questioning my gender and I've been seeing a therapist. Now, the therapist has instructed me to log day by day on a scale of my choosing how I feel gender wise. The problem I have then run into is this. I have clear male and female swings. They're definitely there and I don't doubt that. However, I couldn't tell you what that means. I have no idea what makes me feel one way or another. Extrapolating this line of thought got me wondering about what actually makes the difference between genders. Obviously it's not about genitalia. Interests makes no sense. I'm just curious, how do y'all answer this question?"

Shockingpink13,asktransgender,"I'm so disappointed. My friend: ""I wouldn't feel comfortable if you went with the dress.""","Pre hormones 


I have a friend who, for the most part, has been extremely supportive.  In fact, I have told many of my friends that I am trans, and he is one of the very few who has not left me. 


Earlier this week, I made an arrangement to meet him at Chick Fila, and I told him that I would be wearing a dress.  At the time, he was completely okay with that.  He told me how it was no big deal, and how he didn't care about what I wore.


Fast forward to last night, and he sends me a text saying that me wearing a dress would make him uncomfortable.  I tried to stay cool, so I calmly (I hope) asked him why it would make him uncomfortable.  He said, ""Ok.  Remember how I said that my views are different from yours but I still love you without thinking differently of you.  We have been very respectful of each other's opinions so hopefully that can continue.""


I feel awful.  I was in tears last night.  I tried telling him how humiliating it is to present as male, but he didn't change his mind.  I feel like I can't be real with anyone without them leaving me or hurting me as much as my friend has just hurt me.  "
transteenaway,asktransgender,I need a list of ways that gender dysphoria is different than anorexia for my mom. Any more points?,"I have two already.

1. There is scientific literature about transition and HRT that says it works.  There is no such literature about ""giving anorexics weight loss pills"", as the old chestnut goes.

2.  People with gender dysphoria are fully aware of what their bodies look like.  They look at a male body and see a male body, or look at a female body or see a female body.  Anorexics, on the other hand, are defined by seeing their body as unrealistically large, so they are not aware of what they look like.

Wanderer-on-the-Edge,asktransgender,Do you feel weird about compliments?,"I've been on HRT for a little over 23 months now and finally went full time about a month ago.  Before HRT I was grossly overweight and hated my appearance in every way.  Nowadays, I'm still grossly overweight (although not nearly as much) and actually like the way I'm starting to look.  I only recently realized (about a month ago, when I went full time) that I was passing as long as I didn't open my mouth.  It took a ton of my friends basically hitting me over the head with it, but I accept it now.  And now that I've accepted it, I'm getting compliments.  People have called me beautiful or adorable or cute.  And these are individuals who aren't lying, they genuinely believe this.  And it feels wonderful, but also very strange.  A lifetime of wanting to be cute, but knowing that I never could be... that attitude is hard to relinquish.  Has anybody else had similar experiences?"

I didn't know what transition exactly entailed back then.  There are a few other things I'm starting to remember.  I don't doubt that I'm trans but I see many here questioning.  I could be wrong but I think sub-consciously our brains try to work things out and sometimes when sub-conscious thoughts are translated to conscious thought they are sometimes misinterpreted.  Maybe because it can only translate it based on things you already know, so in my case I briefly heard of sex-changes but never heard of dysphoria because the shows that talked about sex-changes I saw didn't go into the details of how and why.

Have any of you experienced similar thoughts but did not exactly connect it together that your true gender identity is different from what you were assigned at birth?

Solovan,asktransgender,"I think I might not be transgender. I think I might just be your average, feminine gay guy. (Wall of Text)","Sortathrowawayaccount. I've posted before, but I wouldn't say I'm known. Not that that matters. Either way, I've spent a lot of time on this subreddit and I'd like to thank all of you for the support during my questioning period. You're a great bunch. Anyway, huge wall of text incoming. Just sort of writing while I think. I'm not even sure about it yet. But for some reason every time I come to this conclusion after a heavy jolt of dysmorphia and doubt, this is what calms me down again and gets me out of the seemingly endless pit of depression (for a little while). I'd love to hear people's thoughts. Does it sound like im lying to myself? Do you think my dysmorphia will keep intensifying, even as I reach my ideals? 

Anyway, I think I've come to the conclusion these last few weeks I'm not transgender. Or at least not transgender enough to warrant a transition to become female. That last bit probably sounds weird to most people. I feel like I should share my thoughts. Not posting to dissuade others or anything, but to share the perspective of someone who has mainly lurked and only occasionally posted to help others out. 

I've been pretty ""girly"" all my life. Dresses, nail polish, cute hair, shaved legs (Oh my god, I have such bad dysphoria when it comes to bodyhair and I still want to laser everything to get rid of it!~) and I still enjoy things that are considered typically female. Sometimes a little too much. I remember stopping dressing as a girl when I was five because children in the neighborhood started bullying me.

Growing up, bullied, getting overweight and going through puberty, I felt more and more disassociated from my own body. Didn't take care of myself because I never really felt I was in the right body and I picked up some other disorders along the way. 

I didn't really figure out I was gay till well past my education. Yeah. I had even fallen in love with a few girls once, but nothing had come of it – part of me thinks I fell in love with them because I felt that was the normal thing to do for a guy my age. It wasn't till I was twenty-five and fell in love with a guy that I realized something was ""wrong"".

Five years ago I bought a pair of stockings. It was a mixture of boredom, depression and supressed sexuality. It got the ball rolling though. It went from wearing long socks to female underwear and while it definitely started sexual, it turned into something more than sexual. The first time I shaved my legs and wore fishnets was like the first time I saw my real legs. I can't really explain it, but the disassociation with my own body just disappeared. I suddenly started to care for taking care of my body. Lotions, shaving, it was glorious. For a long time that helped. And then suddenly it didn't.

The more I indulged in my feminine side, the more I needed. And because of my rather conservative surroundings/family, I was pretty much restricted to a single room when it came to wearing girl clothes. I wore them under my guy clothes to work and it definitely made me feel better about myself.

I always thought that the grass-is-always-greener on the other side mentality was normal. That liking girl clothes and being jealous of transgender friends transitioning and all those sort of feelings were perfectly normal for a regular cis guy. But that changed when I stumbled upon this reddit during one of my depressed streaks. I realized that being transgender was a real possiblity. 

So yeah. Up till now it's pretty obvious right? Obviously transgender. I know, I know. But here's the thing.

I've considered HRT a lot. For two years now. I've weighed the plusses and the cons a ton. I don't care about the infertility, that's not an issue. I don't want children anyway. However, the other negative side effects of HRT are really daunting and I feel a lot of people underrate them. A life long dependency on medicine? Having to face even more discrimination than I already do as a gay guy in a christian community? The danger of not passing after years and becoming more of a social outcast because of it? The health issues? Breast cancer? Let's be honest here. If you transition past 30 and you become fully passable, you're one of the lucky few. It generates all kinds of new problems. I deeply respect people who go through with it, knowing they won't pass, but at least will feel better and happier, but I don't think I will.

My dysmorphia is still negatively affecting me real bad. I want to lose more weight (I'm a few kg overweight atm), have a more androgynous/feminine appearance in day to day life, have wider more girly hips and a nice butt. I want to lose body hair and have hair laser removal and find a hunky soulmate. I love make-up and taking care of my nails and skin. I love being cared for tenderly and protected and cherished. 

But I can do/have all these things as a guy? Sure, I can't go outside in a skirt and on high heels, but yeah. I guess. I'll not have breasts, but I don't really care that much about them (Not that I would mind having them!)– its the other female shapes that I want. I feel no dysmorphia towards my penis or my flat chest. 

I feel like I'm forcing myself into the transgender lifestyle just because I happen to like things that are stereotypically 'female' things to do? Why am I conforming to gender norms like this? It feels like I'm being mysoginist by telling myself this is what I should do. More so because I'm a pretty submissive person and a bottom IRL. And I feel I should quit doing that. Did I think I was transgender and should be a woman because I'm submissive and a bottom? Did I get sucked into this sense of wishful thinking that if you're not comfortable in male gender roles that means you're a girl? 

I think part of my wants/wanted to be a girl because I always feel like a second choice in relationships. I'm way too girly for most gay guys, but not girly enough for a lot of bisexual guys. It's like I'm telling myself I have to pick one or the other, or I'll be unhappy. Why am I telling myself it's wrong to get my totally non-sexual long socks, some boy shorts and a nice long wool sweater and just be comfy unless I identify as a girl? 

In the end, I don't mind being a guy. A 'feminine', gay guy? Well yeah. But that's still a guy. So why am I driving myself crazy? I have zero problems with the idea of presenting as a guy, I have problems with how masculine my body looks, but that's fixable without HRT yeah? 

Am I crazy? Am I deluded? Is it acceptable/reasonable/possible to strive for my appearance change wishes if I don't transition?

I read tonns of information on the internet and came to the conclusion that it is most likely to be male pattern baldness. The weird thing is that no one from my family faced it so early in life. I managed to get finasteride and I have been taking it for about 1.5 month. I see no effect so far. If I don't wash my hair in the morning I shed all the time like crazy and when I run my hand through the hair it won't stop falling out! 
  
I feel so down and anxious and just terrible. What kind of a girl would I be being bald at the age of 20? That fear makes me willing to start HRT as soon as possible, even though I am still not sure if I actually want to transition. The problem is that I do not dislike my male body apart from the facial and body hair and also the size of my feet, hands, my height, adam's apple and of course my face. So it is mostly the things that cannot be changed.I cannot say that the idea of growing boobs is appealing to me. But I think I wouldn't mind having them if I were a girl from the very beginning. So I might be a non-binary transgender but that doesn't make my life easier as I don't see any options of how I could medically transition. I certainly don't want my body to keep masculinizing and I feel so jealous when I look at how perfect some girls' faces and skin and hair look like.

I am sorry for this rant but it is a tragedy that I am 16 and I have to face this hair loss issue. What if it is going to affect my decision of whether I should go for HRT and after some irreversible changes such as boobs occur I would realise that I am actually not a transgender female but something else or even a cisgender male? That makes me so anxious... Now I just feel like I want to cut myself or get drunk or something. I cannot live like this every day and find 80+ hairs in the sink when I blow my hair and lord-knows-how-many flow down the sink when I take a shower. It seems like NO ONE ON THIS FUCKING PLANET CAN HELP ME. My parents tell me that I am overthinking and stuff and that they can't do anything. 

The endocrinologist I went to said that it is probably caused by stress but I really doubt so. The internet says that 95% cases of hair loss in males is androgenic alopecia. And finasteride doesn't seem to help me... After all this shit, how can I live a happy life? "
sftbo,asktransgender,When does the acceptance start,"Hey everyone, I post some much here it seems like a life update.

Which then makes me feel like shit.  So my question when does the acceptance start happening?"

Laika_Come_Home,asktransgender,"So, I tried something yesterday that, in hindsight, has me feeling less hopeful. And I want advice.","So, last night, I got really drunk with my friend and told her all of the shit going on in my head with gender (whatever that is). Although, she already knew that I was interested in crossdressing, although I've never tried it.

Long story short, she did my makeup, let me wear one of her dresses, bra, and a wig, and I liked how it felt. At the same time, not only do I feel like it's a fetish, I also realized that, assuming it wasn't, I wouldn't pass at all. I look like too much of a man; my skeleton is far too angular and masculine. AT BEST, I'd look like a drag queen.

Even then, still don't know if I'm trans, nor do I have the finances (I'm unemployed and struggling) to employ someone who could help me figure that out.

And even if I did, I see people ask the age old ""if you could press a button today and live as a cis woman, would you do it?"" Question pop up, and my answer still is ""I don't know.""

From time to time those feelings came back and each time I felt worse. But when they were gone, I was feeling completely fine again. A few weeks back those thoughts and feelings and the question if i'm actually not male but female again hit me like a truck when my best friend outed him/herself as trans. I felt again like shit and tried not to ignore these feelings this time...If you would have asked me 6 hours ago gow i was feeling, I would've said that it's quite possible that I'm trans...

But now that dysphoria-esque feeling just completely vanished...which bothers me even more than the initial thoughts. I don't feel like shit anymore but am confused as hell about that. I don't know what my mind wants me to think anymore and I just don't get it. What the hell is my problem?"

So then my question is, that if it is argued that there is no difference other than sex (yes I understand sex is anatomy, gender is the roles associated with them), then why do the same people feel the need to switch genders or be gender fluid or things of that nature? Since based on the earlier statements, they are switching between things that are in theory not different at all.

I hope this does not come off as rude, or trying to be disrespectful. This is a genuine question I have in trying to understand better, and don't mean to come off as offensive."

"
WW-Landslide,asktransgender,"Greetings! Preparing to schedule consultation for HRT next week, and I have questions!","Hello, there! Okay, so to make a long story short, I'm 35, born male, and I *mostly* identify as female, if that makes sense? I guess maybe ""pangendered"" is a better term? I don't know...either way, I'm calling a clinic next week to schedule a consultation prior to setting up HRT.

Anyway, ever since I was a child, I preferred playing female characters in games, and I preferred pretending to be female online. At first, I thought it was just a phase, but as I got older, I realized more and more that I actually *wanted to be female.* I wanted people to see a woman when they saw me, and I would regularly daydream about being a woman.

Around 25, I finally realized that I was transgendered, and what it meant, but for so long, I've been afraid of transitioning. My biggest problem is that it might not feel *real* to me. I know that a lot of people are happy with transitioning, and I'm overwhelmingly happy for those people. I think it's a beautiful thing to be able to transform into something you're more comfortable as, but I've always feared that it would never be ""good enough"" for me since I tend to be a perfectionist about such things.

However, at 35, a friend of mine showed me a link about transitioning later in life, and I've decided that I want to do it. It's going to be rough, because I live in a somewhat conservative part of California (rural area), and I'm genuinely worried about my career and how my co-workers will react. I know, I know, I should just say ""fuck them, it's my life!"" but it's not that easy when I've worked so hard to finally get a good career going and transitioning could jeopardize that.

I'm less worried about my friends. None of the people I call friend would ditch me if I transitioned, though I know some of them would be confused. Some of my family would balk at it, but fortunately, I couldn't give a shit about the ones that would.

Sorry for making that so long, so...on to my questions:

1. I've heard that HRT for MtF reduces libido considerably. I like sex. A lot. Sex, masturbating, watching porn, reading erotic fiction, playing sexually-explcit computer games, etc. **Will the hormones cause me to lose interest in sex? Will I have trouble getting aroused? How severe will it be?**

2. I'm still not entirely sure I want to get rid of my penis. As previously mentioned, while I do want to pass as female and identify as female, I tend to view gender as a more fluid concept (just like sexuality), and therefore may decide I want to keep it, since I don't think genitals define a person, and having a penis is one of the very few things I actually don't mind that much. **How much functionality will I retain if I choose to keep my penis?**

3. Voice is a *big deal* for me. I have a pretty significantly masculine voice, so much so that I very sincerely doubt I'll ever be able to make it convincing through training alone, so I will eventually opt for voice surgery, and yes, I know it's not a magic wand that transforms your voice and that some practice is still needed. **How effective is voice surgery at assisting vocal transition?**

4. What the hell do I do mid-transition?! I'm currently a slightly overweight, 6' guy with a beard and a buzz cut. I've had a beard pretty much all of my adult life, and I'm really wondering how gradually (or suddenly) the transition is going to hit me...**How do I deal with that awkward phase where I still look masculine but people might notice more femininity creeping in?**

5. Last one. The place I'll probably pick, due to proximity, is a place called the Metamorphosis Clinic in Orange County, CA. I live in south Kern County. **Does anyone have experience with this place? Is it good? Should I avoid it? Any better recommendations?**

Thanks for reading, and hopefully I can get some good advice and help here."

ThrowawayTrans15,asktransgender,Am I autoerotic?,"One of the main reasons I began questioning my gender was due to always identifying as the girl in porn and my sexual fantasies. It seemed to make sense that a transgender female would be female in their sexual fantasies (and it does), however mine seems really autoerotic and fetishistic so idk if that's the case for me. First, whenever I think of myself as female I get aroused and eventually gave to off. In porn I'm always focusing on the girl, but it's not on her being sexy and erotic, it's imagining watching me as that girl performing the sexual act. I think things like ""I'm that hot girl being fucked"" and more. The focus is on me as the girl and me having boobs, a ""bubble butt"", sexy lips, etc. Again it's imagining watching (myself) as the girl from a third person pov. Sorry for the details but I felt they were necessary in making my point. All this seems autoerotic and fetishistic doesn't it?"

I haven't changed my fitness routine at all since before HRT, I do approximately the same cardio.. same situps, same squats and crunches.

So anyone else experience a change in their appetite since HRT?

scientificnonsense,asktransgender,Are transwomen nearly as common as ciswomen in the software industry?,"or is it my imagination?

Why do y'all think it might be this way? something about the social isolation of computer nerdery being a safe place for people raised as boys to not interact with the world and its gendered expectations, where people raised as girls are expected to be social and not hide away with computers?

And it's far easier in my observation to be a junior in software as a man than a woman, expected competence vs expected ignorance, and then we figure out and transition once we're senior and much more in demand...

And maybe excellent pay and job security/high demand mean it's safer to transition at all, and given similar resources a higher proportion of the general population would transition?

It just seems really statistically unlikely - any other theory for why?"
Abby_Road88,asktransgender,Any negative experiences with injections?,"I was on pills (100mg spiro and 4 mgs E) for 3 months and everything was going great.

Over the next two months, this continued and intensified little by little.  So much so that I would have to hold my chest running down stairs and such.  Then at my 3 month check up, I asked about upping my dose and switching to injections, having heard that they potentially give better results.  My doctor put me on 6 mg E and told me to take the pills until my shots came in a week or so.  Finally the moment came and I was so excited to not have to take as many pills every day.  One inter-muscular shot of 1 mL of 40 mgs/mL estrogen valerate once every two weeks.  About after the first week I started to notice that I had lost a lot of sensitivity in my chest.  By the end of the second week it's like I had a boy chest again ����.  It is such a discouraging feeling.  I feel like I was making good progress with the pills and then the shots just messed up my whole game for me.  My doctor didn't seem to think much of this.  Is this normal when first starting shots?

transthroawayy00000,asktransgender,Trans people made the cover of NatGeo,"I guess I should read the issue first before making any judgments. Maybe the people on the cover expand a bit on their genders in a way the cover just can't convey. And I think it's great that trans people are getting the visibility that they are in this issue. And part of me feels like my concerns are so minute and I should be grateful that this was even published. I'm also glad that the people on the cover are diverse in many ways. But while I appreciate the visibility, I don't know, I'm just not sure I'll like it. Some of my concerns include: 

1) Why do trans people need a ""*special* issue""? 

2) Is ""androgynous"" a gender? I thought it was a type of gender expression/presentation (like someone presents feminine, or masculine, or androgynous), which is totally valid, I just think there's already too many people out there conflating gender roles or gender expression with your gender. 

3) I really dislike how they specified everyone as being ""trans something something"" but the one presumably cis dude is just ""male"". This and the whole idea of ""transgender"" being a gender of its own is quite frustrating to me. I intensely dislike for example, having ""trans female, trans male, male, female"" as options for the question ""what is your gender?"" as if trans men and women aren't ""real"" men and women and they need a special category. I always looked at it as someone could have their gender identity match their gender assigned at birth (cis) or not (trans) and those same cis or trans people can be male, female, bigender, etc. Not to mention that having these rigid categories sets up more boxes and often leaves no room for people who aren't binary (although props that the cover actually included a non-binary person). 

Again I'm glad for the visibility and I read the editor's note which helped ease some of my concerns, but I dunno, I'm always really apprehensive about trans-specific articles. I just really hope the issue is not muddled with misinformation. What do you all think?

torienby,asktransgender,This time last week I was ready to kill myself (cw: suicide) (happyish),"I'd started SSRI's recently and honestly I was feeling worse than ever. I was so close to ending it all, and I honestly thought that I'd never feel OK again.

Turns out that my bipolar had come back with a vengeance and that it was causing my suicidal ideation. Because it had been so long since it had emerged and it was presenting differently than it used to that I had no idea that it was the problem and just assumed that I was depressed and that nothing would fix it. Thankfully during a short hypomanic episode I became aware that it may have returned and I had the presence of mind to see my doctor, who prescribed appropriate mood stabilisers for the mania and valium to combat my insomnia. That very quickly ended my hypomanic episode and stopped the terrifying depression that came every night.

I feel sane again for the first time in a long time. I'm honestly starting to feel like myself again, not the whiny needy creature that was inhabiting my home and slowly destroying my life. It's incredibly early days, but I'm so glad that I didn't end it when I wanted to and actually sought out  help. I'm so thankful for my friends right now, I'm glad that when I reached out to them that they helped me out (even if they need to learn to pity laugh at my jokes :P )

Honestly, I'm just so happy to feel like myself again. I guess the moral of the story is that if you're in a dark place, please try to reach out to people and get the treatment that you need. I can't promise that it'll help, but it might and that makes it worth trying."

it is because I got all of the masculine genes possible from both
sides of the family. My adam's apple could pierce an actual apple, my
voice is really deep, plus my legs and ass have what is effectively

it out all the time.

been trying to break it to my parents that I'm trans but I just can't

telling them directly per se, but I do remember begging my mom for a

be fine if we were gay, they support transgender rights, but I don't

really expect to at this point.

They claimed that it was not healthy, that my girlfriend (who Ill call M) is not well, physically, mentally, and spiritually. They also said that our relationship is codependent and that it was not healthy. Due to all of these things they decided to take her out of college (with 3 weeks left in the semester) and move M home where M would get a job and start attending a community college. They also asked me to not communicate with M until her and her councilor decided that she was healthy enough to reach out, which I verbally agreed to. Now, the back story to this is that things were fine from when we started dating in April until October. Through my life I have been struggling with being transgender and had been repressing it for about 7-8 months before October. In October, this part of my identity resurfaced and our relationship broke apart as M could not see herself dating a girl. However 2 weeks after we broke up M decided that she still loved me and so we got back together.

After this she also started to reexamine herself and realized that she is Bi sexual. So we date for a while more until thanksgiving break. M’s mom messages me telling me that M will not be able to text over break as they feel we need space. Then comes the aforementioned meeting. Through this time M and I had been communicating still as iMessage works from her mac. Come after the meeting and she still wants to communicate so we use snapchat to send messages back and forth so we are not found out. Come the Tuesday after the meeting and I find out from M that she is up at school and is moving out. Under the guise of dropping stuff off I go into her room to help her pack. Her mother, who drove her up, had left. The mother had said that I don't love M and that I am a manipulator, this caused M to cuss her mom out and so her mom left.  Her mom ended up coming back in time to help load the packed boxes into the car. During this time I confronted the mom and told her that it is not ok to tell M that I don't love her behind my back and that my respect for her and her husband has fallen tremendously over the past month.

So M gets back to her house and I hear that her mom said “this whole day is a lie” in the car. Which I later find out is connected to M not supposed to interact with me (something I should mention is not M’s wishes nor an agreement by her but rather her parents orders). Her mom then goes to give her the silent treatment for the rest of the week. Her dad was out of town on business this day. Over the rest of the week they pulled financial support from M for her college classes, have stopped letting her use their car, and are now requiring her to pay $1000 per month in living expenses as long as she stays in their house. This all cumulated last night when they took M off of their cell phone plan and have greatly reduced her access to wifi.

Over the past week we have gotten more brazen in contacting each other. For the past few days we have used iMessage and Face Time to talk. Then comes tonight. I just received a text from the mom telling me that the meeting we had was the first in a series of steps that they (her parents) are willing to undertake.

The first step was the meeting, the second is to apparently contact my parents and discuss the matter with them thoroughly. After the second action they say that they will move onto legal actions. 

I honestly don’t know what to do. M is my life, I love her more than I have ever loved anyone.

Here is some more additional information. On the topic of manipulation, I have always told M to leave me if she feels like I am manipulative or controlling. My parents are not accepting of my transgender identity, which my parents do not know the current state of but M’s parents do. I had a large falling out with my parents about my identity last semester. Also, if it were M who asked me for space and was the one who wanted to leave me I would respect that. It is not however her that is telling me this. It is her parents and I don’t like other people getting messed up into my shit.

I am so stressed out right now and I dont have anyone else to really turn to. Any help would be so appreciated right now. Please, let me know if you have any questions.

LooseyLewd,asktransgender,Shifting sexuality - nsfw,"Hello. I have been on hrt as a mtf trans woman for about 4 months. I came out a few months before that, so I've been out for less than a year at age 32.

So my question/discussion prompt today is about shifts in sexuality. I felt a profound internal shift from the moment I accepted for myself that I was a trans woman (which only happened because of a really incredible friend who one day just looked me in the eye and asked ""are you trans?"" and I just completely broke down because it felt like the first time anyone had ever seen me through the disguise I'd been hiding behind for 30 years).

I've always been very sexually attracted to men, but socially terrified of them. I'm sure this has a lot to do with growing up in a small religious town.. but I also feel like I could never make sense of my sexuality until I accepted myself as a woman. I couldn't imagine anyone actually being attracted to me because I was so disgusted by myself. It felt like anyone who was couldn't possibly be seeing the real me.. I had a few relationships with cis girls (mostly butch queer types) and sex was always 100% focused on them. I could hardly even stand to be touched, and HATED to revive oral. 

But so much has changed in the past 6 months!

All of my fantasies make so much more sense now.. I feel so much more confident flirting with guys, and receiving sexual &amp; physical attention. A big part of this is finally feeling like my body is beginning to match my internal picture of myself. I have even been able to enjoy oral on several occasions.. like embracing my identity as a trans woman has really improved how i view/relate to my body, and just because I have these strange and too-big-for-my-body genitals it doesn't mean that I'm a gross boy. I think I owe a lot of this to being exposed to other very out and proud trans women. Having those role models has given me a way to see love and accept myself. 

I've seen a lot of posts where girls talk about feeling lower sex drives, but I honestly sort of feel the opposite happening for me. I mean, i definitely have way fewer erections, and no longer feel the urgency to have an ejaculation, but my sexual fantasies and general sluttyness are, if anything, accelerating. I am also more and more in love with butt stuff. I've found that I can have multiple organisms from anal (w/ a partner or solo) that are much different from genital stimulation. 

Pre transition I was always interested in butt play, but had never been able to get much out of it in practice. I've also felt a similar shift in my kink &amp; fetishes.. I've been into bdsm for a while, but once again, could never get close to the same enjoyment from reality that I did from fantasies until I shifted my perception of myself. But now that I can see myself in a way that fits with my fantasies, they are all coming true, and I can really relax and let go as a submissive in bdsm scenes.

I guess the similar theme in these is that I have come to a point where I can actually accept attention and pleasure because I see myself as worthy of it.. I look in the mirror and like what I see, so I can accept that someone else might as well.

Honestly, I'm a bit surprised by these changes. I went into hrt thinking ""okay, if I loose my sex drive, that is fine. My sex life isnt doing that much for me in terms of living a happy life, so whatever happens there is a small price to pay if hrt can help my gender dysphoria and mental health.""

Okay, so that is me. I'd like to end with a few prompts on things I'm most curious about.

Trans femmes: have any of you had similar experiences? Were you surprised by any developments in your sexuality throughout transition? Did you notice any shifts later in your transition, like 6 months in vs after a year or more? Do you feel more attracted to guys/masculine energy?

Trans masculines: have changes in your personal perception affected your sexuality? Has it changed how you view or relate (sexually) with men or women? Have you experienced any unexpected shifts in your sexuality since transitioning and starting hrt? Do you share the experience of feeling more open to sexual pleasure as a result of seeing your body match your mental picture of yourself? If so, how aware of that inhibition were you prior to coming out? 

For anyone who came out prior to starting hrt, did you feel anything like this begin just from your shift in perspective? 

Okay thanks y'all. Sorry if that's a lot of questions lol. Don't feel obliged to answer them all ;)"
Genocide_Bingo,asktransgender,I've figured out how I'm gonna come out to my friends!,"Alright so this is short and sweet, it's gonna be said when I see them after the new year. ""So y'know how people sometimes say 'New year new me'? Well yeah, I'm going one step further because I'm trans :D"""
musicsexnotions,asktransgender,Just a rant. But I need to be read. Thanks for being for me.,"I am almost 23, a woman who has yet not transitioned from her male-body. Please read this if you have the time. I need you to.

I came out to myself early this month. It was among the most relieving moments of my life. After disclosing it to only one friend, I came out to one of my sisters and her husband. All these three were supportive - particularly the friend, who encouraged me immensely. I was away from home thereafter for a week (when I also saw a psychologist), and I was contemplating asking my sister to disclose it to the rest of my family when she herself did that. Upon returning, my mother's first question was whether I was contemplating physically transitioning (know that she is very uneducated). I told her I was and that left her fuming. She blackmailed me, said I could do whatever I had to once she died, and discouraged me from transitioning. I shouted back that the life was mine as were my choices. A few days later, when she was ill, she softly said I was going to be the cause for her death. When I asked why, she said I had to think myself. When I said I couldn't, she said it was because of my plans to transition.

I forgot to mention my father, who is divorced to my mother, and a debauched man. He lives in a different part of the country altogether. I have no expectations whatsoever from him as he is a very inconsiderate person, and I am suspecting my mother has blurted it out to him. He's gonna flip.

The tension between me and my mother later reduced until today when I playfully told her about my plans to get my septum pierced and she flipped once more accusing me of behaving like a woman, ""what are people gonna say!"" and calling me a ""chhakka,"" which literally translates from Hindi to ""sixer,"" and - for whatever reason - is meant to shame a transgender woman. It is considered highly offensive in India. When one of my sisters (not the one I personally came out too - she is also very supportive) tried defending me, my mother argued that there was nothing ""girlish"" about me, that I was *Man* in every sense - broad shoulders, tall, behaviourally, etc. Then they went to another room while I contemplated ways to leave my family to relocate to a bigger city, say Mumbai, and after some discussion between them my mother returned to say it was my life and I was free to undergo transition and ""dance on the streets,"" and something about her death.

I just wanted to share this here. I don't feel too strong. I have really not confirmed to myself that I will transition but I know the choice will be *only* and only mine. I want to move to a bigger city and start earning so I can afford medications and keep my head high. I just feel defeated in the sense my mother won't understand me *anytime* soon (I don't even care about my father) and that I live in such an abusive, uncaring, unsympathetic world. I have ambitions and I want to achieve things, but such situations make me prefer dying peacefully. I just wanted to let you know since this a community where we all support each other. Just ranting. Thanks.

Anon20055,asktransgender,How do you deal with a gender identity issue? (not sure if correct term),"I am in my late 20s, male, but identify as female. For practically my whole life, I have been wishing I was born female instead. I don't have a masculine personality or build, and almost no masculine interests which has made it very hard to make friends. Other guys want to talk about things like sports or go clubbing and I don't have any interest in things like that. Most girls seem to have zero interest in associating with me and I've had a few tell me that I don't seem like a ""real man"" (whatever that is) or ""manly"" enough. Some guys use harsher words to say basically the same thing.

I'm not sure how to put it into words but I really want to be able to wear dresses, accessories and feel pretty I guess. If I happen to see someone wearing a great dress, I wish I could wear something like that, but as a guy I can't. I just feel totally out of place in my current body and I don't really know how to act my current gender, which causes all kinds of issues in social situations. I can't get into a proper relationship because I keep thinking that I would rather be the girl in the situation instead. I sometimes have dreams in which I am going through my daily life, except as a girl, and those are the only times when I feel that things are ""right"" and I feel natural, but that all ends when I wake up.

I've tried to ignore things, keep my head down and just go through life as best as I can, but as I get older, it just keeps getting harder, especially as there doesn't appear to be anything that I can do. The feeling of isolation and loneliness just keeps growing and I'm not ""growing out of a phase"" or anything like that. Time is not making things better.

While I don't have a masculine build, I am tall, lanky, and my facial structure is definately not feminine (although a female friend did comment that she would love to have my waistline at a pool once), so I highly doubt I would be passable even if I did undergo surgery. I can imagine the massive amount of social stigma and discrimination that I would face if the surgery isn't a success, which certaintly would not make things better. I don't have the funds for transitioning anyway, and I won't for a very long time unless I happen to win the lottery.

I was reading up on Klinefelter syndrome the other day and I couldn't help but wonder if I have something similar to that since I do tick a number of boxes, but nothing too obvious like breast growth. In particular, I have above average height, problems with speech, co-ordination, and very little muscle mass (and can never seem to gain muscle mass or weight no matter what I try). Particularly, the symptons seem similar to Marfan syndrome, and I was tested for that when I was younger (at our family doctor's suggestion), but tested negative.

Either way, I don't know what I'm supposed to do, or what I CAN do. Everything seems to require massive amounts of money, which I don't have as I am still in uni. Talking to counselors, psychatrists, or whoever is of no help since it just leads to the same dead end : the lack of money. I'm tired of being discriminated against, tired of feeling isolated, tired of feeling like a stranger in someone else's body.

Does anyone have any suggestions or advice? It feels like I am stuck in a dead end because of a bad roll of the dice before I was born, and while things could certaintly be worse, I'm still stuck with a life long problem and no clear or viable solution."

ray2rey,asktransgender,"Started HRT on Friday! Questions on conflicts, side effects, and planning for full-time","Based on impulse, I decided to forego sperm storage and started HRT on Friday Dec 16. Mixed feelings so far--sometimes I feel good mentally, but I'm not sure if it's due to the drugs or if it's just the fact that I started. I was hoping by 3 days into it, that it would be much more clarifying (either yes this is great or no this is not right), but I'm still rather conflicted. But for the time being, I'm still moving forward. Anyone else still feel conflicted in their first few days/week after HRT?

I also seem to have some side effects (estradiol + spironolactone), though it doesn't feel like a long enough time to tell. I have some occasional nausea and at times, it seems hard for me to get enough oxygen in the system. I went on a run the other day, and it was significantly harder (which I attribute to side effects, not actual hormone levels). Anyone else have side effects?

Due to the way my contract at work is set up, I have an opportunity to have up to 8 weeks off in mid-2018, which I thought could be good recovery time for bottom surgery. Since I have to go full-time a before that, that means I will need to go full-time in about 6 months, but that seems rather soon given that I wouldn't want to go full-time unless I mostly pass.

I think the most pressing things to work on are: 1) facial hair removal, 2) voice training, and 3) figuring out what to do with my fair knowing that I eventually want long hair as a woman but needing to pass as male before I go full-time. Anyone have any advice?

Thanks in advance!"
OutOfTine,asktransgender,Emotional turmoil after coming out to yourself?,"Hi, I'm (very nearly) 21, AMAB, and I've identified as genderqueer since I was 17 or so. As of the past two months though, I've realized that I'm actually a full-on transwoman, and 0% boy.

Now, other than the constant doubt that I'm sure is normal, this seems to have caused some changes in my emotions and thought processes. The biggest one is in masturbation. I used to do it all the time, watch porn and all that. But since my recent realization, it's like masturbation has been ruined for me. I'll start to do it, but then think along the lines of ""what are you doing, you don't even like these genitals"" and not be into it anymore. 

Other than that, I have this constant anxiety hanging over me. I've made a list of evidence for me being trans and a list of advantages of transitioning, and read over these when I feel doubt about this whole thing, but a lot of the time all these reasons feel fake and like I'm making the whole thing up, even though I know they're factually true.

When I try to imagine the future, like when I'm in my 30s and 40s and beyond, my mental image of myself is something like Laurelai from Gilmore Girls (I don't know why lol, I'm blonde and look nothing like her), and definitely not as a man or as a nonbinary person. So I know transitioning is the best choice. Before coming out to myself, I didn't know what the future would be like. And now that I know I have to transition, I know how the future will go, more or less. But at the same time, I've never felt more uncertainty in my life. This is a contradiction and it's annoying.

This turned out way longer than expected, so I guess the overarching question I have is: did anyone here go through a period of emotional turmoil between realizing you're trans and starting transition? Especially related to doubt and uncertainty, and/or having a more strained relationship with your body than before. I feel like I'm going nuts over here."
bluepen456,asktransgender,Cis Wan here. How do I keep from offending anyone who is transgender?,"***Omg the title. Autocorrect is not my friend. That's supposed to be Cis Woman***

First things first is I want to apologize for any ignorance I may have here. I have read a bunch and really try to keep from saying the wrong thing, but I still don't feel confident in my ability to not say something stupid.

I have a few trans friends and I see many comics posted about how annoying it is to misgendered. I know that this would annoy me too, so I understand that. However, there are times I'm not sure of someone's gender. If I'm friends with someone and they tell their preferred pronouns, I use them, of course, but there have been a few times I have been introduced to people and wasn't sure of their gender, even after their name was given to me.

I don't want to be an asshole as be like omg which are you because I recognize people can be not only male or female but also non-binary. But I'm so afraid of using the wrong pronoun and misgendering a person and being seen as an asshole. I really just want people to be themselves and not have to worry about someone ignorant person(me) saying something triggering. How do I ask which pronouns they prefer without being insenstive?

I also saw something the other day that said telling a transwoman that she looks more like a woman now then before is highly offensive. I can totally see that and would never say that to a person. But I do compliment my girlfriend's. I say oh wow your make up skills are really improving or your hair looks so chic like that or whatever. I know I liked being told this because I'm still learning makeup. Is this offensive though? I could see it being that way because I'm like making assumptions and stuff. Idk. I want to be nice but also be sensitive to certain things.

I guess I'm just trying to figure out what is the best way to interact with anyone who might be trans without being offensive. I don't want to just ignore people because I feel that's so rude but I also get so worried about making a blunder. 

If I get hate or whatever, that's OK. I understand I'm some what ignorant and if I need a wake up call, I'm fine with that. I just want to be less ignorant and make sure I'm doing everything I can to keepy assumptions in check."

violaceous_trogon,asktransgender,[MtF][NSFW] GIGANTIC resurgence of arousal after 6+ months on HRT. Is this bad?,"I've been either 7 or 13 months on HRT (started ""officially"" in Nov. 2015, but the dose was ineffective, was put on an effective dose in May 2016).

Right now i'm getting a significant resurgence in my sexual and romantic desires. I went from being practically asexual and touching myself less than once a week, to *finally* being able to figure out my sexual orientation (i'm 99% lesbian but i'm freaking *terrified* of sex) after like ten years of questioning. And i masturbate at least once per day. 

I used to be able to talk and think about sex without becoming physically aroused, but when I see or even think about a good looking girl or (rarely) a guy I can't help but get hard. This is a big problem because, while I can live (somewhat uncomfortably) with my current reproductive organs, I feel really really dysphoric when I get erections.  and the only way I can make them go away for a significant amount of time is to touch myself. if i let them go away on their own they always come back. I posted about feeling suicidal yesterday and my erections were a big contributor to those feelings.

I'm hornier than I ever remember being and i don't know what to do. I'm faithfully taking my estradiol and spironolactone; i don't understand why they suddenly seem to be working less effectively as a dampener on my sex drive. 

i want to go back to my endo to see what my hormone levels are, but he's so far away and i have no way of getting to see him. 

sorry if this is rambly, i can't really think straight. *i'm just really really horny* right now. what should I do? does this mean my testosterone is going up? how can I cope if this is just how things will go from now on?"

Groomofnightmother,asktransgender,Has anyone else's T shot given them an anxiety attack afterward or similar?,"I suffer from anxiety but take nothing for it as my doctor wont give me anything for it. (In the UK, dunno why he wont. He's just an arse I suspect.) I take a shot of 250mg Sustanon every month and normally it's fine. I rotate it from thigh to thigh(I do it in different sections of the thigh also), since I prefer it there as opposed to my arm or butt and this was my 7th shot. It was done in my home, by my friend who is a nurse. I'm never nervous about them or apprehensive, I'm usually really excited. 

After all my injections, my thigh always swells up at the point of injection and it's usually about a first sized swelling. I know this is common due to the pressure in that area from fluid, the tissue damage it does and so on, so that doesn't concern me and I'm used to the pain. 

The day after the injection, I took some ibuprofen to help with swelling and pain, but for some reason my skin around that area felt really...I don't even know how to describe the pain, but suddenly, with no reasoning, my skin felt like it was over sensitized and it spread to my entire body. I felt really stressed out and really panicky and started pacing back and fourth, unable to stop moving. I started hyper ventilating and feeling like I was suffocating. My friend tried to touch my shoulder but I had to warn them off, because touching me just made my skin hurt. My body just felt totally over stimulated from anyone touching me, even my hoodie touching my hands made me freak.

I have NO idea why I had this reaction and I've never had it before to a T shot. My first shot of T in my arm was more painful than this, but this pain is very different, it's a deep, gnawing kind of pain that's the only way I can describe it right now and it's a constant niggle at the back of my mind. 

Has anyone else ever had anything similar? Or felt like they had some kind of sensory over load after a T shot? I'm not concerned that it's a reaction or anything like that, it just seems to have affected me differently and be a different kind of pain this time around.

I've had sensory over load before from someone touching me, but not to the point where it gives me an anxiety attack and never from a shot. If anyone does suffer from similar, do you have any tips at all? I'm still a little bit over sensitized right now in my fingers and back but managed to control my panic attack and breathe deeply, but this sensory overload is still there, just not as intense."
elveness,asktransgender,How do you perceive gender?,"Hi everybody,

Today I heard a question ''What is your gender and why?''. It is probably not the first time that I hear it, but this time it got me wondering.
Frist of all, I always differentiated sex and gender. Sex being the biological characteristics, so that there is female, male and intersex (androgynous). As for gender I perceived it as the way you feel about yourself. Before moving to my actual question, is that part correct? Do you agree?
Anyway, I thought why am I a girl. Female sex is very clear, but I have no opinion on my gender. There are social factors based on which some identify gender, but I think those are bullshit. For example interest, anyone can dislike or like sports. Then clothing, I don't see why someone who says he is male gender wouldn't be able to wear a skirt if he wanted to. Are the social standards of ''masculinity'' and ''femininity'' really what determines our gender? If there were no social standards of masculinity and femininity, would even gender exist?

Trans people, how do/did you feel that your gender is different from your sex? What makes you say I am xxx gender? What feeling/state of mind / characteristics / something else makes you feel male, female, non binary, fluid, both, etc?

PS. If I used wrong terminology please correct me."
Sorry_for_the_mess,asktransgender,How to even save for expensive surgeries?,"Hey there everyone! Ive been looking more and more into surgeries that unfortunately seem more and more necessary for me to actually further relax the dysphoria. 

So far the three things i will need are breast augmentation, body contouring, and srs. 

My question is, how do you even save for this kind of work? Breast augmentation is probably the cheapest but i have no way to save money. Ive been unemployed since september but occassionally get a day shift as a bartender in a not so busy bar. I'm getting evicted because i cant even afford rent. How is it even possible to save money for these surgeries? at this point ive basically lost hope on ever having srs, its just too expensive..When i start to really think about it, it really gets me down. Someone tell me theres hope? "

throwawaypirate89,asktransgender,Frustrated.,"I'm just having a rough time. (Quick back story, last jan came out to parents. went tits up. barely got things in order to live at their house over summer. Repressed who I am over summer. Dated first time starting in april. Back at school for last year. Couldnt repress anymore.) A few nights ago I had a long conversation with my mom as we drove aimlessly. She asked about my gender cus she noticed residual nail polish on my nails when I got back from college. She talked about how she hates my college for hiring a trans man for a gender studies position. As soon as she heard about him she said she knew that I would reach out to him. (which is something she had asked me when I first talked about being trans, last year when I first came out she asked how many ""adults"" know and what do they think? She also asked if I had talked to anyone who is trans which at the time I hadn't. And she made it seem like as soon as I did I would realize I am making a mistake.) She said that he is brainwashing me. She told me that I needed to stop contact with him, since I see him every other week for coffee. She kept calling him an it and saying that he did not know who he is. Throughout the conversation implying that by not accepting and living as the gender assigned at birth, that he was confused. 

(Some quick back story, after coming out to my girlfriend we broke up for a few weeks but then got back together. Her parents do not like that we are back together, took her out of school [because she was at the college I am at] and put up a request of no contact. Which later turned into threats about legal action of which they had no recourse. We are now talking again as her parents were told they are crazy by my girlfriends councilor.) My mom also asked if the whole being asked not to talk to my girlfriend by her parents had something to do with gender. She said that what they, s/o parents, had done is ok, right, and just. My mom, doesnt know about the threat of legal action but I assume she would have no problem with it. She accused me of destroying my girlfriends life and causing her parents to loose tens of thousands of dollars to pull her out of school.

My mom also accused me of claiming to be transgender to get attention.That I just need to love myself and it'll go away. She kept talking about how terrible altering your body is and that god made me like this for a reason. She basically wanted me to say that I am not transgender that night. I didn't but I may have led her on to it. I felt like crap and I just wanted to get to my bed at that point.

Now in addition, my girlfriend is hoping that I don't actually want to be transgender. She really wants to date a guy because it feels safer to her. She is the love of my life and it is tearing me apart. We both love each other immensely, more than I ever thought possible and more than I ever thought I would receive. 

To top it all off I am feeling so pissed off about being in my body. I hate it. Why did I get the shit end of the stick? Why did I end up as a guy when I should have been a girl. I just hate all of it. And its hard too because I am an atheist and so I don't have anything I can hate directly or take my anger out on. Like I got livid after hearing some lyrics to cheep thrills by sia because it talked about getting ready to go out in high heels and makeup and I just felt terrible because I can't yet. And Im so afraid. I need to get a job for after college in May but everything I apply to, I never hear back. And that is applying as a guy!

Im sorry for the rant and the walls of text. I just cant see my therapist until later in January and I don't really have anyone to talk to. Writing everything out helps. I appreciate you listening.

I want to point out that I know Im not special, that a lot of other people have the same questions and feelings and that what I am going through is not the hardest. Its just really hard for me and since Im me, it means a lot to me.

Thanks again for listening."
OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,"I give up, I'm done fighting it. As much as I wish I was, I'm not a Cisgender Male and no amount of trying will make me one, and that hurts.","I...I tried. I really tried. I tried to be like my guy friends, I tried to practice self-sex. I tried looking at porn. I tried being a normal guy. But even then I couldn't escape. All I could think about was how much I wanted a vagina. How I wanted to be the attractive women I saw on screen. 

I can't stop wanting to be a girl. No matter how hard I try, I can't escape it. And I hate that. I want it to just go away. I didnt want to be born this way. I just wanted to be a regular guy, get a girlfriend, have a son, and a good job. 

But I'm not allowed to have that life. I want that life but I can't have it. I have no future as a guy.

I thought that I just convinced myself I wanted to be a girl because I started browsing this place, but this was always a part of me.

I'm getting sick of fighting it. Second guessing myself, trying to find every excuse to forget about being trans only for Dysphoria to hit me like a tsunami.

I am transgender. And maybe I'll start seeing the positives of that in time. But it just hurts to give up James. James was a good guy and he deserved a happy life with a girl. But I'm not him. "
hayley90,asktransgender,Question about sex between pre-op MTF and cis woman,"Hi,

I'm a pre-op trans girl (about 14 months on E) and I've started sleeping with a cis woman.

I'm pretty sure I know the answer to this but if we're having PIV sex is there a risk she could get pregnant if we don't use protection?

When I ejaculate now it's just a clear liquid but I'm assuming that there could still be a risk and the sensible thing to do is to use some sort of protection.

reverserocket,asktransgender,"Ignorant and confused, would like some enlightenment.","Hi everyone! First it's best to start off by saying I'm asking in order to get a better grasp on things as they are irrelevant in my personal life and circle of friends or family. With that I've never had a full understanding on transgender though my friend, who is gay, has tried to give me some basic understanding of what it means to be transgender. So my question is:

""My general understanding is sometimes the human brain is wired in a way that functions differently from the majority. It doesn't mean it's working wrong, but outside of the norm. Is being transgender a medical issue that is being corrected through hormone procedures or is it a mental alignment of self identity""?

Put shortly: ""DNA is extremely different amongst people but one thing that remains constant is gender (male or female). Is this being denied and argued or is being transgender just something of a feeling and desire?""

Thank you for answering and helping spread the stories of your challenges and opinions. The world isn't always a nice place to exist in, but I know people are generally good and that just requires trusting them. The unknown can be scary.

imapommagranate,asktransgender,"Went from injection to pill two weeks ago because of shortage, now in an emotional downward spiral filled with rage.","I'm nearly two years into my transition. Still on spiro and was on injectable estradiol valerte since. I recently had to switch to the estradiol pill form and everything was fine for about a week. Then my mood started to dip and I got more annoyed, tense, and angry. Two days ago in a fit of rage I destroyed a bunch of things in my home and nearly broke my hand punching things.

This is the only thing that has changed in my medication or life recently. I started on anti-anxiety meds over a month ago and haven't had any depression for a long time then this past week it was like a tidal wave of depression, self hate, and self destructive behavior. I unfriended a bunch of people, blocked everyone close to me, and ended my relationship. I haven't spoke with a person outside of work since.

Has anyone had such an extreme reaction to a change in their hormones? I had scheduled an appointment with my doctor but sadly I have another week until I can get in. Is there a major difference in the pill vs injection other than potency? My body's response to a change in hormones has been quite impactful before and I was afraid of what might happen if I had to switch.

I'm kind of afraid of how unhinged I can become right now. I'm worried the pill isn't working."

ClosetedVet,asktransgender,"I think I'm trans. I'm a veteran, trying to go reserve, and I'm not sure what to do with myself.","First time posting here, and I'm using a throwaway account, and anyway, I'm trying to figure out what to do with myself. Bear with me here, I'm new at this.

So I just finished up a decade-plus long career with the U.S. military (I'll keep the branch to myself, and no, not a Coastie). It was a long road, but it's time to put down roots and quit moving my family around every few years. And I'm not trying to totally kill my career--I'm trying to go reserve so I can reach some form of retirement. Here's the thing--on the way out the door, I started to realize that I might be trans.

I didn't have anything overtly trans-like when I was a kid, playing with dolls or playing housewife. I fooled around with cross-gender stuff when I was a teenager--trying on my mother's clothes when she wasn't home, stuff like that when I was younger. Genderswap stories were always fun on a certain level that other sexual kinks weren't. I grew out of this stuff once I joined the military and got married, so all that stuff just sort of fell away and wasn't a concern. I had a career, a wife, eventually a kid, so I did and kept doing the husband and dad thing, and none of that was a problem.

The catch is that I got into cosplaying a few years ago. Some time back, I found out about crossplaying--cosplaying as the opposite sex--and decided, hey, that sounds kind of challenging and fun. Let's see if I can get away with that. So at my big cons, and also for Halloween, I put myself into female costumes. My wife and kid were a little weirded by it, but it's become an in-joke in our family that I costume cross-gender and we all have a good laugh about it.

The thing is, the first time I got into a female costume, I looked in the mirror and was shocked at how much I liked it.  Adding a few curves here and there, a wig, and some makeup, and I was amazed at how suddenly I was gone. In my place was this woman who wasn't me, but looked a whole lot more...real, if that makes sense. Like, I don't know who this woman is, but she looks wonderful and *happy.*

For awhile, I thought I was just a weirdo with a kink. It's fun to pretend to be a girl, but I'm not *actually* a girl, I'm just weird. But...no, the feelings have been intensifying since I first put on a girl's costume, and I look more and more forward to my next opportunity to stop being me and start being her again. And I think this goes beyond clothing and makeup. I feel like I want those curves to really be there under my clothes. I want real breasts, not just the rubber ones I put under a bra.  I want real hips, not just padding over my ass.  And so I finally asked myself a few weeks ago if I'm gender dysphoric...and it feels like that's the answer, even though I'm not sure.

But back to the military.  I'm not sure how this affects my career going forward. Yeah, I know we just lifted the ban, but the new policy handbook is sketchy, and I'm skeptical of how to take it. Because here's the thing: I spent a long time arguing with the Reserve over existing medical conditions before they'd accepted me. I have a few medical issues in my file which have never meaningfully interfered with my duty status. However, they raised all kinds of red flags when I applied to the Reserve, and they didn't care that I was active duty with no impact. You apply to the Reserve, it's like you're fresh off the street. I finally convinced them to grant me a waiver for my issues, but it was a hell of a process.  I got lucky.  I've known people who tried to flip to the Reserve, got caught in an indefinite medical review, and gave up.

So I'm worried about what happens if I really do have gender dysphoria and the Reserve finds out.  ""Oh, you have an undisclosed medical condition?  Well, we'll just charge you with fraudulent entry and have you kicked out right now.""  I mean, technically, it's not diagnosed, so there's nothing to report *right now.*  I'm worried about what happens if and when I decide to out myself in the next few years.

And then there's getting VA treatment.  I'm going through my VA disability processing right now and haven't brought this up yet.  On the one hand, if it's not brought up, then I don't have a diagnosis, so there's nothing to report to the Reserve.  On the other hand, if it's not reported, I can't get treatment for it.  No HRT, no therapy, nothing.  So I'm kind of stuck until I can figure out what to do with it.  

Prior to separating, I did ""out"" myself to an off-base therapist I've been seeing, so I've at least got documentation that I can take to the VA to prove that I was having issues during my military career.  And the VA apparently gives you the benefit of the doubt that anything you report in your first year-out is service-connected.  So I've got a year to decide if I want to get the VA to treat me.  But that clock is ticking.

And then there's the change in administration coming up.  Obama and DoD are very trans-friendly and things are moving in a positive direction there.  But come January, things are going to completely flip.  I honestly think Trump doesn't care about this issue, but Mattis as SecDef?  He might.  He seems like a classical, no-nonsense kind of leader.  Good for the force, but he might seriously want to flip on this policy as soon as he comes in.  I don't know.  I don't have a read on him.

Oh, and this says nothing of the social and moral impact it's going to have on me.  Let's just say that my MOS is a more conservative field--I'm not a combatant, but I could be called upon to pick up a weapon all the same.  How are my peers and leaders going to react if I decide to come out?  I know it's supposed to be about me, not them...but the reality is that I don't know if I can come out at this time in history.  And if I did, whether I could transition.  If I do it, I'm going to start changing shape, and losing muscle mass, and that's going to affect my physical performance.

So, yeah, loads and loads of questions here, and I'm not sure what to do with myself.  Looking for some other veterans or reservists to help me figure out what to do with myself.

TL;DR version: I'm a veteran joining the Reserve forces and I'm not sure how being a newly-realized transwoman will affect that.
1. Should I report this stuff to the VA now so I can get treatment?
2. If I'm outed as gender dysphoric, are the Reserves going to give me crap for having a new medical condition?
3. Are the military's politics about to become trans-unfriendly to a point where it's not worth it to out myself until I retire?

Thanks for any feedback.  I'd post this in /r/transalute, but it seems quiet over there and I might get an answer here faster. "
wayang_kulit,asktransgender,Has anyone experienced anything like this?,"I'm a non-transitioning mtf and with some peculiar medical issues and I was wondering if anyone else had something similar.

In my early twenties, in hopes of providing a babies for my then fiance, I visited an endo to see if I had a hormone imbalance. I was pretty sure something was up because I was/am massively less masculine than my brothers (I had admitted I was trans before this).

I went to the endocrinologist and he noted I had the T level that was within normal male levels... if I was an elderly man. He insisted on giving me a testosterone shot and I very reluctantly agreed. My body went kind of haywire and not in a masculine way... I had hot flashes and mood issues and in general was pretty miserable until it got out of my system. After that mess and a couple more he caused, I swore off seeing docs about my issues. I managed to procreate anyway and life moved on.

That said, I recently lost 35 or so pounds of weight very, very quickly (I didn't do much of anything to make it happen beyond keep my work lunches really small and high fat/protein) and my body started feminizing. After some internet research I found out that losing weight can cause estrogen to spike for a little bit... but it kept going until I was forced by my friends to see a doctor about it.

I got my blood work back and once again I showed up as very healthy, with ""normal"" on E and T for a male (though still with the T levels of an 85 year old man)... but my body is still slowly feminizing. My boobs and areola have expanded and hurt all the time, and... and I don't know how the heck this is possible at my age (mid-late thirties), my hip *bones* have been widening and rotating a bit. I am constantly sore in my hips, I had to get larger underwear, and I got stretch marks. Oh, and when I went to the doctor I found out I was shorter by an inch than 5 years ago. I've got a 23.7 BMI and am athletic, so I'm pretty sure it isn't fat issues.

I am concerned, confused, and elated all at the same time and it is honestly fucking with my head a lot. I'll be seeing an endo at the beginning of the new year, but I have no freaking clue what is going on. Has anyone had anything remotely similar?"
Ayarave,asktransgender,So. I don't even know...?,"How to Describe this, But this is my first time actually posting to any kind of reddit forum/subforum thing. Though i cruise this and two others for transgender stuff all the time. But, things have kinda gotten really really -really- bad for me out here in Montana. So i guess ill elaborate and kinda explain me! I first questioned myself in may of 2015, i was introduced to the whole concept of transgender and the other non binary ways of not just orientation, but sexuality. This was kinda big, case i always was ....""off"" as a kid. I did like so many others and joined a branch of service (USMC) and got out by medical means (legs are kinda buggered). but anyhow, By April i had an appointment at the V.A, then a few months later a pscyh eval, then many more months later i got my first dose of E, they started me out on a low dose, November 19th. spiro came about 2months later, Low dose. By June i was on a higher dose with my levels doing great. But yeah, that was the best thing ever!
    Now, the bad times. See i have/had a wife, she and i had been together for 9 years, with 5 kids (one is with my parents) and well, She was -hyper- happy about the concept of me be transgender, and when we confirmed and i started she was just full of joy. It was really good for us, Until the start of 2016, see i get a nice VA Comp so she worked and i stayed home with the kids. This was working out well, until well, she started to change. She no longer touched me, or wanted much to do with me. I was changing in ways and finally able to express myself how i felt, and it was going great and for some reason that made her feel worse so she started to distance herself from me. When we started to see things like what happened in NC and the ""Bathroom bill"" Debate came up she sided with those who said MtF (AMAB) or FtM (AFAM) (Whichever folks prefer) should use the bathroom of their birth gender. This....is where things started to get bad, like really bad. When i asked when i am about two years along, should i still? She replied yes, and then i said what if something horrible happens? like ...rape? and then she said if that happened it would be my fault. This continued until this summer when i went full dose. She started to constantly take jabs at me, constantly kind of put herself away from me and exclude me. Thats when she suggested she wanted to go out and sleep with some other woman, get ready for our future. I am....extremely laid back, so as long as she came home to me, and still gave me attention it wouldn't bother me, so she did....but she stopped giving me attention completely, and when we discussed that i had needs and wants from her too, she said ""Im sorry it hurts you, but i dont really care, i want to find out who i am, and you need to understand that"" Then....October, she suggested we separate. She wanted to split our tax returns in January, and spend the summer with our kids at her parents, I didnt find that to unreasonable, although it hurt. I mean she had been doing horrible things, i have...two real life friends right now, and like 6 good online friends, and they had been wanting me to break off over all the abusive things she had done, but yeah, it still hurt but i was willing to see.....Then the Election kicked up....See, im Out to everyone of my friends online (Except Facebook), and almost everyone i deal with on a Day to day knows too. But im not out to my Mom or dad, or my bothers and sisters, im out to some cousins and stuff, but my Mom/dad are huge trump supporters. We got into facebook arguements (not fights, just arguments) and my wife, she kinda freaked out. She was worried i was going to Out myself to them, to spite them about their trump support as they didn't really know any LGBT folks, and my mom specifically said she never had to deal with it cause all her kids were ""Normal"" (I wont get into....just ugh my parents are) so she decides not to wait for the summer, she told me around the second week of november, she was taking the kids and going to her parents by the 26th. We had to set up thanksgiving, and my daughters birthday, then she was leaving the night of my daughters birthday. We had some talks, and right now i have my two kids in school, i was fortunate to find a job in 3 days (its at a fish store) she however did leave with the kids, and since she was the only working one, and my VA comp pays for our rent/big bills and she kept her paychecks to leave on, i...had no money for food and things for my kids for  week (i got my new VA paycheck and we are ok, my next paycheck is hopefully soon) but like...After everything that has happened....i am very depressed. Suicidal depressed at times. i have very little friends, i have had very little time to adjust, HRT has been going great i think, i have a lot of mental changes (She told me she was sick of me turning into a ""Pussifed wimp"") but i have not seen a lot of physical changes (i mean there are some but...like some chest growth and the like) I still have to maintain boymode. She made me promise not to come out to my folks for a long while, basically until i cant hide it anymore. I want to work with her with the kids, and do whats right for them, and i also still need her to split the tax returns with me, or i cant finish off some debt and get electralysis....but everything is just so...horrible. i am having a hard time coping with anything, i have very little friends i can do anything with, or people that can spend real time with me, or want to even spend time with me. Like i dont even know what to do anymore, i just do a lot of crying when im not working. when i am working im fine, i can focus. but when i am alone, things get very...dark. Its not good. I just...could use some advise or, a good word or really anything, i don't even know how to word this properly and i feel i basically just ranted..."
-clare,asktransgender,Did you feel like you were asexual prior to SRS and then it changed afterwards?,"This is how I feel right now. Not asexual as in like, zero attraction and stuff, but more in a way I can't really describe. Like it's impossible for me to feel like a sexual person because of having a penis. It literally kills any kind of positive sexual feelings I have instantly the moment I realize I can't actually do anything I want to because it's... there. Like I just can't be with anyone right now because of it. 

It's such a weak excuse but it's true. I've realized a shit ton of people don't give a shit that I have a dick but I can't be with anyone who is alright with that. (On me, that's not like transphobic, is it?) Is there a way to accept it? How did you accept it pre-op enough to be like meh whatever, I want pleasure...cause I can't do it. 



I used to masturbate and I hated it. I did it because I wanted to stop having boners and it felt good if I could think of it as just masturbating and not as a dude playing with his dick lol. But it was endless on T. The thought of using it as intended like a man was so wrong. The thought of it being on me is likewise just as wrong. I don't want a dick on me, I want it in me ffs. See! I *can* be sexual! ugh

I'm on the list for assessment for surgery with Dr. Brassard. It will probably happen within a year or two possibly more who knows. But I am so. thankful. Just the idea I won't suffer like this forever is enough.

hej2k1,asktransgender,what does gender dysphoria feel like,"hi, questioning person i guess, but i usually just refer to myself as gay because im not 100% sure about everything. i am asking because i have trouble with my emotions and feelings and i have a hard time pinpointing what exactly im feeling or what something im feeling means, would be interesting to hear what people's feelings of gender dysphoria felt like to see if i might be feeling the same."
zephrtesk,asktransgender,My mom refuses to use my pronouns or name unless I get a girlfriend because she thinks I can’t be gay and trans…,"Finally told my mom I’m trans a couple of weeks ago. She took it okay at first. Well, it turns out she doesn’t understand the difference between gay and trans, so she takes it much less okay now. She’s decided that it’s impossible to be a gay trans guy or a lesbian trans girl, because everyone is straight by default (where does she think cis gay people come from?), so she thinks I have to “prove” I’m trans and that I deserve to have male pronouns by getting a girlfriend. I’m zero percent attracted to girls. I honestly don’t even think I could pretend about that. I’m eighteen, so I doubt she can legally block me from transitioning or anything, but I’m still technically living at home. It hurts a lot getting misgendered all the time. It also just hurts a lot thinking that the people that raised me would rather insult me constantly than go through with something so minor as a name/pronouns change. I don’t know how to explain to her what’s going on, and I don’t know if I should; I’m scared she’ll overreact if I push it too hard. But if I don’t mention it, I don’t know how to not feel terrible about getting constantly misgendered. I’m stuck here and I’m having a bad time."
FierceIsland,asktransgender,Exercises for people on patches?,"Applies for estrogen and testosterone patches alike- how exactly do you exercise when you have to worry about patches falling off?

StarkMidnight,asktransgender,Problem with gender/sex marker with insurance.,"So I was self-medicating for the majority of my transition but decided to get insurance since I won't surgeries done. Anyway I went to the doctors office for hormones and they had my gender listed correctly on their forms.

However I just went into the detailed documents of my health insurance and they have my sex listed as male. Know I have already had my social security and all my other documents changed to female so i'm a bit confused on this. Due to medical purposes, do they keep the sex marker as male or should i have them change it. Doesn't bother me that much personally but I could probably run into problems later down the line if they try to refuse me treatment due to certain surgeries only being deemed necessary for ""female"" marker.

I should also note that I my changes to my name/gender happened right before i applied. So i would assume since they got my name right they woudl have also got the gender right. Unless they leave sex un-updated for medical purposes."

Then she misgendered me, and I since my dysphoria was above the roof, I started crying like crazy. She asked why I'm not responding, so I told her that I'm trans. She readed her message once again and went ""OMG IM SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN TO""... and confessed that she identifies as non-binary, but doesn't tell that everyone and she uses male and female pronouns in the internet, but only female ones in the irl.

justsallygirl,asktransgender,[science of transition]Let's talk about blockers and medications! Yay!,"**What is this thread?**
--

There are a *lot* of comments and posts and questions about blockers, usually in regard to suppression or reduction of androgenic effects *[masculinization]* for mtf patients -- but occasionally we also see questions about estrogenic *[feminization]* suppression/reduction in the ftm community (and bodybuilding, for all genders... gotta lower e2 to shred). So I figured I'd compile some of the medical data available for easier consumption and community discussion.

I'm trying to keep this as concise as possible but... it's not exactly like more information isn't totally fun!

*Note: a lot of this is simply going through wiki pages and simplifying the available info in a more concise manner. Please read the whole wiki pages if you want to know more. Links are at the bottom.*


**What is a *blocker*?**
--

A blocker, in terms of biochemistry, is a exogenous compound that attaches to a receptor and blocks endogenous resources from attaching to said receptor.

Some compounds have higher or lower affinity to their target receptor than others, so they are classed according to receptor affinity profile. Many compounds express an affinity to multiple types of receptors (like cyproterone) and thus can be seen as both receptor agonists and antagonists depending on their pharmacokinetic activity.

Then there's the nomenclature that deals with endogenous *suppression* of hormone levels via glandular feedback mechanisms, which is to say that a compound may express the ability to reduce or block endogenous production of, say testosterone, via it's actions on certain receptors... so it would then have a dual role: it would block endogenous testosterone from *attaching* to the AR (androgen receptor) plus block the *production* of testosterone by the gonads+adrenal glands and thus reducing the overall amount of bioavailable circulating testosterone that could attach to the ARs in the first place.

**Terminology &amp; Abbreviations**
---

Here are some common terms to get you in the right mindset...

* **Affinity** = An inherent likeness or relationship; an attraction for a particular element, organ, or structure.
* **Exogenous** = external to the body, hormones you take in pill or injection or other means.
* **Endogenous** = internal to the body, hormones produced by the various endocrine glands.
* **SERMs**: Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator
* **SARMs**: Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator
* **AA** = anti-androgen
* **AE** = anti-estrogen
* **AI** = aromatase inhibitor, prevents conversion of testosterone to estrogen.
* **Agonist** = An agonist is a chemical that binds to a receptor and activates the receptor to produce a biological response. An agonist causes an action from the receptor it attaches to.
* **Antagonist** = receptor antagonist blocks or dampens responses rather than provoking a biological response itself upon binding to a receptor. An antagonist blocks the action of the agonist.
* **Inverse Agonist** = causes an action opposite to that of the agonist, which is not necessarily the same as an Antagonist.
* **Inhibitor**: an enzyme inhibitor is a molecule that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity.
* **Steroidogenesis**: the process by which steroids/hormones convert/metabolize from one to another. [ http://i.imgur.com/MBDi93o.jpg , http://i.imgur.com/NNNdiv2.jpg , http://i.imgur.com/DBm9KC0.jpg ]
* **Half Life**: an awesome video game... or in this context, the time it takes for a substance to lose half of its pharmacologic and physiologic potential. Also describes the time it takes for the blood plasma concentration of a substance to halve to its steady-state. The relationship between the biological and plasma half-lives of a substance can be complex due to factors including accumulation in tissues (protein binding), active metabolites, receptor interactions, and metabolic manipulation by other compounds (CYP450 modulation for example).


**Receptors**

* **AR** = androgen receptor
* **PR** = progesterone receptor
* **ER** = estrogen receptor
* **MR** = mineralocorticoid receptor
* **GR** = glucocorticoid receptor

**Hormones**

* **T** = testosterone
* **DHT** = dihydrotestosterone
* **E1** = estrone (a weak estrogen)
* **E2** = estradiol (a potent estrogen)
* **E3** = estriol (the metabolite estrogen)
* **GnRH**  = Gonadotropin-releasing hormone

**Enzymes &amp; Proteins**

* **5α-reductase [10]**: converts Free Testosterone to DHT.
* **Aromatase [11]**: converts Free Testosterone to Estradiol.
* **CYP450 [8]**: Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) are a superfamily of proteins heavily involved in the Catalytic metabolic cycle. CYPs are the major enzymes involved in drug metabolism, accounting for about 75% of the total metabolism. Most drugs undergo deactivation by CYPs, either directly or by facilitated excretion from the body. Also, many substances are bioactivated by CYPs to form their active compounds.
* **SHBG [15]**: a glycoprotein that binds to androgens and estrogen. Only a very small fraction of Total Testosterone and Estradiol (1-2%) is unbound, or ""free,"" and thus biologically active and able to enter a cell and activate its receptor. Bioavailability of sex hormones is influenced by the level of SHBG. SHBG has both enhancing and inhibiting hormonal influences. It decreases with high levels of insulin, growth hormone, IGF-1, androgens, prolactin and transcortin. High estrogen, and thyroxine cause it to increase - this results in less bioavailablity of testosterone and estradiol. Thus one can see high SHBG (caused by supraphysiologic levels of estradiol &gt;600pg/ml or via other compounds) as a means to induce reduction of Free Testosterone levels without HPG-axis feedback inducing medications.

Here's some simple stuff about the common meds... it's a lot of info and it's in summary fashion for simplified reference. Please read the whole wiki pages if you have time. It's very easy for this to get out of hand and very detailed... so please let me know if I need to add some terms or clarify anything.

**AA: Cyproterone [1]**
--

*Relevant info from the wiki since I don't feel like writing it all out... but I'll format it and order it all up for ya'll to be in summary fashion.*

CPA is a progestogen. It has affinity to the AR, PR, and ER. it blocks receptors (eg it's an androgen receptor antagonist) and engages the HPG-axis feedback mechanism to suppress testosterone production. CPA blocks the effects of androgens like testosterone in the body, which it does by preventing them from interacting with their biological target, the androgen receptor (AR), and by reducing their production by the gonads and hence their concentrations in the body.[14] In addition, it has progesterone-like effects by activating the progesterone receptor (PR). CPA is well-absorbed, is extensively bound to plasma proteins, and has an elimination half-life of around 40 hours.

CPA has powerful antigonadotropic effects via activation of the PR. In humans, it blunts the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced secretion of gonadotropins, and accordingly, markedly suppresses circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at high dosages. Consequently, progesterone (P4), androstenedione, T, DHT, and estradiol (E2) are also markedly lowered at high dosages, while an elevation in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and prolactin levels is observed.

**CPA's Pharmacological Actions**

* Androgen receptor (AR) antagonist/very weak partial agonist (IC50 = 57 nM)
* Progesterone receptor (PR) agonist (Kd = 15 nM; IC50 = 79 nM)
* Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist (Kd = 45 nM; IC50 = 360 nM)
* Pregnane X receptor (PXR) agonist (EC50 = 1.6 μM)[61] (and thus CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inducer)
* Weak inhibitor of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase, and 21-hydroxylase
* CPA does not have significant affinity for the estrogen receptor (ER) or for the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR).
* CPA is said to be equipotent as a progestogen and antiandrogen. CPA is said to be the most potent progestin of the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone group, reportedly being 1200-fold more potent than hydroxyprogesterone acetate, 12-fold more potent than medroxyprogesterone acetate, and 3-fold more potent than chlormadinone acetate. CPA is also reportedly the most potent of the steroidal antiandrogens, out of hundreds of other steroids.

**CPA's Receptor Activity**

* AR: CPA is a potent androgen receptor (AR) competitive antagonist. It directly blocks endogenous androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from binding to and activating the AR, and thus prevents them from exerting their androgenic effects in the body.
* ER: Because CPA does not bind to the ER, and because it suppresses estrogen production via its action as an antigonadotropin, the drug produces no general estrogenic effects (direct or indirect) and is potently antiestrogenic at sufficient dosages.
* PR: CPA is a highly potent progestogen. Through its action as a progestogen, CPA has been found to significantly increase prolactin secretion and to induce extensive lobuloalveolar development of the mammary glands of female rhesus macaques. In accordance, a study found that CPA, in all cases, induced full lobuloalveolar development of the breasts in transgender women treated with the drug in combination with estrogen for a prolonged period of time.
* PR: The action of CPA as a progestogen is responsible for its antigonadotropic effects.
* GR: Due to negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, administration of exogenous glucocorticoids such as prednisone and dexamethasone suppress the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland and the production of cortisol from the adrenal glands, resulting in adrenal suppression and atrophy and, upon discontinuation of the glucocorticoid, temporary adrenal insufficiency.
* OR: CPA has been found to bind non-selectively to the opioid receptors, including the μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptor subtypes, albeit very weakly relative to its other actions.

**CPA's Pharmacokinetics**

* The oral bioavailability of CPA is reported to be 100%.[1] However, it has also been said that CPA is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and should be taken after the consumption of food, which it would be implied improves its absorption.
* In terms of plasma protein binding, CPA does not bind to sex hormone-binding globulin or transcortin and is instead bound exclusively to albumin (93%), with the remainder (7%) circulating free or unbound.
* CPA is metabolized primarily by hydroxylation via CYP3A4, forming the major active metabolite 15β-hydroxycyproterone acetate. This metabolite circulates at concentrations approximately twice those of CPA, and has similar antiandrogen activity to that of CPA but only 10% of its activity as a progestogen. As a result, the co-administration of CPA with drugs which inhibit CYP3A4 may increase its potency as a progestogen.

**AA: Bicalutamide [2]**
---

*Relevant info from the wiki since I don't feel like writing it all out... but I'll format it and order it all up for ya'll to be in summary fashion.*

Bicalutamide is a non-steroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) and acts as a selective antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It does not lower androgen levels, instead acting purely by preventing androgens from mediating their effects in the body. Unlike the cases of the SAAs spironolactone and CPA and GnRH analogues, no clinical studies assessing bicalutamide as an antiandrogen in the hormonal treatment of transgender women have been published (well doesn't that just suck). Bicalutamide is almost exclusively metabolized by CYP3A4. As such, its levels in the body may be altered by inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4.

**Bica's Pharmacological Actions and Pharmacokinetics**

* Bicalutamide is a racemic mixture consisting of equal proportions of enantiomers (R)-bicalutamide and (S)-bicalutamide.
* Acts as a highly selective competitive silent antagonist of the AR.
* Has been found to accelerate the degradation of the AR, and this action may also be involved in its activity as an antiandrogen.
* Owing to its selectivity for the AR, bicalutamide does not bind to other steroid hormone receptors, and for this reason, has no additional, off-target hormonal activity (estrogenic or antiestrogenic, progestogenic or antiprogestogenic, glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid, or mineralocorticoid or antimineralocorticoid); nor does it inhibit 5α-reductase.
* Neither inhibits nor suppresses androgen production in the body (ie: it does not act as an antigonadotropin or steroidogenesis inhibitor).
* Mediates its antiandrogen effects by blocking androgen binding and subsequent receptor activation at the level of the AR.
* Blockade of the AR by bicalutamide in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus suppresses the negative feedback of androgens on the release of LH, resulting in an elevation in LH levels. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, in contrast, remain essentially unchanged. The increase in LH levels leads to an increase in androgen and estrogen levels.
* At a dosage of 150 mg/day, bicalutamide has been found to increase testosterone levels by about 1.5- to 2-fold (59–97% increase) and estradiol levels by about 1.5- to 2.5-fold (65–146% increase).
* Levels of DHT are also increased to a lesser extent (by 25%)
* Concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and prolactin increase as well (by 8% and 40%, respectively) secondary to the increase in estradiol levels.
* **It is important to note** that bicalutamide increases androgen and estrogen levels only in men (those owning testes) and not in women (those owning ovaries or post-op transwomen); this is because androgen levels are comparatively far lower in women and in turn exert little to no basal suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis.
* Bicalutamide is extensively and well-absorbed following oral administration, and its absorption is not affected by food.
* Steady-state concentrations of the drug are reached after 4 to 12 weeks of administration independently of dosage, with an approximate 10- to 20-fold progressive accumulation of circulating levels of (R)-bicalutamide.
* (R)-Bicalutamide has a long terminal half-life of 5.8 days with a single dose, and a terminal half-life of 7–10 days with repeated administration, which more than allows for convenient once-daily dosing of bicalutamide.

**AA: Spironolactone [3]**
---

*Relevant info from the wiki since I don't feel like writing it all out... but I'll format it and order it all up for ya'll to be in summary fashion.*

Spironolactone is a steroidal 17α-spirolactone, or more simply a spirolactone. Compared to cyproterone acetate, spironolactone is considerably less potent as an antiandrogen by weight and binding affinity to the androgen receptor. However, despite this, at the doses of which they are typically used, spironolactone and cyproterone acetate have been found to be generally about equivalent in terms of effectiveness for a variety of androgen-related conditions.

**Spiro's Pharmacological Actions**

* Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist
* Androgen receptor (AR) antagonist/very weak partial agonist
* Progesterone receptor (PR) agonist
* Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist
* Pregnane X receptor (PXR) agonist (and thus CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inducer)
* Steroid 11β-hydroxylase, aldosterone synthase, and 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase inhibitor
* Metabolizes into: 7α-TMS, 6β-OH-7α-TMS, canrenone, others.
* Bioavailability: 80–90%
* Protein binding: Spironolactone: 88% (to albumin and AGP equivalently), Canrenone: 99.2% (to albumin)
* Half life: Spironolactone: 1.4 hours, 7α-TMS: 13.8 hours, 6β-OH-7α-TMS: 15.0 hours, Canrenone: 16.5 hours

**Spiro's Receptor Activity**

* AR: Direct blockade of androgens from interacting with the androgen receptor. It should be noted however that spironolactone, similarly to other steroidal antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate, is not a pure, or silent, antagonist of the androgen receptor, but rather a weak partial agonist with the capacity for both agonist and antagonist effects. There may still be a potential for spironolactone to produce androgenic effects (i.e. act as a receptor agonist) in the body at sufficiently high doses and/or in those with low enough endogenous androgen concentrations.
* AR: Inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-desmolase, enzymes in the androgen biosynthesis pathway, which in turn results in decreased testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels.[55][98][99][100] Though, its inhibition of these enzymes is said to be relatively weak.
* AR: There is mixed/conflicting evidence that spironolactone may inhibit 5α-reductase to some extent.
* AR/ER: Acceleration of the rate of metabolism/clearance of testosterone by enhancing the rate of peripheral conversion of testosterone into estradiol.
* PR: Spironolactone has weak progestogenic activity. Its actions in this regard are a result of direct agonist activity at the progesterone receptor, but with a half-maximal potency approximately one-tenth that of its inhibition of the androgen receptor.
* ER: Spironolactone does not bind to the estrogen receptor but has some indirect estrogenic effects. By acting as an antiandrogen, as androgens suppress both estrogen production and action, for instance in breast tissue.
* ER: Displacement of estrogens from sex hormone-binding globulin. Spironolactone binds to SHBG at a relatively high rate and thus blocks relatively more estrogens from interacting with SHBG than androgens, resulting in a higher ratio of free estrogens to free androgens.
* ER: Inhibition of the conversion of estradiol to estrone, resulting in an increase in the ratio of estradiol to estrone. This is important because estradiol is approximately 10 times as potent as estrone as an estrogen.
* ER: Enhancement of the rate of peripheral conversion of testosterone to estradiol, thus further lowering testosterone levels and increasing estradiol levels.
* GR + MR: Spironolactone has been found to increase cortisol levels. Research has shown that this is due to antagonism of the MR, which suppresses negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis positively regulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn signals the adrenal glands to increase production of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. By antagonizing the MR, spironolactone causes an increase in ACTH secretion and by extension an indirect rise in cortisol levels. As such, any antiglucocorticoid activity of spironolactone via direct suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis (at the level of the adrenals) appears to be more than fully offset by its concurrent indirect stimulatory effects on glucocorticoid production. At the same time, spironolactone weakly binds to and acts as an antagonist of the GR, showing antiglucocorticoid properties, but to a significant degree only at very high concentrations.
* MR: Spironolactone inhibits the effects of mineralocorticoids, namely, aldosterone, by displacing them from mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in the cortical collecting duct of renal nephrons. This decreases the reabsorption of sodium and water, while limiting the excretion of potassium (A K+ sparing diuretic). The drug has a slightly delayed onset of action, and so it takes several days for diuresis to occur.

**Spiro's metabolic activity and other notes**

* Spironolactone is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver upon oral administration and has a short terminal half-life of 1.4 hours.
* The major metabolites of spironolactone are 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS), 6β-hydroxy-7α-thiomethylspironolactone (6β-OH-7α-TMS), and canrenone, and have much longer half-lives in comparison (13.8 hours, 15.0 hours, and 16.5 hours, respectively). These metabolites are responsible for the therapeutic effects of spironolactone. As such, *spironolactone is a prodrug*.
* Spironolactone is said to possess very little or no antigonadotropic activity, even at high dosages. (Though conflicting reports exist). In fact, the drug can actually increase gonadotropin levels by inhibiting androgen negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis via blockade of the AR. However, spironolactone is effective in lowering testosterone levels at high dosages in spite of not acting as an antigonadotropin, and this is thought to be due to direct enzymatic inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase.

**GnRH Antagonists [4]**
---

GnRH antagonists competitively and reversibly bind to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland, blocking the release of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary.

* In men, the reduction in LH subsequently leads to rapid suppression of testosterone release from the testes.
* in women it leads to suppression of estrogen release from the ovaries.
* Unlike the GnRH agonists, which cause an initial stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA), leading to a surge in testosterone or estrogen levels, GnRH antagonists have an immediate onset of action, rapidly reducing sex hormone levels without an initial surge.

---

**GnRH Agonists [5]**
---

A gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist, GnRH–A) is a synthetic peptide modeled after the hypothalamic neurohormone GnRH that interacts with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor to elicit its biologic response, the release of the pituitary hormones FSH and LH.

GnRH agonist use cases

* Suppression of spontaneous ovulation.
* Delaying puberty pending treatment decisions in children with gender dysphoria.
* Management of female disorders that are dependent on estrogen productions.
* Suppressing hormone levels in transsexual people, especially trans women.
* Severe cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia

---

**DHT Inhibitors**
---

**Finasteride [6][9]**

* A 5α-reductase inhibitor, specifically the type II and III isoenzymes. By inhibiting 5α-reductase, finasteride prevents conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the type II and III isoenzymes, resulting in a decrease in serum DHT levels by about 65–70% and in prostate DHT levels by up to 85–90%.
* Does not completely suppress DHT production because it lacks significant inhibitory effects on the 5α-reductase type I isoenzyme, with 100-fold less affinity for I as compared to II.
* Finasteride is a 4-azasteroid analogue of testosterone and is lipophilic.
* Half life: 6 hours
* Bioavailability: 63%
* Protein binding: ~90%


**Dutasteride [7]**

* A 5α-reductase inhibitors, preventing conversion of testosterone into DHT. It is an irreversible inhibitor of all three isoforms of 5α-reductase, types I, II, and III.
* Dutasteride is able to achieve a reduction in circulating DHT levels of as much as 98%, whereas finasteride is only able to achieve a reduction of 65 to 70%.
* In spite of the differential reduction in circulating DHT levels, the two drugs (finasteride and dutasteride) decrease levels of DHT to a similar extent (approximately 85 to 90%) in the prostate gland specifically - where the type II isoform of 5α-reductase predominates.
* In addition to DHT, dutasteride prevents the 5α-reductase-mediated formation of neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone and THDOC, and 3α-androstanediol. These neurosteroids are potent positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor and have been found to possess antidepressant, anxiolytic, and pro-sexual effects in animal research.
* Half Life: 4-5 weeks.
* Bioavailability: 60%
* Protein binding: 99%

**Aromatase Inhibitors and SERMs**
---

**Anastrozole / Arimidex [12]**

* A non-steroidal aromatase-inhibiting drug.
* Anastrozole works by inhibiting the synthesis of estrogen.
* Anastrozole binds reversibly to the aromatase enzyme through competitive inhibition, inhibits the conversion of androgens to estrogens in peripheral tissues (extra-gonadal).
* Some athletes and body builders use anastrozole as part of their steroid cycle to reduce and prevent symptoms of excess estrogen--gynecomastia, emotional lability and water retention.
* Study data suggest dosages of 0.5 mg to 1 mg a day reduce serum estradiol by approximately 50% in men, which differs in postmenopausal women.

**Tamoxifen / Nolva(dex) [13]**

* A selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM) that works both by decreasing factors that increase the growth of breast cells and increasing factors that decrease the growth of breast cells.
* Tamoxifen improves fertility in males with infertility by disinhibiting the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (via ER antagonism) and thereby increasing the secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone and increasing testicular testosterone production.
* Tamoxifen is used to prevent estrogen-related gynecomastia, resulting from elevated estrogenic levels.
* Tamoxifen itself is a prodrug, having relatively little affinity for its target protein, the ER. It is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 into active metabolites which have 30–100 times more affinity with the ER than tamoxifen itself. These active metabolites compete with estrogen in the body for binding to the ER. In breast tissue, acts as an ER antagonist so that transcription of estrogen-responsive genes is inhibited.

**Clomifene Citrate (Clomid) [14]**

* Clomifene inhibits estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, inhibiting negative feedback of estrogen on gonadotropin release, leading to up-regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis.[14] Zuclomifene, a more active isomer, stays bound for longer periods of time. Clomifene is not a steroid drug.
* Clomifene is included on the World Anti-Doping Agency list of illegal doping agents in sport.
* Clomifene is a mixture of two geometric isomers, enclomifene (E-clomifene) and zuclomifene (Z-clomifene). These two isomers have been found to contribute to the mixed estrogenic and anti-estrogenic properties of clomifene.

Ok... that's all for my morning... questions and comments always welcome! Happy Saturday everyone!

"
throwaway34481,asktransgender,Best coming out tips/stories?,"How'd you come out? What were the results? Did any of you have your faith in humanity restored afterwards? What are some of the things you should do, and conversely, things you shouldn't do?"
DysphoricUnicorn,asktransgender,My parents stole the letter from my psychologist and I honestly don't know how to survive the time I have to stay with them,"Two days ago my mom opened a letter, which was adressed to me. It contained the letter stating that I am transsexual and that I should get HRT. I need this letter to be able to get my hormones the legal way. My mom quietly hid the letter after seeing that I was allready asleep (I only pretendet because I didn't feel like talking to her and even though I was at the mail box a couple of times already without finding anything I heard her open a letter and was scared. Last evening she aproached me about it. She told me that I _abuse_ the therapy she got me for depression to get a sex change. Afterwards everything got even worse. My dad started screaming at me, saying it's no coincidence that transsexuality is listed as a psychological disease and that gender is something biological. They pretendet like I didn't have anything female in me at all and just kept yelling at me. When I finally was able to go back into my room I just locked myself in and started to cry in my bed... 

I definitely don't think that I'm ever going to see that letter and I can't live with these kind of people anymore. I'm 18 years old and I should be able to decide what to do and what not to but it feels like they want to control everything in my life and if I didn't have my girlfirend I'd probably have killed myself already.

Is there anything I could do now?

Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for any advice"
fuckmylife333,asktransgender,Obamacare and legal name/gender changes?,"Does anyone know how easy/hard it is to update your information with healthcare.gov? Specifically, I was on an insurance plan through it in 2015, then got insurance through my job. I got all my legal stuff taken care of (name/gender) and now I'm trying to sign up again for Obamacare. 

But, all the records they have attached to me and my social security number are under the completely wrong name (I changed my last name too). I have no idea how to change it and every web search I do just pulls up news articles about SRS and how conservatives are furious that Obamacare covers transition-related health care. Anyone been through this?"
apothanein_thelo,asktransgender,Stopped estrogen a week ago after being on it for 2 weeks. Will the breast buds ever go away?,"Long story short, I was on a low dose of estrogen (1mg per day) for two weeks and then decided to stop because I realised breast growth wasn't for me.

It's now been a week since I stopped, and I still have pea-sized lumps in my chest, and my nipples are still very firm and protrude more than they used to - enough to bump into things.

Is there any hope that these breast buds will diminish with time or will I likely need to have expensive surgery?

Note that I'm still taking a low dose of spironolactone and have no plans to discontinue that. (Yes, I'm aware of the risks of spiro-only HRT)."
ancapnerd,asktransgender,just really want to die,"living seems rather purposeless, I can't really get myself to believe any reasons for living"
AllysaurusRx,asktransgender,Is suicide really that bad?,"Every day when I wake up I just count the seconds until I can go sleep. I have no motivation to do anything. I hate myself both physically and mentally. I don't enjoy anything, the hobbies I used to love I can no longer stand. My friends only make me feel worse so when I'm not working or sleeping all I do is lie in bed and read or sit at home alone and do nothing.

Is it really that wrong to want to go to sleep and never wake up again?"
throwawaydddsssaaa,asktransgender,Can I ever have kids?,"I'm a nonbinary AFAB person. In most of my life, I present as a girl. Unfortunately, even in situations where I present more masculine I still get marked as a girl. I'm not on hormones and haven't done surgery. 

There's still a lot I'm figuring out about my identity, and everything feels like a scary balancing act. I know everyone says you should transition for you and not think about other people but that's just not realistic for me right now. I honestly still don't entirely know what I want. I have an SO who is 100% attracted to women. Even after I came out they stayed with me but I'm worried if I go ""too far"" in one direction we can't be together anymore. I'm also worried that I'll make one statement that will make us incompatible only to find out that it actually wasn't right for me. Does that make sense?

But my biggest concern is kids. Even though it's a long way off, it's something that I keep coming back to. I've always wanted kids. But I've always been scared of the idea of pregnancy and birth. 

Now I have my identity mixed up in this. I'm worried if my identity does end up more male, not only will I no longer have my partner, but I'll also have no one to start a family with. As much as it shouldn't happen, my dating pool will likely shrink, and I might just be asking too much of others. In the event my partner does stay with me, I just don't know how I'll handle pregnancy. It's almost impossible to be androgynous while pregnant. I don't know if I want to go on low dose hormones in the future, but it'll probably affect my fertility, maybe permanently, and I certainly can't take it while pregnant. Not to mention all the fears I have around birth but that's not even related to my identity.

Then I keep wondering, how will I be a parent? How can I have a kid who doesn't technically have a mother? Are they going to be made fun of? Or will I have to throw on a maternal, 100% woman persona while raising them, to ""make things easier for everyone""? Is everyone I know just standing around waiting until I give up on this identity thing? Am I asking for too much out of life? Should I never be a parent?

I keep thinking I should give up on this and let my life play out like it was supposed to. I have a great SO who will be a good dad someday, I have a nicely progressing life since my kinda shitty childhood. But I did that before, and these thoughts and feelings just came back. I don't think I'm repressing anything now, but I am worried about what will happen if I figure myself out and it's not ""convienent"".

Part of me wishes I was infertile. It would make me very sad, but it'd be one less thing to worry over. Who knows, maybe I am, I haven't exactly checked. I actually have a lot of symptoms for PCOS (which I haven't treated. I know it's stupid, but I kinda like having a bit of extra testosterone naturally. Whenever I feel dysphoria I remind myself of that and feel a bit better)"
Magenta-Rose,asktransgender,Does being misgendered ever stop bothering you?,"I'm recently out to my parents. They are outright refusing to use she/her, even though I've asked them to many times. They keep telling me just to get over it, or to not let it bother me, or to just ignore it, but I really can't do that. It bothers me being misgendered, especially by people who I've asked many times to use the right pronouns. 

Does it ever stop bothering you? Can you just ""get over it"" and let it slide. I'm starting hormones soon, so I'm hoping either one of two things will happen. 
Either my mental state improves enough that it doesn't bother me, or when seeing the changes that hormones give, my parents will start to see me as their daughter and gender me correctly. The first one seems more likely"
xJ_Dx,asktransgender,"So.. Gonna start taking real baby steps in my transition. Where should I start? Or we can just talk, idk I just want somewhere to put these thoughts.","Let me describe my current situation, I go to an all male school so that makes me feel pretty terrible, being associated with such a blatantly 'male' facet of the system. It makes me feel like I'll never escape my maleness, but in my right mind I know that isn't true. I've always liked to reassure myself by telling myself that I'm a girl in disguise, and that notion is actually kinda fun to think about!

Also I'm heavily involved with a group of stoner 'boys', from a different school. Like, picture 'the boys' in a highschool environment, that's us, except all we do is smoke weed so we have our own little culture around that. I sometimes feel really uncomfortable being a part of this social group, because they're always pushing masculine norms on me i.e- they one time threatened to punch me in the balls if I didn't hook up with a girl at a concert, among other 'micro-aggressions', if you will. I have expressed my gender fuckery to them, and they do sympathize, but they often get caught up in the cycle of the masculine norm and end up making me uncomfortable. I don't really blame them, they don't know much better, and I still love them and tolerate the weird manly rituals they partake in.

Through this social group I have obviously connected with other groups and people as well, mostly through shared love of partying and weed, but I've sort of been easing into expressing myself to my fullest. Last summer, when I wasn't constricted by my school, I would paint my nails and occasionaly wear a bit of makeup to push my identity without creating too much of an uproar. Everyone knows that I'm a little different from most people, and I've gained a degree of respect for 'doing my own thing' in a sense. Some people don't like it though, on one occassion some kids shouted at me from a car calling me a shemale and saying that I looked like a girl, which only made me feel better than them in the end, hah.

So maybe you have an idea where I'm at socially. People know somethings up but I haven't been pushing my identity hard enough to the point where people see me as female instead of some weird fairy-boy. I want that to change, and I plan on getting some girlfriends together and just girling out with them just to experiment with my feminity a bit deeper. Try clothes, makeup, all that shit. I won't be able to start presenting fully until the summer begins so what should I do to prepare for my REAL coming out?"
bluemagic123,asktransgender,Would coming out on Facebook really harm my chances of getting a job?,"For about a month now, I've been wanting to come out on Facebook, but my parents are completely against the idea. Their reasoning is that there's a tiny chance it will make it really difficult to get a job once I start searching in a year, and that ""rushing through"" things is a bad idea. They say that:

1. If I change my Facebook info, companies will be able to tell I'm transgender from my history. Even with privacy settings they have ways of finding out (apparently there are people they hire to dig into this stuff).

2. Even if I make a separate profile, then companies will still be able to find out through posts my friends make.

3. Even if an employer has nothing against transgender people, they will prefer not to hire me because they don't want to risk the tiny chance of someone abusing their protections.

4. There is no way to prove that I didn't get a job just because I'm transgender.

5. I'm being naive by thinking that a company will be more likely to hire me if they somehow find out I'm transgender.

And the frustrating this is, there is no way I can argue against them because my dad and aunt actually hire other people.

I personally think they're being ridiculous worrying about such a tiny probability, especially since they acknowledge the chance is so small and since we live in California. They've been really supportive so far, and I don't want to post without their consent to avoid risking getting on their bad side. But at the same time, I really want to post in order to fend off my dysphoria.

Do any of you have any insight into this? I'm getting pretty anxious just doing nothing about this :/"
Marscreature,asktransgender,Am I an awful bitch?,"My mom won't use my name or pronouns... She made me feel like shit again today: http://m.imgur.com/a/bKQC6

Shes deadnaming and misgendering me in public. I'm full time I can't have that, I can't stand to hear it ��

QCAlexis,asktransgender,Is it possible to go on HRT long-term and still successfully remain closeted?,"Transitioning isn't an option for me. I was planning on killing myself after seeing my family one last time over the holidays, but I'm contemplating trying HRT to see if it will improve my mental health.

I don't want to socially transition. I don't want anyone to know that I'm trans. Its a secret I want to take to the grave with me.

I want to hear experiences from people who have been on HRT for at least a few years but still successfully present as male in their day-to-day lives, with their associates and acquaintances none the wiser."
-Jen-,asktransgender,Progesterone: Your Experiences? Yay or Nay?,"I was just wondering if anybody had any anecdotal evidence based off of taking progesterone. Preferably micronised?

Its obviously still a hot topic without any concrete evidence to suggest its beneficial in the treatment of trans women.

Is there anyone who has experienced estrogen alone compared with E+P long enough to be able to come to a conclusion as to whether it has worked better? That would would really be useful.

I hear so many conflicting theories on P. Some say it increases estrogen sensitivity, others say it blunts or helps suppress it.

Then theres talk of cycling or not to mimic female periods.

I have read through countless scholarly articles but I guess peoples experiences would be much more useful to me and others in coming to some conclusion as to what it actually did, physically to them?

I am currently taking Prometrium 100mg (for one week so far) and unsure whether to continue.

My own reasons for taking would be to slightly increase weight and fat redistribution."
[deleted],asktransgender,I live in a place where being a non-passing trans woman isn't really a viable option. What should I do?,"I live in a reasonably big city where HRT is essentially free and gatekeeping is a thing of the past, but other than that, everyday attitudes towards trans women are pretty backwards. I've been on HRT for 7 months and living full-time for a couple of months longer than that, and the constant barrage of stares, misgendering, slurs and the occasional fistfight has got to me. Right now I feel ashamed of my face and most of the time I don't even want to leave the house.  
Do you have any advice on what I should do? I'm considering staying on HRT and presenting femme to my close friends but otherwise socially detransitioning until my body becomes acceptable enough for society at large, or at least until I'm done with laser and I don't need that much makeup. However, I'm also beginning to realise that point will probably never come, plus facial surgery is out of my reach and will continue to be (presumably forever - I can barely pay rent as it is). Moving is not an option as I'm still not done with my degree, I couldn't afford it and anyway I already live in the biggest, most important and most progressive city in a radius of maybe 1000 miles.  
Do you have any advice on how to cope, either with keeping as is or with being forced to pretend I'm a guy (in front of maybe 40 people who already know I'm trans and know me by my girl name, etc?)"
xDreamsleep,asktransgender,How was everyone's holiday? Also some other things.,"I would like to say a few things in this post. First as the title says how was your holiday this year? I hope it went as well as mine but I know for some it wasn't as pleasant. 

To share my father had this made for me: http://imgur.com/lscOqlV

I've only been on HRT for just under 2 months so this is huge for me. It got me thinking though for the ones that don't have such accepting families. I'm thinking of doing some kind of dinner somewhere next year in the Nashville area next year on Christmas Eve if possible for everyone who has no where to go. I can't really give too many details since it's just an idea but am just kind of throwing the idea out there to see what response I get. 

It should be possible to rent some kind of wreck center or something and have a catering service etc. on Xmas Eve. Please throw ideas out there even if you are not from this area. I just want to be able to give back to the community next holiday season just as so many of you have. It's the least I can do with all of the great advice and support I've gotten from here."
SleepNowMyThrowaway,asktransgender,What makes your state a trans haven or hell?,"Planning on a move next year and juggling many factors - how do you find your state as far as trans protections, insurance and other factors?"
Boob-a-saurus-Rex,asktransgender,Anyone with Kaiser Norcal know how soon I can schedule surgeries?,"So I just enrolled with Kaiser Norcal, and I guess it starts Jan. 1

Does anyone know what the process for them to approve you for surgeries such as orchie. ffs. And srs? 

Since I am going in already on hormones for 10 months. With  legal gender change possibly completed by then. "
CuriousAnConfusedSam,asktransgender,"Sorta new to the trans side of the world, where do I fit? (Plus some back story; Text Wall, be warned)","Hello r/asktransgender, I'm Sam.

This post is sort of a 3 parter. First, I'm going to give a bit of background on myself to give an idea of my life and how that may effect my question at the end of the post. Then, my experiences with the trans part of society. Finally, I have a bit of a question.

This will be long winded. I apologize for that. It isn't necessary to read the first section, but I would greatly appreciate it, as I feel it would improve the quality of any answers.

A bit of a note, I'm still not fully versed on the appropriate and factual language and mannerisms of the trans community. With that said, I apologize for any incorrect assumptions/statements/words. I'm giving this preface because I'm truly curious, I wish to potentially immerse myself in this community, and I'd like to absolutely solve any previous misconceptions and/or harmful opinions that I had/may still have. I have a true intent to find some answers and hopefully make myself a better person.


I'm a 19 year old Male, through and through. I have a penis, and have lived my life as the traditional image of a male (for the most part). I was born and have lived in Saginaw, Texas damn near my entire life. My family is that of a typical Texan family. Baptist Christian, very Republican, and not incredibly accepting of more progressive ideas. With that said, they're caring, loving, and amazing people. My grandparents are traditional in such a way that makes them not understand more modern ideas of psychology and science. Neither of them have responded kindly to any news they receive on the side of almost any LGBT. They still haven't stopped talking about Caitlyn Jenner. However, they have recently become much more open and receptive of the homosexual community. They still believe it's against the word of god, but they accept that people are people, and we shouldn't condemn them for it. The reason for this transition lies in my 17 year old brother. While he himself is not homosexual (as far as I know; he is in a wonderful 2 year relationship right now with an amazing girl), the vast majority of his close friends are. As my grandparents meet some of these friends, they have become much more tolerant and accepting. My dad is much more accepting and open, but is still pretty christian. My mom is an oddball. She's very passively Christian and is more inline with my way of thinking. Let people live their lives and be happy. With this, however, she has her own plethora of issues that stem from a family tragedy.

Back in 2007, when I was in 4th grade in elementary, my 3 year old brother was diagnosed with brain cancer. He got treatment, surgery, and a lot of love. He was seemingly okay after the surgery and was given the opportunity to take a Make-A-Wish trip to Disney World. The day we set out to Disney, he started to have multiple silent seizures. As soon as we touched down in Orlando, he was taken to a hospital. I wasn't told until just a year or two ago, but they learned he had relapsed on the first day of that trip. The cancer was then in multiple parts of his body, and it was terminal. On January 19th, 2008, he passed away while in a coma.

My family had a lot of issues from then on. Everyone gradually grew more and more depressed, mentally unstable, or both. For a good year, I, myself, was practically a nut case. Young me rationalized that it was my job as the oldest sibling to protect my younger siblings, and thus I blamed myself in some fashion. I'm not sure if I've just majorly suppressed it (that's generally what I unfortunately do with my emotions), or if I've moved past it, but I don't even think about the whole ordeal most days. However, I still can't bring myself to visit his grave (which is why I almost think I'm suppressing it).

My mother has probably been hit the hardest. She has been on multiple anti-anxiety, anti-depressants, and has visited a lot of grief counselors in the last 8 years. In more recent years, she and my father have divorced and she moved to another state. I'm unsure if it's because she needs to re-evaluate or if she's done it because she feels guilt and thinks she's harming the rest of us more than helping.

My father felt worthless as a parent until very recently, when he helped me get through one of the roughest patches in my life so far. I've held his hand and hugged him while he sobbed during some of his worst days. He helped me get out of a depressive state and finish my high school classes.

My 17 year old brother hit the depressed teenager phase hard. He self harmed and hated himself for several years until about the point when he met his current lady friend.

My 12 year old brother doesn't remember much (as he was 2 during 2007), but he's grown up in a world where his older brother died and he was the fill-in. He was always shown love and support, but never a tough hand. He was never taught how to work hard or how to deal with conflict. Then, our mom moved to another state entirely. Now, my other brother, my dad, and myself are trying our best to help him. He is still confused and falls short here and there, but he's improved a lot and is learning how to be self-sufficient.

Long story short, brother died, family went crazy, mom and dad were too busy trying to piece their heads together to properly raise us (which was more a story of self hatred than lack of love for us). I don't blame them in any way. I love them both, and would honestly say they are both my heroes in their own way. My dad is perseverance and still kicks my ass when I show intolerance, ignorance, or disrespect. My mom shows that despite all the shit, there is still love in the world. Even with the possible guilt, she manages to contact us and speak to my brothers and I daily. 

Are you still awake? ;) I'm sorry for all the text. 

Now we come to more recent times. Started back in my freshman year of High School.

I don't mean to brag, but I'd consider myself above average when it comes to intelligence. At least now, anyway. Through middle school, I managed to pass classes simply by getting A's on any and every test I did. I have never come close to getting anything less than high scores on state testing. 

However, due to lack of discipline and my own laziness, I was never pressed to do any schoolwork that wasn't a test/group project.

It became habit.

When I hit High School, I wasn't ready. For 3-4 years, I went through a constant cycle of beating myself up.

It started by me believing I was fully capable of getting straight A's in the High School setting. Then, I would get homework and ""forget"" to do it. Eventually, I would get so far behind, I would ""realize"" it would just be easier and more efficient to wait for the grading period to end and then get a fresh start. I would wait, and then never bother to actually start doing work in the new grading period. And repeat. As the cycles started to rack up, I started to loathe myself. I began to believe I wasn't intelligent or worth much. This feeling just grew and grew until I got to the final weeks before my Junior year started. I cracked and let a lot of suppressed emotion out. While on a phone call with my dad about groceries or something, I snapped and began crying. He talked to me for 30 minutes on the phone. I just tried to explain over and over that I didn't believe I was worth much and that despite everything I had believed up until High School, I wasn't smart. Over the course of the next couple of months I did the worst I'd ever done in school, which put me in an even worse position. I eventually dropped out to do home schooling, which is where the real crap began.

About a month after I dropped out, my mom and dad told me that they were splitting up. A month after THAT, my mom told us she was moving away. Over the course of the next year, I didn't bother doing any classes or really anything other than playing games all day. Eventually, even gaming got stale.

Now, with all this, I also had an eating problem. I went from 170 to 280 in 4 years. I would just sit infront of a computer and eat all day. Nothing else.

Now, eventually, my dad decided he wasn't having it, and forced me to return to school under the pretext that I would, after a month, be transferred to an Alternative learning center. Otherwise, I would have needed to suffer through another 2 years of school, essentially putting me behind a year. I'd still be a highschooler.

I started back at school and pushed myself harder than ever. I managed to push out an even average of about 94 in every class while I was still in the normal high school. I cried the day I saw I could pull off straight A in the gradebook. No lies, I had to stop and take a minute. It was the best I felt about myself in years. I went on to the other school and managed to finish all of my junior and senior classes in about 5 months (the school was entirely self paced; the teachers were more like baby sitters), and got a 96 average for those two years. I graduated High School in March of 2016.

After I graduated, I went into another stupor. I didn't know how to procede. My family didn't have the money for college, so I didn't have a lot of choices. Through a lot of more laziness and lack of will, I went until about April until my family forced me to find a job. My first two jobs were shitshows, both of which I was pressured into. A family friend recommended me for a job at a 60 hour a week (10 hours a day, Monday-Saturday) place cleaning semi trucks. With no work experience, ethic, or motivation, I was fired on the second day for not being quick enough (was told a job should have taken 2 hours and I took about 7). My second job was 10 hours straight making 1 minute omelettes. With almost no experience, I was quickly overwhelmed and due to my own issues, I personally quit. 

This is where the latest biggest figure in my life is introduced.

My dad works in a machine shop that repairs large industrial grade shredders for a very close family friend. We'll call the guy Larry. He's an old helicoptor pilot with the mouth and belief system of a priest that part times as a sailor and a drill sergeant. He's upfront, loud, in your face, and VERY dedicated to his beliefs. At the same time though, he is one of the most caring people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. He would kick your ass 18 different ways to help you realize a mistake.

He forced me to visit the shop one day. In 20 minutes of crying and talking with him, he realized a large issue that a lot of others didn't. He quickly realized I had little to no self esteem. He gave me two choices. Work for him and learn how to work and be proud of my work, or don't. Over the next 7 months, he kicked my ass, made me cry, made me laugh, and gradually made me improve.

Small Edit:Due to the nature of the job, I also got a lot of exercise and have lost about 50 pounds. I need to lose about another 60 to be in a decent spot, but I'm getting close.

Here I am now. I found my own job, drove myself to the interview, did all the paperwork myself, and have worked hard since I got the job 3 weeks ago. I have more self esteem than ever. So, we come to now and what this post is really about.

In all of this, I've never been in an actual relationship, and in addition, I've never had sex.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's the second part of this post, finally. Thanks for listening so far.

So, my experience with the trans community is long and complicated.




The way I've always viewed things is simple. We're all humans. To me, what a person identifies as, or is biologically, doesn't really matter. If I'm attracted to a person, I'm attracted. Statistically speaking, I've never found a biological male attractive sexually. I know a good looking dude when I see one, but seeing a penis is an instant turn off for me.

So, the question of sexuality has always been weird for me. I find biological women to be wholly attractive sexually. Eyes, noses, hair, faces, bodies. Whatever. Biological males, though? I wouldn't rule out a relationship with one, but I cannot see myself ever being in one.

This is a double edged sword, though. I actually almost lost a friend due to being passive towards someone that identified as a male. We'll call this friend Stacy pre-trans, and Jacob post. I had known Stacy for years. She was someone I knew well. After my stint out of school, I came back to Stacy now preferring Jacob. I, without being considerate, pulled a logical argument out of my ass and was fairly disrespectful and completely disregarded Jacob's choice for a long time. I did eventually apologize, but more out of guilt for the disrespect than acceptance.

Until fairly recently, I honestly wasn't aware of just how many people legitimately have psychological conditions (in relation to their sex) that stop them from enjoying their life. I ignorantly believed there were more extremely left crazies that wanted attention than people who just wanted to be happy. I can't say I have directly interacted with any trans people (aside from Jacob) that I showed my ignorant side to. However, I have made my share of jokes. 

I explored this sub for a couple of days before deciding to make this post. In that, I have seen the amount of disdain towards the Apache Attack Helicopter copypasta, or anything of that degree. I would have to say I still have a bit of reservation on that side of things, though. It may just be ignorance, but I'm conflicted. On one side, I believe that the moment a topic becomes offlimits to any sort of joke, we have failed as a society; I do fully believe that a joke can be taken way too far, but that doesn't mean we should just avoid making the joke. Living in fear is stupid. I do, at the end of the day, realize that jokes can severely discourage the confused and lost. I'm conflicted because a joke taken too far could lead to a lot of young trans people to continue to suppress their feelings, but without the option to make small jokes, we lose a large part of what makes the topic something that can be discussed.

With all of that said, I'd like to apologize. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now here's the last part.

With all of this research and thinking, I have steadily recalled more and more occasions where I, myself, yearned to be a female rather than a male. It wasn't sudden, just repressed. 

Now, here's my confusion.

It's not a serious conflict or condition. I don't believe I have ever felt gender dysphoria to the point that I was truly miserable for more than a few hours. These occasions are very random and generally happen when I'm feeling down. Now, it isn't every time I'm down in the dumps. It's just that I generally never feel it without also feeling a bit depressed.

Lately, however, it's been happening more often. 

This is part of the reason I've been looking into and studying trans society and this subreddit in particular.

Psychologically speaking, could this feelings be born from a complete lack of sexual interaction, or just a lack of social interaction in general? As I said, I am 19 with no relationship or sexual experience. In the past 7 months, I really haven't had much interaction with anyone other than coworkers (have all been male), family, and people in my gaming community (all male).

Could this simply just be the result of my yearn to have a partner, or it is possible that it goes past that?

I would say, though, that if you gave me a button that would instantly turn me into a female, I would press it.

Thanks for reading all of this, and thanks to anyone that can help me make light of things."

I've been on hormones for 7 months and I feel more unhappy and uncomfortable with myself than I did before I started hormones.

Lofavreel,asktransgender,What makes a face feminine?,"Hay folks,

I had some free time today and came up with the idea, to idealize my face. What I did, was taking a picture of me totally ungroomed and photoshopping it to feminine appearence. That was fun and challenging;

The big question was: ""How can I make my face feminine?""

From my knowledge about FFS, I knew about some features:

* Round hairline
* Smaller Nose
* Somewhat round forehead
* Smaller chin
* (Shorter distance between nose and mouth)
* (Bigger lips) 

Manipulating the mouth looked always ..wrong.. , so I stopped trying.. 

But I feel like I'm missing something;

http://iob.imgur.com/uYGg/WqwGuAXhLy

I know that I produced an unrealistic picture out of the original. But the goal was an ideal, so thats no big deal.
And this is not about makeup or beauty. Just feminization.

The question I have is: What would feminize this ideal picture of me even more?

PS: I know it's not that clever to dream about such ideals... but if you don't mind, please let me know how feminine the picture feels to you!"
Girlydian,asktransgender,"Could use a little help, I guess...","Let me start of by saying that I've been wishing to be a girl for ages now (so that would make a MtF transgender), but I've only been talking about it for a little over a year with my therapist in semi-regular sessions. I haven't seen her since the beginning of October, my next session will be in a little under a week.

I've first gone out as a girl in September, and loved every second of it after the feelings of ""oh my god what am I doing everyone is looking at me and must think I'm crazy"" wore of after the first two hours or so. That was a very big step and I may not have been quite ready for it :') Fast forward a couple of months to December and I've started to accept that there is a very big chance of me being really trans and this has had a massive impact. I can't seem to think straight anymore, when I get home from work there is nothing I really want to anymore but go watch some mindless TV.

I don't really mind being trans I guess, I have a couple of friends who are too - including one who actually figured it out after talking with me and she's now way ahead in presenting as female :'). On the other hand, I'm damn scared about all this change and really have no idea what this is going to mean for the future and how I'm going to end up etc. All this thinking might have an origin in my Aspergers, though that is only a ""probable diagnosis"" (I hate not knowing the correct words). That part did fill in a lot of the blanks I had that time, so I have accepted that part as truth.

Add to that the fact that I always thought I was attracted to woman, but am now also starting to develop attraction to a few handsome men. I'm so confused! I really have no idea where this all is going and what's going to happen and that's freaking me out.

I know that none of you will actually know how this is going to turn out, and I'm not expecting that. I'm just really wondering what kind of stuff helped you figure out what was going on and helped you come to terms with it.

TL;DR - Done a lot of thinking in the past month or so and it's really freaking me out. Any tips to help deal with it are very much welcome."

catherinedevlin,asktransgender,Role modeling? ergh,"I put my name in code.org as a potential volunteer to help schoolteachers introduce their students to the awesomesauce that is computer programming.  I got a request from a teacher who said, among other things,

&gt; I love when I can introduce them to women in the field as we are usually working with men and I have been really working on getting girls involved in computers. At this age they tend to pass it off as something that they can't be good at or boys won't like them. 

So.

Let me say first up that I do indeed consider myself a woman in the field, and thbbbbpt to anybody who says otherwise.  I'm here, living that life, have been since before these students were born.  (And I've had the experiences, like being asked if I was at a software conference because of my boyfriend.  A conference *that I founded.*)

But I feel awkward about what the girls themselves will think; if they'll dismiss me as irrelevant; worse, if they'll think you can only be a woman in software if you don't start that way.  Yes, my career shows you don't have to give in and write software off as a boy's club.  But will they see it that way?

On the other hand, trans and gendery kids are people, too, and they deserve to see people like them just as much as anybody else does.  

I'm not sure what to tell this teacher.  I'm a little tempted to make an excuse and bow out, but that feels like letting the bad guys win.  Or I could give her a chance to bow out, but I'd want to explain that I'd accept that... without legitimizing the notion that my womanhood doesn't count.  How do you do that?

SelfLoving91,asktransgender,The ideal body type...? Just how rare is it?,"So this one's a bit of realization, recently one of my friends who's been reviewing my transition and how HRT + my exercise routine has GREATLY changed my body.

I was told that if my waist were 5 inches smaller(I have excess and stubborn fat from when I was pretending to be a guy down there) I'd be an hourglass shape. My hips and my bust are proportionate to one another. Granted I used to not really have hips at all, they expanded a few inches since my last measurement, same with my bust obviously well.. except the expand..

So my question is this, just how rare is it for AMAB to have a hourglass body shape and for the guys, AFAB to have inverted triangle body shapes?

AitherInfinity,asktransgender,Question about testing for hormone levels.,"So long story short;

I've been having problems with my endocrinologist, to list them:

* She won't give me a letter for name/gender marker change, or for a passport gender change citing ""surgery required"".

* She's uncomfortable with my GP testing my hormone levels (after they hadn't been tested in 3 months), which I guess can be understandable but struck me as odd.

* She was surprised that I already had my letter from my therapist and was ready to go for HRT

* She does not want any other doctors involved in my Transition.

* She had her lab test my blood, for some reason they forgot (?!?!?!?!) to test for E levels and she didn't want to bother having me come in to give more blood for a test (Then I would go 6 months without E levels, maybe more)

* The final straw: Her office is sending me $700+ bills per visit (which I'm not paying), and not submitting claims to my insurance at all.

* She wants to get my T levels to 0 (from 55), which I'm told is bad

I'm pretty much done with her at this point as my GP is perfectly happy testing my hormone levels and giving me HRT, and doesn't jerk me around and be really shady.

My last T level was 55 ng/dL, E (on patches, I'm on pills now) was 297.5 pg/mL

I know my T levels are good, I think. I was wondering what the range of Estrogen I wanna shoot for is? My GP is not experienced in transgender HRT/treatment, but if I know the numbers I need I'd rather go with her. I'm pretty sure my levels should be equal to what an average cis females levels should be, non-period levels that is.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: bonus question; My boobs are itchy af, I'm supposed to itch them correct?

EDIT2: My intent is to ditch my endo, thats why I need to know what my levels should be, which was the point of this post :P. Also my name change lawyer already recommended I ditch her and asked for her name so she doesn't refer trans clients there."

amon_erin,asktransgender,One more question before I go,"Okay, so I've been struggling greatly lately with everything. I've decided I need a break from the trans subs. I want to help everyone I can, because I always put the needs of others ahead of my own. I feel like I need to take a break, though, because all of my insecurities and doubts get amplified. 

Right now the physical dysphoria isn't terrible. It comes and goes, often throughout the day. Mentally I don't feel terrible right now. But that comes and goes throughout the day.

My highs are pretty good, but I've gone to the complete extreme like tonight where I was having thoughts of self harm because I had this thought in my head that I couldn't get rid of that I was a boy and had to stop. Right now, I don't think I want that. And most of the time that's the feeling. And when I feel like giving up I look for any sliver of hope to continue on.  I'm just stressed out from work and transition. I've heard some say that a cis person who tried to transition would be stressed out from it. Which makes me worry that I am cis. But I've also heard from other trans people that they're stressed out about their transition as well. I'll take it as a YMMV.

Everything I've felt tells me that I'm probably trans. Tuesday was my 3 month HRT anniversary and I like all of the physical changes I've had thus far, except for the weight gain. But that's easily corrected with diet and exercise. I mean, a cis male probably wouldn't like the breasts or enlargement of the nipples to a more female appearance.

So I guess my question is this, for those that didn't always know they were definitely trans, how long did it take before you stopped doubting yourself very day and morning when you wake up? And then just in general. And how long before you finally started to feel like you were actually the gender (or lack thereof) you transitioned to?

I know I'm moving to a new identity and it's going take a while, but I need some advice on how to bide my time until I get there. I just don't want to go back to male. Or stop HRT.

I've got to take some time away to get my anxiety and doubts straightened out. You're all great people, and I will be back! Of course, I'll be coming back to see if anyone replies to this. But I need to fix some things about myself before I help others. I hate doing that, though.

Edit: I guess anyone can really answer this."

tao-nui,asktransgender,"dad is trans, took me 6 years to realize that I was trans myself. wth?","Hi there

My adab (assigned dad at birth) got srs 2 years ago. When I was 17 I tried to understand her awakening but didn't really. For me it was ""out of the blue"", I couldn't forget my dad, a very rough man with no sense of grace, and clumsiest person I knew about appropriate behavior. Yet I tried to understand her and (here's the dumb part) I went online and watched transition timelines on YouTube. I remember being amazed at minorqback and I *showed it to my dad*. Yeah. At the time I just thought ""this is courageous but odd"" , I couldn't understand why someone, would transition since ""it's fake. They are still male"" and I felt like nothing could ever bring someone to the other side. I didn't know srs and I thought they just became a sterilized version of a male. All those things were so impregnated in my subjective truth that I never ever felt attraction for transition, even tho I was fascinated by the changes.

Yet I was called gay all the time. I daydreamt of being a girl when I was a kid. Something was off but I didn't have a clue what. Things appeared so fatal about my gender that I never considered questioning it for real.

My dad moved away from my family to better transition and I felt abandoned. I was angry because I didn't understand why he left, and because he literally disappeared from our lives, letting my mom with two children and my very expensive degree to come. I didn't know how hard it would have been to stay in Reunion Island (French territory, 1M people, a lot more traditional and conservative than France), so I blamed him. We didn't talk for almost 4 years.

Years passed by, I went to college and at 23 after a little bit of emotional rumble and questioning I came the the realization that I was in fact, trans myself.

___

I'm sitting here wondering what is going on with me. Writing this made things a little bit clearer but sometimes because of all of this, I'm really wondering why this is so sudden. Why didn't I click earlier? My dad announcing her transidentity, coupled by my ""researches"" should have put me on the track I am today but it didn't. And it somehow still holds me back a little from jumping with FAITH toward what seems to be the real me. The cute loving girl I always dreamt to be deep inside, hidden somewhere, and beat down by the shame that society laid on me for feeling different. Covered by a masculine character that helped me fight, no matter that I took the wrong direction.

Am I alone? I just want to hear that I am trans like an unquestionable truth. That all this early experiencing of experimenting the other side of the other gender and me loving all of this is genuine. That I am in the right direction no matter how far I go.

I take a time to thank you for being part of all of this. No matter where all of this goes for me, I feel like I have a family here. I'll stick around no matter what because you are worth it.

Napstablooregard,asktransgender,Long-term alternatives to HRT?,"I'm sure this question has already been asked before, but I thought I'd ask again to maybe find some more specifics for my situation (MTF).

As time goes on, dysphoria hasn't gotten better. It waxes and wanes, but never disappears completely, and the overall intensity creeps ever higher. I've dealt with it as long as I can remember, but it wasn't until this last year that I really recognized it for what it was. I've been seeing a therapist, and so far they have helped me to recognize that this is real and that dealing with it is better than ignoring it. My wife is aware of my dysphoria as well, and she's okay with small things like dressing in private or wearing makeup. But when it comes to HRT and transitioning, both of us are afraid it could tear us apart.

Part of me wants to transition. I want a feminine figure and face. I want boobs. I want wider hips. I want to feel right and happy in my skin. However, the other part of me wants to stay with my wife. I absolutely adore her. She means the world to me and I want to fight to keep her. HRT is a choice, and I don't want to choose something that could cost me what I cherish most.

To find a happy middle ground, are there any long-term ways of coping/minimizing dysphoria without transitioning? For anyone who has NOT transitioned, what do you do to help you feel happy with yourself? If there's an option that could satisfy both criteria, or even a healthy compromise, I'd take it in a heartbeat."

(no insurance involved),"Lets say a random MtF person in all out guy-mode walks into one of the big US FFS places like dr.Spiegel's, D-B's etc but doesnt have any official papers about his transness, (perhaps he is on diy HRT or pre-everything) and so all he brings is his trans story to tell, perhaps some images/vids to back it up and lot of cash to pay everything by himself (not insured).

Will he get smoothly processed? (for this case, lets assume the requested ffs procedures are ok to perform regardless of prior HRT time spent)

tharjaa,asktransgender,"(MtF) Having terrible Insomnia from HRT, any suggestions?","Its horrible, and I feel like a mess.. I can only manage to sleep for 3, if I'm lucky 4, hours at a time, when I first fall asleep at night.. I am worried about my mental health, feels like I am slowly losing my mind.. And also I worry about how the lack of sleep will impact the efficacy of my transition.

I go to bed around 12, fall asleep within the hour, and then wake up around 4, and sometimes I am able to fall back asleep, but sometimes I am completely unable to, this morning I just stayed in bed for a couple of hours, but couldn't get anywhere with it, and then felt really anxious and just browsed internet on my phone for an hour, then got up out of bed because it seemed impossible to fall asleep, and made my breakfast and ate. Then I was able to calm down a bit, and I was able to fall back asleep around 8, and slept till 11..

The other big problem I am having with sleep is that I seem to be dreaming waaay too much, and the dreams are always vivid, and to some extent lucid, and quite often slightly disturbing, to full on nightmarish, and I can't seem to get past the dreaming phase, and into a deep sleep most of the time.. 

Atleast, for the first 3-4 hours of sleep, I am able to get restful sleep, but after that, if I fall asleep I'm almost always just in a dream state and fluctuating between that and in a half awake state or hypnagogic state where I am sometimes opening my eyes and seeing disturbing shit in my room. It feels like I have hours of dreaming, and its really really taxing on my brain and I wake up feeling totally mentally exhausted, and confused, and anxiety goes through the roof.

This all started after a few weeks on HRT, although before HRT I wasn't getting ideal sleep either. But it was much better, I could get around 6 hours of sleep, and sleep all the way through the night with no interruptions.

I think this is not so rare with MtF? Anyone else dealing with this, and what has helped you? Is it something that should get better on its own as my body and mind adjust to the new hormones? 

I'm gonna try progesterone because I've heard good things around helping with sleep.

Also the usual solutions I've read about that work for a lot of people with insomnia seem to be doing more harm than good, things like taking magnesium supplements, and melatonin.. Instead they just make my dreams even more insane, causing more interruptions &gt;.&lt;

testacc125,asktransgender,Awkwardness with family,"Hello all. I want some advice on an issue if anyone doesn't mind. So, when I'm not at college (e.g. during forced breaks where the college shuts down like the next month for Christmas break), I live with my grandmother. She's a Christian Trump voter who I've attempted to let into my life about my gender issues before. She insists that it's some ridiculous bullshit like Satan inside me, that I'll be an abomination, that she doesn't know who I am and can't love me, etc.

I am an overly empathetic person and am too lenient generally. I was thinking about writing her a letter and giving it to her after the month is over, when I'm safely back at college, and tell her to read it when she finishes the drive home. It'd basically say that since beginning transition and accepting my issues, I'm not only more happier, but no longer suicidal and generally much more self-actualized.

She never even believed I was depressed though. When she saw the scars I gave myself years ago she didn't even feel any empathy, just ""why would you do that to the body God gave you?""

I can't tell if I'm more fucked in the head or she is. I know she wants to love me, and I want to love her, but she needs to get over her beliefs. She's like almost 70 though. I know she wants to be my mother but a mother should love and support unconditionally, and if I have to be a boy to earn her love, I'm willing to cut her out of my life.

The main issue is I'm not the best at adulting and I still rely on her financially somewhat, and she could potentially interfere with my medical insurance or my education.

Last time on the ride back to college she tried to bring up my trip to Chicago where I went to the informed consent clinic. This seems to imply she's aware of my actions. I avoided the subject entirely with some subtle diversion.

I'm just confused and sad. Sad that I don't, and have never had, a loving parent to support me. It's always been just me, alone and in my own head, trying to work this stuff out. Maybe I would've turned out differently if I had had people there for me. I dunno.

Any advice? I can hide the meds from her adequately enough, but she'll eventually notice the changes anyway."

15122016,asktransgender,"I get annoyed when my dysphoria gets better (sounds weird, I know)","So sometimes I feel quite dysphoric, and can change really quickly.


I hate the fact I was born a boy. Like, to the point where I feel like I'm not going to be here in a few years if I don't do anything about it. I don't feel male that much. I just don't seem to fit in with being a guy. I don't know why, it just doesn't feel right. 

I do get dysphoria. I call it dysphoria, but I am not sure if it is just me questioning, if I am just stupid, or what. I honestly have no idea. But it just makes me angry.


Other times, often when I am at college, my dypshoria gets quite a bit better. It creates a lot of denial, which I FUCKING HATE. I hate it when my dypsohira goes down. I hate it. It makes me think that I might not be trans, I am making this up in my head, and it annoys the hell out of me.


If there were two pills. The blue pill would make me cis male, and the red pill would make me 'more' trans, to the point where I can transition without regrets, I'd take the red pill any day. I don't want to be male.  I feel like if I do transition, I'll regret it, but if I don't transition I'll regret it. I don't know what to do.



I've read the null hypothecis and that was dysphoria multiple times. I relate to ""that was dypshoria"" a lot more. But still, doesn't quite relate to me 100%.

madmarmalade,asktransgender,"Losing trust in allies ""You'll never be a convincing woman.""","I recently had to take refuge with my sister and her family due to depression and a looming threat of homelessness. Nominally she's always been supportive, using my name and pronouns correctly from the very beginning. However, during my stay with them they seem to have come to the conclusion that my depression is stemming from my gender (it's not; it's from losing my job, my home, and my car in the space of a month.) So my sister took me aside and gave me a long lecture about how gender doesn't matter, and how I need to stop getting offended and depressed whenever I get misgendered. Which I don't, I usually just brush it off cause I've got other things going on in my mind constantly. But her husband decided to try to give me a pep talk too, and said ""You will never be a convincing woman, but you can be a strong, feminine-spirited person."" 
The thing is I do know they're wrong. Gender is immensely important on a personal and political level to both cis and trans people. Additionally, my dysphoria is at a level where I fully think of myself as a woman, just with some additional body hair to manage, and I pass to about 80℅ of people I interact with. He's basing his statement off of how he used to know me, as well as my voice not being where it normally is due to a cold. 
Anyway, it's just been really disappointing because I had so much love and respect for them, but now I feel like I can't trust them any more. This is on top of really inappropriate things they said about my depression, saying it's a disease, not an excuse, and not taking my suicidal ideation seriously."
Questioning_Queer,asktransgender,Is there a name for someone whose gender more or less correlates with the gender they were assigned at birth but feels like their body is not the gender it was assigned?,"Hi there, I'm a confused mess and I was wondering if I could get some feedback. So I'm afab but pretty much my whole life I've been uncomfortable in my skin. As a kid I was always a ""tomboy"" and in high school I had some acute but brief bouts of gender dysphoria that made me feel great comfort in the idea of gender fluidity. Since then, the way I experience gender-related discomfort has gotten much less physical (and as such I have come to question the validity of my previous more clearly non-binary alignment), but I am still consistently uncomfortable in my body. This has led me to consider different gender identities that might apply to me (genderfluid, demigirl, demiboy, ciswoman, agender) but none of them feel quite right. Is it possible that the source of my discomfort lies in, despite having a more or less female-aligned gender identity, feeling like my body is not a female body? I don't if it makes sense but like, I look in the mirror and I have a deep, uncomfortable feeling that my body is that of a man's. Not so much that there are specific aspects of my body that are ""masculine"", although I think this is true to some extent, but that my body just feels like it belongs to a male-identified person. Does this make any sense? Is this something that exists outside of just my head? Is this internalized transphobia? I don't know and any insight would be really appreciated. 

Sorry if this is at all offensive to anyone or the incorrect place to ask this question, I certainly don't mean to marginalize or otherwise dismiss other people's identities. "

Makeup and Hair
Some people, trans or not , seem to over-apply makeup. Would like to still have some makeup in  incognito boy mode.(Painted toenails with closed toed shoes has been suggested) What are some thing I could do?In girl mode ,What do you look for? What are your favorite brands and techniques( never really used it fully.)? I would love  to accentuate my eyes (lashes ,shadow,etc.) without overuse and looking painted. How much makeup overall do you need to start,(it being very expensive)? Would like to color my dirty blonde hair , nothing too crazy yet, maybe a lighter shade. (though my heart cries for purple (: ) but I don't want to damage it too much . Also growing it out. How do you care for longer hair and what's your favorite styles (both short and long)? I might go for a ""shorter"" style and see where it leads( though girl short is a little longer than what I have now). 
Jewelry and Clothing
Jewelry is easy. How to accessorize/Favorite accessories. Clothing is where it's hard for me. I would rather online however still love shopping in general when I get the chance. It's finding my fit in girl clothes and shoes. Maybe I should get over myself but getting into the fitting room is super stressful, still being a guy to the world. Also panties,in my experience, are usually uncomfortable ( due to men's hardware) There is boy-cut. Is it any more comfy and can it be cute? Underwear and socks seem perfect for boy mode when I have to. (x-posted on MtF)

Starting around two months ago my desire for any kind of intimate relationship has drastically increased and is only getting stronger. It's not a want anymore, it's a need. This is the first time I can remember feeling this way and it kinda sucks. At the same time it's fun to experience new things like this. Things that could drive me to make my life better.

She says that I'm ""not sure of myself"" because my girlfriend is depressed, so it must be affecting me.

Also how should I even go about this?

SecretOfficerNeko,asktransgender,Came out to parents and it is not okay...anyone help me talk to them?,"So I ended up being forced out of the closet as transitioning by my parents, and it is not okay... They've rescinded any support for financing college, and will not cosign any loans this point out, essentially leaving me out in the water in terms of my ability to even continue university (even next semester is a serious risk). 

I'm not fully kicked out yet, but my parents have not changed they're policy of ""no girl presentation allowed"" at home, so now they say they're ""at a loss"" of what to do in terms of my ability to go home and visit them. They want to talk about it, so I'm not fully kicked out yet, just very seriously at risk of being kicked out.

I had hidden the fact that I was transitioning after coming out as transgender didn't work out well. I decided to try and be independent, but eventually I couldn't and it was only a matter of time before they found out. What makes it worse is that I didn't really talk to them at all for a while because I was scared.

They think I was being deceitful in hiding it, and ""not taking [their] feelings into consideration"", as well as being selfish. They did not ever even ask why I hid it. They just assumed I cut off contact and didn't talk to them because I was being selfish, deceitful, and looking for only a bubble of reinforcement. So things really haven't been good. I need to let them know, even if they don't accept it, the impact they had on me, and why I was AFRAID to even talk to them, and how I wanted to escape from that fear.

Then there's also the fact that they think transitioning is a ""quick fix"" solution"", which they liken to drugs, alcohol, or other narcotics, by saying that they feel good at first, but then they become horrible. They seem to have completely ignored how I've benefitied emotionally from transitioning. Not in blind euphoria, but in actually being able to feel good emotions, to actually feel like I am me, to actually feel like I have a body, and to actually see my pre-dysphoria personality coming back bit by bit, and giving me, myself back.

Just...ugh! I can get through this, but I'm angry at my parents, and ready to cry, at their self-absorbed and persecution complex filled perspective. They believe that they're right, and the liberal agenda is trying to normalize homosexuality, transgender identity, and abortion, which they say are a danger to society, by silencing the truth of the opposition.

I just don't know what to say or do to bring my parents around HELP!"

TransOCDThrowaway,asktransgender,Maybe this transgender stuff is all just OCD?,"I'm pretty sure I have OCD as I get obsessions then they go away and I get intrusive thoughts and I'm starting to think that this whole me being a transgender woman thing is just my more then likely OCD too!

The reason I'm thinking this is because like other obsessions I had, one of the obsessions to do with me being a transgender woman was the same I think. Whst it was, it was described as people close to me as an ""obsession because you go on and on about it everyday"". What they were specifically addressing was how I used to literally mention i would say every day how I wanted to get surgery to get curves like Kim Kardashian and now that's stopped. I still do want curves like Kim Kardashian if I figure out I won't regret transitioning and if I figure out i am actually a transgender woman.

Admittedly, I do often think about what I want my body to look like if I were to discover I once and for all that I was a woman. Good sign or bad sign as I seem to be incredibly focused on my physical appearance as a possible woman?

Does this sound like OCD?"

DeadliestTulip,asktransgender,My hormone progress.,"Hi! 

So I've been on hormones for a little over a month now.  

I've experienced my first serious mood swing. From normal, to sad, to cying, to being happy all in a span of 2 hours. Like omg ""welcome to girl world"" as I get told from my friends. But I love it. The estrogen flowing thru my body just feels normal and proper. It's like I have the right plumbing now.

 I've also seem to have smoother skin in spots. And hair is thinning in spots. It's weird. My face is smoother. Amongst other areas.

My boobs are still a small A but it's still growing pretty fast. I love my boobs. They're  cute. The boob pain sucks tho. One time I had boob pain and itchy boob. I complained as girls do lol.

I'm definitely happier now than I've ever been. I still get cranky sometimes mainly in the morning but things are better and improving.

Dysphoria itself has calmed down a bit. The constant music of ""kill yourself "", and what not is mostly gone. It shows up for a second once in. Great while. Suicide is less of a thing. I'm still scared to be around guns tho. 

I think the biggest positive change is that my balls have completely shrunk into my body. Which is great. Tucking isn't even a thing I need to do. My balls aren't even balls anymore it's just skin.

My biggest dysphoria is my body hair still. That's still a serious problem. Another problem is my voice. But I'm slowly trying. It's very hard heh.

if you can relate let me know your progress so far if you want to. I'm mainly writing this out to share and just think about my  own progress. 

K cya!

CallMeKali,asktransgender,I'm so hurt and lost right now. Transphobia runs so much deeper than hurtful words and violence..,"This may end up being a long post. Idk. I'll leave a TL:DR at the end. I just need advice and support right now.

A bit of context:

I received a minor injury at work in late July, which put me off my full time duties at work until the beginning of September. During this time, I decided to come out publicly on facebook. Word spread quickly and by the end of August, everyone at my station knew. I returned to work in September, but I've been getting very few hours there. Sometimes less than 25 hours in a week. My boss is super supportive of me and claims to be trying the best he can to get me more hours.

So, I work as an EMT. On an ambulance. We run in crews of 2. Meaning, if they don't have another person to run with you, you don't get scheduled. That's the main reason I haven't been getting hours, is because they can't find me a partner. I've been in financial ruin for months now because of this.

To the point: 

I found out today that the reason I haven't been scheduled as often is because *so many people* have requested not to work with me, that there's like hardly anyone left to schedule me with. All because I'm trans. 

These are the same people that have acted *oh so supportive* to my face. The same people that I've known for over 6 years now. I've been through burning buildings with some of them. Through meth labs and hazmat and combative patients. Literally trusting our lives to each other. And now that trust is gone.

I don't know what to do. Transphobia isn't always outwardly expressed, sometimes it runs so deep it can ruin your life before you even realize it's there. I feel so hurt and betrayed. I just want to cry but no tears are coming..

Do I have a case for discrimination here? What do I do? I've already lost my apartment. I'm getting close to losing my car. I have so any unpaid bills that I don't know how I'll ever get caught up. 

TL:DR: People at work requested not to work with me because I'm trans. My hours are being cut as a result. Help?"
StephanieAnnikka,asktransgender,The long conversation with my dad.,"Lucky me I guess. Since he respected my privacy and not open the letter, with my brilliance told him I wrote for information for my friend Stephanie. I thought I had taken the control over the conversation but boy was I wrong. 

My dad's approval ratings over the course of two hours went from around 60% to just under 90%. He ranted on about so many things I was silence by it. He talked about how he had gay friends. People whom I knew had wives but he and my mother knew were gay. He ranted about cheating on my mom before I was born. How he protected a guy who came out of the closet from bullies. HE EVEN CALLED HIM TO PROVE IT. It was a long and winding conversation. 

In his words, ""I know I was raised in the deep south and hold conservative and traditional views on family, but when it comes to respecting someone, it doesn't matter who the fuck you are. Whether you are Willy Wonka, Elton John, John Lennon, that fucking alien from the thing. I would still show respect.""

And the very end after the long discussion, he asked me if I was gay, I said no. Because I'm not. . . and he just told me, ""I'm an old parent, I had you at 38. I've learned and regretted a few things I've done and said to you and your mother. But at least I'm learning.""

""Bring home Stephanie some time. I'd like to learn about it.""

This was all during the mini ""father-son"" road trip he planned after finding the letter. That's why he avoided discussion. 

At least I can breathe. I'll be doing the true coming out some other time. Thanks for the support. "

WynterArlene,asktransgender,What was it like to come out and how did people handle it?,"My younger cousin is a FtM trans and he's hoping to come out to his parents sometime soon. He's tried multiple times when he was younger, however, it was dismissed as ""just a phase"" during his time in elementary school (he's going to start middle school next year).

I was wondering how it was like for others when it came to coming out. Given that I'm not transgender (I'm genderfluid), I was wondering if anyone would be comfortable with talking about your coming out stories and how everyone had reacted to it (friends, family, etc). It would also be nice if people could offer some advice or words of encouragement to him, but if not, then it's fine. Regardless, I intend on fully supporting him.

Thank you for taking the time to read this."
AzureRemnant,asktransgender,Am I transgender?,"I've been confused or idk concerned about my gender. I'm not sure how to phrase it. I kind of feel like I'm connecting things that aren't related in order to convince myself I'm trans. 

The earliest I remember where something seemed off. I can remember from a young age that I wanted to play with ""girls' toys"" and I liked a lot of generally girly things. My mom did not like that, and she'd tell me no a lot, and I didn't understand why . As, I got older I tried on my mom's' wig a few times and i got happy. I walked around and people told me i looked like my mom and that made me happy. I would continue doing this on rare occasion even when no one was around and look in the mirror. I thought it would be nice if I were a girl and I tried to talk in a girl voice. Eventually when I got a DS, I started taking pictures of myself with it on.

When I got older around 12, I started to have this strong desire to get rid off my penis. I strongly considered cutting it off on multiple occasions. Occasionally, my mom would joke about buying me a skirt or a dress. When I was younger this would make me really mad because I wanted to say yes but I could tell she was joking and making fun of me. She continued this up until recently after she caught me wearing “girl socks”. I would daydream about being a girl. In video games, I almost always play as a female character if it’s an option. Often I’d make on guy character and one girl character because my friends would bother me about it. 

I watched this anime called kämpfer and it for lack of a better word “triggered” me. I was very angry/jealous of the main character because basically in they’re a guy and they become a girl because of this magic bracelet. I told my other friend who is also into anime, and I kept talking about. Once he asked me if I could be in any anime which one would I choose. I choose kämpfer so I could turn into a girl. I would talk so much about it and how I wanted to be a girl.
 Around 14 I was set on cutting of my penis. I started imagining doing it with sharp objects, but then I started crying because I knew it would hurt and I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I told one of my friends, and they said if I was really serious I should see a doctor about it to remove it. So, I thought about that. I’d wait until I was old enough to live on my own and then have it removed. This only made me temporarily happy, but eventually I started masturbating. A few days after I started masturbating regularly, the desire to get rid of it just kind of went away. I no longer have any dysphoria about my penis if that was dysphoria. I’m not even sure if that's what I should call it.
This is two fold. I was scared as of recent that what if I’m just a fetishist, but looking back at stuff in the past I just don’t think that’s the case, but that stuff earlier on could just be unconnected stuff I’m looking to in order to justify my fetish.I’m often jealous of girls and guys that manage to make themselves appear female. It makes me feel really angry/jealous. It’s a painful feeling. I don’t really like being male, but It doesn’t make me depressed. I feel like I could be fine being male for the rest of my life but just have occasional feelings of anger/jealousy and just a little sad sometimes. I just really want to be female. I wanted be treated like a female. I want to live me whole life feeling female and having people treat me like a female. I really want it, but I’m not sure if I’m trans because being male doesn’t make me depressed. Am I transgender, a fetish, just confused?"
Clarine87,asktransgender,Breast Ptosis - related to body age or breast age?,"Just a random thought, sorry!

I know there is not an established age related rate of deterioration, but I can't help but wonder if breasts grown at a stage later in life than a cis-female's normal puberty might be less typically affected, but there seems to be no information online about this.

I can't imagine Mtf HRT in someones' 50s-60s causes growth of a 50/60 yr old cis female's breasts, but at the same time, I can't find any literature indicating whether it's the age of the person or the age of the organ which can be attributed to the deterioration.

Same question as to whether anyone thinks this process would be accelerated in an older person. 

Personally I couldn't care less, but if there's any chance that MtF breasts last longer I'd want to know! :)

ebae150,asktransgender,Questioning gender advice,"So I've been questioning my gender for quite some time. About two or three years ago, I came out as FtM to my parents. They were very negative about the whole affair and shoved me back in the metaphorical closet. A lot of stuff happened in that time, (lots of verbal and mental things, deleted lots of personal work and social media accounts so I couldn't have 'negative influences', etc). 
About a year ago, I decided genderfluid fit well. And it was ok for a time. Since I've been living on my own, I thought it appropriate that I buy myself some more masculine things. It feels great. Wearing a binder is empowering. Pants are nice for the few seconds I get in the dressing room, since I have yet to find a pair that fit. And it can go like this for about a week. But suddenly I'll freak out and hafta rip the binder off, or smth similar. It's not a claustrophobic based issue. 
Is it possible the previous negative responses from my family are still screwing with me? Could it be something else entirely? (Also, on a more medical side, I may be intersex. My doctor and I have talked about it, and as far as we know, I have enough going on to very easily be inter, but my parents refused to get me tested, and I can't afford it now)
Sorry for the long question. It's been weighing on my mind so much more than usual, and thank you for any help"

mtf_or_not,asktransgender,I get angry when I'm in doubt about being trans,"Hi,


So every time I get into doubt about being trans, it makes me extremely frustrated and angry.



Like, when I am fairly certain I'm trans, I get a sense of relief out of it. When I get the slightest doubt about me being trans, I just get fustrated and get angry inside.


Also, when I don't feel that dysphoric, I don't like it. It makes me feel extremely fustrated, and I'm scared that this dypsohira is going to go away and come back in the future. 


I'm constantly thinking about if I am trans or not. I am constantly thinking about it, from the minute I wake up to the minute I fall asleep. Before I thought I was trans I never thought about it. 


People just say to me ""see a therapist"". The thing is that I can't. /r/asktransgender is the closest I can get to therapy. Like, I get extremely anxious when talking to people I don't know, plus the nearest therapist to me is 150 miles away. I can't drive, I have no money, and I can't get a job. My parents will not be supportive of me being trans one bit.


What should I do? I can't see this getting any better. "

It did wear off by the end of the day. 

As for the estradiol, absolutely nothing. This surprised me as I've always felt at least weird after every shot I've ever had. I think I could get jabbed with saline and I'd have at least some kind of placebo effect.

When should I tell a potential employer? Certainly I will have to tell them at some point. Should I do it during the interview process, after I get an offer, or after I get the job and get settled in? 

If I am to tell them sooner rather than later, how should I bring it up, what should I say? I feel like talking about it with a complete stranger will be extremely difficult, I have a real hard time coming out to people in general. 

If I am to wait to tell them, how should I go about trying to see if they are friendly during the interview?

colette_collie,asktransgender,Please help me with some general guidelines and thoughts. Thanks! :),"Hiya,
I made an account just for this, I'm generally very shy.
So this is going to be a long one, but I'd like everyone's opinion. I can't really formulate my question well so I'll try to elaborate.

I know you are not doctors, and I have already decided to go visit a therapist, but I'd like to know am I just being silly, is it the novelty of it all, why is it that this has only started to bother me at a relatively late age (30yo), am I just repressing things, is there something else, or am I possibly really transgender? 
I'd like some thoughts from you all, experiences, whatever might help me to go to the therapist with a slightly clearer mind, because it's all been so cloudy lately.

I read far and wide for information on transition and gender dysphoria, but I'd still like some more personal thoughts, as I believe every nuance matters.
Using what knowledge I have gained so far on the matter, I'll mention things that I think might be important in shaping my psyche. If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I'll reply as soon as I can.

In my youth, my mom was the one that raised me for the most part. Dad was an alcoholic back then, and my mom was miserable, but she tried with all her might to pour all the love she had in me. For that, I am eternally grateful, as it has made me into the person I am today, and I think I'm pretty fine, save for the fact I'm incredibly shy (once made a remark in a conversation how I'd approach a lion with greater ease than a girl), very passive, I never talk back, I hate fighting of any kind, never raised voice in my life, and I feel like I'm incredibly submissive. 
With this in mind, I have to say that my parents had always been INCREDIBLY demanding, in terms of success, demeanor, etc. Even now, they tell me how I should act, what I should do or say, who should I marry, it's driving me insane... but I cope, I've found ways to vent and divert my thoughts and enjoy myself and life to the best of my ability. I am very intelligent, but not very brash, so I had a lot of issues during my education, up to university. I was bullied, not extremely, but still, it was unpleasant. I always have these thoughts, remarks in my head, like ""You can't teach an old dog new tricks"" or ""If they were smart enough to know some things, they would have known it on their own already"" etc, which make me get out or avoid any kind of confrontation. I do not think I have any psychological issues... I occasionally feel down, exceptionally horny (I somehow believe this is important), but it's nothing I can't seem to manage. I'm still a very positive person, and have always strived to show people how despite everything, you can be happy and simply good. I'm introvert, guess that's a given by now, and the only time I can talk to people is in situations where I absolutely have to, or if I know them for a long while and know who they are. I like observing, reading people, I prefer action to talk and I am a very good leader... when I have to. I'm not overly popular, and my intelligence has made me cynical (though I still consider myself an idealist) and questioning everything for a million times over. But the upside is in the fact I don't regret my decisions, even if they turn out bad... they're just new experiences and knowledge. 
I love certain types of sports (fitness, swimming, gymnastics), everything to do with music, and I’m a pretty decent writer (you can be the judges of that, though English is not my native language). I’m good at basically all sciences except math (because all my math teaches were horrible people and I have an issue with those who do not lead by example).

So much for the past and some general stuff about me, now for the present, and the issue at hand... how did I come to this anyway?
So, about 2 years ago, not sure how or why, but I guess I just started thinking, what it would be like to be a girl? Guess I was down, unhappy (I'd never call myself depressed because, actually, I'm very happy most of the time... like 70% of the time), especially with my love life. Being this type of guy, I've never had much success with the opposite sex (and I'm sorry if my terms are misleading or wrong or make people angry, I still haven't learned how to properly use some of them), and, truth be told, since my 1st girlfriend, I've always been kind of... jealous of the girls. I remember saying to her ""It's unfair, why do you get to wear all those lovely things and use all that lovely makeup and there are no such things for guys, and if we do it, we are considered gay"". So there's that... Every time I was with a girl, there were several consistent thoughts in my head ""I'm lacking"" in terms of size, stamina, appearance (while I do consider myself fit, since nowadays I work out a lot, I'd never call myself hot or desirable... not a pretty face here), as well as, damn she's gorgeous, look at that skin, the curves, the smell, lips, eyes, hair... all of it. And if they wear something sexy, GOD, I couldn't decide do I want her, or do I want to be her. So since two years ago, I've been thinking... a lot... about being a girl, but what always held me back were a couple of facts, first, I'm old (for this I guess... older than a 20yo at least), and not very pretty, so chances are I won't be pretty after transition (and this is REALLY important to me)... and the fact that, in my head, guys age better (past 45, in my opinion). Maybe this last thing is just due to the circumstances of my location, can’t really say, or maybe I have an idiotic point of view on this… does appearance past the age of 50 matter anyway? I guess it’s obvious that this is a pretty physical thing to me, and that appearance and acceptance of my personal looks play a great role in all of it, but which is older, the chicken or the egg? Is this the consequence of me not liking my body, or is me not liking my body the consequence of being transgender… or is this all just a consequence of a well masked depression? Though, as I’ve said, I’d never call myself depressed… does that matter too?

As I said in the beginning of this post, my mind’s all sorts of hazy right now. I can’t seem to think straight, my head is hot all the time, I have insomnia (but that’s just because I tend to overthink, I deal with it through meditation, it’s actually super effective… at least in my case), and I have had this INSANE libido for the past month or so, where even if I masturbate daily, it just won’t go away. Usually I have these “heat” moments (god that’s such a bad word) once every two weeks, to a month, but now it has been constant for a while. And I only watch porn in those times, but now I’ve kinda stopped watching porn, and started more envisioning myself as a girl, what would it feel like… would I be free like girls are on pics of most lady intended products? I’ve been browsing pictures on /r/transtimelines and some of the girls there are incredibly pretty at, or around my age, so I kinda think, maybe there’s hope?
Gotta tell you, I shaved my lower body and it feels AMAZING, the way things brush against my legs is so touchy feely, I can’t imagine what it would feel like to be caressed by someone right now. Also, where once I tought my skin is horrible and that I’m old, that the marks of age are visible on me, the skin on my legs is so gentle and… baby-like… and my legs look great! But there’s this other thing… now when I look down and admire my skin and legs… my penis looks so wrong… I kinda feel like it shouldn’t be on a body like this, that’s the best way I can describe it. So I’ve been tucking it every time I can. I don’t know what else to write, but as I’ve said, I’ll answer any question you have, so long as it is not overly identifying. I’m quite nervous and even scared about all this so…

As you can tell, I’m quite down to earth and honest towards myself. I have this no bullshit attitude and have adopted the KISS principle of some of the world’s militaries, Keep It Simple Stupid, and thus I believe all unnecessary duality or diversity, complications etc. are bad… so I want to uncover which direction is it that I should take, so I can focus on that.

In conclusion, there’s a chance I have underlying depression, I’m a sex/porn addict, I’m very body (self?) conscious to the point of self-loathing, OR I’m transgender… what do you think? 

Thanks!

P.S. As intimidating as it sounds to someone like me, I can't wait to go see a therapist. I guess that'll be the most accurate source of information, and is the thing with the highest probability of giving me peace of mind. As a matter of fact, I’ll go visit several!"

I'll make my first post short-ish:
I'm mtf, 25, and just started HRT yesterday! (It's a very low dose of 1mg Estrodial / 50mg Spiro, but it's a start and better than 0). 
I came out to my wife last year, and though it's been incredibly difficult and sad and hard, we want to stay together. We have a 2 month old son and still love each other. She's fiercely defensive of me and the LGBT community, but she feels hurt / sad most of the time. 

In general, her sadness is that she's losing a husband and gaining a wife (although with the same if not better personality as the husband) she might not be attracted to. About 80% of the time she's supportive and excited for me, but occasionally she'll get really sad, shut down, and unable to look or speak with me. She told me as much as she wants to believe this is who i am, it hurts because she fell in love with the masked version of myself. 

I love my wife with all my heart, and I'd never want to leave her, but I want her to be happy. I believe deep down that her love is more than the physical attraction to the male me, that we will one day be happy together. She's not sure all the time. I know I couldn't give up transitioning to make her happy (she doesn't want that either because I'd be unhappy), but I hate the idea that she's the one compromising in order for me to be happy. 

I repeat Jenny Boylan's words in my head all day: ""I knew that I'd never regret being a woman, but I'd always regret not being [My Wife's] husband."" Paraphrased from 'She's Not There.' 

So anyway, how am I able to not feel guilty? I feel that my transitioning is inherently selfish (though necessary), but it's so difficult for my wife. 

Any tips or advice from those who have remained married (and hopefully happy) with a heterosexual partner in an trans-homosexual marriage?

[deleted],asktransgender,How not to kill my self? + a little rant. Sorry.,"I already know who I really am, what hurts me right now is that I know I have to wait 3 months before I can even get “diagnosed“  with  being trans… And It hurts so much because I already know who I am. I don’t need someone else to tell me “ok you’re trans, here are hormones“…  I already know what I need, and I need it fucking fast because every second in this body is torture, its disgusting, I cant stand it anymore. What bothers me is the fact that I realized it too late, I think. I am 20 years old, soon to be 21 in a few months… So I will most likely begin HRT at the age of 21… sigh. Anyways my life is falling apart, I am a 20 year old failure, dropped out of high school 3 times because of psychological problems… This is so emberassing… But hey, I didn’t choose any of this, I was thrown into this fucking mess, just like everybody else... Now I‘m just really sad, and hurt because I know no matter what, I HAVE to wait these 3 months, and that’s just for diagnosis… I will need to “prove“ to them that I am really trans… God fucking damn it this retarded system in this fucking country... Why the fuck do I need to prove anything to them, when I know what I need. All of this is just retarded. We live in a fucking comedy… This life is a joke. I got all these problems and no way to solve them, this is so enraging… Extremely frustrating. No wonder trans-folk commit suicide so often.. No wonder… Misunderstood by my environment, misunderstood by my own family, life is just super awesome… And there’s not much I can do about it. All of this makes me want to damage my self somehow. Oh how I wish for things to be different, but it is what it is, I was abused for 9 years and today I am not able to function correctly in the society… This makes me so fucking angry, that they inflicted so much psychological damage upon me, and today, I am completely and utterly fucked… The only two things left are suicide and keeping this bullshit of a life going. Suicide is getting more attractive each day. I cant stand this torture any longer. Society fucked me over and I think this is it. There’s no where to go now. This is it, I have to keep feeding my self bullshit everyday, so I don’t kill my self. Everyday I just wake up and sit at this computer, trying to find a solution to all of this, searching for something, anything that will put me out of this misery. Something that will save me from this hell. But I guess I have to wait 3 months or even a few years before I can even get started with HRT…. This hurts so much. I just want to die. Because there’s too much pain. My question, How the f#ck do you endure this hell and not kill yourself when you finally realized everything?"
henx125,asktransgender,Made an appointment with a doctor for HRT. Why then do I feel shame that I do not yet present as my preferred gender?,"I was procrastinating a bit on making an appointment after receiving my letter from my therapist, but I finally went and did it. Yay! 

^^^Now ^^^I ^^^only ^^^have ^^^to ^^^wait ^^^3 ^^^more ^^^months...

However, there is one thing I can't get off my mind and that is that I feel a sense of shame or guilt or something around people who know that I am trans because I have yet to feel comfortable presenting as female in public, like my soon to be doctor. Why?

It's almost as if I feel like I am being pressured to become hyperfeminine to 'justify' my being trans to those around me - even though no one has actually said anything to this effect. I'm not even particularly girly and I consider myself to be a tomboy but that just makes it seem that much harder for those around me to understand what I am going through."

* Would I sleep with a cis woman? Probably never. I wouldn't be able to do any of the sex acts a cis woman would expect. I'm not attracted to vaginas.

* Do I consume unrealistic, fetishizing pornography? I don't think so. Mostly I'm attracted to average trans women, usually in the trans section of chaturbate or on Tumblr.


* Am I a virgin? Yes, and I can't forsee myself losing my virginity ever at this point. (I'm 25) The only way I can imagine it is if I met a trans woman who actively liked the idea of dating a chaser, which I think is unlikely.


* Do I feel guilty/hate myself? Yes, extremely. I don't understand why I'm like this, and I wish I could just have a normal sexual orientation. I feel like pretty much all straight people would be disgusted by me, and the entire LGBT community would think I'm a creep."

eliza_silver,asktransgender,I need hair style and care tips,"I currently find myself having really shitty hair: it's long, unbelievably curly and messy, dry, frayed, and it sticks out and makes my hair look like a really crappy afro. I tried combing it down and styling it, but it makes me look fucking terrible. I can PM folks who need to see a picture to understand how it looks like, I just don't want to share it publicly.

I'm thinking of getting my hair cut and styled but I really don't know what to get or how to go about it. I'm pre everything, I just started therapy. HRT and such is a very long ways away. I'd like to have a style that is cute, but not super cute that it makes people look at me funny. I guess a cute androgynous style would be nice. I don't really know what styles fit that category and what I should ask the people at the hair salon for when they ask what I want. 

The last time I tried, the person flat out said I can't have a pixie cut or a bowl cut, and she just trimmed the sides down heavily and left the top quite long. It made my face more square, and I fucking hated it. 

I also don't know what I can do to take better care of my hair. Ideally, I'd love it straight, but that doesn't seem economical since I'm pretty afraid of using a straightening iron and sacrificing even more hair than I normally do from stress. 

Any and all help would be really, really appreciated. If you need a reference pic of me, just ask and I'll PM it over. I don't know anything about style or looking good, so this is a very new thing for me."

I've heard so many stories from trans people about how they feel so relaxed and good when they present as their identified gender. This was the opposite for me. It made me really reconsider if I am actually trans. ""Shouldn't I feel more at peace with this stuff on? Instead, I feel disgusted."" Am I just cis with some kind of strange fantasy?

I can sit there when I'm all alone and practice for a few minutes to raise it. I think I sound pretty passable. However, the second I'm around anyone, including my girlfriend, my brain just automatically stops trying to use the voice and I go back to my normal one.

TransThrowaway_1,asktransgender,Why is it even after living as a woman I'm not sure if I'm transgender?,"

As the title says I'm living as a woman, I could literally start HRT tomorrow if i wanted to because I have a HRT letter, but despite all of this I can't accept myself as a woman and because of that I can't start HRT in case I regret it.

For example, someone on hear will tell me ""yes you sound trans"" or they'll say I'm ""textbook trans"" or ""your transgender because cisgender men don't live as women, ever"" or something like that and two things will happen. I either will be like ""yeah, maybe there right, maybe I am trans"", or I'll just let it go over my head. I suffer from anxiety so do you think this may be causing all this doubt too? Like, if I'm wrong, what will I do? I've come out, etc."

I'm in the process of undoing 20 years of work cultivating a deep baritone/bass voice. Compliments given and a desire for attention and acceptance led me to this, in addition to genetics (my father has a similar voice, but he shouts more than sings)
I like the sound of that voice. I just hate it coming out of my face.
I wish I could just give it away.
I think I need professional voice advice so I don't actually harm my vocal cords (which would be counter productive), but that's another issue entirely.
If I can never sing again after it's all over, I'd prefer that to keeping this, but I hope I can just change my range.

This is actually a big reason I didn't accept that I was trans until this summer, despite hating my body.
It's like I have this nice piano, but I only want to play guitar. I'd be fine with a pawn shop disaster guitar. Heh.

I'm sorry for being so long-winded. I have the amazing ability to make a short story long, but not the reverse. Maybe it's the autism.

I don't have many people to talk about these things with, and I can't start transition proper for a couple months, but I'm in the waiting list!
I'm optimistic overall, but I mourn for that voice, and the time put into it.

I'm glad that something so small is my greatest fear going forward."

azenthe,asktransgender,When shit hits the fan.,"So. This is gonna be hella long. Ill leave a tldr at the end. 

I'm 23, live in western Ohio (deep red) and MtF. I start HRT Wednesday. Here's 2016 for you.

In July, I left my fiancé. Moved in with parents. My depression and anxiety grabs me by the throat and then proceeds to tear my heart out my chest. I left my fiancé because we were not getting along well. She never wanted to do anything, sex life went to zero, she never cared about anything except things that applied to her. I was also dealing with resurfacing depression and anxiety. Things got sour and I left. In August, things went straight to hell. After a perfect storm of a night after work, I drove off in my car. Fast. It ended up being a hour long pursuit with the police. After I called my now ex and she said she didnt hate me for it and would really like to get back together, I pulled over. (note: that is what I consider suicide attempt 1) in November I  finally started meds for my depression and anxiety. I filled realized I was trans then. Broke the news to my best friend,  then my gay friend at work. However, the anxiety of it, and knowing that my dad is transphobic, led me to not tell everyone. That anxiety combined with the mood changes my depression meds caused (paxil) got my put on FMLA just before Thanksgiving. People at work complained to HR about it and now I'm trying other meds as well as working on HRT. Now, the plan was, cash out my 401k, use that money to move the fuck out of my shithole parents house with my dickhead dad, and transition. 

However. My wonderful ex had assembled some of my shit and demanded that I come get it today. However, due to the law proceedings, I lost my license for 3 years. She knows about that. Also knows I'm trans. Which instantly when I told her that she became very spaced from me. We were okay up until then. Now she doesn't want anything to do with me. 

Regardless. Today. I try to get my mom to take me up there, and my dad wants to come, because they are going g to see my brother who also lives in the same area. However, my ex doesn't want him to be there because she knows he is a dickhead. So, I tell them this. It doesn't matter. He goes. I don't. I stay home, because I'm not dealing with my dad today. I'm on prozac now, and it's not as string as paxil and I'm dealing with that. It doesn't suppress my irritability. Then my ex texts me, and says look come get your shit I say fine my brother and mom will there to get it. The, this bitch says oh, well I'm going to look at a house so you can't right now.  Wtf. So then she texts me back, after my parents lead to come back, and says come get it. I tell her look, I can't. She says she isn't keeping my shit any longer. I'm like okay, it's gonna be a minute. But nope. She wants me get it right the fuck now. So I stress the fuck out. She has some important stuff. Like my cars payment book, extra key to it.. so I tell her I'll be there with my mom soon. But then my mom and dad get home and have to argue and shit as usual, so I wait. Then she starts asking me how close we are. Are we coming. Blah blah blah. I get sick of it, snap, hop in my car and do 125 mph all the way there. It's 32 miles away by the interstate. I get there, losing my mind, suicidal, ready to die. She then just sits in her car. Doesn't even let me get my stuff. So, worried she's gonna call the cops, I hurry up and leave. Fast, of course. I drive far away, get lost and try to find places I can crash alone and die. I find one. Banked curve, long straight before it. So I get some speed and charge it. But then, one person comes to mind. You're on here. If it wasn't for her, I would have never hit the brakes. I wait. My mom comes to pick me up. She cares, btw. It's all my dad and this bitch of an ex I have. We go home. I show her the informed consent packet. She already knows, but she asked so yeah. She told me that my dad was figuring things out. So she told him I was gay because it's was not as bad as being trans, I guess. 
Tomorrow is unforseen. He hasn't said anything. Not being hostile. Nothing. So. After this second attempt at suicide, after my mind has went to hell. I don't know what to do for the next few days. I'm clearing out my 401, so as soon as I get those funds I'm gone, and it doesn't matter anymore. But what the hell am I gonna do if shit hits the fans tomorrow?

Tl;dr - I have no drivers license, transphobic dad found out I'm 'gay' because I went suicidal and sped off in my car after my bitch of an ex wouldn't be patient enough to wait for me to get a ride up there (he doesn't know the full story about me trans.) I'm already suicidal even with psychotherapy and meds. I have to live with them for a few more days. Wtf do I do until then? He hasn't said anything yet, expecting the boot tomorrow though. I don't how to deal with this. I just need to get through the next few days. Then I can move in with my also MtF friend. "

By (Hong Kong, China) law, I still have to use the male's toilet when I can't find a unisex/disabled toilet. I understand that...or so I thought. Yesterday I was at a gathering and I got up to use the washroom. I used the stall, of course.

Upon exiting the stall I saw a man using the urinal, and another male waiting outside the toilet. Eye contact we're made, eyebrows were raised.

It was deflating and humiliating. To be seen by other people exiting a toilet designed for males, and reminded that I am still a male no matter how much I make up, act and speak like a woman. The others may recognize me and acknowledge me as much as I want. But the law is cold. Reality is harsh.

I just don't know what to do the next time I need to use the toilet..."
wannabeRiley,asktransgender,Help with the California name and gender change forms?,"Hi everyone! I have no idea if this is the place to ask something like this, but I figured I'd ask.

The first question feels like a valid question. The second feels like I'm an incapable child or something, heeehh. FIRST QUESTION; I was born in Texas, but I moved out to California. So I have that texas birth certificate, but I have a California drivers license at the moment. What do I need to do to change my name and gender? It seems like court orders are only for changing California birth certificates? And drivers licenses can be changed without a court order? But if I want my Texas birth certificate changed... does a California court order help? What even constitutes a name and gender change in this situation? Like, if I just get it done on my license, which I think is the faster process, does that count as legally changing my name? Could I use a license with a different name and gender to try changing my Texas birth certificate? 

In short, question A is ""wtf do I need to do"" 

And question B would be... is there anyone that can help me do it? Or does anyone know resources to help? I used transgender law center to get as far as I've gotten now (it didn't have anything for being born in one state and living in another), but with california forms in hand, a lot of the fields to fill are confusing to me. I get sorta addled looking through legal junk like this, it'd be awesome if someone could just hold my hand through it. But I'd totally settle for a website or a location where I could help myself xD

Anyways. Thanks in advance for the help. This stuff is kinda daunting for me for some reason. x3x"
ucaffejsheckereit,asktransgender,when compliments mean someone has clocked you,"Hi everybody, first of all, I am well aware that I am not beautiful. I get it. However, tonight, out of the blue, I was in a store and one lady told me ""you are beautiful"". I thanked her but I felt very uncomfortable. The thing is that it is not the first time that happens to me and my explanation is that these people want to show support but all they are doing is reminding me that I do not pass as cis-female. Okay, but I am fine with people being supportive and nice. 

However, I have caught people obviously talking behind my back and giggling and when I confronted them they said ""we were saying you were beautiful"". Come on now. Seriously? I am not that stupid. I know I am not beautiful. I am not saying that I am ugly, but I am not beautiful and for someone to giggle behind my back and then say they were saying I was beautiful... I just don't buy it. 

Lastly, I go to a trans- night on Monday where I can chat with friends who share the same interests. Admirers there used to compliment me a lot... until I saw that they did it to every single girl there. 

So, how do you feel about compliments? They make me uncomfortable especially because I know most of the times they are insincere.

The last time I tried doing this, I came out empty handed, unsure of what I wanted and what worked on me. I came a bit more prepared this time. I had came a little overdressed, makeup a little more dramatic because I accidentally went to heavy with my eyeliner (and just rolled with it, and it turned out pretty good), and because why the fuck not, my parents just told me I destroyed my life and that they don't care if I killed myself a couple nights before, so fuck it, let's go all in. I found clothes that worked. Things I just wanted, things I knew would flatter me. I took selfies with my friend at a beautiful part of town, where in the past I would just sadly hold the camera for friends, wishing that I was girl in the pretty dress in front of the lens. But now, everything I did felt like I was enjoying it for the first time ever. When I came home, I looked at the dress I just bought for myself. I felt so happy. I felt right. I am far enough in transition to feel happy, and I'm not even done! I suddenly felt myself smiling, then laughing, then plopping down on my bed and crying, feeling so overjoyed that I had finally made it. In the long, crazy, painful existence I've had so far that one moment felt like it made up for everything I had worked for. "

having to clarify pronouns in the first place serves a reminder im not cis. i think this is the base of the problem. i hate those. but it doesnt make sense to sit there and let myself practically be misgendered with something like a they pronoun, so why do i do it  

correcting isnt much of a problem in real life. i think i feel like i cant run from being trans there, so i suck it up. internet is so much easier, nobody has to know. online i just get passive aggresively upset almost. this is irrational  

im even vague about being mtf or ftm because it another thing highlights that im trans more :( this makes no sense. this is a trans subreddit. i should be open the most here. does it all boil down to a deeper self-hate problem?

Does their definition only include people who live full-time (or close to it) as a gender other than that assigned at birth, and people who wish to do so at some point even if they are not open about it? Does it also include people who practice any transgender experience, such as cross-dressing or drag, while still identifying with the gender assigned at birth? I mean, it doesn't make a difference to me, I just remember being surprised that something like 1 to 2 million people in this country identify as mtf or ftm or something on that spectrum, so I wasn't sure how they defined it.

ncole1,asktransgender,Question about levels? Too high estrogen?,"Hi!

I am currently on 4 mg of E and 200 mg of spiro per day. In my most recent blood results my t levels were great (like 20 or something) but my endo seemed concerned with my e levels. I take my pills 2 mg morning/2 mg night sublingually because I heard it's more effective that way, and I had taken my morning dose 2 hours before getting my blood drawn. When the results came in my E level was 800 which is obviously way too high. My doctor didn't seem concerned because I said I had taken them early before and was taking them sublingually which I'm assuming causes a spike, but I wanted to ask you all if I should be worried my levels are too high throughout the day or if I can expect that the spike drops to a more acceptable level for the rest of the day?

Anyone have experience with sublingual dosages? 

Thanks in advance for the help!"

lyaa55,asktransgender,contemplating my shift to full time...,"So I got on HRT while still questioning about 4 months ago.  I'm in graduate school and had a very busy semester, which was good as it allowed me to take my mind off gender somewhat and let the hormones start their work.  I'm now out to most of my friends I see frequently and almost all of my family.  I'm lucky to be a trans-friendly area, and have a trans gf and some new trans friends.  

With my trans friends and a couple cis queer people, I've started using my new name and everything.  I'm thinking about my next steps--- telling my closer friends my femme name, dressing more feminine more regularly, etc.

While I do feel cute, I'm far from passing.  My shoulders and arms are pretty huge, as I used to exercise obsessively to manage anxiety while living as a guy, and this narrowly limits my clothing selection.  I'm imagining going out with my cis girlfriends and introducing myself as a trans woman, etc., and wondering, like, is that's too much to ask.  I know it isn't, because trans people know not to see me as a guy.

Idk.  I'm out to most people but super shy about asking for a different name and a little shy about clothing.  Any advice for keeping things moving along?  "
MonePie,asktransgender,Confused about your sexual thoughts and the implications they have on being trans or not? Read this.,"Right now im sure plenty of you, as i once did, think imagining yourself as a woman when you think of sex makes this whole thing just a pure sexual fetish and nothing more. It does not. When cis women fantasize about sex, they are not having sex as a man. They never see themselves as men during sex and are always a woman during sex. This will be the exact same for you, as you have the brain of a female. 

There is a clear difference between getting off at the thoughts of being a woman, and getting off at the thoughts of having sex, and just so happening to be a woman while doing so. This took me so long to figure out and held up my transition for so long, as i thought i wasnt trans enough, that i was just a crossdresser with a fetish.

I mentioned this on a post earlier, and it got me thinking that this information needs to get out there more. As so many people are confused about not being trans enough for this very reason. So, to you confused bunch, here you go :)"
throwaway37421,asktransgender,Resources for why it's important for people to have SRS?,"Hi, I (22 mtf) came out to my parents in January.  While my mother was initially very supportive, it was hard for my father to accept at first.  He still says he loves me and is becoming more accepting over time.

However, when I told him today that I'm planning on getting bottom surgery, it threw him for a loop.  He trotted out the arguments he initially gave for HRT (which he's coming to accept): namely that it's all material (as opposed to spiritual) and it's a matter of self-discipline.

He always compares my being trans to his life.  He initially reacted to my wanting to change my name with his story (which I've heard endlessly): he changed his name when he converted religions, and then again when he converted religions again, but now realizes that it's all material compared to the spiritual.

While he now realizes the name thing doesn't compare totally, when I told him I'm planning on getting bottom surgery, he responded with his own stories of how self-disciplined he was.

Basically, his biggest concern with my transition is that I'm too focused on the material instead of the spiritual.  I think this comes from his ignorance in *what it feels like* to be trans.  This leads to him thinking it's something one can/should overcome through self-discipline.  Are there some resources explaining *why* trans people go on HRT/socially transition/get SRS, and why it's not something trivial or aesthetic?"

Clarnico,asktransgender,An awkward predicament...,"Hello. Back again for more random advice, if possible please. 

I started college with the right name, and have always presented male there. Some of the lecturers know, but I haven't told anyone about the situation. I hoped I could ""go stealth"", or as close to it as possible. 

The problem is (at almost 3 months on T, and pre T when I started) I don't consistently pass, and get frequently misgendered by others on my course - who know me only by a male name, but still assume female.

I'm not really quite sure what to make of the situation. I keep being called ""she"" or given subtle indicators that they see me as female, but at the same time despite doing everything I can (besides wearing a flashing sign that says ""I AM A MAN"") people still make comments? 

I don't know if they see me as a really weird cis female (who for some reason has a guy's name, dresses like a guy and uses the men's room), if they think of me as a weird cis guy but slip up, or if they know I'm trans and do it purely to be dickish, or have no idea what I am. 

The subject just keeps coming back to trans people in their conversations (whether they know or if it's just conversation, I'm not sure), and I don't know quite what to do - the majority may as well be in the dark ages, and aren't particularly respectful (but a few seem pretty chill) but on the whole they keep making comments about ""banging ladyboys"" or making jokes about genital surgery (amongst other unfavourable terms, which although not applicable to me, their grasp of trans issues is not great) and how it's ""no better than identifying as a toaster"". 

If I knew how exactly they percieved me (If they cottoned on and know I'm a trans guy, I'd react differently to if they just think I'm a slightly odd cis man (I don't know if they even realise trans men exist?) and do the female pronouns thing as a joke...) then it'd make it easier to handle.  I kind of don't know whether I should risk outing myself, but it's beginning to get on my nerves... I'll probably just ignore it, I don't want any drama, but at the same time, the more people call me ""she"", the more people get confused. 

I tried correcting someone last week, everyone just looked at me like I was insane, and it went quiet very quickly...

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? If so, what did (or would) you do in my shoes?


Additionally, I think my parents want to cram me back in the closet for Christmas (with the ""logic"" that me being trans will shock relatives so much that they will literally have heart attacks and die, and it will be entirely my fault). I'd honestly rather spend christmas alone than do that... no idea what to do. I'm not going to not wear my binder and put on an act, as selfish as it sounds, is it bad that I want a happy day too? Is it bad that I'm annoyed that my family see me as an embarrassment (they don't want anyone else to know)?

Thanks in advance.

SarahJrandomnumbers,asktransgender,"So, my father doesn't accept me, but accepts his child porn collecting friend. Opinions? [Rant/open letter]","Yup, you read the title right, his friend (for 40+ years, during which time he's been gay/bi) has been sent to prison for 2 years for, quote;

&gt;Fifty eight of the images were in the most serious category A, 193 were in category B, 1,092 were in category C.

&gt;There were also more than 2,600 prohibited images including drawings and cartoons.

&gt;The majority of the images featured young boys aged between 8 to 16 years old.

&gt;But some images featured children as young as three years old.

Yet while he was supporting this guy (despite having 2 young daughters of 6 and 9), he's very unsupportive of me ""cos muh religions"".

I have been hoping that at some point, he'll realise his mistake, call me up and ask for forgiveness, I was even giving him a year to accept it (not to be happy, but just basic acceptance), but now this has come to light, i can see this isn't going to be the case.

So as far as i'm concerned, Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined is no where near the level of bridge burning i'm planning, but just in case you do ever see this...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider this as my final letter to you, as i will send you this link should you ever try to contact me.

*(Names changed to something the people involved will recognise, but random people wont).*

""Songis"", as far as i'm concerned, your near psychotic drive to attain a level of power within a social group has killed off many of your relationships in your life, friends, partners and now your own blood.

Just look at all the hobbies and groups you've been a part of in the last 30 years, and look at how many friendships you made during that time, then see how many of them are still a part of your life. 

You had a wonderful relationship with one of the few women on this planet that could ever stand your ""quirky ways"" (read demeaning, abusive ways), but you decided to dump her because she was having a rough time with schizophrenia, and was having ""paranoid delusions"" of you dumping her and shacking up with ""Robert"" (nick name, said in french).

So after you jump the shark by indeed proving that it isn't paranoia ""if they're really after you"", you end up shacking up with said woman, proving your ex 100% right. This has got to be one of the most shitty things you've ever done, but nowhere near the worst, that title is given to the letter you wrote your ex 10 years later calling your current partner, and the mother of your children... Well, let's not just quote single words, lets quote the WHOLE PARAGRAPH;

&gt;You were absolutely right about ""Robert"", though I don't think even you could know just how evil she was. My life has been a total misery and that is my penalty, though to have to watch the abuse the children go through is unbearable.

You call your current partner evil, and claiming she abuses the kids despite the fact she's trying to raise 2 children basically on her own, but with you constantly deriding her for ""not keeping the flat clean"" or ""not dealing with the children properly"", despite 4 Xmas's ago, you hit ""the eldest sister"" (which you named after a friends recently deceased wife (died of breast cancer)), across the face so hard, she went flying 6 ft across the room.

What did this (then) 6 year old child do? Nothing but the worst crime known to mankind, WALKING ON THE SIDE OF YOUR FOOT!

Yes, a 4-5 stone child, walking on your foot was enough to send her flying across the room, to the point where we were worried cause there was no screaming or crying, just silence. A silence that felt like a fucking year, but was most likely 5-10 seconds. 

Your reply to the question ""Was that REALLY necessary?"" was just totally expected from the sort of bottom feeding scum you are.

""She walked on my foot!""

At least you had the decency to fuck off back to your bedroom to sulk, allowing us to fix the damage you did.

Oh and lets just quickly gloss over the fact that the woman you are with, just happened to be my ex. Thanks for that, it wasn't weird at all seeing you 2 kiss, or have kids, then to see you mentally abuse her on a daily basis, nope, not weird or infuriating at all.

The fact that i never reacted to you 2 shacking up isn't because i agreed with what you did, but was because i wanted both of you 2 to be happy. This has clearly backfired as you 2 hate each other, and rather than splitting up, you keep firing your toxicity in front of the kids, causing them to call their own mother ""STUPID MUMMY!"".

You are going to poison those kids, not only with your particular interpretation of your religion, but with the way to treat people. 

Hopefully you'll either split up, or die, either way, the sooner that happens, the sooner the kids can start to fix the issues being around a manipulator like you has created.

But even after all this (and this isn't a compendium of all the shit you've done), i still was holding out hope that you would see, that calling me a sexual deviant, pervert and a cross dresser was all said in haste, and that you would at some point realise that you were wrong, and that i'm finally happy, and that's the only important thing for a parent to want for their child.

So just imagine my surprise, when i come to learn that in October 2014, you helped ""Boulanger"" write a letter (read statement to the police), stating why he bought pornographic pictures from Azov films (yes, that's right, I know ALL about it...).

What makes this even worse is that you are still supportive of him, after he was sentenced to 2 years in prison and made to sign on the sexual offenders register for 10 years.

Now ok, you've been friends for 40+ years, i can see how you wouldn't just want to nuke a friendship like that, even though most people would, considering you've got young children now, but that's fine because ""god will judge when we die"" or whatever religious flourish (read bullshit) you want to use to deal with it.

But to then cast me aside as a sexual deviant, while your partner (under your influence) denies any form of contact between me and my sisters in case i ""corrupt them"", because, like you said, you have to worry about what i'm going to indoctrinate them with, while at the same time pushing a religion onto them, is the last straw.

You have known, and still know MANY gay/bi/lesbian/trans people in your life, and you haven't had a problem with them, but now, since you decided to go ""balls to the wall"" christian, you've been nothing but filled with hate for your fellow man.

In fact, there is 1 person that instantly comes to mind that shows the sort of piece of shit you are. When ""PL"" asked you to look after some money he was illegally hiding from his bankruptcy proceedings, you did the good christian thing, and stole it. 

Another friendship nuked.

What about when you were running that group, and we had a group meeting at the football club, and i told you that you need to do proper accounts, cause if someone says that you are stealing money, you're going to want to prove that instantly as false?

Both you and ""Boulanger"" both said that it will never happen, because we're all friends.

Surprise, years later, after you've been caught stealing money from the group to fund your lifestyle, you refuse to show anyone the books, and that nukes the group.

Multiple friendships all over the country nuked.

What about when your neighbour died, and you decided to help yourself to her carpets, because ""she doesn't need them, and the council will just throw them out, so i might as well have them!"". Aside from the fact that you technically committed breaking and entering, even if you had the keys to the place, you had no right in going in there, and you certainly had no right in removing her possessions, even if it was just a carpet.

This is why you will end up dying old and alone, with what friends you did have dying years previous, and I'm half expecting a phone call from you, asking me to forgive you, now that your death bed has finally made you ""see the light"".

So consider this my reply to your future phone call, or if you happen upon this while posting your religious bullshit on Facebook that NO ONE SEES.

There is no amount of work you can put in to repairing this ""relationship"" we had, the back this camel had was very sturdy, but after decades of abuse and shit, has finally broke.

Fuck you, you irredeemable sack of shit.

Also, I suggest that you remove me from your next of kin details at the hospital, i would hate to have to walk in and show the doctors the email where you stated clearly, that you don't agree with western medicine and all you need is Jesus's love, and that you wouldn't want to be kept alive artificially.

An email like that could be used to instantly stop any attempts to save your life under religious grounds, which considering your current heart issues..."
LAAWTG,asktransgender,"I feel like I started living as a woman without thinking about why I was doing it, etc.","Hence the title, I've been living as a woman for some time now and ever since I have done this, it has caused me to ask alot of questions. One of which was, ""why do I start on living as a woman when I was completely fine as a man"". I'll be honest, I think it might of been a little bit of an attention thing because I never got attention when living as a boy from men or women and when I first got it (as a woman) it felt great.

This was how casual me ""coming out"" was. I had literally just finished watching a programme on the youngest transgender person ever recorded to ever undergo a sex change and I kid you not, literally after that went off I went to everyone and said ""I want a sex change"". I do think I have OCD but, I'm scared. I don't know what of who I am. I don't know why I evdn started living as a woman! I do honestly think it was an attention thing.

Hi,
i'm currently still waiting to get started with hrt, so srs probably won't happen within the next few years. Still, i keep wondering about the long-term consequences...

While i think i kind of have a grasp on the worst downsides (infertility, dilating, body can't produce sexual hormones anymore), there's this one comparedly small issue that keeps my head spinning:

What about self-lubrication, or rather the lack thereof?

Of course, i have already learned from this sub that there are also operation methods that allow you to get wet after srs but as i understand it, those don't seem to be very common and i honestly doubt that flying to thailand to visit a specific doctor will be an option for me. So, i try to imagine the worse case for now, which brings me to my question:

Those of you who have gone through srs and can't get wet: How do you handle it?

Since my first girlfriend had the same problem, even though she was cis, i know that it's not much of a problem when in a relationship. (To me, it felt a bit weird to have to use lube whenever we had sex but i can handle being ""responsible"" for that amount of weirdness.)

But what do you do if you want to spontanously hook up with some guy in a club or bar? Would you always have to carry some lube with you because without it, you can't have sex or am i picturing this way more dramatic than it actually is?

All of this is making me feel very defensive about everything and closed off. I'm apprehensive to even think about people as attractive or to pursue them cause I know it won't turn out the way I want. It never matters who I like or how ambitious and high achieving I am or how well I'm able to present and take care of myself or how good of a girlfriend I might be.

In that thread is a plot showing the blood serum levels of Oestradiol for:

- 1mg dose, Sublingually administrated

- 0.5mg dose, Sublingually administrated

- 0.25mg dose, Sublingually administrated

- 1mg dose, Orally administrated

- 0.5mg dose, Orally administrated


The dose of 1mg, sublingually administered every 12 hours will be of focus in this thread. Also, paging u/justsallygirl - may be able to shed some light on this.


What I'm wondering is what mechanism delivers diminishing returns on the processing of 17b-oestradiol when administered exogenously?

zephrtesk,asktransgender,A question for those of you with mental illnesses that supposedly have gender variation: are your symptoms/behaviors those of your assigned gender or your real gender?,"All of this is based on what I know, I’m no expert and if you see something plainly wrong please correct me.

I have schizotypal disorder and severe ADHD. From what I understand, boys with ADHD generally show more symptoms in early childhood, are more aggressive, and are more likely to develop compulsions, while girls’ ADHD tends to appear in adolescence and often comes packaged with social anxiety and introversion. Schizotypal disorder supposedly has much less gender variation, but apparently boys are more likely to develop bizarre language/speech patterns, be unable to form close friendships, and have more trouble expressing emotions, while girls are more likely to be socially anxious and slightly more inclined towards maintaining strange beliefs. 

My personal behaviors in both cases are pretty conclusively male-leaning. I was wondering, then, just out of interest, if it’s very common among trans people to have mental illness-related tendencies particular to their real gender rather than their assigned one. What are your experiences?"

eliza_silver,asktransgender,Need some advice on dealing with some stressors,"Hi all,

I...uh, really like reading romances. Not the sappy, bullshitty kind, but just stories with romantic ties to them. Initially it was just a generic guy + girl romance, but after I kinda came out to myself, I've been gravitating to the lesbian kind. Thing is, reading has become a sort of double edged sword for me. I really enjoy the happy feelings that come with reading stories with happy couples and moments, but at the same time, I'm always bogged down by anxiety and what you could call dysphoria. 

I can't ever see myself as one of the women in the stories. Sure, one day in the future, I might see myself as a woman. I might be able to call myself a lesbian. But it doesn't feel...right. Authentic. I guess it boils down to considering myself fake, not really a woman, and not really deserving of happy stuff.

Aside from just quitting reading those stories (which I really don't want to since they make me pretty happy and my inner sappy romantic needs her fuel every once in a while), I don't really know how I can go about combating the dysphoria, sadness, and the immense sense of longing I get from the stories.

Any and all help and advice would be appreciated. And yeah, this is a very silly and minor thing that's bothering me, but it does affect me pretty strongly. "

TurdFerg78,asktransgender,I feel like I'm two different people.,"  For almost my entire adult life and some of my childhood I have known that I am ""different"". I am, what many consider to be, a handsome man. I have two amazing sons who are the best parts of my life. I never lack for having a girlfriend (and yes, I prefer females). But underneath all of that, I have never really been comfortable with my male form. I started to realize that as looked at women in everyday life, I wasn't just attracted to them, I was jealous of them. I wanted to be them. Dress in cute clothes, do my makeup, wear a feminine hair style. I yearn to have a woman's body. 

  The problem is, that this feeling seems to come and go at times. Sometimes I think I can deal with and should just continue to be a man. No worries about losing loved ones or being discriminated against for being a transfemale. Other times I am so positive that I am really a woman that I can't stand it. I have started and stopped hormones several times, sometimes diy and recently under Dr's supervision. I have been and am still going to therapy. Through all of that I am still completely uncertain what direction to go in. I literally feel like I am two different people fighting each other every day. It is a miserable feeling. What am I?? "

eliza_silver,asktransgender,An interesting conversation with my mother and then my sister.,"So, I did a big thing yesterday. I went and got my earlobes pierced without asking for approval from the good old parental units. I come back home to my mother staring at me. 

""Do you like the piercings Ma?""

""It's okay.""

""I feel great! They look lovely!""

""Okay.""


She goes back to cooking. A few minutes later. 

""You seem to be on a roll son.""

""Hm? What do you mean?""

""Leather jacket, ear piercings, fancy boots, you get your eyebrows done, you use beauty products. I don't know why you're trying so hard to be different.""

""Well...I've looked and felt the same for 20 years. I figured it was about time I change.""

""But you're you. You shouldn't change. This is just a phase. It'll run off soon.""


Internally I chuckled. She's uncomfortable with me learning to love myself and be more autonomous. But she finds the need to use ""parental wisdom"" to tether me to what she prefers. 


""Ma, I'm 21. I don't really think you and Pa should expect me to listen to you both. I respect you both, but I am going to live life on my terms.""

""That's all the respect we get eh? After all we've done?""

""Did I ask to be born? You threw me into this mess. And the chances are pretty high that you two are going to die first. I'd rather live those 20 years after with no regrets, on my own terms.""

""So be it son.""


I then head upstairs and chat with my little sister. 


""Hey kiddo, how are you? How was school?"" 

""Hey! It went well. What about you?""

""I'm a bit anxious. About being...trans.""

""You're fine.""

""Are you okay with having a sister then?"" 

She simply chuckled. ""Of course. Why wouldn't I?""

I just kinda nodded and walked into my room.

transthrowaway5356,asktransgender,Questions about moving to Germany from another EU country,"I'm pre-HRT and have not been officially diagnosed as a trans woman in my home country.

I'm planning on moving to Germany to move in with my boyfriend eventually. He's straight but he said he won't care that I'm pre-HRT.

We're short on money though. I heard that German citizens get a great cost reduction during doctor visits after paying for health insurance (I also heard that it's obligatory to pay for health insurance there now, anyway), but what about non-citizens? Would doctor visits cost me way more because I do not have German citizenship?

Should I theoretically be able to acquire hormones just as ""fast"" as citizens?

What about if no? Is DIY relatively safe (from a legal point of view) in Germany?

I assume SRS won't be paid for by insurance since I'm not a citizen. I assume I cannot even be put onto waiting lists for SRS? What about after acquiring citizenship?

And lastly, I heard one can acquire citizenship sooner through marriage. But gay marriage is still not legal in Germany, although it's recognized if it's done in another country. But would gay marriage done in another country affect how much sooner one could get citizenship in Germany? (In either case, I don't intend on pushing marriage per se, but yeah.)

Any information is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance."
doughaway7562,asktransgender,My experience with US Passport agency + some tips.,"I applied for a passport and got a email/letter back that my identification wasn't enough to identify me (my driver's license). I ended up calling the National Passport Information Center (1-877-487-2778) and asked them about the letter. 

The lady immediately escalated it to her supervisor. He turned out to be trans ally. He told me the understood the rush, and sent a message to the facility to the New Hampshire location to get it done before the end of the year, and figured it was due to my gender marker on my ID. I asked him if I should send information preemptively, and he said it wouldn't hurt, and left me a few tips. He told me to make sure I'm sending it to the New Hampshire location (their expedited location), or the the documents would end up taking a few more days to travel. He also told me to put my reference number (RE: ########) and ""Expedite"" (Expedited?) on the front of the envelope, which he says will speed up the process in sorting. He also recommended a trackable service, ""Priority mail is great for that"". 


I got a call a few hours later, and the lady asked for secondary forms of identification. Apparently this was before the supervisor's message made it through. I asked her if this was routine, and she said yes, they will call people with expedited passports if there is a problem, as they get special treatment.

A few business days later, a supervisor from New Hampshire told me ""Your passport will be there tomorrow, the problem was your gender marker on your ID didn't match, which shouldn't be a problem, so he personally committed it to go through.

TL;DR

* The US Passport agency has allies!

* If you can afford it, definitely **apply for expedited**. You'll get special treatment.

* Although it is not supposed to matter, a mismatching gender marker on your ID may hold up your passport.

* You do not need a reason or travel date to expedite

* If you need to send documents AND your're expedited, send it on a trackable service (like USPS Priority/Express mail) and write your reference #and ""Expedite"" on it. 
* If you're expedited, make sure to send to the New Hampshire facility:

Kerr94,asktransgender,"After you picked a new name, did you stick with it or end up changing your mind later?","I don't hate my birth name but it's almost universally read as male so I want to change it. So when it comes to picking a new name I've settled on Riley, and have for a couple of months but it still doesn't feel like it's me, like it's my name in any meaningful sense. More like it's just a name. Which might just be because I haven't switched over to it and I'll get used to it in time when I do. But at the same time, while I know this is silly, picking a new name now feels very final. Like I need to be 100% sure on what I want my name to be forever before I start asking anyone to call me by it.   

So what I'm wondering is this, have any of you changed your name multiple times? Like you picked a new name, used it for a bit but then changed it to something else? How did people react to that?

I'm probably just worrying about nothing, there's nothing concrete until legal documents and that would be ages away. But I worry I might just be settling on a name which I think is fine rather than picking one which truly resonates as *me*. If such a name even exists."

Jazz8680,asktransgender,Emotional rollercoaster?,"Yes thats not a real question. It all suddenly clicked a week or so ago and I've been having this emotional rollercoaster ever since. My roommates all left for winter break so that has given me the opportunity to lounge around the house in makeup and female clothing. I think I'm STILL in denial about being trans, even though I think I WANT to be. There have been minutes where I feel super excited and happy that I've found who I truly am and have put a name on that weird feeling in the back of my head I have felt my whole life. But the next minute I'll be sad that I had to turn out this way. Then I'll feel sad because I look nothing like a woman. Then I'll be happy at the prospect of someday getting hormones and being treated like a woman. 

Its all going on super fast in my head and I don't know what to make of it. Any thoughts?"
GlitchiDawn,asktransgender,I'm so close to just giving in and ending it.,"I really can't do it anymore. I don't know if I'm making this post as a cry for help or an outlet to vent, but I'm so close to killing myself. I'm not trying to get attention, but I've really lost all hope as far as being able to live an emotionally balanced ""normal"" life.

It's been roughly 2 years of HRT and even longer as far as social transition. 

As of now:

* I still get harassed in public.
* I still get called sir everywhere I go.
* I haven't changed physically from 2 years ago at all with the exception of breast growth (And hair growth and clothing).
* I don't even have a slim chance of affording FFS.

I don't even do anything out of the ordinary. I try so fucking hard to just *blend in,* but someone has laughed and pointed at me every time I've tried to go out anywhere in the past 1 month I've been out of treatment.

I'm so sick of people telling me bullshit lies to try and make me feel better when all it could possibly do is fool me into a false sense of security that's going to be broken as soon as I step outside into the real world.

If one more person tells me I'm beautiful and pass perfectly I'm going to lose my shit. Stop lying to me.

Look, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to make a big deal out of this but I really need something, just anything really. 

I feel so alone when I see countless posts of people passing and doing great in their transition. It's so depressing.

Sorry. Thanks.

AlisonWood,asktransgender,My experience with HRT and fertility...,"Let me start by saying that of course YMMV and I know some girls have had different experiences on HRT, but for those of you worried about fertility, thought it might serve others to share my experience.

I've been on HRT over 6 months, up to 4 E/200 spiro per day. My partner and I have been working on trying to get her pregnant...recently we visited a fertility clinic to see what is going on.

Like many have reported, my semen looks different than it did before HRC. Although, I still produce some (know some girls go dry on HRT). 

Before going on HRT my endo assured me that it shouldn't effect fertility. When I asked the doctors at the fertility clinic if I should go off HRT right now to save my fertility - they were very much like, ""let's wait and see what the test says first.""

I was sure my fertility report was going to come back saying that I was shooting blanks. However, much to my surprise, it was fine. This clinic even had records from similar test I took over 5 years ago, way before I was on HRT (and when I was 5 years younger). My current test results where just a little lower than that one.

So...the point of all this is...especially for those of you worried about taking HRT because you don't want to mess up your fertility: talk to your doctor...they may know what they are talking about.

As with so many things about transitioning, sometimes the information we have and/or the assumptions we make don't always turn out to be right. 

For any who read this who have had a different experience, don't mean to rub it in. But was so surprised by this experience, felt obliged to share."
RoidsVSestrogen,asktransgender,I either want to be extremely manly or a feminine girl (mtf),"So a little backstory, I've known I wanted to be a girl from age 5. I am 25 now.

I work as a fitness model now and make a great income, can pretty much get any girl I want (not bragging, but just trying to explain what it's like right now). But I still feel like my life is pointless because I feel like I'm just an actor playing a role, instead of being myself. 

But the change from extremely masculine to feminine seems so far away, I don't know what to do with my life if I were to cut out going to the gym, challenging myself daily.

I will start my transition and I will be far away from my family and friends (my friends support me but my family don't know anything about it yet).
I think it can be really tough, but at the same time it would be really hard to transition in Italy, cause it is a really transphobic country, and I think I would not even be able to find a job as a trans person in Italy.
So it would be an hard choice anyway.

And my legs are always irritated. Especially when I shave them. Like, I shave and I get bad razor burn every time. Little red dots, some scabs from cuts, general redness, and what looks like some ingrown hairs. 

And my arm pits seem to always be red and irritated from shaving.

Danisel,asktransgender,"Soy un hombre y con novia en sociedad, pero siento ganas de ser mujer en secreto","Hola, pido disulpas por escribir en español, pero es el reddit mas completo que he encontrado.
Si alguien puede ayudarme o traducirlo lo agradecería.
Soy fisicamente hombre, tengo novia y trabajo como ingeniero. Desde chico comenze masturbandome con ropa de mujer.
Cuando conoci a mi novia, esta forma de placer desparecio y solo tenia relaciones con ella.
Pero despues de 1 año empecé a sentir impulsos de ser cualquier mujer bonita que veia en la calle.
Esto fue creciendo, cada día. Se siente una angustia interna, una desesperación, y siento que solo encuentro paz si estoy en estado femenino, con el cuerpo de una mujer. A veces voy tranquilamente por la calle o en mi oficina, y cuando veo a alguna secretaria o otra mujer me fijo en su ropa, en su maquillaje, y siento el deseo de vestir como ellas, de ir caminando con vestido y tacos. Cuando imagino esto es como si flotara en el aire. Cuando imagino que no tengo nada entre las piernas siento alivio, un descanso, siento comodidad. Y cuando me imagino que tengo senos siento placer, quisiera tenerlos, sentir su peso y su  movimiento en mi pecho.
Pero todo lo que siento ahora lo escondo. Todos me ven como alguien normal, incluso a veces mas masculino que el resto.
Siento que hay algo dentro de mi que quiere salir, pero tengo miedo. No quiero que la gente me odie y que mi novia me deje.Cuando reprimo esto por mucho tiempo me siento irritable. A veces reprimo esto por mucho tiempo, y repentinamente los deseos desparecen, pero cuando pasa esto me siento deprimido, siento un nudo en el estomago. Me siento cansado y el cuerpo me pesa.
Tambien estoy preocupado por mi novia. Siento que ya no me atrae tanto fisicamente como antes. Siento que algo esta cambiando poco a poco.
Cuando tengo relaciones imagino que soy mujer. Imagino que otra mujer me dice ""eres una mujer!"" ""debes usar brasier!"" ""sientate con las piernas juntas!"", pero no pienso en mi novia.
Perdon por lo que voy a decir, pero necesito desahogarme. Cuando me estimulo imagino que tengo vagina, que alguien sube mi vestido y me penetra, incluso que termina dentro de mi.Me imagino abriendo las piernas y luego cerrandolas y vistiendome femeninamente despues de tener relaciones.
Una forma de salida a todo esto es viendo moda femenina en Pinteres. Alli busco vestidos, maquillaje, joyas, y me imagino ser esas mujeres. Me llama la atención que una de las cosas que mas me gustan son los vestidos de novia. Los encuentro hermosos.
A pesar de todo esto, siento que no me gustan los hombres, pero algo extraño pasa ahí.
Siento que no tengo tanto instinto de penetrar, pero mas de ser penetrada.
Se que lo que he dicho obviamente corresponde a ser Trans, pero quiero su opinion y si alguien ha vivido lo mismo.
Esscribo por que es la unica forma en que puedo contar esto libremente, con menos miedo, aunque de todas maneras siento miedo y verguenza de que me digan que soy un degenerado.


Muchas gracias.

tgpineapple,asktransgender,How can you tell if/when someone is just being nice to you?,"Half rant and half genuinely wanting answers. Today I was sir'd. Usually I don't get called by any title sir or ma'am. It might just be my country or what I look like, I do not know (Australia). Last time I went out, the waiter used sir/ma'am for everyone except me. He just looked at me and didn't say anything. It might be because I already had his attention, or maybe he didn't want to insult me. 

I'm out to all of my friends. My friends that I ask, or by chance, all tell me that I look female to them. My brother describes me as andro-femme. I'm too chicken to ask my male friends. My female friends see me as female. They use the correct pronouns all the time in front of everyone and use the right name (that's the only name they know me by so it's ok). One said I should stop wearing boy clothes because it looks weird and I pressed her on if that was what she really thought. She sounded offended and I immediately apologises. It was rude. 

My brothers friends constantly joke that I look like his sister, but I asked what he thought. He said I don't look like a girl. That works fine. But then sometimes he says I look like a girl because of my hair. I can't trust what he says. That's fine. 

In some bursts of stupidity I get brave enough to put my face out there sometimes and people say I look like female (in the few times I've done it) but you wouldn't be so cruel to say ""you look like a guy"" to a woman you know is already feeling down. And there's the cross-race effect and my race is categorised as more feminine by people so people think that it's easier to pass but they can't pick up the cues. Reddit can be nice sometimes and lie to you to make you feel good. Or not say the whole truth, picking up on details to compliment without saying what they think. 

I don't want to think people are lying to me. But at the same time I don't think I look like my gender. I guess a lot of us struggle with this. I can't tell who's telling the truth and who's being nice.

Jooleea,asktransgender,"Dad is supportive, but wants me to wait to start HRT","I was terrified of coming out to my dad after my mom reacted quite badly, but it turned out much better. He said he didn't really know much about the subject besides the really basic stuff, so I did my best to explain it to him. 


He spoke with my therapist a few days ago and, although his reaction has been miles better than expected, he doesn't want me to tell other people in my family or start HRT for a bit, until he's ready. 

I have started DIY on a low dose (which I haven't told him), but I would like to start the treatment the proper way as soon as possible. With that in mind, I'm not really sure what I can do to get the importance of starting this sooner rather than later across to him. 

Anyone had a similar experience or has an idea of what I could try?"

He fears that one day, a trans woman will 'trick' him. Like, he'll fall in love with a girl and then oops, she has a penis (his words not mine, I know there's srs, and I know not everyone has it).

What can I do/say to get him to understand? He's one of the reasons i'm afraid of coming out.

lecrazyunt,asktransgender,Female wig recommendations?,"Hi! My hair is pretty short and I've already started HRT. 

From those of you who bought human wigs online, any recommendations? 

I've used wigs before and am very familiar with good quality synthetic wigs and techniques to make them blend into your hair and stuff.  But I've never bought a human hair wig. i'm skeptical of some of these online wig stores that sell human wigs (at a costly price but not as pricey as others) because many say they're from Chinese retailers that often rip them off, have crappy return policies, and give products that don't meet standards. I don't really have much disposable money to lavish on a wig that will disappoint.

I'm almost 23 now, but I feel like I need to transition.. Is it 'too late' for me? My fear is starting up HRT and ending up in an androgynous limbo in which I cannot pass.

TrueHOAS,asktransgender,My height triggers my dysphoria so bad,"I am 16 years old and now 1,77 m (5'10""). I live in Germany and most women I've seen are between 1,58m (5'2"") and 1,66 m (5'5""). There are just a few that reach 1,70 m 5'7"". But I think the bigger problem is that I am taller than alot of guys. The guys say that they would only date girls that are 1,66 m or smaller because they look alot more feminine and they feel more powerful around them. Wearing heels would make me as tall as these really big guys. I would probably feel alot more feminine too when I would be smaller.

So the fact that my height could give away that I am trans, is seen as unattractive, doesn't allow me to wear heels and makes me feel alot less feminine and feel like I am not a part of the normal girls. I've seen alot of trans that are this small or in my class are a few that are this small, why must I be forsaken?"

violaceous_trogon,asktransgender,How to accept help transitioning?,"I've recently come to the realization that I have really awesome friends.

But I **always** say no.

Deep down, I think it's because I was raised to be a subconsciously proud person. Though my parents are by no means rich, my mom was raised in a wealthy family and passed a little bit of that snooty attitude onto me. Deep down I think I equate charity with pity; i *think* i think that if people offer you stuff for free it means they think you're too low to get it yourself. I should note that this is all internalized; I don't think anything of the sort when I give to others or others give to others.

And thing is, I *am* a really poor, objectively lower-class person. I have a low-paying low-hours job that barely covers food, gas, and medicine. Even if I do get another job, i'll still be poor. So like it or not I *need* their help.

I know i'm really blessed to have such kind friends. I sometimes feel like i'm insulting them by not accepting their help. But I can't bring myself to say ""yes, please help me"". What can I do to swallow my pride?"

23Dec,asktransgender,Should I be concerned if my 7 y/o nephew had the same sign of being trans as I did?,"I met up with my family over Christmas, and I have one niece and one nephew, one aged 13(Female) and one aged 7 (Male). I'm going to call them Lauren and Sam.


So Lauren tried to convince Sam to put make-up on, and I was there. Sam seemed really excited to try make up on. Sam said he hated it (although I could tell he liked it).


I haven't told anyone about my gender dypshoria, no one actually knows that I have it. Everyone thinks I'm just like any 16 year old boy.


But, when I was his age my sister did the exact same thing to me, and I liked it as well. I remember really wanting to wear that dress outside, but I knew I couldn't because I was a boy, and thinking it was wrong for me. I just ignored it, and I never thought much about it until recently.


It makes me wonder, could this be an early sign for him, or am I just being paranoid? I thought a 7 year old boy would hate make-up, wearing a dress, but he clearly liked it. Same for when my sister did it to me.


I'm not going to say anything, I am probably being paranoid. Maybe all 6 year old's like it. But it's almost exactly the same sign I had, and very similar age too. "
RileighY,asktransgender,Do the feelings always come back?

As I've been progressing with the early stages of my transition (coming out and getting an appointment with a GIC) my doubts have been getting stronger and it makes me think maybe it was just something I had to work through? what also doesnt help is that there were times where I was okay and fairly happy being male, so why do I keep wanting to transition?

TL;DR - Doubts getting stronger, think I could be alright sticking with dudemode, feelings likely to come back anyway? probably a stupid question -__-"
Wavooka,asktransgender,To those of us with noticeable raphes + foreskins: Does the raphe 'extend' through to the inside of the foreskin?,"That is, does your raphe continue to the tip of your bits and then 'wrap around' so that it is noticeable on the inner skin? Or is it not noticeable on the inner skin at all?

Edit: It'd be helpful if you mention whether your were circumcised or not. The thread is worded making that assumption, but it helps to be sure.

I ask because I'm currently 'restoring' my foreskin. Since I have a really pronounced raphe and the way I'm tugging, what will become the restored part of the inner skin will have raised raphe running through it. As it is now, my raphe continues past my circumcision scar to what remains of my frenulum.

NB: To all the FAAB peeps here: I tried to be as inclusive as possible asking this anatomical question. So feel free to chime in with your experiences/knowledge.

HyphenScribe,asktransgender,I'm a year in on HRT (MtF) and my body hair is as bad as ever... Help?,"Hey folks,

I go by Vivian, and my parents tell me I have a lot of northern European blood in me, and that's what I can blame this coarse, thick body hair on. My legs, butt, lower back, arms, and chest all grow hair that is dark dark brown, coarse as my facial hair, and moderately thick. HRT has not helped me yet, despite me growing breasts (nearly a B38, woo!) And getting a bit curvier in general. 

My question is really this: people who had hair like mine, did you still have it all at this point in your transition? If yes, do you now? What did you do to get rid of it, or still do now? I know this sort of question is asked frequently, but a year for a lot of people seems to be enough time, and I'm wondering if I should keep waiting and hoping, or just start electrolysis, because shaving just leaves me with a dark shadow on my snow-white skin, making it damn hard to wear cute low cut tops :/

Never been attracted to other guys in my entire life but recently I noticed I've been becoming more and more attracted to a friend of mine who is transgender female to male and gay. I met him 6 months ago and he's been on T for a while so when I saw him I just thought he was a guy, I didn't really find out he was transgender after we kept talking for a while and he told me. He's a pretty cool guy and I really like hanging out with him. I'm just worried I might be attracted to him for the wrong reasons, even though I easily assumed he was a guy just by looking at him he has a lot of ""feminine"" qualities(not really physical, but in terms of his expressions and voice) and he's very graceful and sweet. I don't want to have something progress into a serious relationship only to find out I was only attracted to him for the things he wants to change about himself. I'm sorry if I sound a little insensitive right now, I'm trying to learn. I've never been homophobic, or afraid of being gay myself but I just never saw myself as gay because I've never been attracted to guys, I've always been with girls and loved it. So yeah while this is a little new I'm not really scared, I'm open for it and I want to make sure that these feelings aren't misguided so that I don't end up getting hurt or hurt him.

Also, I don't think the attraction is physical(well it is, he's a pretty guy I can admit) but by that I mean I don't think I'm attracted to his female qualities because there really aren't many. He's just a slender guy with short hair, no boobs or anything like that. You can go swimming with him and not bat an eye, so I don't think that's where the attraction comes from."

rightsomeofthetime,asktransgender,Questions about re-meeting a transgender friend after transition,"Hi all, thanks for reading. Basically I want to know if there is any standard etiquette when meeting a transgender person for the first time after their transition.

Just for some context, I'm male, and the transgender person has transitioned to female. She is a step family member who I always got along great with, but we never catch up apart from at family gatherings. Obviously family members have filled me in on her transition to female and what her name is now, but I haven't seen her in a few years, and it's been over a year since the transition.

I guess I'm a bit confused as to how much she would consider herself to be the same person as before - like is she likely to want to reintroduce herself, or do we just jump in and continue our friendship as it was?

And if we are going to do a reintroduction, do I pretend to know nothing and let her introduce herself, even though it will be obvious to both of us that the family would have already filled me in?

I'm confident that we'll get along as great as we always have once my anxiety about doing something offensive at the initial introduction is out of the way. But what if we get to talking about stories from the past? Is there any terminology I should be aware of? For instance is it okay to say ""Hey remember when you did this when you were Billy-Bob"", or is it okay to say ""Remember when you did this"" even though they had a different name and gender back then, or should it be more like ""Remember when Billy-Bob did this...""

I understand the answers to these questions will probably be different for different people, and I'm pretty confident that I'm not going to offend her if I'm simply authentic and respectful, but I just wanted to pose this here for peace of mind and to make sure I'm not about to commit some huge no-no!

Thanks again y'all!"
likeClockwork7,asktransgender,Just looking back on a sign from Boku Girl (not a question),"I began questioning shortly after reading the manga Boku Girl, wherein a feminine-looking male high school student one day wakes up to find that he(?) has been magically turned into a girl overnight.

When this happened I thought ""Oh, that must be awful! To have a nice girl's body and then suddenly be back to having a guy's body with a penis and stuff :(""

Of course, the protagonist has been trying for *the entire manga before now* to get back to being male, and so he's really excited about it. To me that was genuinely confusing.

I don't know how to describe it, but when I'm out with friends or family or just out in public in general, I don't care how other people see me because I'm not worrying about my gender necessarily. I'm just a human like all the other human out there. However, when I'm at home by myself, I get really dysphoric.

LostTrans,asktransgender,Please help me ! I'm desperate,"Hi everyone let me present myself first,
I am a 19 years old trans girl, i have been a long time lurker here but this is my first post.

I am actually living in Canada on a study permit, i have started hrt 6 months ago.


Last week i have made the biggest mistake of my life, i came out to my parents who are still living in my home country which is Morocco.

My parents are Muslims, they are so religious and they never miss a single prayer, when i was still back there i was forced to go with my father to the mosque every day.

I knew that i was transgender for a long long time but i was never able to tell them back then. When i finished high school i did all of my possible to study abroad so that i can finally transition and be the girl i have always dreamed of.

After i came out last week, my parents called and just said ""You are not my son anymore, i regret sending you  abroad and spending all this money on you. You are now a shame for the family and i cannot tolerate this. You are now on your own, and one last thing don't ever bother calling back you are dead for us now"".

I was so afraid, i tried to call them back multiple times but as soon as they heard my voice they hung up on me.

I am now so desperate, As of now i have no job and i don't know even how to get one as i never worked in my life and my study permit only allows me to work up to 20 hours a week. In top of that, i should pay a $7000 tuition fee each session. It's really impossible to do this on my own.

I think i am going to drop of my school because i cannot afford all of this, but the problem is my study permit expires in the first day of march 2017, and because i will drop out of school i cannot renew it and i will be illegally staying in Canada, i'm so afraid of being deported, i will rather die than going back to my home country because transitioning there is impossible.

As of now, i have $2600 CAD left. I think i can afford living for another 3 months but what can i do afterward, after my study permit expires i won't have the right to work anymore. I'm so fuck*** desperate now that i can't even think clearly. I wish that i have the strength to end my life and this misery.

I'm so sorry for the rant and for bothering all of you with my problems."
stardropTabletop,asktransgender,How should I deal with hostel bathrooms in Japan?,"Okay, so this is kind of a follow-up to a question I posted several days ago, but I'm currently traveling in Japan and I'm about to leave a friend's apartment to visit a couple of other cities (Kyoto and Tokyo) before I go back home. Thing is, I'm going to be staying in hostels in both cities, and since I wasn't able to get my gender marker changed on my passport before coming to Japan, I ended up registering as guy.

This whole situation has now become compounded by the apparent fact that I simply don't look like a guy anymore, something I was completely unaware of until I last posted on here about a really uncomfortable experience I had in a men's bathroom in Japan (here's the link to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5hpo1u/uncomfortable_experience_in_the_mens_room_while/). I've been using single-stall women's bathrooms for the past four days, but now I'm probably going to be in a situation where both bathrooms *and* showers are gendered, the hostel staff consider me to be a guy because of my papers, and the guests...well, I'm honestly not sure what they're going to think of me as.

How should I navigate this situation? Do I somehow notify the front desk what's going on with me? Do I just go ahead and use/shower in female bathrooms? I'm honestly so overwhelmed by this situation, and I didn't realize how much of a grey area it was until today."
[deleted],asktransgender,So how do I get the strength to get the ball moving,"Hi, trans mtf here. Lately I've been struggling with really getting the ball moving towards taking the necessary steps to come out to the world and start living full-time as myself.

Here are my fears:

* I am an infantryman (infantryperson?) in an all male unit in the army national guard. I am really afraid of facing discrimination, I've heard some really terrible shit while on drill.

* I work full time as a carpenter and am nervous of losing my employment. My company is fairly large though and does have an HR department.

* I am afraid women will no longer find me attractive.

Why I must transition:

* I am a recovering alcoholic and am heavily invested in AA. I realize coming to terms with being trans is essential to long term sobriety.

* I have been crossdressing all my life and I am tired of being ashamed and dysphoric.

* I came out as trans six years ago to close friends and family but was overcome by fear and couldn't quite do it.

* I want to hit the point of no return. GOD this feels so liberating. 

* I have been self medicating hrt for the past 6 months and I have never been happier.

* I really just want to be happy.

Please any advice is greatly appreciated. I have just been feeling really lost lately and need a little push to get started. 

PS: sorry for the format of this post. I've lurked reddit for years and I never really speak up.

Marla__,asktransgender,Anyone else self conscious of their voice?,"Im transgender, obviously, and im super self conscious about everything. More so my voice and how that is going to sound. Im a VERY big person standing at 6'7"" and i have the voice to match. While my size does cause a bit of anxiety about transition, i can live with that. The biggest problem is that i dont know how my voice is going to end up sounding. I have been trying to practice it, but it just doesnt sound the way i want it to and makes me incredibly dysphoric. I want to know if anyone else has felt this way and has eventually dealt with it. I am pre HRT and wont be on it till at least september 2017. I know voice doesn't change much if at all, but its still the biggest concern i have with transitioning when i do end up doing it.

In my case, I really didn't want chest development from E. I already had preexisting gynecomastia from a medical condition, and I really didn't want anymore. I'm actually looking into my options for top surgery after development's done in a few years. When my sibling was considering T they really didn't want facial hair; it really skeeved them out. Likewise, a friend said that he wasn't keen on facial hair.

So yup, if applicable, what didn't you want?

I've noticed that within an hour of my doses, my nipples get pretty sensitive (nothing too crazy though). But towards the end of the 12 hour gap, nipple sensitivity is virtually nil.

It makes sense that estradiol would have the most effect shortly after it's absorbed, and it would slowly diminish at the body metabolizes it. I'm just curious if the loss of sensitivity is common towards time to take another dose, or if it means my levels could be dropping below ideal levels."

Anyway, my genital dysphoria comes and goes, but whenever I try to masturbate lately I get really sad. Like, I get an erection and suddenly my nipple play gets wasted and I feel like I want to stop altogether and cry because it feels wrong. Like the arousal should not be external? I don't know how to describe it, but I don't like it. I usually just push through and do it anyway, but yeah. 

I've also been getting more random erections this past week or so, and while they're an annoyance, they don't make me sad because they're not happening when I'm trying to feel sexy.

I use a magic wand so I don't have to touch it, but this is frustrating because that surgery is like at the bottom of my priority list and I feel like I'm never going to have a pleasant sexual experience until I upgrade to indoor plumbing. Anyone else? Any suggestions for dealing with this?

I'm pretty nervous that he'll try to retaliate or something (oh thank goodness I'm in Oregon, where there's less chance of him being able to pull court-assisted shenanigans *fingers crossed* ). Anybody have a situation with transitioning after having separated from someone you have a kid with?

Some background:
We were never married, split up rather before my daughter was born. He's rather abusive and manipulating and more than once threatened court action against me in the past (""you'll never see her again"") if I did something he didn't like in the past, like break up with him or comment that bringing a baby back with soaking diaper, soaking pants, and bad rash was not ok. Shortly after our kid was born, he gave me sole custody (as in, we never went to court and did it by a stipulated agreement). And he used to have parental visitation (day visits primarily, some night visits) but has since emailed me saying he wasn't going to do it anymore until our daughter asked for it because she seemed to be happy and doing well with me.

I'm almost 3 months into hrt (mtf) and feeling great. The dysphoria is almost totally gone. I'm in a consistently positive and calm mood, and physical changes have thus far been minimal. I'm average height for a male, thin and somewhat athletic. I've gradually changed my style of dress to a more gender-neutral appearance that's comfortable for me.

However, now that some physical changes are beginning, I have to wonder about the outcome. I hope for the top to develop to a certain point but no further, and to achieve a sort of androgynous physique, but of course I have no way to know if it will stop there. 

I hate the thought of discontinuing E, because the psychological effect is so positive. But if I develop like some of my female relations, there will be no hiding it.

He walked into the room we were in, greeted my son and made some small talk about him, then looked at my wife since she was holding him and said ""you're mom?"" She replied yes then he looked at me and said ""also mom?"" We said yes and then this is where the confusion set in.

He was trying to get background details on potential hereditary issues so he understandably wanted to know more about us, just normal doctor questions. He asked: ""ok so who carried him?"" as if I possibly could have. Of course my wife carried him so we answered accordingly and then he started to assume she got a donor. We had to stop and clarify.... ""uh no... there wasn't a donor... we're both biological parents..."" 

Once this fact set in he laughed at himself and clarified that he was embarrassed and just showed a general sense of support and acceptance, so it all ended well!

I have been thinking about trying some stuff like make-up and girls clothing in private at home, but I have 3 problems.

The first is that I get carried away really quickly if I like something. I don't want to go running around outside in girls clothing when I'm not ready for it. Does anyone know to prevent me from doing this?

The second one is that my mom is basically 24/7 at home. This is because she got a new hip recently so she can't really do much yet. My dad is usually gone or asleep so ge won't be a problem, and he's pretty supportive (after I finally came out to him 2 days ago). My mom on the other hand seems to still be deep in denial. I really don't want to practice make-up with her seeing it, allthough girls jeans or so would be fine (I would even go out in public in them, they just look so nice with my pink shoes). When should I practice this stuff with my mom in the house at all times?

The last problem is that I need my mom to buy make-up, because I am WAY to embarrassed and scared to buy it alone. And considering my mom can't go out of the house without my dad driving her, I'm kinda fucked. Anyone have any tips? Like online shopping or so (I live in the Netherlands, if that's important to know).

Have any other MtFs tried not losing function of their penis by intentionally becoming aroused and allowing an erection to occur regularly, and how successful were you? Has anyone's penis not atrophied without doing this?

Danisel,asktransgender,Alguien se dió cuenta que era transgenero a loa 41 años?,"Hola. Perdon por escribir en español, pero es mi lengua de origen. Espero que alguien pueda contestarme. Desde los 11 años comence a masturbarme con ropa de mujer, me gustaban las mujeres y mucho, pero no me imaginaba teniendo relaciones con ellas, era algo platonico. Hasta los 39 no tuve novia formal, hasta ese momento seguía estimulandome con ropa o imaginando estar vestid@ como cualquier mujer que pase por la calle. Nunca ropa vulgar, siempre ropa elegante y bonita. Mis amores eran platonicos, pero mi caracter hacia que ellas no se fijaran en mi. Yo solo imaginaba besarlas o estar junto a ellas. Hace 4 años encontre novia formal. Al principio todo anduvo bien, aunque siempre me costó tener relaciones. Es como si no tuviera instinto de penetracion. Sin embargo ella me aceptó asi y hasta hoy estos juntos. El problema es que luego de 1 año juntos sentí que sexualmente algo me faltaba, y volvi a estimularmeben secreto. Pero esta vez las ideas fueron siendo mas fuertes. Sufrí ginefilia por varios meses, alucinaba con ser mujer, tener cuerpo de mujer, senos vagina, etc. Luego esto disminuyó un poco pero vuelve siempre. Actuo de forma masculina, pero en secreto quisiera sentir que no hay nada entre mis piernas y que mis senos rebotan al caminar. Este sentimiento va acompañado de mucho miedo, porque pienso que no voy a poder controlar esta situacion y quw terimaré tomando hormonas, operad@, y solo, sin familia ni amigos. Realmente no creo sentirme 100% mujer, aunque se que soy distinto de otros hombres. Pero al ponerme la ropa es como un switch que enciende la femeneidad. Alucino con tener cara femenina, poder maquillarme, vestirme linda, pintar mis uñas, usar aretes, etc. Cuando reprimo mis sentientos siento algo de calma, pero a ves aparece esto otro y me arrastra a la idea de ser mujer. Yo me opongo a cambiar, pero no se hasta cuando. Quisiera saber que opinan, o si alguien ha pasado por algo parecido. Gracias"

Because this happens all the time, and no one does.

Yesterday I saw some screenprints of a religious group who is targeting trans woman, who they call ""the gays"", and killing them. There were graphic photos of a dead/bashed to death girl, and I was very, very triggered. This is more recent examples that I can give.

jenn4u,asktransgender,Change in dose effects?,"So I went to my endo the other day Dec (23rd) and got my dosage upped. 100mg of spiro-&gt; 300mg and 2mg estradiol-&gt;4mg. Since then it feels like I just started HRT for the first time. In the span of a month (since 11/16) I think I saw a slight change in skin softness and maybe a better attitude, as well as more emotional. The 4 or so days on my new dose, my nighttime erections are gone, my strength has really diminished (just did 30 pushups the other day and today I could barely do 10). As well as my boobs being really sore.

So my question being, is this a result of the dose changes or rather because of it being about a month since starting?  Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but is it possible that the first dose regimen I was on, had little to no potency?

Also, if you have any noticeable changes right after upping your doses what were they?

23Dec,asktransgender,Is it bad that I'd rather be a transwoman than a cisman,"I might sound stupid, but here I go.


I really want to be transgender. I'm scared that I am cisgender, and honestly I'd rather be transgender.




I don't feel male. I can live as male fine, but I'd rather be female if I had a choice. I'd rather be a cisgender woman (but I can't) so I'd have to be either a trans-woman and a cis-man, and I'd rather be a transwoman. I'd rather live as female.


If I found out I was cisgender I think I'd probably be upset. It's almost like I am scared that I am male and not female in the inside.


I do experience some dysphoria. It gets really bad when I am alone, and I get really angry that I was born male, all I can think is how much life would be better if I where female. But sometimes I am more like ""I'd rather live as female, but being male is OK"". 


I've noticed that it often gets triggered someway or another. I can take my mind off it, such as playing a game, sleeping, watching TV, etc. But it's quite easy to get triggered. Something as little as seeing someone who is female, going on Facebook and seeing someone I know who is female, and sometimes it will go to my head randomly.


It's only been like this for the past few months, probably around September time. Ever since then, time has moved so fast. It's almost like my life is in fast-forward mode or something.


I have had signs of being trans. I always picked female friends (my first ever friend was female), I've been cross dressing since I was 6, etc.


Maybe I am making it all up in my head and I am not really trans? I do have doubt about being trans - like what if I am a confused cis-male, you know?


Before I thought about being trans, I was obsessed with transgender topics. Like, I read loads of stuff about being trans online, all about surgeries, hormones, but then the thought that maybe I am trans (I read That Was Dypshoria?). It's like I've convinced myself that I am trans, and it has made me trans.

August1453,asktransgender,So I finally spoke with my wife and told her everything...,"...and she was INCREDIBLY tolerant, loving, supportive, and understanding!!!  I am so relieved and happy, I'm beside myself.


Background:  I'm the one who posted [How do I deal with all these feelings past age 40?](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5jf303/how_do_i_deal_with_all_these_feelings_past_age_40/) a few days ago.  Amongst the many good pieces of advice I received, was the counsel to be open with my wife sooner rather than later.  So I did just that.


I didn't really plan to, it just sort of came out last night in a burst of tears and shaking and nerves and embarrassment.  She was SO understanding, and even a little humorously relieved at how ""not that big a deal"" it was.  (I think I had scared her into thinking I was about to admit to an affair or crime or something like that!)  She said she was totally fine with my expressing my female gender identity aspects when I needed to, as long as it didn't interfere with our relationship or involve anything like extramarital affairs or anything.


Thing is, I genuinely don't feel that I'm transgender.  I think perhaps a better label might be genderqueer or gender variant or something.  So I hope it doesn't offend anyone here for me to say I don't really think I'm part of the transgender community per se.  You all have been GREAT.  Kind, supportive, loving, and informative, and this is the best place for me to have come to get some advice, I think.  I thank you deeply, and I won't forget your kindness.


My wife and I both still think it would be a good idea for me to see a gender therapist, but at least for now a fair amount of the anxiety of feeling so ALONE, is gone.

Robinwolf,asktransgender,"Any other MTFs on HRT have an issue with ""wetting themselves."" (Nsfw?)","I am currently 6mo on HRT but about 2 months ago I started having a problem when urinating. I finish, wipe, even give a little lift to make sure the hose was empty before putting it away, and yet I'll get a little flow after putting my clothes back on. Sometimes it doesn't happen immediately. Sometimes it happens multiple times. I'll get a soft shiver, and I'll feel it. It's almost always enough to go through my panties and sometimes my pants. Is this normal? Should I just start wearing liners?"

tomgabriele,asktransgender,What does /r/asktransgender mean to you?,"I am new here, a cis male looking to learn more about the experience of others. I was planning on lurking for a while to learn about the sub, but figured it would be fit the spirit of the sub to just ask about it! So what does this sub mean to you?

Is this just a good place to vent and/or share stories regardless of whether they culminate in a question or not?"
Jazz8680,asktransgender,Feelings hitting like a bag of bricks just hit my head,"Hey guys, so I think I've always had a desire to be a girl (AMAB here) but I was always able to ignore it or suppress and maybe even repress it. 

I'm 22 years old, but I think I've had these feelings since I was in middle school. Something that I did when I was young that I've seen a lot of people on here do is ""pray"" or ""wish"" to god or to some other form of superbatural entity that I would wake up in the morning with the body of a girl. 

Anyway, a couple of days ago I had what felt like a ton of bricks fall into my brain at like 12:00am. I had been idly questionig my gender for a little bit, but like I said, it didn't consume me. But that night I was up till 6:00am (I also had class at 9:00am the next day too) watching videos and reading articles about what it means to be transgender. The past few days (four I think it's been? Three? I feel like I can't tell...) I've been struggling to concentrate in my classes. I'm still very confused but I'm trying to piece myself together. I've read on here that a gender therapist is the best person to talk to so I'm going to look into it. If you guys have any advise I'd really appreciate. 

My real question relates to that ton of bricks feeling. Is it unusual to have some moderate and semi-frequent desires and thoughts to be a woman, then for it to suddenly hit full force one day almost unprovoked? Did anyone else have a similar feeling and what, if I might ask, was it like? What triggered it? 

I've also been told that cis-gendered people almost never question their gender or wish to be opposite gender. This seems like such a foreign concept to me... is that what being trans is like? I know that no one but myself can decide if I'm trans, but I wouldn't mind some kind and thoughtful words of encouragement."

_Earthrise_,asktransgender,Tucking Problems,"Greetings fellow trans ladies!

So I started tucking in the summer using the usual pantyhose gaff setup, which kept everything nicely squared away at the cost of a *horrendous* pantyline from the waistband of the tights. My girlfriend pointed this out when I began presenting part-time around her, and generously offered me some of her boyshorts, which I accepted, having read many times that they're the best option for keeping you tucked. 

However, while they look amazing at first, I find that after a few minutes everything falls out and hangs like it would in guy's underwear. I'd like to not have to worry about my, er, *carry-on item*, but don't want to waddle around squeezing it between my legs all day. Am I missing a step or doing something wrong here, or is the cut of the underwear just not right? Ideally I'd like to avoid taping and be properly tucked with just women's underwear while presenting female, but that's seeming like an increasing challenge so long as I'm pre-HRT. 

What are the most effective ways to maintain a tuck throughout the day without gaffs or tape? Please let me know and I will eagerly co-opt your methods for my own purposes once I go part-time soon. 

Thanks!"
RebeccaNobody,asktransgender,What is the actual process for coming out at work?,"Okay. I've been on HRT for nearly two years. My friends know I'm Rebecca. My parents know. I'm starting to get antsy about finishing the job of coming out -  there's one more hill to climb and that's Mount Work.  

What's the actual process for coming out at work? Do I just kick down the door and say ""What up, chumps? I'm Becca now. DEAL WITH IT!"" I imagine that's inappropriate, although tremendously fun. What's the right way?

I work for a large city library system, if that makes any difference.

StevieWTF,asktransgender,"How to deal with insomnia, severe social anxiety, depression, dissociative identity disorder(DID) and terrible dysphoria at the same time? Need advice.","Hi all

My christmas sucked. Again.
I feel broken again because nothing can even make me feel better. Being happy is still a looooong way ahead. 
I need my lonelyness to stabilize my feelings. Instead I get forced to be social (not only during christmas tho). I get 0 privacy and I have a big family. 
My dad knows I' m trans and accepts it but he only increased in pointing to my manlyness. ""He only wants to help me"" (he' s a dick).
Insomnia is driving me mad. I haven't slept much.
Anxiety on overdrive. Too shy to come out (only do it for safety). Too shy to talk about it unless I' m forced and there is no other option. My 'friends' (not out to them) think trans people are a joke. I don' t even feel safe in my own bed. I trust nobody. 60% of my presents are already robbed (money and gift cards). My stomach hurts from stress and currently feeling sick like I have to vomit. No apetite.
Major depression since 12.  I'm 17 and never got helped.
DID increased. Relapsed cutting to control it. Stopped in june after recovering from suicide attempt. I can' t feel emotions. Senses are gone. No concentration. Loss of reality. Somewhat braindead.
And to top it off I got huge dysphoria. Being pre everything sucks. Waiting already one year for hormones. Can' t look into mirrors. My dad makes it worse. He' s doing it on purpose. Can' t get away from him. He follows me like a bully.
All of this is real. No exaggerating.

But hey. To be so mentally broken to not be even capable of thinking anymore (especially about suicide)  is fun. It's like an euphoric hell. 

How did y'all overcome this? I already tried so much options but I always end up like this again :/(I already present androgynous). Is waiting currently the only option?

Teejsaurus,asktransgender,How to handle when someone you're close to misgenders you around people you're stealth to? (mostly a vent),"(x posted on /r/ftm)

So my mom is in town as we have a wedding to go to this weekend. She's been pretty much fine with my transition so far. I'm on T, and pass all the time now. My voice is deep enough that it passes even on the phone now. I have a masculine haircut, I'm capable of growing facial hair, and I bind at work and when I go out so my chest is flat. I'm stealth at work, and for now would like to keep it that way. There's not any risk to me if I do have to come out at work, but I just quite enjoy being stealth. 

My dad kind of takes his cues from others, so when we're out together and someone genders me correctly as male, if he needs to use a pronoun on me around them he'll use ""he/him"". My mom however...it's like she has blinders on. We picked her up at the airport today and she called me ""she"" there, in public, and it actually made me scared. I'm not afraid some stranger will hurt me if they know I'm trans or anything, and I don't think I'm really much ashamed of being trans, I just so desperately want to live a normal life as a guy and anything that reminds me that I lived any of my life as female just makes me feel disgusting (like if some pervert tried to touch you on the train and even when they're gone you still feel horribly gross about yourself...that's the type of disgusting that I feel about myself when I'm reminded that I used to be known as female to people, like when my mom uses female pronouns on me). 

She's so proud of me for getting this job because it's a job I've been trying to get for two years. It's a sort of retail/food service-ish job, so she could come visit me at work as a customer if she wanted to. I'm so scared that since she's so proud about it that she'll feel she has to come see me in action at work. And I'm so dumb/lame I'm sure I'd say to my coworkers ""hey this is my mom!"" (one of my coworkers did this when his mom came in the other day lol, and I'm sure I'd do the same.) and she would probably respond by saying ""yea I'm her mom"". *her*. Did I mention I was stealth at work?

In that situation I'm sure whatever coworker she said that to would be like ""huh, don't you mean he? he's your son not your daughter."" Which you'd think would be the end of it and she'd just shy away and be like ""err yea"", but my mom just doesn't understand the concept of being stealth, she doesn't seem to understand the fear or danger that can come with being lgbt, especially trans, being out, etc. She wanted to join an fb group for parents of trans people a while ago and was so confused about it being a closed group and I had to remind her that hate crimes exist and extend to the internet and are a thing and are more common than cishets tend to realize. When I talk to her about things like asking my manager for time off for top surgery, she tells me not to out myself to my manager, but when she talks to other people she outs me all the time. She just like doesn't get it, but I think it's just cos she doesn't experience being trans or lgbt first hand. So if that situation happened at work instead of just being like ""err yea"" she'd respond with ""no, she's my daughter!"" 

I'm just so scared this will happen. She was talking about renting a car while she's here, since my dad will be at work with his car most days. But luckily she isn't renting a car, so I don't think she would come visit me at work (god forbid she use public transpo like some of us lol)...but there's still a strong possibility she would still show up there with my dad since I think he's taking off some work while she's here. Buuut luckily there's only two days I'm working while she's here lol, so I know I'm overreacting. I'm just worried and needed to kind of vent about this. "
dragonheart01,asktransgender,Just a thought on SRS and genetic engineering,"So I have been holding onto this idea for a while, but finally realized sharing is a lot more helpful. I was thinking about inserting the sex chromosome of target sex and ""shredding"" the chromosome that it replaces. Don't know really know how this would work, maybe using a modified polymerase complex or something for ""shredding"" the chromosome, and then using protamines to pack the chromosome in a viral shell or some other vector. Then to actually change things you would inhibit CDKN1A and remove parts of the body, like the genitals, hip bones, rib cage, or whatever you can without killing the person that differentiates between their target sex and their birth sex. You probably need a ton of painkillers or induced coma for a while. This is way out there, but the individual pieces make sense. Of course, there is a good chance of cancer and other side effects, and the regrowth may not work as well I think. What are your thoughts? This may be more fitting for a bio subreddit, but I think that the people who are actually going to use should talk about.

**EDIT**

The shredding mechanism I was thinking about is already found in nature in the form of nucleases, so another thing off the research list."

That being said, I was wanting if there is a way to make more friends with more girls before I transition.  I know that I can be friends with anyone, but I was wanting to know how I can be their friend and have them know that I am trans.

TransgirlInLove,asktransgender,What do you need your birth certificate for?,"I've changed my name legally, my name on my social security card, and my name and gender on my ID. The last part is the birth certificate because I really don't have any other major documents. It's also probably going to be one of the harder parts, just because I have to send away for a copy and wait a long while for it all to get settled.

The question is, what do I need the birth certificate for? Getting a job? Opening a bank account? Getting a credit card? Passport? Etc. etc. Or will my ID and SS card be enough?"
AlyssofHearts,asktransgender,I hate the holidays.,"I can't stand them mainly because I have to deal with my mother up close and personal. At home, I can be myself and I have a loving girlfriend that loves me for me.

 Here, I have to be someone I'm not. I have to hear the name I've come to loathe because I'm terrified of my mother.  She says my name and I cower. She snaps her fingers and I will do anything she asks of me because not doing it scares me.

I'm afraid that if I tell her that her ""precious baby boy"" is actual her daughter she'll snap her fingers and tell me to do away with all of this nonsense and I will because I can't disobey her. I physical can't and I hate it. 

I also can't just cut her from my life. I've tried, but when she managed to get ahold of me a few months later, the tone in her voice had me bawling and begging her for forgiveness.

I hate this house. I hate her and these last 4 days have been a living hell. I want to end it to get away, but I have one more day til I'm away from this. If it was any longer, I don't know if I'd have the will to make it."

The thoughts and feelings have gone on and off for the past few years, usually occurring once or twice a year for a short span.

I keep hoping my thoughts go away but they keep on persisting and I don't know what to do.

OnePunchRoxanne,asktransgender,I can't do this anymore.,"Everything is looking bleak. Not looking forward to the prospects of 2017 and beyond the more I think about it. 

I've been on hormones for 3 months and nothing is  improved. My mental state is worsening. There is an incoming conservative political and social climate is about to change the USA. Most of my ""friends"" are going to give conservativism a chance. And I'm in fucking California. I've been working two jobs looking to get a third. I don't want to give myself free time alone though I'm on break for the winter. I'm overworking myself just so I don't have to be alone and get mental breakdowns and to afford hormones. I don't remember  the last time  I've experienced happiness let alone a feeling of normality.

Every time my dad comes home and turns on the TV I want to smash it into a million fucking pieces. I'm tired of hearing about politics from Fox or CNN. I'm tired of being reminded how subconsciously people see me lower than a human for my race and gender identity. 

The only good things about next year is that  I'm probably transferring to UC Berkeley engineering and I will be losing weight after  being fat for most  of my  life. But I feel like it's pointless. No matter how hard I work I'm lower than an garbage. I have to earn my humanity for conditions I can't change and it makes me so fucking angry.

I feel like my mental is beyond help. I can't stop feeling like I want to cry or pacing around my apartment everyday now that I'm off work for the winter break. I can't stop coming on to this subreddit because I have no one else to talk to. 

I'll never be a passable transwoman. I wish there was alternatives to being transgender but there's nothing. I'm forced to settle for garbage. If I wasn't transgender I wouldn't be having half of  these  problems. 

I can't do this anymore."
Eliott_Croshaw,asktransgender,Help from another perspective,"Hi there, I'm a cis male who is currently in high school. My psychology class has a final coming up and I have to make a slideshow presentation about any disorder in the DSM-5. As I was browsing through different disorders to chose from, I came across gender dysphoria. This seemed interesting as I had recently met a trans male who used those words to describe what he was going through. I didn't personally think of it as a psychological disorder and was wondering why it was in the handbook. Of course, this is the handbook that at one point also contained homosexuality as a disorder as well, so I'm sure it'll be off the book after a revision or two.

At any rate, it seemed like an interesting ""disorder"" to tackle as long as it was in the book. I thought it was important to address in some way, shape, or form and thought it should be handled with great care. I have a lot of respect for the courage of those that are openly trans and support all those experiencing some sort of dysphoria or discomfort with their bodies. The last thing I want to do is accidentally handle this subject poorly and make a lot of people look bad. So I came here for some advice on how to approach this subject in a classroom setting.

The slideshow is split into four parts as per the instructions I was given. 

The ""cover"" (first slide) needs to contain an image as well as a title. I was a bit unsure of what to use as an image, right now I'm thinking the trans pride flag. 

After that I need to give ""a brief description of the disorder, including the symptoms, the causes, and some statistics on the prevalence of the disorder."" The information I've found online has either been vague or hateful and I was hoping I could find more friendlier sources here. What I'm looking for (or at least what I think I'm looking for, I'm honestly quite uncertain) is what reasons individuals give for feeling uncomfortable with how they were born and what caused them to start becoming so conscious about it.

The next part is a narrative. This part is where I really got cold feet. I have to write a two to three page (twelve font, double space, times new roman) story from a first person perspective about having gender dysphoria. I really want to handle this part with as much care as possible and do not want to accidentally spread misinformation or make anyone look bad. I'm really hoping some of you folks might have some advice on how to write from that perspective. I don't want to be disrespectful and I feel like the way to go on that is to be as authentic as possible.

Lastly is a slide about whether the ""disorder"" is ""treatable or curable."" For this, I'm really wondering what kind of stance you folks have on this. Would transitioning be considered treatment or the path to a ""cure"" or is it considered something else entirely?

I really hope I've worded this well enough and haven't accidentally offended anyone, as I can occasionally do so without realizing it or knowing any better. 

I'd like to thank anyone who took the time to read this and look forward to your responses. I really want to handle this well and appreciate any feedback."
justsallygirl,asktransgender,To those who are/have-been spiraling into suicidal ideation... you are not alone.,"I have a concept about the spiral of depression... that may be unique to those with the trans... it's not a short read specifically, but if you are currently (or have been) suicidally depressed - please give it a read. 

*TL;DR ... no...*

---

The first few years of gender transition are exceptionally difficult times for most everyone. We've been blunted by the greyscale of having the wrong ratio of hormones for so many years, maybe decades, and that left a void of emotion... but now, with our levels corrected, with the sensory world around us now in color for the first time in forever... for all of the beauty and happiness and potential, what has been so shocking for many of us is simply the ability to FEEL this deeply about *anything*, good or bad. 

And so when the darkness comes and all the emotions grasp us... it's very difficult to get away from that, or to even want to - because though it isn't the light, it is still *beautiful and strong and all encompassing*, if not simply because of the intensity of the emotion, but also because the blackness of the black that we couldn't see into the depths of fully before... and it FEELS so much. 

So when I get very depressed it's exceptionally difficult to get away from it, because at least I can finally feel *something*, and strongly. 

---

After enough time, enough struggle and loss, enough difficulty - of which there is no shortage of in transition - I got to a point where the darkness and the power of that side of the emotional spectrum was so well known that it became part of me... that I couldn't let it go without actually trying to kill the version of my Self that it had encompassed. So the only way to survive, in a convoluted manner, was to move towards suicide again and again until I had killed off enough of my old versions that were defined and consumed by darkness.

For me suicidal depression is an addictive state. I know it so well, and I know very well what it's like to have the lights go out. I want to be back there every single day more than any junky could ever want *just one more* needle.... but cognitively and philosophically I know that I can no longer look towards suicide as a means to satiate my emotional requirements. 

Instead I have a much more challenging struggle - which is to extend my patience to the point of letting go of the *illusion of control*, to let go of the concept that I can chose to die at all; and then to not only accept that state of being but to also not act on attempting to prove myself wrong (or right) or to simply act on doing anything in the notion of believing that this life is a choice. 

So it becomes a cognitive dissonance with what I have, for my entire adult life used as the foundation towards my ""success"" or whatever people want to term it, that which I took as a given --  the ability towards self determination. 

I used to think that I could get whatever I wanted in this life, as long as I dedicated myself to the goal and did my best... and in a sense that was correct - I've attained what many consider to be the inexpressibly impossible. Yet the one thing I have failed at entirely was death, despite exceptionally strong efforts and despite all of the doctors assumptions that *I would never wake up. [http://i.imgur.com/1tge8TR.jpg]*

What was out of the realm of my control each time was love. The nebulous and irrational emotion that others provide and which I cannot pull any plug on. The binding force that I can't let go of because it's not mine to let go. 

---

So when you think to yourself...

&gt; the part of me that hurts, is pain or in pain, just wants to close all the shutters and spiral in on itself in the darkness.

I know that feeling very well, and you should know that when that does happen... and you're laying in bed alone in the darkness feeling the depths of this existence... 

**there are people who know you and love you and you are not alone.**

t2e1991,asktransgender,When did you first start going out in public (part/full time),"Hello, I've been on HRT for NINE months (male to female) and have still been too scared to even think about going outside presenting as female. I've had reasonable success with the effects of hormone (not brilliant, but not bad either) and am in constant girl mode around my/family/friend's houses, but I still feel as though even going to the shop to get milk as a woman is too daunting without getting FFS first (not until October 2017!)

Kim2025,asktransgender,[Self repost because I thought this community could provide some insight] Did I overreact? Was I transphobic?,"Throwaway because I'm embarrassed

So last week I met this beautiful women on tinder. We started chatting and eventually met for drinks a few nights ago at a gay bar. We ordered a few drinks, we both had fun but I had to work in the morning so we called it a night. Flash forward to tonight I meet with the same women for dinner and all goes well. We both had a great time and she suggests we go to her apartment. We get to her place and we start kissing. Sorry to be so blunt but in a few minutes I'm naked and she is topless. I then go to take her jeans and panties off to find a tucked dong. I have nothing against trans people but I'm not into penises. I was shocked and kinda mad that she didn't say she was pro-op. I flat out told her I was a lesbian the first time we met so I was not sure why she didn't say anything. After a few moments of no one saying anything and having her penis get hard basically in my face I just grabbed my clothes and left. I'm so embarrassed. Was I wrong to just leave like that? Is what I did transphobic? She texted an hour ago and I agreed to meet with her for coffee on Wednesday but I don't know what to expect. If anyone has insight on what happened that would be great."
LoveIinus,asktransgender,"4 months of HRT, need real and critical comments. Even if it hurts, it's okay.","[4 month HRT album](http://m.imgur.com/a/VS09V)

I'm 4 months on HRT and I'm still feeling insecure about how I look. I usually dress up like this, this is my boymode. Just my usual boy Long sleeve T with shorts. I usually get male fail about 80%? The remaining 20% will make comments such as me looking like a Korean boy, pretty boy etc. 

I'm going to include some body &amp; face shots and I need very real and critical comments. Because no matter how, when I look at myself in the mirror I don't see a girl, I see a boy. Once a hairdresser said I have a square face and it scarred me forever. I don't even know what my face shape is. My cheekbones are the widest part of my face, I get comments that I have a V shaped face (not sure what shape is that) Will I need FFS? I don't know what is the thing on my face that makes me look like a boy. My face shape? Masculine jaw? Maybe I have a square face and jaw? At this point I'm not even sure if Long hair will help me to pass. I'm still in the process of growing out my hair. 

Do my waist and legs look okay? It measures about 24-25 inches. I don't like my thighs and calves they look thick :( also my shoulders. Muscle atrophy hasn't started. :(( feel sad. Any tips to increase my femininity? In terms of looks. "

lainelect,asktransgender,gender dysphoria and porn addiction?,"as i further explore my gender identity and dysphoria, i must confront my years of porn addiction (god, i wish i could undo them...)

it's like, for about six years i had a daily habit of watching porn. this is through my teenage years. it's been my only source of information of intimacy - ive never dated or kissed or sexed. 

how probable is it that all these years of pornography have altered my gender identity? could it be possible that i have identify as a woman because of porn?

i don't necessarily believe this is the case. there are many other things that lead me to believe that im a woman. but if im going to alienate my family and alter my body and learn an entirely new role just to rid myself of this dysphoria, i should at least consider the possibility that i have been corrupted by this disgusting addiction. 

i ask you, my friends, a huge favor: please be as honest as you can be here no matter how painful. have you experienced anything similar? is this even possible? thank you for your time and honesty. 

EDIT: thank you all very much for your patience. i recognize how silly this question is - like someone mentioned, if porn had this kind of power we would have an epidemic by now. and i didn't really believe porn was the cause of these feelings, but i needed to squash that lingering thought once and for all, so thank you for doing this. ill end it with this: i had been trying to stop watching porn for months, with no success; it wasn't until coming out to myself that i was able to quit entirely. now, whether or not this is due to my dysphoria is another question...but at least i quit, right?"

I'm 22 years old and am going to see a doctor and psychiatrist soon to speak about different hormone solutions.

He recently got a haircut (iirc a pixie cut) and people aren't very supportive calling him ugly and all that as he looks masculine. I honestly loved it and kept telling him that it fits. His 'boyfriend' even keeps telling how feminine he is.

I am trying my best to try to tell him that they are wrong and nothing is wrong with him. I told him that I am here and if he gives me the go signal I would seriously tell the other people to piss off as they are in no way helping him (yes they know but they dont understand what it means to be trans).

He said that nobody could understand how it feels to be in the wrong body. I wish I could say I could but I really couldn't and can only imagine how it must feel like...

#Next, my story!    

I have been on hormones since may but haven't really done much else to transition other than let estrogen do its magic. I started getting boobs and so I bought sports bras to help conceal at work as I am still male presenting full time there. My family isn't very supportive so although I've told them everything I still present male around them since I can tell they are still uncomfortable with everything and I think of others a bit more than I do myself. Anyway, I recently decided that I wanted to get a regular good underwire bra so that I could start showing off what I got. I wasn't expecting much, I did a lot of research(Thanks /r/ABraThatFits, you the real mvp), and ended up ordering a bra online I thought would fit. It came in the mail yesterday, I excitedly unboxed my early Christmas present to myself, and got ready to try it on. Once I did My reaction was OMG, I ACTUALLY HAVE BOOBS!!!! All of a sudden instead of them being hidden behind a layer of compression and hoodies they were being accentuated like 2 glorious pillows of fun! This gave me a ton of confidence to further be who I want to be.    

TL;DR Got a bra and bras make boobs look good which made me happy.

EL_AMOR_PROHIBIDO,asktransgender,Does anyone regret decision not to transition?,"As above? 30 year old, questioning gender since age 14 or so. Thought I turned a corner at 27 and decided to transition. Told family, work, friends and doctor. Got counselling and psych. Decided it wasn't for me and was happy being male. 

Now 30. Dysphoric feelings are back and it's hard to see how I haven't made a huge mistake. Got married last summer, wife knows about my past feelings and struggles. Have mentioned I'm feeling this way to her...but hard to articulate how I feel. 

Not really sure whether I made a mistake or not. Transitioning feels out of reach. Staying this way the rest of my life doesn't feel possible either. Is there a creamy middle I'm missing? Would like to resolve this heartache without wrecking my life. I feel like I've been too noncommittal to ever really transition. But hey. Who knows. 

Would be grateful for any thoughts and opinions people can offer. "
Lesbitrans,asktransgender,"Q for Pre-op trans women who have little to no genital dysphoria,","(NSFW) I asked this once before, but I didn't get very helpful answers because I wasnt too clear on some details, so I'm asking again to see if I can get more help.

I have trouble masturbating because since starting hrt, I can't jerk it like a ""normal"" penis due to lack of sensitivity in my shaft. I've tried to look up stuff on how to maturbate as a trans woman, I've found no helpful information.

So, to the trans women who still masturbate by touching their penis, how do you do it? I've hear to treat it like a clit, but I'm not sure how to do that? I've tried muffing and thats fine but id still like to know how to masturbate with just my penis, without having to do anything else (because sometimes im just not in the mood for anything else haha)."

Thank you"
InkaOCD,asktransgender,Transgender woman or OCD?,"I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just some helpful advice!
Okay, so I have never been diagnosed with OCD, although I am pretty sure i do have it because I do get intrusive thoughts and obsessions and things like that. But, I'm confused about being transgender. I was assigned male at birth, and whenever i think about transitioning into a woman I get scared when I think about taking hormones (HRT) and getting irreversible surgery. I get thoughts like, ""what if I regret it"", ""what If I find out years later I was not and never have been a transgender woman"", ""what if I figure out I'm not transgender after I've had irreversible surgery such as Gender Reassignment Surgery and I've had irreversible effects such as infertility from the hormones"".
These are the types of thoughts I get. Luckily they seem to have gone away lately. But, what scares me the most is because I have been living as a woman for the past two years (please DON'T say that I am transgender because I've been living as a woman and this is something that cisgender men just wouldn't do), I could technically start hormones tomorrow if I wanted to, that what if I regret it, what if I'm wrong, things like I said above. See I'm not exactly uncomfortable with being male. As a matter of fact, I can live as a male perfectly fine, so when people ask me questions like ""well you must if started to live as a woman for a reason, so what was that reason"", I struggle to answer them. Do you personally think that is a bad sign?
I think if God let me choose what sex I would be assigned at birth, I probably would've chosen to be assigned female at birth I think because I prefer the life of females growing up, etc. I am not particularly a fan of facial hair, it doesn't cause be dysphoria, but it is more of a nuisance. I do know that if I discovered that I was in fact a transgender woman, I would want a body like Kim Kardashian. See, I even plan what surgeries I want to get even though I'm not sure.
I first came out as a transgender woman after watching a video on Kim Petras who is believed to be the younger ever transgender to ever get gender reassignment surgery (I think sge got it at 16 if i remember rightly). After I watched the video, I literally said to my family ""I want a sex change"". Looking back on it, it doesn't seem very real, like as if I was transgender, I wouldn't of made it so casual. What do you think?
I also have this big dear of transitioning now and then regretting it, or not transitioning now and figuring out later in life when I'm unpassable, unattractive, etc that i was a really always have been a transgender woman. Is this normal? What does this tell you?
I should point out that when I came out as a transgender woman, someone said to me that i need to put in a straight jacket and that I was ""choosing to be transgender"" and that I was ""mentally ill"". This started the doubt. But do you think this all sounds like where all this started?
I don't know if this is of any significance but I'll mention it anyway. Whenever i listen to certain songs and they hsce particular themes or meanings i will pretend that i am the woman in the video.
Please be objective and please be brutally honest, what does this sound like to you? Again, I'm NOT looking for a diagnosis, I'm just looking for advice as to what you think this all sounds like!"

Jazz8680,asktransgender,How long do dysphoric waves last?,"I'm in an odd predicament. For the past two weeks I've felt like I'm trans. Did little things to combat what I think was dysphoria, and felt good. Now, two weeks later, dysphoric feelings are subsiding. Like I now feel fine presenting as male and I feel as if it was all just a joke. I didn't make up the childhood memories of wishing I would wake up as a girl. Nor did I ""invent"" my dysphoric symptoms. 

I've heard that dysphoria can be experienced in waves. How long did these waves last in the beginning? I only just recently started thinking I could be trans and for a few moments I completely believed that I was. Now I'm no longer sure because my dysphoria has significantly died down. 

I'm afraid that I might be subconsciously repressing it all again. I have to go home for break from college today so my parents will be over and I'll be leaving to go live with them for a few weeks. I might be stuffing these feelings back where they came from so that I can function at home without distraction. 

The trouble is that if I really am trans, I don't want that feeling to go away. I want the dysphoria to go away, sure, but not the desire to be trans. 

I'm really confused! "

I'm not a very sociable person, but what very few occasions i do spend time with people it's always with guys (Not like i have a choice) I live in a Male dominated society and the majority of people whom live amongst me are Men..
I don't have any Woman that are my friend's nor' do i even have a mother, it's always been me and my Dad, i love my father i truly do, but he get's under my skin a lot with his ""Advice"" he enjoys carelessly slinging at me, such as.. just Man up or he might punch me on the shoulder telling me to cheer up (I really hate that one)
I know he means well, but i hate not having any feminine influence in my life, it's so degrading to me..
I'm 21 Atm and i really want to start taking Hrt, but i feel my father might not like that.. So i'm kinda to scared to tell him.. but the more i think about it and my situation.. the more i realize there is no way i could live my life as a Female.. no one would except me and i'd probably need to have some FFS done and i don't have that kinda money.
I'd be all on my own if i walked down this path and that scares me.

I want to have some support me (In Real Life) so i don't feel alone, but i feel that's a bit of a long shot for me.
I'm starting to loose my will to keep living, i'm starting to think suicide isn't as scary as i originally thought, the more i continue in the world the more i become pained, i'll never be a real Girl, i'll never have a family, i'll never give birth to any children.. 
Like yesterday i started drinking heavily and started to feel wonky and dizzy and i just sat in my corner crying about my situation, so i grabbed my handgun and started pulling the trigger as if i really was going to do it, 
i'm scared i'm going to really do it one day, and i'm starting to loose any reason to stop my self.. i'v been doing this since i was 13, living with my Gender Dysphoria.

My parents that I'm living with right now would pay my way through college in a heartbeat, but they would never do so if I started transitioning. My mother who lives in Florida wholeheartedly would support my transition, but I would have to work and wouldn't likely get the opportunity for anything more than community college if that. I want to go into the arts but it's so risky and while I'm good at STEM now if I don't have a degree it means nothing. I know there are ways to live without a degree, but I just want to know what I'm getting into with regards to the future. If I do end up moving in with my mother I would be much more likely to receive scholarships for community college or anything in the future, as my father is a government employee, but I really don't know what to do right now :/

*Edit: quick responses, jimenee holidays. Those suggesting starting on my own; I'd have to be in state and they'd make me visit or they won't pay.

QuestioningT,asktransgender,Really confused and anxious right now,"Ok, so I have been imagining life as a girl for a very long time, even before I was aware of trans people as a concept. 

I feel like I would have been much happier if I had been born a girl, but at the same time I don't hate being a boy - at least most of the time. 

I fantasise about being a girl in sexual situations but I feel like that's just a fetish. 

I don't know what i am or what to think and it's starting to wear on me a lot recently, as I told my parents how I feel last night. They are both supportive and have helped me book an appointment with my GP to get some help but I don't know what to do. 

I feel like a complete mess,  as if this is something I'm telling myself just so I have an excuse for why I'm unhappy. 

If it turns out I am trans, I don't know if I can go through with anything as I am 6 feet tall with big hands and size 13 (UK) feet. On top of all that I have no idea how I would fit in as a woman, I don't know anything about women and don't act in a feminine way, or have typically feminine interests but whether that's because I was raised in a family where everyone in my generation (6) are all boys,  or because that's not who I really am I don't know.

ToukaMist,asktransgender,"Local gender therapist? (MtF, OKC)","So I'm pre-everything, but I am *finally* in a place where I'm hopefully getting a job in the next two weeks and able to get my own place and move out. I've been living full time (girlmode) when I'm not home (since I'm not out to any family yet), but with this job I can be independent and go full time at home too. Consequently, I've planned on starting the HRT process very soon after I get the job if possible.


I've looked up a local therapist which you can read more about her [here](http://www.mosaicmentalhealth.com/) and [here](https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_detail.php?profid=148595&amp;sid=1476738525.3236_18501&amp;city=Oklahoma+City&amp;county=Oklahoma&amp;state=OK&amp;spec=187&amp;tr=ResultsRow). I'm sure that I'm transgender, so I mainly would like to find a therapist for the HRT letter (I'm pretty sure that's how it works). Of course, if it requires a month or two of therapy before a HRT letter, that would be within reasonable expectations. I'm just asking so I can avoid blowing all my insurance or money at a place that makes me wait for possibly years without any progress towards HRT. I've read of too many instances of other girls getting put off way too long, especially here in the south, and I'd prefer avoiding wasting time and money on a therapist that won't make any progress.


She was just what I found when I Googled ""OKC transgender therapist"", but she accepts Blue Cross, which is the insurance I would receive at the new gig. And that would help immensely since money will be tight. I'm in the OKC area, does anyone here know of a therapist to recommend or one they've had a great experience with? If not, then this one seems like a good place to start at least. Cheers!



TL;DR recommendations for a good therapist in the OKC area?"
amon_erin,asktransgender,This is goodbye,"Well, probably goodbye anyway. I don't know if I'll be back in a day, a month, a year, or ever. In an ideal world I would not be writing this. Alas, this is not an ideal world. My life is rarely ideal, or remotely close to ideal.

I've been struggling for weeks with the hope that things were going to get better. They have not. They've gotten worse. My last really good day was about two weeks ago when I had a therapist appointment and went out in girl mode. I crashed hard after that day, with only a couple good days since. 

My depression is worse than before HRT, my constant questioning of myself and evaluating my feelings is no better, my doubts were becoming overwhelming. I could sustain this no longer. There is no hope that things will get better for me on HRT. I'm an emotional mess. I never should have started down this path, it seems.

The physical changes weren't what did me in. I'm just not mentally strong enough to do this, because it's easier to just write this off as one of the long list of doubts that I have and constantly obsess on. Lately everything I say about what I want and feel feels like a lie. Even the things I know to be true. 

I've been on the verge of giving up so many times in the past month, but I always ran around inside my head trying to find some glimmer of a feeling to justify continuing on. I can't do that anymore.

im in junior year of high school right now, and i was originally planning on coming out for senior year. i recently found out that a lot of my schools art department wont be continuing next semester, the exact time when id be taking courses to get into college (im trying to go to an arts college btw so i need these courses)
ive got the option of applying to the arts high school downtown, where i know identity wont be an issue. my issue is that i would have to come out to transphobic parents and my school also isnt the most accepting.
ive been thinking about possibly going to see the schools social worker (who is openly gay) to see if she can get me in therapy for all the mental health problems school has been causing me, or at the very least gender therapy and i can tell the gender therapist ill need other help first.
any ideas of what i should do/who i should talk to?

asdfadsf95,asktransgender,Can a EU person get informed consent HRT in the US ?

Can i just casually fly into the US and get an informed consent HRT at one of the clinics without being a perma US citizen and not having US insurance? (assuming non-citizens cant get local insurance easy).
i can pay all the procedures thats no problem, the question is whether i can be smoothly processed just like everyone else there.

I would start the stay there with a 6month visa and then switch to ESTA passport that allows a 90day stay and if i fly back to europe for a week or 14days inbetween and blame it all on business trips it should safely reset for another 90days indefinitely or at least long enough to finish the basic transition.

manwoman1990,asktransgender,SEXUAL DIMORPHISM is a social construct? No!! And thoughts on respecting people's sexualities...,"Throughout the years I have considered transitioning, I thought it was a given that I would just go for pan/bi women to make things easier as a transman. I figured it is the most respectful thing to do to acknowledge that a) lesbians like women, and b) often straight women often prefer biological males to men who are female, whether it be for reproductive reasons, the dislike of the female anatomy, etcetc.

To clarify, I am a biologist, I have seen the realities of sexual dimorphism throughout many members of the animal kingdom, and I am quite aware that my body does not produce male hormones endogenously, and the term that we came up with for those with ovaries etcetc is ""female"". I am female and will be for the rest of my life. This entire time, I thought it was obvious, but lately, there have been movements to ""break down the cotton ceiling"" (as in, convince people who do not want to date a trans person to have sex with them despite being uncomfortable with it?), and I even met a few folks who went as far to call me ""bioessentialist"" and even TRANSPHOBIC (wtf) because I have repeatedly observed the realities of sexual dimorphism, whether or not a small number of outliers w/ defects exist, the purpose is reproduction. The outliers, such as intersex folks generally cannot reproduce and do *not* negate dimorphism and ESPECIALLY do not make me something other than female. Also, one person went as far as to say that those who refuse to date someone of the opposite sex (but identifies as the gender they are attracted to) are TRANSPHOBIC. I, however, think people's sexualities shouldn't be disrespected just to bolster someone's identity/self esteem (Pansexual people are real and more common than you'd think). Oh yeah, and that SEX (not gender) is a social construct. WHAT. 

If gender/sex are essentially something we made up, then I feel that it would negate the purpose of transitioning. Why pay all this money and waste a shitload of time trying to appear as a member of the opposite sex when you already ARE that (and for the large price of NOTHING, FREE OF CHARGE!!)? Additionally, we wouldn't have sex specific healthcare (why do I need to go to the gyno whether or not I take exogenous testosterone? -- I would say because I am a man who happens to be female, what do you say?)

I want to know your thoughts on this. Is it transphobic for a gay man to prefer to date a man that does not have a vagina? Is biological sex a social construct? Did the patriarchy make male rats put giant testicles on themselves simply to give humans the illusion of sexual dimorphism? 

The last question is the most serious one of all :P"
Tomgurl,asktransgender,What does feeling like a gender fell like?,"Just like the title asks. What does it mean to feel like a woman or a man? I have been struggling with how to define such a thing. I am male and am okay with that. But I also love to dress and present as female. Is our gender identity truly defined by our interests and clothing?
I love to do this that are traditionally male. I like combat sports, beer, shooting guns, fast cars, beautiful women among other things. But I love things that are traditionally female. Dresses, make up, painting my nails, Katy Perry, and much more. 
I think what I may be having a hard time with is girls can be interested in those things and it's socially acceptable. But as a male it's weird if I want to wear a dress and paint my nails. 

I don't really know what it means to identify as a gender. I identify as me. I have heard some people say they identify as one or the other and I am just wondering what that means to you. How did you know? 

Sorry if this was incoherent and makes no sense. This is a very condensed version of a conversation that could take generations to figure out. Thank you for any help or insight. "

Gozer45,asktransgender,Am I all alone in thinking that we need to stop selling this chasing happiness dream?,"I love this subreddit, I do. I think this community as strong and filled with individuals that have made my life a better place just from Reading their content. It was one of my earliest ways to reach out and flex the idea space I figured out I was trans. And without it I don't know if I would have figured out something this meaningful about myself. 

That all being said I think there's a problem. This may not be just a problem with us and it may be a greater problem with Society in general. But we are still buying into it and it's still hurting people here.

That probably isn't going to be a popular opinion but we are selling the idea of transitioning to be happy. And that may actually not be good or right. In general a lot of cultures do sell the idea of striving to be happy. And we absolutely do too I've seen plenty of threads with somebody talks about transitioning so they can be happy. And people are encouraged to transition so that they can be happy. One of the big negative aspects of this is that when transitioning doesn't fix an underlying issue that makes us unhappy we feel as if we're wrong or not built right or just broken. And you know what screw that.

Transitioning can lead to being happy and that's wonderful but happy isn't all there is to life. And pardon my french but fuck being happy. I want to be angry. I want to be sad. I want to live life and feel every feeling possible. And this extra emphasis we put on being happy does a disservice to us all.

Who ever you are out there just so you know I love you. And I hope you can love your sadness and your anger and slowly but surely love your self as you truly are. You arn't broken, even if you arn't happy you are wonderful."

OnlyFiguratively,asktransgender,Missing being your birth gender?,"Hey guys. So I'm just beginning to realize that I am in fact trans and do wish to transition, probably sooner rather then later. This thought scares me a ton but also makes me really excited. I identify as a demigirl, as I switch between feeling agender and girly and am often somewhere in the middle. I pretty much never wish to be addressed with male pronouns, present as a male etc except out of convenience. However I'm worried that if I transition I'll miss being a guy. There are good things about being a guy, and I don't wish to cast them aside. I also feel like being a guy was a big part of my identity for almost 17 years and while I really don't feel like a guy right now, I wonder if once I transition I'll experience some reverse dysphoria where I wish I still was a guy. It just sounds like far enough into transition, you almost forget that you were ever your birth gender and while that sounds nice it also sounds really scary.

Malimestar,asktransgender,Am I delusional of being trans,"I have been typing here for some days now guys, and please help me understand what am I going trough. I am now 25 years old male, still not sure if I am transgender, but my brain stopped asking when I accepted the fact I feel like a woman. But now l dont know what it means to be woman? I have lived for the last 15 years thinking I was gay, in order to blend in I had girlfriends and realy wanted not to be gay. I have always felt a bit odd  (enjoined girls company, didnt care about most boys things) but never tought of it as my gender but my sexual orientation. When I came out as gay (month ago), I was happiest man alive! But few days later the tought came to my mind ""what if l am woman""? And now after 20 very hard days, I have no clue who am I?  Were all my previous experiences fake ( tought I was gay, behaved like straight and was female all along)? It feels like all my life decidions are someone else's,  I can't feel any emotion, just sad and scared. I try to remember have I ever felt love or passion for anything and it seems to mensure I  haven't.  I don't know how to feel about my body, I recognize it in the mirror as face I have seen many times but I dont have connection to it, I still don't have dysphoria about my genitals ( but I FEAR that at some point I would want my penis gone). I haven't felt any happy tought or sensation with realisation of me being transgender. I don't get aroused nor I feel natural when I do some feminate move ( although I have an urge to do it) and when I do it feels weird. I just don't know where to start or continue with life. I am so used to living as straight man I can stil easily behave like one ( and that is in front of the people I came with my problem), but feel like my entire life was a huge lie and I can't connect to anything that happened to me in 25 years. I can't see my friends, my family, I just feel empty and confused. Have I just boxed every emotion I tought was gay (but subconsciously it was me denying my efeminate side) that now I feel nothing. No emotional memory, no love no nothing, I remember things but feel nothing for them. Am I going mad? I am not thinking of suicide, but I can't be born again and start from zero, I know even if I transition I will never be woman just fizical expresion of one. Not sure if I need hormones to start behaving and feeling like one all the time (because I tell my self I am woman, I accept it but since I don't know how to behave like one I just go with straight behavior as l am used to it), but as of now I don't feel like man any more (can't find any muscline behavior in my past life since from this point it seems to me I have pretended it all) while writing this I don't feel woman either (I just feel like woman in some particular moments, not all the time)  just person with memories. And yes I cry a lot last few days, I feel old me is crying from fear of what I might become and I would be very happy to bwing cis gay man but somehow since I identify as woman now gay man are not attractive to me any more (today I had gay episode, where l accepted my emotions as my own not woman or man, but it lasted only for 15 minutes, and than the sentence ""don't delude ur self you are woman"" came back). Like my reason and my subconsions have to fight all the time. 
Sorry for the long post, but I am mess and don't know how to go trough all of this and don't loose my already fragile mind.

FatedChange,asktransgender,Dealing with parental unhappiness,"So a couple of months ago, I came out to my mother about transitioning.

Two questions. One, how can I find gender related therapists for her to seek consoling with? To my understanding, Google tends to be extremely lacking when it comes to this kind of search. 

Two, how can I convince her that this is the right move and that I should not compromise on a timetable?

Their mother and I had a sit down with them when the kid of one of my exes started bullying my daughter. (Kind of applicable, but their mother and I are no longer together). The kids have never seen me en femme, though. One of the things that's always been in the back of my head is a fear that being myself in front of them would somehow influence them to ""be like me"", and I don't want them to learn to be trans. Self loathing, maybe?

My evangelical parents are okay with it. Their mother is in a ""wait and see"" holding pattern but more positive about it than I am. Daughter's soon-to-be ex stepdad is okay with it. Hell, even her mother's new Muslim boyfriend is more okay with it than I am.

I'm not sure why I am the least okay with it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Maybe I need assurance from somebody who is a professional to help validate whether my daughter is a trendsexual or if she really is struggling with her gender identity. I don't know. Any advice?

Edit: Why the downvotes? I get that this is something better suited a therapist, but I thought this was the subreddit for insight to this kind of thing, at least until I can get to one. Is it because I haven't transitioned? I wasn't exactly in a welcoming environment all my life.

Edit 2: It's been really helpful to get my thoughts out. Thank you, everybody. I'm finally getting some clarity. I've had a few realizations. 

1) I remember when my parents blamed themselves. The more things change, the more they remain the same I guess.

2) The biggest thing that bothers me is how fast this happened (from my perspective). It went from 0-100 mph in about a month. Doesn't really change anything, though.

3) I think I'm looking at his transition the same way I look at mine. I didn't because I wasn't in a good place for it. Now I'm just too damned old, and poor. Just because I look at my transition with a jaundiced  eye, doesn't mean that the reality of his is the same."
trowaway3573,asktransgender,[fetish or transgender]Need help figuring out about transsexual feelings,"Hello ask transgender!

I am about 20 years old male who enjoy fapping to both man+woman vanilla sex, women alone, and for some reason gender bender erotica, and transformation porn. The transformation is usually male to female and then having sex. This urge stops once I finish, and usually only stays while fapping to it and right before I start fapping. I don't always have the urge to fap to this... but I sometimes do, and it really scares me after I'm done. As I am not sure if this is some hidden wish to become a woman. 

In my normal everyday life I really enjoy being a man. I would stay a man if I ever had a button that would turn me into a woman instantly. And would not change places with my girlfriend, except to try sex. The only thing I would like to experience about a woman's life is what women feel during sex...the orgasm, why they make such noises, how good it must feel etc.

I do not think about gender bender, or transformation when I have sex with my girlfriend. During sex with her I really enjoy being both the dominant one. Sometimes when shes only pleasing me. I really enjoy when shes licking/sucking my nipples like I usually do with her... and I vision myself being her. This is also a thought that scares me, but it usually feels good when it happens and I don't think about it before after. Like after fapping to gender bender, I also sit alone and a bit scared with these thoughts.

What I would like to know if these feelings make me transgender, or just a man with a transgender fetish?

And I know a lot of you can't answer this question for me, but I would like to have some of your thoughts on the subject.

She was really cute.  Im so weird!  I have no idea why I said that.  What do you think made me say that?  I've said it before to confused people who asked me if I was a boy or a girl.  But sheesh I don't like that I said that.  "
ErinOrchid,asktransgender,"On transition (and no longer ""just"" a CD)","I think a lot of us at times may have doubt or wonder just where we fall on the wide gender spectrum and whether that is static or a dynamic position that changes with hormone therapy. I'm specifically speaking of our behaviors or how we feel about certain issues.  As I go through transition and these hormones really start to change my inner workings, I realize I am changing.  One of the first and most profound for me was the rapid shutdown of sexual need  that gradually has blossomed into a new kind of sexual desire.   

However, it's other little changes that take me by surprise and make me so happy.  For example, today I was hand washing delicates which included both sweaters and sexy lingerie. As I was rinsing them and laying them out to dry, I found a very distinct prioritization in how I felt about these clothes. First, I very carefully laid out the cute little sweaters with precision and delicacy and followed with a somewhat less precise manner when handling the garter skirts. This was subconsious until I thought about it afterward.   I think I suddenly realized that I felt more attached and prioritized the condition of my daily outerwear as opposed to the lingerie (which I still love too!).  Before hormones and when I was ""just"" a crossdresser, I think I would have done this in reverse.  When I say ""just"" CD, I don't mean any offense. It's just how, in a way, I internally refer to myself before I fully accepted myself as TG and took this as my life and began full transition.

Have you any other examples of little behaviors in yourself that have changed since beginning transition and more specifically since starting hormones?"

Skyharp,asktransgender,Genital dysphoria - feels like lava on my skin...?,"Hi guys. My main question is if it's normal for genital dysphoria to get way worse after taking ""cross-sex"" hormones....? Every one says it gets better if you start HRT.

Looking down and seeing ""your"" genitals and frowning is one thing. Feeling like there's someone's running a knife through that area 24/7 is another thing entirely. I feel like crying all day and doing nothing else.

 It isn't really physical pain because if I daydream about being ""more female-ish"" it tends to go away. The only thing I'm mildly worried about is if the genitals are mildly out of place or something because I had some surgeries done in that area when I was 1, because I have the hormone disorder Kallmann Syndrome.

 But I'm really concerned because it isn't sustainable to cry 3x a day because of them, to be afraid to go to the bathroom because you feel as though you have a tapeworm on you, and to not want to eat or drink water because of the thick ""depression"" / nausea associated with it. People say that I'm exaggerating if I say I feel like there's a knife being jammed through. I'm not, and nobody believes me.

I did all the right steps and it just got worse. I stopped taking testosterone when it was just a dull discomfort all day that made me just want to hole up and play video games all day. I took estrogen, transitioned at work, did a bunch of facial electrolysis. I can pass as female 2/3  the time if I just roll out of bed and don't do anything to my hair or what not.

The funniest thing about this? I'm still worried if I'm transgender or not because I have such bad anxiety. (Based on mostly on the fact that I'm tired of thinking about this and that everyone feels better after transitioning at work, right?)"
[deleted],asktransgender,So now that I pass more. I'm much more scared in public.,"Hi everyone. I just passed my 1.5 year mark on HRT. I've also started passing fairly constantly. But now I am much more fearful beingoutside and in public when I at least knew I was more visible and took some small comfort from that at least? i just feel like being ""seen"" as male now that I look more feminine is going to cause a much more significant and potentially violent response to my trans status. It could be that I'm just feeling more vulnerable just as a a plain old woman alone instead of being seen as a trans person first and then a female secondarily. Has anyone else felt this way?"

 Its that time of the year again. my parents want me to get my hair cut. Now my parents are not against me having long hair, but it is getting a little sloppy in some areas, so it needs to get done. So with the pictures I have here, what would be a style that would be a very subtle way to have a more feminine cut, without having to explicitly tell the hairdresser that I want a feminine cut. I work in a 100% male garage so if i get a cut thats noticeable feminine, I may get bullied out of a job(not ideal right now). here are my hair pics: http://imgur.com/a/4qKQy

now for the second question, With this picture: http://imgur.com/fo8fNdJ
what features are more feminine that I can help to bring out more, as well as what more masculine that I can try to hide more. I want a place to start working on makeup without going all out trying to do my entire face when there are probably just a few spots that could use some trickery.

HenchJudiDench1975,asktransgender,Am I really FtM transgender? or is it something else? 17 year old feeling really confused.,"Okay, firstly I'm aware that the vast majority of cis people never question their gender therefore meaning there’s a high likelihood I am not cisgender. However at the same time I'm fully aware this doesn't mean I'm transgender. I feel a lot of the time that I'm not transgender, I'm just a freak. 

Growing up, I was a weird loner who felt completely and utterly out of place and different. This sense of oddness, of never fitting in, of being a 'freak' has come to define my life. And has unfortunately led to a great deal of repression and 'acting' in order to fit in. Its no coincidence that a song that resonates with me is “the Great Pretender” by Queen.

From a young age, I wished I was a boy. I remember on multiple occasions wishing and expressing that I should’ve been a boy. I hung out with the boys, played football and got into fights. But I knew deep down I wasn't one of them. They didn’t treat me as one of them. And this hurt. I was made fun of for being female, for being ‘ugly’ not ‘pretty’ like the other girls. I liked girls but socialising with them was a chore and I hated it, pretending to be interested in boys, fashion and makeup was a chore. So I didn’t, and for most of primary school spent my time on my own, knowing I was estranged between the two groups, destined to never fit in or understand who I was. I was regarded as a freak, I feel, by most of the people my age. Or someone to be pitied. This led to a immense deal of insecurity, self-hatred, self-loathing and isolation on my part. I had no real friends, no formative memories of love and acceptance. I became introverted, quiet and stoic. I used fantasy and books to escape, I used talent and academic measure to feel like i had a purpose, an identity. During this time I became a habitual people pleaser, desperate to make people ‘like me’, desperate to find some way of fixing myself, of ‘fitting in’ but it never happened. All the while I felt a blinding jealousy, a hatred of boys eating away at me. I wanted to be them. I wanted them to accept me. During this time I also discovered porn, and felt very aroused and attracted to the girls in it, although this didn’t manifest itself as much romantically in real life other than in my desire to please them and make them like me. I thought that maybe I was a lesbian.

During high school, I began as a quiet, introverted, brainiac because I had severe social anxiety. I never allowed my real personality to shine through, it was considered too ‘loud’ and ‘brash’ for a girl by others in the past. I was ‘for a female’ fat and unattractive. I personally didn’t give a shit about being ‘pretty’, I didn’t care about my appearance, I didn’t want to be judged on my appearance. Wearing makeup felt weird and odd too me, like I was putting on a disguise. I was confused by the fact that others seemed to care so much about it. I was bullied mercilessly for this,and my aggressiveness and temper and the entire time I felt this same need to be considered one of ‘the boys’ eating away at me. I’d watch the boys doing football and wish I was one of them. Id want to be a part of their banter, to be considered a ‘dude’ in their eyes. I started hammer throwing and liked the idea of my own strength, I would watch male weight lifters and hammer throwers and dream of being like them, being as strong and masculine. During this time I also became obsessed with facial hair and suits, which I just waved away as an ‘aesthetic’ thing. But when I would see a bearded man in a suit I became jealous, I would want his style and his appearance. 


As puberty happened, I never identified with femininity or the experience of womanhood. I felt like an alien species in female spaces. I never connected with female characters on screen in the same way I never connected with the women in my life.I despised looking at my naked body in mirrors. I hated shopping and wearing feminine clothes felt like I was a imposter.  My mum would force me to go bra shopping, or shopping for any kind of clothes and I hated every second of it. I would buy masculine plaid shirts and tie my hair back into a tight bun, because I feared the judgement of having short hair too much to cut it. During this time also I thought I was a lesbian, I was definitely sexually attracted to women, and had never experienced any attraction to men. I assumed that all Lesbians didn’t feel connected to other women, didn’t feel female and wanted to be men. I came out to a friend, then I reconsidered and said I wasn’t. The label didn’t fit correctly and I didn’t know why.  I didn’t care what bra’s I had, or that I had bra’s, I didn’t want breasts. They were there, in my way, ugly sacks of fat that would be better gone. Periods were revolting, but I just got on with it. My body felt like a sort of suit I would have to endure. People pressured me to shave my legs, so I did, desperate to please and be socially acceptable but I never wanted to and felt weird and annoyed doing so. During this time I became more confident and outgoing in myself, and my natural comedic side came out, meaning I had a greater social group and was incredibly well liked, earning me a close group of friends. Unfortunately, these all consisted of girls, as most boys my age treated me with disgust and ridicule, and even when I did find boys who were my friends, I still knew they treated me differently because I was ‘a woman’. I continued to isolate myself, even from my friends, but I didn’t know why. I still wished I was a boy. I still felt like a freak.


During this time, I continued viewing porn. I would imagine myself having sex with women from the male position. I would find gay sex attractive, I would imagine myself as the top in the relationship. The concept of being penetrated, of giving birth made me feel repulsed and sick to my stomach. I would masturbate with a pillow, from a young age, because touching my vagina made me feel ill and sent shivers of disgust down my spine. 
When I got to college, and had what I considered to be a 'true' group of friends, I acted on the surface as if I was happy, jolly and outgoing. But there was something missing. I still felt anxious, depressed and isolated myself. And I still couldn’t comprehend why, I had so deeply repressed my gender issues. A boy that went to primary school with me goes to my college and I still look at him with jealousy. He now has a strong beard, broad hairy chest, muscular arms and a deep voice. I insult, compete with and taunt him, due to my immense jealousy. I mock men a lot for this reason, especially my brother who’s close to my Dad. Who my Dad always took on father son fishing trips and football matches. I wanted that with my Dad. But I just assumed and felt I couldn’t because I was ‘female’. I grew up playing video games, fighting with and dominating my little brother. Now he’s taller than me, has a deeper voice than me, and is growing facial hair. I feel insanely jealous, of him and his gender, so I continue to bully him. I always played video games as male characters in fact, always identified with male characters, my favourite celebrities ( Like Dwayne ’The Rock’ Johnson) were always male. Not out of sexism, but rather because they inspired me. In the same way I played with nintendo toys, racing cars and lightsabers unlike dolls, I was drawn to it.

Now I am in my second year of college, as I’m 17. At the end of last year one of my drama friends came out as FtM transgender. I was initially confused and odd about the entire thing…I had never heard of FtM transgender people, only MtF transgender people..I cisgendered him once accidentally…I was just shocked about the entire thing, and that started making me think if maybe i was MtF transgender too. In shock at the concept and fearing people viewing me as a freak, even though everyone had accepted my friend, I repressed these thoughts and hid them away, focusing on my studies. When I did a drama performance I wore a suit, and these thoughts came roaring back, but fearing rejection I again repressed and ignored them. I began a hyper-feminine form of presentation, cutting my hair into a bob, wearing eyeliner and makeup, dresses and initially because of social approval from my mainly female friends I felt good.It was a facade, a fragile facade, but it worked. I started acting, pretending to be more feminine, making my gestures camper, mimicking my female friends, talking about things I thought were ‘womanly’ things to ‘make a connection’ and gain what I thought was social approval and acceptance. I thought I was finally becoming ‘ a woman’, like a transformation. I put on dresses that hugged my figure, and even though I felt uncomfortable and strange in something that sexualised a body I felt so disconnected with I pretended to be confident.But I wasn’t. I was putting on a performance, I was pretending. You cant ‘become a woman’ I said to myself ‘ because you already are one’. The statement "" I am a woman."" does not resonate with me, at all.

I looked at my face covered in makeup one night, and felt a deep sense of shame, humiliation and disgust in my inability to be myself. I wanted to rip my hair and breasts off. The gruff, temperamental, loud, funny, weird, butch person I was behind closed doors in the comfort of my family I hid in public. I treated my social life like a game to navigate, having to make the right choices or else it would be game over my fear of loneliness and rejection was so intense. These terms. Female. Girl. Pretty. Ladies. Mrs. Miss. Feel disconnected from me completely. I felt once again like a fucking alien, attempting to learn human norms and assimilate, appear ‘presentable’ in the body I have. One day however I put my foot down,I stopped the feminine presentation and persona, and predictably those around me reacted in disdain, and once again I felt like a freak.


For a while, these thoughts went on the back burner. I focused on my work and applications to university. My brother got a weight set for christmas, and I found myself once again insanely jealous of how buff he was going to get. I felt scrawny and weak beside him, and that made me feel upset, because my entire life id had a strong paternalistic attitude towards my little bro. It has made me evaluate my entire body in self loathing. My stick like little arms. Tiny, prepubescent little hands. Ugly tits hanging down like cow udders. Sexualised hour glass curves. a face lacking in facial hair and bone structure, like a doll. I feel sick. Where were my pecs, my biceps, my bone structure.


My parents also brought me the makeup set and eyelash curlers I had asked them for when I was hyper-feminising myself for social approval. I smiled and thanked them, but internally felt dismayed at myself for pretending to be something I wasn’t. 


I have only recently discovered FtM transgenderism as a concept that could apply to my life. I was aware it existed, through my friend, and social media. But only now have I truly begun to evaluate my feelings and consider the possibility that I’m a boy. Due to this, all sorts of memories have come flooding back, and I feel more repulsed and distant with my body than ever. I don’t like looking at it in the mirror, when I was pretending I could disconnect it from myself, but now I cant, and it feels wrong. Something has always been wrong with me, I assumed it was just that I was an alien freak who was destined to never have friends and never fit in with anyone. Now I’m realising its perhaps more complex. I have never truly felt or identified with being a female….but does that mean I’m a trans male? 


Thank you for listening to my story. Even if you cant help me on my journey to self discovery, you have made me feel less alone and confused in myself by simply reading this. "
babeunderseige,asktransgender,"My parents are extremely concerned about the health issues of me taking HRT (19, MTF)","I am 18, nearing 19. I have spoken to my parents about being transgender (mtf). They want me to do whatever makes me happy and say that I have a right to choose what to do with my life.

However, they are very concerned about the ramifications of me taking hormone replacement therapy for the rest of my life, let alone having the surgeries. 

My Dad is very naturalistic and pro-alternative medicine -- he won't take an aspirin if he can help it and against taking drugs in general. 

He is extremely concerned for my health -- that I may have terrible health issues such as liver problems or shorter lifespan as a result of taking HRT before even considering my desire to make a permanent decision. 

I think I am close to being sure of my condition of being transgender and have felt this way for seven years, including brief moments when I was 10 years old. I don't think the thoughts are ever going to go away. 

Even though I fear transitioning is the only option, I fear that he is also right about there being big consequences for my health.

I also fear that if I'm right in my decision to transition and won't regret it, I will be missing out on preventing the further permanent effects of male puberty I may still have in store for me. "
TrueHOAS,asktransgender,Reality has hit me again,"I am 16 and I have never felt my dysphoria this strong. I should be happy because everyone is accepting me but I just can't. My body is already too manly and I am just bones and skin so HRT can probably do nothing to get me to cis girl standards since bones don't change.


I know every girl is different but I am just a big, ugly mess with a big upper body, nothing feminine. My hips are nonexistent and will probably never be womanly because the bones will not grow anymore, my proportions overall are just too manly to ever be attractive or feminine. It feels like I am taller than everyone, there are just a few taller than me. I feel like shit and honestly wish I was never born. My face is just a mess, nothing feminine except for my skin and everything is just straight ugly. I can't have kids, my past was as a boy and I can't be as feminine as the cis girls because my past molded my behaviour and perception of things. My voice is so deep that I can never have a real girl voice, not only that of this I will be unable to squeal, scream and stuff."

I have to tell my wife at least, and I'd prefer to do that first, but I know from experience that she won't take it well and I'm afraid she will out me to a lot of other people. I don't necessarily want to come out to everyone else yet...maybe after I've been on HRT for a few months. But what would you do? Would you tell your spouse first, or would you go behind their back and tell a bunch of other people first, just in case, so that they don't have to hear it from an angry and hurt spouse, and you can tell them the way you want to, on your own terms, even if you're not really ready to tell them yet?

Edit: The reason I worry about my spouse telling people is that I came out to her in the past, and she was somewhat supportive in that she kept it secret, said it's my choice, etc but that she couldn't be with me if I wanted to transition. Well, shame on me, I told her I didn't need to transition, basically went back into the closet, and now it's five years later and I have a feeling she's not going to take it well when I tell her that I lied to her again for five more years."

Throwytransthrowaway,asktransgender,Maybe I'm Cis. Kind of a weird question,"Sorry for the throw away account, I don't really want any of my friends to know I'm questioning my gender.

I'm a trans girl in her early 20s who took to transition like a fish to water. I finally came all the way out to myself about 7 1/2 months ago, I'm full-time everywhere to everyone, and hormones for just over six months. I'm making constant progress at breakneck speed, I've never been more comfortable with myself, I've never been happier. I love my feminine expression, I love estrogen, I love everything about my changing body and, conversely, hate pretty much everything explicitly 'male' about myself, up to and (DEFINITELY) including my genitals.

However... lately I've been hanging out with a few gay trans guys, one of whom is very very femme, definitely more than I am, and I've been having weird pangs of jealously when I'm around him. I'm not jealous because he's prettier or more feminine than I am, I'm pretty comfortable with my gender expression, but I guess I'm envious of his actual identity? I don't think I want to be a femme gay cis guy, and I have really bad genial dysphoria, but something about specifically being a femme gay trans guy really, really appeals to me and I'm not sure why.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is whether or not anyone can relate to that? Does it sound like something you've heard before?


Part of me feels like it's just early transition confusion, but I figured it might help to get some feedback. Thanks.

aililll,asktransgender,How to assure conservative parents that trans is ok?,"Hi there, beautiful people. 

My cousin came out as FtM several months ago. Although I'm living in the 2.5k miles from him I'm trying my best to show my support. He haven't dove into all the transition stuff (yet?), and the problem is that his parents (my aunt and uncle) are not taking it seriously at all.

sgoddardta,asktransgender,Another clichéd 'am I trans?' post.,"If you're sick of reading this kind of thing, I don't blame you. I mostly just need to scream into the void more than anything.

I'm 18 y/o, I was born male, and I think I might be trans. I think. I don't know.

The obsession with femininity (I mean proper stereotypical femininity) dates back to when I was a toddler. I was obsessed with Barbie and basically everything girly (I wanted a Barbie bike for my birthday, my parents refused because they figured I'd be bullied). But since I was pretty much forced into acting more like a 'male should' during school I lost that entirely. Until this year, where I went shopping with my female friend (still mostly gravitated towards having girl friends) and she was picking out clothes and I suddenly felt really weird and not like myself. Basically I wanted to wear it all, I wanted to try all of it on, and pretty much be her. I even picked out things in my head that I wanted to have.

Since then I've been struggling with it non-stop. I don't have what people have described to me as the 'telltale signs' of being trans, aka looking in the mirror and not feeling right, hating the idea of being male, or wanting to wear female-gendered clothes. The idea of being male, to me, is just...'meh'. I would cope. I look in the mirror and I just see me. And as for wearing women's clothes...just no. Not for any 'ew crossdressing' reason, it would just feel like...lying. I guess. (P.S. this isn't saying that I think crossdressing people are lying, this is just how I personally feel, sorry if I offend anyone)

It just leads me to think that what if it isn't dysphoria at all. What if it's just a weird obsession with femininity left over from when I was a child? What if I come out to everyone and starting living as female and then change my mind and it goes away and then I'd have to live with everyone knowing that.

It's pretty much certain in my head at this point that the answer to the old 'if you could change your sex/gender right now with no physical or social side effects, would you?' question is a certain yes. I would live as a woman. But real life isn't as simple as that. I would have to come out to my parents, who already seem...exasperated with me as I keep going back and forth between orientations as I try and figure what I like and don't. They're still very much stuck in that Gen X mindset of 'you're either gay or straight, pick one and move on'.

My family is probably the biggest reason that I don't go ahead with it, plus the inner self-doubt of whether it's real at all. I just don't know and all of this is making me more confused by the day.

Chaojidage,asktransgender,Worried about blockers and puberty...,"Hi, everyone, and I'm a 16 year old student with parents who are semi-supportive. They say they love me no matter who I am, but think that my dysphoria will go away with time. They definitely want me to present male due to a cultural preference for males, but recently, I dropped hints that I don't like being referred to as ""big brother"" when my mom talks to our dog, and she seems to be making an effort to stop doing that.

Anyway, my recognition of being female is not a phase; the suppression of that recognition is, and I've fully come out to myself after a year of denial. However, I've only recently realized that I'm rather lucky to have a slower puberty and a less masculine form, and I want to halt puberty right now and start HRT. My parents probably don't want me to take estrogen, but I need to at least start antiandrogens sometime soon.

I'm super scared to talk to my parents about this, but my dad seems more supportive. They say being transgender is a taboo topic when I came out this April, and refused to even let me talk with my younger brother about it. Should I talk to them about estrogen and (when they probably refuse to let me take it) settle for blockers, which should be easier to accept when they've refused a ""favor"" of a larger scale? Or should I not stun them by talking about taking estrogen so suddenly when I've kept my mouth shut about anything trans-related in 8 months?

I'd appreciate your advice!"

Basically, I met this girl sometime in the last two years, she's one of the first real women I've ever been friends with IRL (it's a long story but I've been isolated a lot in my life). I used to be friends with a couple girls online and I always felt like I could relate to them so much more than any of my male friends, and I always wanted to be friends with them in a less traditional way, like I always wanted to be friends with them like how I perceived other girls to be friends with each other, not like how guys are friends with girls: emotionally invested, affectionate, open. This is how I'm feeling right now too with my new friend, but the feelings are even stronger now than they were before, because she's real and tangible. I want to be able to record songs with her where we both sing, or have sleepovers with her (non-sexual), or whatever really, and the stuff that I feel like I can't do with her because I'm a male, that's what causes me this discomfort, what I think may be dysphoria. When I feel like there are things that I can't do because of my perceived gender, that is when I feel the worst. I've felt that anxiety, or whatever you want to call it, for ages. I only recently realized gender might have something to do with, and so far it's felt very true to who I am and in a way it's made that feeling easier to deal with.

 More than anything, though, I feel like I can relate to women so much more than men. I have male friends and they're cool, but now that I really have this contrast of what it's like to be friends with both, and I thrive with girls 100%. It just makes more sense to me. On top of all of this, I'm very reserved, very in tune with my emotions, I've been called sensitive and soft spoken... I don't know. I don't know how to define any of this.

I don't know if any of this really means that I'm more female leaning or what, but because of the introspection I've really realized at the last that I don't feel or act too much like a male, so I think I am somewhere in the middle, gender neutral.

What do ya'll think?

throwaway2964k,asktransgender,Do cis guys secretly think being male sucks?,"I'm a trans man and think being male is awesome, but I was chatting to someone who said the world is horrible to men and society is structured for women's advantage. He listed 'female privileges' such as not being expected to die in combat, having men be their slaves to win their affections, getting free drinks on ladies nights and being allowed to be practically naked (sleeveless dresses, short skirts/shorts etc) in professional settings where men are expected to cover up in long sleeved shirts and pants, even suits. He said that was just one example of society's humiliating slutshaming of male bodies. (Another being how there are so many magazines of sexy women but not sexy men. He'd created a whole FB page just to rant about what he termed 'female exposure privilege'.) He says most men don't dare to talk about this because feminists would get them into trouble.

I insisted that being female was worse and what he talked about were the results of benevolent sexism and homophobia. He said I wouldn't think so if I'd been born male without the protections of female privilege. So that made me dysphoric and thinking that maybe if I was a Real Man and had grown up subject to toxic masculinity, I would understand how horrible it actually was - i.e. the fact I enjoy being male is proof I'm not really a man, which set off the old ""am I really trans?"" dilemma.

Do you know if most cis guys are actually angry about those things and jealous of women for it? The things he mention don't bother me much, but I'm obviously biased, and the existence of MRAs would suggest it's not that rare an experience.

(Some of his posts set off my transdar so I asked outright if he would prefer to be a girl. He said no, because he was born a boy and sex changes were unnatural. It's not the most convincing answer, but I'm also wary of just writing off his grievances as the result of being a closeted trans woman.)"

My posts are always so long QQ

Anyhow, I was wondering, at what point did you realise this won't just go away, these feelings, that it isn't just a phase?
Also, as I've gathered, it's not uncommon to come to terms with your gender through fetishes... which is my case. I’ve first thought about being a girl when I felt like being a boy won’t work out for me romantically. I don’t see myself dating men as a man, but as a female I doubt I’d have a problem with either. But, there are these things that keep nagging at the back of my head like, sure I'd love to have a female body, but when I think of the future and my family, I always see myself as a dad. Then, most of my idols are male, at least when it comes to attitude and actions. I basically only really think of girly things due to them simply being... pretty. The body, clothes, make-up... and while I idolise males in a certain way, my personal feelings, my character, is more female... at least that's what I think. I understand now what male privilege means and how much us guys can actually get away with just being… male… and it kind of sucks. I don’t mind being a girl, and being girly and doing girly things, but I don’t see myself as hyperfeminine… more of a lady in the streets, Rambo in a forest, and a slut in the sheets. I just don’t think I’d ever give up my wild (feral) side, because I love it so much… I’m not a party maniac, but I am a survival maniac… I’d totally be a lady, but a savage lady o.o

Even now, I think myself more of a pervert than transgender... and I somehow believe that, should I find an understanding female partner (understanding of my general weirdness), I wouldn't have any problem whatsoever being male for the rest of my life. Obviously, sex would be very quirky...

So what am I? Just a perv, trans, something in between, nothing definable? It scares the hell out of me, what I've read on some blogs and other trans oriented webpages, that in the end it comes down to your own personal subjective choice, and that it's all about how you feel... well, I've never really trusted my feelings, they've betrayed me a lot (romantically unfulfilled person here, can't emphasize that enough, like a stigma upon my soul), so I've learned for the last... 10 years to be EXTREMELY logical, and logic seems to not work in this particular case... and I don't know how to deal with that!
If it comes down to me simply, mathematically weighing pros and cons, I'm quite sure I'll end up not transitioning... but what if I can't stand it anymore and end up transitioning at the age of 40, or 50? I'd prefer being young when I transition, I don't want to miss out on experiences... pursuit of life experiences had led me in many an odd situation, but I liked them all, they gave me what I wanted... but this is just so much to deal with... an absolute life changer…

And here I am, shaven from the waist down, exfoliated, moisturized, feeling good about the way my lower body looks in a mirror (I swear to you, my skin is that of a 20yold (30yo actually), and my hips look feminine as hell, even though I work out vigorously), but feeling sad because I don't have any female undergarments to wear tonight (will be dressed in full boy mode on the outside).

I'll end up repeating myself a lot so I'll wrap this up here.

Thanks for your time and take care.

Happy New Year!"
actually_crazy_irl,asktransgender,What's the best analogy you've come up with for some trans-related thing?,"I've come to realise that the need to transition is - in a way - much like an animal's need to chew off a leg trapped in one of those iron bear traps. To an outsider, it might seem completely insane, having the urge to just chew off your leg when you're completely aware of what you are doing and what you are about to lose, but you just know it *has to be done*. They don't see the trap, they don't understand why you can't just live your life with the leg intact like a normal person, or just compromise and maybe just chew off a few toes?

What makes crystal clear sense to you makes no sense at all for them, because dysphoria is invisible. A massive component of the equation is intangible. They don't see the trap."

the-nat,asktransgender,"Thinking about starting HRT as a nonbinary person, but very unsure??? (Also unsure if nonbinary or FTM)","Hi I've been lurking for a few months but been too anxious to post 'til now. I've got this kinda catch-22 on my hands. (sorry for long post I don't know how much info is helpful or unhelpful to include)

For the past couple of years since I was 19 (I turn 22 in a few weeks) I've identified as nonbinary, and it's suited me pretty well? I finally figured out late in the game that I don't like the societal expectations that come with being strictly male or strictly female. I present pretty masculinely, although it's difficult because I'm on the smaller end so finding guy clothes that actually fit me is a challenge. It's also hard because I still like bright flashy patterns and soft oversize sweaters sometimes, but I'm afraid to wear them, since because of my height and my voice people immediately peg me as a girl for them, and I know for certain I'm not comfortable as a girl.

For awhile I was on hormonal birth control to stop my period from happening (I wasn't thinking about taking T at all yet, and my toxic ex boyfriend sort of pressured me into starting the pill but I ended up keeping on with it so as not to have a period anymore because aside from making me uncomfortable for gender related issues, I also get super nauseous during shark week). My period is one of the only physical dysphorias I get; largely they're social perception-related for me otherwise.

Here's the problem: I would really like to stop having a period, but I can no longer take hormonal (estrogen-based) birth control because I found out it's been increasing my anxiety to a point where my generalized anxiety problems are ruining my life. Upon realizing that in October I quit the pill and started looking for alternative options (of which there's basically none, btw), and began thinking about starting HRT, which has been looking like an increasingly appealing option. I'm just... not sure I want to go ""all the way"", is the problem. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with reaching the level of masculinity that would also stop me from having a period, and the fact that if I made it to a point on T where I stopped having a period, I would not be able to stop taking it or else be at risk of serious medical complications. 
Simply removing my uterus is off the table, because I have a crippling phobia of surgery. It's just not an option for me.

I discussed the prospect of starting hormones with my brother recently, since he usually has my back when I bring stuff like this to my parents (who are... attempting to be supportive but very, very confused and very binary-thinking, and when I mentioned the idea of HRT to them they basically said ""I thought you didn't want to be a boy either???""). My brother, quite bluntly, gave me the ultimatum of ""Would you rather have a beard or a period?"" and I honestly can say I'd rather have a beard, even if I would REALLY rather have neither. The thing is, you can shave away a beard but you can't shave away a period. And lately, I've been wondering if I might be more guy-leaning anyway, just not an especially masculine guy...

Basically I'm stuck on a) suffering the nausea and dysphoria of having a period, b) suffering the increased anxiety problems and chest pain - which makes me uncomfortable with my chest - while on birth control, or c) starting testosterone and actually fixing a lot of the gender problems - voice and body type especially - and eventually reaching a point where I even get rid of the period, but also never being able to stop taking T and getting increasingly masculine beyond how I think I want to be.

(I also have the added complication that I might be living in Japan this time next year and I'm under the impression that it's a lot harder to get HRT there; I'd be going the informed consent route in the USA but I don't think they have that option in Japan and importing any kind of drug but especially controlled substances is ridiculously hard, but I really don't expect anyone to have an answer for me on that front so ignore this I guess)

I don't know how to figure out where to draw the line as to how I identify on the scale of nonbinary to effeminate male, or if it even really matters aside from semantically. I've never tried using he/him/his pronouns before, but I keep thinking and wondering about it. Is there a way to know for sure? Does it even matter in the end to anyone but me? Anyone ever deal with something similar? Opinions? I'll literally take anything at this point I don't know anyone else to ask."

DollyLexi,asktransgender,Dysphoria wave seemingly over...what happened?,"I was in a pretty tough wave of dysphoria from about April to sometime last week. In fact, I distinctly remember last feeling it the night of Thanksgiving. Then over the next few days after, it started feeling better so I sort of played it by ear and thought maybe I was just feeling more relaxed from having several days off from work. By Sunday night that weekend, it just felt...gone? I thought it was too good to be true, but here I am over a week later feeling okay! I'm actually able to focus on other things instead of being bogged down with the constant intrusive thoughts of feeling the wrong gender.

Something to note: I'm not on HRT and never have been. This isn't to sound disparaging towards those who manage dysphoria with HRT, but times like now are when I feel like I don't need HRT. I do realize that feeling ""okay"" probably won't last forever though as it hasn't in the past but I can try to stay optimistic at the very least. I often see people posting here about their dysphoria feeling better after being on HRT or feeling better after just starting it due to a sort of placebo effect, but that isn't the case for me. I did pretty much nothing out of the ordinary and then suddenly it's like a switch was turned off. It wasn't a conscious thing for me. I didn't take any effort to convince myself either way at all. It just...happened...on it's own.

What made it go away? What changed in my head that suddenly made me go from thinking about my gender for every non-distracted moment of the day to just feeling fine how I am now? I know the brain and hormones are really weird and complicated but there has to be something to it. I did take several days off from work - could catching up on sleep be a factor? It was the day after Thanksgiving - does turkey have an effect on your hormones and the way you think? I'm just really curious as to how this happened because it seemed way too sudden and drastic to just go away so quickly. Also, if my dysphoria comes back at full force, maybe I can experiment with myself to see if it actually was something I did or if it really was just completely random.

Did anyone else have any similar experiences at any point?

Their approval came with a 30 day time limit and information on having the doctor contact them if they could not schedule the surgery within 30 days. There was not an opening within the time period so the surgery got scheduled for a later date (Dec 28th).

This morning the hospital called my parents at around 10 am saying that they have a policy that if payment or insurance guarantee is not received by 9am the morning before the day of the surgery, they cancel the surgery. Apparently when contacted to extend the time period, the insurance company had just rejected the claim (which they had previously accepted) and the surgery had been canceled before my family had a chance to do anything about it.

The insurance apparently rejected the claim citing a change in policy on October 1st that transitional surgeries will only be covered if the recipient is over 18. The thing is, they originally accepted the claim on a date that was after the supposed policy change. We were not even made aware until it was too late to do anything and the surgery was cancelled. My mother is currently on the phone with the hospital to see what our options are and if we can get the surgery back on even if we have to pay out of pocket. I'm not sure how financially feasible this will be, but my brother is absolutely devastated and we're all trying to do everything we can to help him out.

I am asking for advice on this situation/how to help my brother out. Being a minor (currently in high school), he gets a lot of crap from people about being too young for big decisions like this, or just being confused and needing to give it some time so he can grow out of this ""phase"". He is the bravest guy I know and he was so excited for tomorrow and to never have to bind his breasts again to try and hide them. If anyone has words of advice or wisdom for him, that would help us out so much. Thank you."
lucykiddo,asktransgender,"""Gay Agenda""","This really pisses me off.. Long story short. Ive come out to my close family about 3months ago. Parents were pretty accepting, my bro was 50/50 about it. I only managed to talk about my situation with my brother for a little bit of time. Months go by, and i have made some attempts to talk to my brother about me being trans, but he seems a bit uncomfortable talking about it, so i havent really made an effort as of recently to reach out to him again.

Yesterday, (xmas).. I was able to talk to his gf, when I accompanied her to the grocery store to get stuff for our xmas gathering. I had asked her if she had talked to my brother about everything and she said yes. She had told me that my brother thinks I am being influenced by youtubers/social media, media tv\, and everything else that is going on in the world regarding the trans movement. He thinks there is a bigger plan by the ""elite"" to feminize males.

This really pisses me off, because i've been knowing that i have been trans from a very young age (Im 25 now).. and he dosent seem to want to listen to my side of the story and the stuff I have been through to realize that i am really in fact trans... Has anybody else been told that they are being  brainwashed into wanting to be trans??? -___-"
Jazz8680,asktransgender,NSFW Confused about sexuality NSFW,"So I'm in the middle of questioning and when I evaluate my sexuality I get really confused. I'm AMAB and am attracted to women, but I think I'm MtF. Anyway, when I think about sex, I think of penetrative and just thinking about that makes me feel either dysphoric or that I'm not actually trans. Like, at the moment I have moderate genital dysphoria, and thinking about sex makes me feel weird. How do I rationalize being a woman with wanting to have penetrative sex with my bits? 

It'd be so much easier on HRT with a stunted libido, but I'm pre everything and can't seem to help occasionally thinking about it. Damn you testosterone..."
juniper645,asktransgender,"My long-term partner has come out as trans. I love them so much and support them, but am sexually confused. What should I do?","Dear asktransgender redditors,

I hope you can give me advice on this distressing situation. I'm cis-female, in my late twenties. I've been with my partner (also late twenties) for 4.5 years now. For the first 3 of those years, and before we met, my partner identified as cis-male. Last year, they came out to me as gender-neutral. I was, am, and always will be very happy to support them, and love them very much.

The problem is that our sex life has taken a huge blow for the past year or so. Although they've been wanting sex, I haven't been in the mood, and they haven't pressured me. There might be many reasons for my change (e.g. a couple's sex life sometimes diminishes over time, especially at the 3-year mark). But I know in my heart that a large part of it was the gender transition. The best way I can describe my feelings is that I feel confused when I'm in bed with them, and have problems getting turned on.

The lack of sex has been a big problem for my partner. I've taken my time to figure things out carefully, and until recently didn't tell them my conclusions about the reason why. I finally told them yesterday night. This was very saddening to them, although they said they'd anticipated it. We agreed that honesty was best, but I feel awful for hurting my partner this way. I truly think that they are beautiful inside and out. I know that they intellectually know I think this. But it's obviously difficult for anyone to truly feel this, after their partner has told them what I did. 

I know not everyone might agree with my decision to tell them. I'm sure this is a huge fear for many coming out. But it's been done. Practically speaking, I don't know where to go from here. I'll continue talking things through with my partner, finding out what they feel and need, and doing my best to support them. But some advice from third parties would be good too. Has anyone else ever been in a similar situation? What do you advise? Any short-term and long-term strategies? How can I best support my partner in this difficult time?

Thank you.

P.S. some details which may be relevant:

- I've been attracted to and had physical relationships with cis-men, cis-women, trans-women, and gender-neutral people. However, this is the first time I've been with someone who has transitioned over the course of our relationship.

- My partner's still sexually attracted to me. Sex is important to them, both physically and as a deeper expression of love and care.

- We are polyamorous. We are each other's primary partners. We live together, sleep in the same bed on most nights, share expenses, and make long-term plans together. But we do see other people, and are open to both emotional and physical involvement. We've both had sex with others in the past year, although I've had more. Please - no moral judgment on our lifestyles.

- The way in which they've externally manifested their transition is through the following. They've changed their name, wear dresses, skirts, jewellery and makeup whereas they didn't used to, and have changed their pronoun from 'him' to 'them'. They also behave differently and more femininely in other ways. This includes the way they behave in bed.

- My partner's in a relatively vulnerable position that might exacerbate their emotions (especially self-esteem). They've relocated from another state to be with me. Thankfully, they've made new friends and networks (not just through me). But they've been struggling to find regular employment (although they have some). I'm financially stable, and bear more of our shared expenses for now. They see a therapist to manage depression, anxiety, and Tourette's.

- This goes without saying, but I absolutely don't wish for them to change the way they identify, or express the way they identify. Their freedom in this respect far overrides any other conflicting desires I may personally have. Any steps we take moving forward will not include them changing anything about their gender identity or expression.

- As far as they wish to, I unequivocally wish to be with this person for a very long time to come. I love them, and love the person they are. I want, of course, for them to be happy. If this means I can't be with them, then I'll let them go. But I'll be devastated. We are best friends, and I still have romantic feelings for them. I suppose some people will find it hard to understand how someone can be confused about someone sexually, yet experience romantic feelings for them. But this is really how I feel about them."

JaiRenae,asktransgender,Parent of transgender,"First time posting in this sub. My adult daughter came out as gay in high school and a year ago voiced her feeling that she should have been born a male and was considering transitioning to male. While I am all aboard with her wanting to be true to herself, which she always has been, I am conflicted because part of me feels like I was a bad parent because of this. I haven't been able to call her male, or by her chosen name, preferring to wait until she absolutely decides to transition. She dresses neither male nor female and I have discussed that perhaps she'd be more comfortable staying how she is. She is happy where she's at at the moment, but I think the transitioning is being pushed by my ex Mother-In-Law.

I'd love to hear from any other parents who have been down this road and dealt with these conflicts."

While I don't have genital dysphoria (I do fantasise about having a penis from time to time but I don't hate the equipment I already have) and I don't have issues with things like penetrative sex and oral etc, I can't shake the feeling that the role I take is too feminine. I'm not sure how well I've explained it, but I feel like the stuff we do puts me very much in the role that a woman would take during sex, and I'm looking for ways to switch it up and things we can do to put me in more of a masculine role.

Current ideas include things like anal play and dirty talk, but aside from that I'm struggling to think of things we can do. We're both pretty open to kink stuff.

LostAndCrying,asktransgender,"I know at this point I need a therapist, but my anxiety is making it feel impossible to reach out. Does anyone here have good advice?","Hey folks,

I need some help with how to find a trustworthy therapist, and how to overcome a boatload of anxiety in reaching out regarding gender therapy.

Back in October my boyfriend and I were having a conversation and it finally clicked - I realized I wasn't just an effeminate gay man, truth is I am a woman deep down. After that day and a good long sob, I've been telling myself I need to get myself to a therapist to work things out. Given I have insurance through work and I'm in the SF Bay, I figured that making initial contact with a therapist would be the easiest part of the whole process - but I keep being my own biggest enemy.

I am familiar with PsychologyToday.com and have been trying to use that. However I am starting to despise that site. It just feels so gross. Everyone has the same little pointless blurbs on their pages that all say the same thing about ""solving issues"" and ultimately mean nothing. I hate how every person has a photograph - it makes it feel like I am the sleaziest scumball on the world's worst dating site. I don't want to make snap-judgement based on appearances but I find myself doing that because of the pictures being unavoidably front-and-center, you know?  I mean I'm setting my filters and whatnot, but everyone seems to _do everything_ so it's unclear who has actual hands-on experience vs theoretical training. Then the site isn't exactly clear most of the time - if the person's issues include Transgender but the categories don't include Transgender Clients is that supposed to be meaningful or just a UI oversight? How about the other way around?

In early November I set myself a deadline to find a therapist by the first weekend of the month since I had some time off work - but that date went whizzing past and made me so despondent I tried to convince myself that by missing this entirely arbitrary date it somehow made my feelings any less real. (If only it were that easy to change reality!) So I have decided against deadlines. But it's been nearly 3 damned months and I'm still dying inside and having nightmares that ruin my sleep every night. Hence I'm here to ask for help in overcoming this critical hurdle.

I have tried to reach out to one therapist already. After agonizing for a weekend I reached out to the top therapist on my short-list who was available, and sent them a succinct but heart-felt email explaining who I am and why I was reaching out (I know for a fact I have some non-standard parts of my lifestyle - I wanted to be upfront to make sure they would be comfortable with those topics). But I feel that I spilled a bit too much of my heart . I got a very brief response. She was unavailable at the times I was interested in so she wished me luck. I have felt so down about that I haven't had the heart to try reaching out again. She recommended two other therapists in her area but I didn't like those two for their own reasons. And I suck at phone calls - I feel my voice leave my body if I try to talk out loud about these things with anyone but my boyfriend. I can't make the words have volume.

I know I should try finding a group or organization in my area and asking for advice. But I'm weirdly and frustratingly anxious around people (the root of the above). I'm in the SF Bay Area - I couldn't possibly ask for a better location to take care of this. But I am too afraid of other people and their opinions of me. Everyone else's problems are legitimate, but my own I will defeat internally with shaky logic and poor reasoning. This anxiety is honestly something else I could use a therapist for - so given it seems to be keeping me from reaching for therapy it's in itself a fun little catch-22, right?

Thanks for any advice everyone. Have a beautiful day wherever you are!"
borishead,asktransgender,"How do you determine if I am trans, do I need a therapist, and can I live without acting on it?","I'm sorry if this has been discussed ad nauseam. But any help would be greatly appreciated. Puh-lease!

Ever since I was young, I've only had sexual fantasies of transforming genders. It started off with other faceless people transforming against their will then over the years, people transforming against their will, then having sex.. then years later.. me transforming against my will.. then having sex.. then now, that i'm in my 40's, just being a woman and having sex with men. 
I've only been with a handful of women, and I married a bi-woman.. we rarely had sex. And when we did, I wasn't into it. We divorced 10 years ago, and I haven't really been with anyone since.  I tell friends that ""dating isn't worth all the effort."" I get very attracted to women, but not enough to act on it. I have EXTREMELY low self opinions about myself.
Does this make me trans?
I don't know what it means to identify as a woman.. because i've never been. 

I know if there was a magic button that wouldn't turned me into a woman,  and all my friends and family would've accepted, I know I would've pushed it decades ago without hesitation. 

BUT.. in reality, I'm 46, and feel like it's too late to act on it. I'm a big guy 6' 300lbs. I look like a bouncer. I worry that i'll always look like a ugly guy in a dress. 
Can I continue to live like this? Or am I going to regret not pursuing this when i'm 80? Are there tests?

I shaved about an hour before the appointment, was this way too soon, and maybe the reason why it hurt so much more than people usually say it does?

Is there something that I can do before hand to make it less painful? Things like ibuprofen, alleve, and aspirin don't normally work for me, so maybe a cream or something?

_littledipster,asktransgender,Is it true that trans women have smaller than average breasts when compared to cis women?,"I see this statement thrown around a lot and I really question the validity of it.

I often wonder if lacking breast growth among trans women is really just the fact that not all women are well endowed or even that full and adequate breast growth takes years rather than months.

Are we too quick to deem HRT ineffectual because of our eagerness? Does HRT inevitably fall short of our own dreams and desires for our bodies? Is this not the case for all women and men? 

EDIT: Information about cis girls I think we would do well to consider concerning the speed and efficacy of HRT.

I had done some looking around vaginaplasty and such a method and it's variations does exist for resolving vaginal agenesis e.g. Pudendal-thigh flap vaginoplasty, Singapore flap, Hip skin flap/graft...Etc, plus

It is possible that this method has been modified for MTFs and Intersex ppl. This is also with the assumption that penile and scrotum material is deemed insufficient + the patient does not wish to opt for the colon method.

Looks like 'no dilation' for MTF transsexual SRS does exist after all. So apparently, there are Thai, Pakistan, Japan and Chinese surgeons who are aware of this, and do employ the method. Why is this not as discussed as often, I have no idea."
downintheforest_,asktransgender,I want to help trans people transition as a career. What do i do?,"Title is pretty good, but I'll elaborate. I'm interested in both mental health and helping people transition. As a trans person myself, I would love to help others be happy. This also stems from wanting to help people in general, but also having a great interest in health and medicine. What are some careers that would allow me to focus on helping trans people? What are some careers that would allow me to help people mentally? I appreciate all help as this is something that I've wanted to do and will finally give me some kind of goal in life. Thanks!"

LightningZombie,asktransgender,Help with name/gender change,"So i am really upset after i get the judge to okay this i have no idea what the hell to do. I live in California, and the instructions say  i need to send a ""certified"" copy of the judges order. It doesnt say at all how to accomplish this. Thats problem 1 problem 2 is I need to send that along with a whole bunch of stuff to the California Department of Public Health and i have no idea what all to send. I filed to change both name and gender same time it was all one packet and some loose forms. Apparently there is a huge distinction between an amended birth certificate and a new one. I want a new one. The amended one will state i has a gender and name change while a new one wont.

instructions only mention to send them a certified copy of the order but apparently that's not enough. I have no idea how much money to send them or what exactly is appropriate i see gender change listed under prices but only for Amended birth certificates. Plus i haven't a clue which documents to fill out and send. On top of that it says they must be on special paper so no idea how to obtain the forms to fill out. Very stressed and i have a time limit they give you a month and don't say what happens if you exceed it. Please help me i have autism and im doing this alone

Need to know
1 How to get a ""certified"" copy of the order
2 How much a ""NEW"" birth certificate not amended with new name and gender on it is
3 How to get the forms and which ones they are for said certificate

Please help i have autism and the stress to get this done is overwhelming im greatful for any help "

FoggyMorningRain,asktransgender,I feel like my life has been on hold for my whole life since childhood. I'm just waiting for some moment to actually live.,"I've realized lately that I've started withdrawing from my life because I don't have surgery yet. I did ballet as a kid and I've always wanted to get back into it but just thinking about revealing that I'm trans or possibly showing something down there makes me want to cry. That same feeling has overcome the rest of of my life and has only become stronger with time. Almost every action I make somehow is affected by this feeling and has created a cycle. 

I've also started to realize that most of my dreams that I had as a kid will never happen and it's too late to even start living. Like the ballet thing, I stopped because I was bullied for being girly (duh) and the ""best years of my life"" we're skipped. I just really wish I could have been born cis and given a chance to dream big. Now my dream is big but small, I've worked so hard to become the woman I am, but now that I am an adult and years later I still have no way to pay for surgery and that's become my silly dream. 

But it's almost like, why? What are my dreams after that? Why have I had to sacrifice everything just for a tiny basic part of my life that in the end doesn't mean much. I am missing something that basically everybody has had from birth, I'll finally feel like a person but born in my 20s. I've realized this and yet I can't help but distance myself from my life even more. "

When I was looking at myself in the mirror this morning I hate my male face and my genitals. But when I see my breasts and feminine figure, even though I'm way overweight, I get aroused. I don't want that, but I can't help it. Does this mean it's probably a fetish?

Lately I've been having some desire for sex, but not as a guy. And just thinking about that gets me aroused. I don't want that because it makes me worry this is just a fetish, even though I don't think it is.

Only thing is, I'm still pre-everything and masculine looking so not sure how it will all look when it's done."
Vyrmayn_Gothryn,asktransgender,"Fairly certain I'm trans, would like input?","So, I'll try to include as much information as I can think of. I'm a male for one, I have a dick, for reference. I never thought I was a girl my entire life until about the last month, however I had becoming increasingly comfortable with my feminine side for the past year or so. I grew up in a very 'conservative' Christian house, and consequently, for as long as I could remember, I hated (and I don't use that word too lightly in this) people who were not 'good Christian, god-fearing folks'. Especially gay peoples and trans. I'm happy to say I'm not a horrible human being anymore :p

About 2-ish years ago, I stopped being a Christian upon realizing I was Bisexual, but it took me a good year to fully accept it. During this time I still had my transphobia going on, unfortunately. However, in the last year or so I have slowly become comfortable with being feminine, thanks to my best friend who is also quite feminine, and bisexual if that matters.

This was a slow process of accepting it, until about a couple months ago for some reason is started to really gain speed. Lots of speed! I can't quite remember what was going on with me when it first started happening, but basically, it all started with thigh-high socks. I had been researching transgender for a week or so, admittedly somewhat obsessively (I do this with everything I get interested in. I did it for like half a year when I learned I was bisexual, obsessively researching and seeing other peoples experiences).

So after a week or so of that, I decided to order some thigh high socks. I had to wait until I got a job, so the hype got kind of outrageous. And I am not a person to hype easily! And my hype is always let down. But not this time! My socks got here a little more than a week ago, and I was SO EXCITED to try them on. But I decided I had to shave my leg first, which I should add, was amazing. It felt like something I should have been doing for a while. Anyway, I tried my sock on, and just, god DAMN it made me so happy how feminine I looked and felt! I only tried one on, because it took me about 3 hours to shave one leg... I need to get better at shaving.

Anyway, so I was all excited geeking out about it to my best friend, and then for some reason, every fiber in my body wanted to say ""I am trans"" to him, AND I DID. And it was the happiest I can ever remember feeling when I said that! And then after that, he called me Mistress Vyrmayn, and Miss Vyrmayn, and the grin on my face was so embarrassingly huge that I covered my face even tho nobody was in the room.

Okay, and so that was 5 days ago. The day after that, I shaved the other leg, and I felt so feminine! And then I tried on both socks on at the same time, and I was in fucking heaven. *Then* the day *after* that, I shaved EVERYTHING. And after I got out of the shower, I looked in the mirror, and I mean, okay I'm fat and I have boobs. Like, bigger boobs than fat males tend to get. And just... Seeing me shaved like that, I didn't see my old Vyrmayn Gothryn self, I saw a girl. And a damn *fine* one at that. I should say, my body image has always been shit my entire life, but now, holy crap, I feel so great about my body after shaving everything. Now I just see a cute chubby girl in the mirror, as opposed to a grotesquely fat dude. And I'm not even horribly fat, I only have about 50lbs to lose I think. And looking back, I can also remember a few things that were telling. I absolutely loved playing female characters in games and fiddling with their clothes and style for hours on end, I loved womens clothes overall. And every time I have had a male character, I never really had a connection to them. It was more like watching someone elses story unfold, rather than my own. But playing as females in games, I feel like it's my story. I can't remember anything about my male playthru of Fable 2 when I was like 15 years old, but I can remember a good deal of my female playthru. And Life is Strange was such an amazing story and I felt such a connection to Max and Chloe. The same goes for my female playthru of Fallout 4, whereas my male playthru was very... well, just blah.

Okay! I'm sorry that's so long, but I'm excited. I've been talking about this to a friend, and she seems to think I am trans, whereas my best friend doesn't, and it kinda hurts when he says he doesn't think I am... but my other friend even asked me if I had a name I wanted, and for some reason Ellie sounds so nice, and she's been calling me Ellie &lt;3 I just really feel like I am trans, and I wanted to hear what you peoples had to say. Sorry again for the huge ranty post.

Edit: Crap, forgot. One thing that made me think I might not be trans is that I am okay with having a dick. I don't want a masculine body, but I'm okay with my genitals, however I'd like to have both, which is unfortunately not possible, like being able to switch between them, because I imagine both naughty bits have their benefits. I've read that you can be trans and still be okay with your genitals, so I didn't let it worry me too much. Bottom line, feeling like a girl, looking like a girl, and being treated like a girl, makes me so damn happy."

What's been getting really weird though is how the people I'm with every day are treating me. I guess the best way I can put it is that they treat me like a cute little brother, rather than the alpha they've always treated me as.

Like i know they don't matter they dont have any real power or education to back up any of the claims they made but it seems like any time anyone hints at nonbinary identities not being real or good i just completely break down. I'm already mentally ill and I know its my brain taking things way too far. I just want to be able to shrug off the insults like it seems like so many other people can do. I've always been like this. I cry at roadkill because I feel bad for the animal, or when i see homeless people and I don't have any money to give to them.

tossaway9832,asktransgender,To SRS or not to SRS,"Hi Reddit!

I'm a transgirl about one year into transition. I don't have very much genitalia dysphoria, sometimes I even like that little thing. I don't like using it for penetrative sex though, that triggers dysphoria for me.

Point is, I'm on cypro and I don't want to continue using that drug for the rest of my life because of adverse effects. So I'm considering orchiectomy. And also scrotectomy, because I don't want an ugly lose empty sack hanging there.

However, I realize that this will probably prevent me from getting SRS later, if I would happen to change my mind about this.

If there was a guarantee for no complications or I could magically have a vagina, I would not hesitate. But that is not reality, and my current setup is not terrible for me. This makes the decision for orchi/scrot-ectomy very hard for me.

I'll not be able to get any of these surgeries for at least 1.5 years, so I have still plenty of time to think this through. I realize that no one here can tell me what to do, but perhaps others have been in the same dilemma and could share their stories to give me some new perspectives."

throwaway6647k,asktransgender,How do I build up the courage to explain stuff to my mom?,"Hi.

I came out to my mom a few months ago and I thought it went ok. Turns out it didn't. It was all a misunderstanding.

She thought that by ""hormone treatment"" I meant that I'd be taking *more testosterone* to ""make me stop thinking that I'm a girl"" and she was ok with that. I didn't know that until a few hours ago.

Turns out, she read online that the only ""treatment for people like me"" is taking antidepressants, and that taking more testosterone should be effective if it's a hormonal imbalance.

Then she started saying that she and my dad talked about it and they both reached the conclusion that I can't be certain of it because I haven't matured completely yet and I'm basically just a kid, and that she wanted to be a boy until she was 16.

She said that she sees me as a boy and that I've never been feminine. She said that maybe if I had a boyfriend I'd snap out of this. I said I like girls. She said that then she doesn't understand what the point of this is.

We ended with a weird situation where she asked me to explain this better and that she only wants me to be happy, but I can't explain anything to her. I just freeze up.

I'm not sure what to do now, I'm just really scared and considering just dropping transition altogether. Please help :("

My dad is a well-known priest amongst our parish and he sorta has this reputation thing going on. I consider myself religious as well.

We currently live around Chicago, but my parents brought up that they want to move to Michigan next summer.

My parents did let me start seeing a therapist starting last year when I worked up the guts to tell my dad I thought I had some sort of anxiety disorder (which I do, GAD) and now we're working on figuring out if I've got depression too.  At school I've told some friends that I go by they/them pronouns, and since my school is pretty open with things like this, I'm not too concerned on that part. Sometimes I even wear a chest binder around (not so much recently though). 

I desperately want to go somewhere away for college for lots of reasons, none of which my parents find valid. The main ones, which I obviously haven't disclosed to them (yet??), involve me being able to express myself how I want and basically live my life as a guy. I can't express this to my parents without fear of being potentially disowned (I seriously doubt they'd do that but the fear is still there) or changing our entire family dynamic (if it's relevant, I have 2 younger siblings). I have told them, however, that I want to be independent and responsible for myself, and that I want to experience what it's like to be on my own. They think it's ridiculous that I'd spend thousands of dollars to live on campus out of state when I'll be getting the same exact education as going to community college for 1-2 years and transferring to a nearby state school. We don't have a very high income, which led me to believe that my parents won't be contributing to my college fund, which also is pushing me to make whatever decision I choose, but my parents are implying otherwise without giving much detail.

There are just so many factors to take into account here (I'm not considering financial right now): would I ever end up coming out to my parents, would they still try to help me out if I did, what would the church say if they found out (like, they already talk shit about my family...), how would I get T behind everyone's back, etc. What are some other reasons I can persuade them with?

So yeah, any sort of advice and encouragement would be appreciated. Ask questions if you have any; I'll answer pretty much anything and this might be a little confusing since I wrote most of it at 4AM.

TL;DR I'm a closeted transgender student and I want to go away to college, but my parents won't let me. What should I do?

P.S. Sorry for the excessively formal writing, I do that when I'm nervous. Or writing essays. Anyway thanks ��"
Basilisk9466,asktransgender,So about them hormones...,"Hello all.

I'm incredibly lucky.  Let's just open up with that.  I'm surrounded by supportive people.  My wife is actually the one that helped me realise that I was trans, and has been with me every step of the way.  While I foresee trouble when I come out to the wider reaches of my family, the people I'm close to accept it.  Even though my parents still aren't sure what to make of it, they support me.  In over a year of wandering around out and about, presenting as female, I've yet to get more than a few weird looks - and I'm in North-frakking-Carolina.  It's the sort of situation some would kill for.

I decided to 'try' being a girl two years ago, and didn't stop.  I don't keep up with my vocal exercises, but that's because I'm a lazy bitch.  It feels physically weird when I'm not wearing my inserts bra, like there's something missing.  The worst thing I have to deal with is people slipping up on my gender, and sometimes *I* do that in my head.  Twenty-five years is a long habit to break, y'know.

So with all of this in mind...

...why the hell is it that two years in a row, I've resolved to be on (or at least seriously looking into) hormones by the end of the year, and I've failed both times?

Has anyone else out there had that kind of irrational hesitation that you can't put a good reason to?"
oopswhattodo,asktransgender,I correctly/misgendered/stood up for? a coworker to others and now she's avoiding me. How can I fix this?,"I hope it's ok I'm posting here. I was going to post in the relationships subreddit but I think this is a better place. I've never had to deal with this before and it's been a ""is this real life"" moment. People can be mean and ugly. As a hispanic woman I'm lucky to have never experienced much racism at all, so this kind of hatred (people hating you for something you can't change) is unsettling to me. I've changed names and timelines for privacy 

 I've worked at a company for about 6 years. I'm close to some of the ladies that work there. We're not friends, but acquaintances that have lunch regularly and chat daily in the office. I've known Samantha for the whole time I've worked here.
We all work in a department that's rather large and 5 months ago had some transfers from another department. Some of us do a ""girl's day"" every so often. We get iced tea and get our nails done at a local salon before work and we were talking about planning the next one in the break room. I mentioned that we should invite the new coworkers too. 

Well while listing all of the new ladies so we could make sure we didn't exclude anyone our coworker Amanda came up. 

 Samantha said that we can't invite Amanda because she wasn't a girl because she was ""born a man"" and that meant she wasn't a woman at all. At first, I didn't believe her. Sam is pretty self-conscious and can be mean to anyone she thinks is prettier than her. I joked that she must have been jealous of Amanda's boobs and to knock it off. Sam got really mad and insisted she wasn't joking and that her looks didn't count because they were artificial. 

I argued with her that she was wrong. I was introduced to her as Amanda, everyone says ""her"" when talking about her, it says ""female"" on her work I.D.- what more proof did Amanda need? Samantha got very angry and said some pretty shitty things. I asked her why she needed proof at all, that Amanda's personal life was none of her or anyone's business and that excluding her was a shitty thing to do. Also, I pointed out it was clear that there was some jealousy thrown in there and she should really work through that and stop being a bitch.

I guess this sparked other's curiosity and people found her facebook and through some sort of web searching found pictures of her transition. Well now people started gossiping about how Sam's an intolerant bitch and how Amanda is just so brave and wonderful. ( not that she is or is not, but people who didn't care about her at all suddenly talking about how hard it must have been to ""look like a guy"" for their whole life and she lived through it and how she's just so brave sounds rude af)

I've said like 6 sentences to her the 4 months after this happened. Our jobs don't cross very much, she comes in 2 hours before me and we work on opposite sides of the building. We are not very close so I thought nothing of it.

Well now that we've been assigned to the same team for a project it's pretty clear that she's avoiding me. I have no idea what to do or what to say. I have no idea if I did something wrong and I don't even know how to broach the subject without sounding condescending as hell. I don't even feel it's my business to know about something that personal if it wasn't told to me by that person. Someone I trusted spilled the beans about my dom/sub relationship to my sister and that was a big mess. I have a deep respect for the privacy of one's personal life.

I;m going to need to speak to her for this project and if she keeps avoiding me our boss will notice and want an explanation why. The last thing I want it to say is she's avoiding me and make more trouble for her. 

Did I say anything wrong? How do I apologize? I didn't want to be insensitive at all, I was just pissed the person I've known and laughed with for 6 years was suddenly this shitty person.

edit: I don't speak with Sam anymore. She transferred after that to get away from the gossiping and the general icyness everyone was giving her."

snoopysissy,asktransgender,Realization,"I am coming to the realization this might be a fetish.. and I am so disappointed. I think I really want this, but I get sexual excitement from it. Any thoughts?"
DarkCrelio,asktransgender,Unsure and confused,"I don't really know how to start this whole thing...well I'm a biological male...I was raised as a normal guy and never thought about myself otherwise. My childhood was pretty normal and there was nothing that seemed ""wrong"". But at the age of 14, I saw a documentary about MtF people and i slowly started to question who I am, but shortly afterwards came to the conclusion that it would be a phase. I lived my live normally, but that thought wouldn't really go away and pretty much every sexual fantasy i had, ended up with me being female. Again I thought this would just be something awkward. 

Time after time those thoughts came back into my head and feel like a red-hot needle that moves but then stops once in a while. Every time that ""needle moved"" it got worse...first it started with just laying around in my bed in the morning having these kind of feelings without being able to aleep again...this was there for quite some time. When I was around 18, that confusion slowly started to drive me insane and i started to feel really shitty during these times of ""needle movement""...i had sleep problems and also problems to eat...but i just couldn't talk to anyone because i was too scared of how people would perceive this. After a few werks i got better again and felt pretty normal for about half a year.

Then last year close to a festival, i was starting to feel like shit. My stomach was a total desaster for over 3 months and I'm pretty sure that thought process might have something to do with that. 

I started to study informatics and at first i still felt bad, but stabalized after a few weeks again...and then I fucked up the ecams and decided to stop studying. That was early this year and I was beginning to have a depression, because of many reasons...I started a vacation job at an car manufacturer but felt extremely out of place there...i even had a mental breakdown and startes to cry because of no reason at all...i'm still not sure why today. After that I was still pretty depressed and tryed to consult a therapist, but they had no space left for new patients, so I tried to get over all of that shit by myself.

I still had that feeling locked away in my mind and slowly started to normalize again. Summer was great, I had a lot of fun and everything seemed normal...well as normal as a needle in your brain can get (ignored). I started a voluntaty service (not sure if the correct term) in september and everything seemed fine.

And that's where it got awkward. 
A friend of mine, mayve even my best friend drifted away from me. He moved to another city and broke contacts for quite some time and in october at a birtjday party I met him again after some months. He seemed pretty down and stressed out and he said he wanted to talk to me. At this point i thought about the possibility of him being transsexual...maybe because i know a shitload about the human psyche or maybe nevause i projected my own thoughts into his acting. I always knew him as that guy who always tried to act overly masculine and aggressive. About a month later I was finally able to speak to him and as it turned out, he actually outed himself to be trans.

I was...less shocked than I should have been and behaved pretty cold and calculated, but at the same time, that lock i used for that needle in my thoughts completely broke and those thoughts of self-doubt and confusion startes to flood my head again...but this time is different...I would not say that I'm depressed this time, it's more like I'm just insanely confused. I am not sure who I am and I am not sure what I am...just something feels off. Those feelings started to fall flat again but i somehow couldn't let them go again...and I did not really want it.

I don't know what i feel, or how I feel, because I crippled my feelings years ago. I feel lost in the eternal void between knowing and not knowing. Am I transsexual? Am I actually not what I sould actually be? Why do these feelings come and go again? What the hell is wrong with me?

btw. I'm 20 years old.

I know, this is quite a lot of text and it took me quite some strength to write that down...but it kinda feels like a releaf to get that stuff wtitten down...I still don't know what I expect, but I really don't want to live with this duality of thoughts anymore and I think here is a great starting point for this journey of self discovery. I hope someone can help me sort my thoughts at least a bit..."
hamoridat,asktransgender,"How can I suppress, push out, get rid of these transgender feelings?","I don't know where else to post or to go, no chance I want this associated with my main reddit account. 
These terrible thoughts have been around since i was 13, like who I was, and who I wanted to, and who I acted like weren't really the same. Like deep down I was really a different person, this female side was who i really was. The side of me that I didn't want to be. 

For 14 years I've constantly had to adjust my natural speech pattern and body language, even my thought processes to avoid being too feminine. I never was the most masculine guy, obviously. Especially being in the ""frat bro"" white collar financial world. 

I knew at 13 I was only attracted to males so I felt it was a byproduct for that. i dated girls occasionally to keep up appearances but I haven't been with a woman sexually since i was 18, it's torture for me and not fair for her. I somehow got into doing drag and that helped a lot but its obviously not about being a woman, but more of a caricature. 

My life would be turned over on its head, most of my family wouldn't accept me I would in all probability lose my finance job which i love to do and the offer to work as a senior associate at a private equity fund. I just can't keep going like this and I want to get rid of these feelings so I can be at peace.

12dec2016,asktransgender,How can I tell if I am trans or making this up in my head?,"Hi, 


I've discovered I might be trans a few months back, and since then my dysphoria has gone from almost non-existent to constantly on my mind.



I feel like I'm making this all up in my head. Every symptom I've had has been similar to ones I've read on here, but I've only really had them until I've read them. 


Being called by my male name feels weird. Almost wrong. Being called by my female name feels better. Having to put Male or Mr feels wrong now. But it never did until I discovered about being transgender was. 


I also think I might be just a confused crossdresser. I first crossdressed when I was 6 and I loved it.  I loved wearing that pink princess dress.  I only did once or twice. Then I started crossdressing again when I was 13, but that was more of a fetish more than anything.  I hardly ever crossdress now. I'm now 17. I don't want to be a crossdresser though. 


I can't see a therapist. I haven't got the money to do so, and probably won't for a lot time yet. My parents will be unsupportive and will most likely disown me.

Men also smile at me, rather than opt to do the ""bro nod"". Women, on the other hand, have been asking me to walk with them, and older women call me things like ""sweetie"".

I've recently felt really depressed and angry that I was born male and not female. Sometimes I just feel like smashing stuff up, or not bother trying anymore. 



I can live as male as fine because I don't have to worry about passing, reactions, etc.



I have no motivation to do ANYTHING. I just don't bother with anything, I don't go out with friends anymore, I'd rather just sleep all day or just go on here or something. 



I look in the mirror, I just see some regular guy. I want to see a cute girl in the reflection, but nope. It's me with broad shoulders, deep voice, and short hair. 



If I could change myself  to be born as female I would, no questions asked. Being male just doesn't feel at the moment. 



I'm scared I'm going to keep living as male, and leave it too late and transitioning will be a lot harder. 



I want to see a therapist, but I have no money to do so, nor can I without being heard by someone else or getting there (I can't drive or afford it).

Does anyone have experience either living there or traveling in the tourist areas?"
EloiseSkye,asktransgender,"Considering detransition/stopping hormones: I don't think I'm strong enough to live being perceived as a woman/trans, really need some advice","I just want to apologise for the length of this post, I'd appreciate if you could read my messy thoughts and help me out but I'll also leave a tl;dr at the bottom. Also cause I'm on mobile, sorry for any formatting errors. Also it's 3:30am so idk if I'll have fallen asleep by the time someone responds but I would really appreciate it and reply in the morning 

I've been on hormones for like 8 months (since mid April) and I feel like my life has only gotten worse since being on them and I've been more confused on who I am. Hearing the way people described their minds before being on hormones as being loud and messy and unable to think clearly is how I feel now on hormones. Before hormones I felt numb and empty. Both of which suck. (Apparently my oestrogen is high and I have a vitamin d deficiency so maybe that has something to do with it).

Before being aware of trans, I wanted to be a girl but it was something that was unobtainable so I could just move on and think of other things. Since finding out I've just been so overtaken by thoughts of being trans and transitioning and whatnot. I spend so much time reading posts on asktg and reading about transition and LGBT and everything around this stuff. My life has become such a mess since ending school and beginning transition. Before beginning transition I felt like I had a rough life plan of school -&gt; uni -&gt; job + family but now I just feel like my life is a mess. 

Recently, people have been confused about my gender (I present male full time). People have come up to me like ""hi miss uh mister uh hi, can you help me"" (at work), or asking me ""are you a girl or boy"" or I've heard people saying to their children ""you're in that lady's way"" as well as mostly being gendered male. It seems like for pretty much every mtf/amab person here this would make them feel great inside but it just makes me uncomfortable and scared. 

It's almost like I feel ""that's not how you're presenting, that's just incorrect to be called a girl"" or ""why do they think I'm a girl I'm clearly not one"". I don't understand why I feel this way. When I was younger all I wanted was to just be one of the girls. But I'm not that, the closest I feel to that is that I'm agender. I hear this community say ""if you want to be a girl then you are one"" a lot around here but that really doesn't make sense to me. I really want to be a girl but I don't feel like I am or will ever be one. I feel that no matter how hard I try (tbh it probably won't ever be that hard because of how depressed I am but hey that's another story) I will never actually be a girl, I might be a person who presents and is treated like a girl but I'll still not actually be one. I feel like no matter what I will always still be a guy.

Being treated like a guy feels more comfortable to me probably because I've been used to it for 19 years but this really makes me doubt myself. If I'm really trans then why do I feel more comfortable being treated like a guy? 

My friends and I were asked for money by this homeless guy, me and my male friend said ""sorry I don't have any"" and he was fine but my female friend when she said that he kept saying ""babe help a brother out, please it's Christmas"" and when she gave him a bit and he asked for more. My male friend stepped in and said are you going to take the money or not the homeless guy just said ""I'm not talking to you I'm talking to babe"" or something. Another friend was telling me about this guy who's like 20 years older than us who she works with who kept speaking to her and asking for her number or Skype and walking with her/following her home. 

I don't in anyway feel strong enough to be able to handle that. Handle weird men being really pushy because you're a girl. Handle unwanted attention because you're a girl. I don't feel like I could cope with the attention from people I don't know for being a girl. Right now and previously when it's really late after a night out and I feel terrified to walk home alone, I know with my earphones in people will just leave me to my business and not interrupt me. They don't do that to guys. But if I was a girl out and about late at night on my own it's way more likely that someone is going to come up to me and make me feel threatened for my life. I wouldn't be able to afford an Uber every night out and I don't want to stop going out but I don't think I'd be able to cope (from my limited experience). 

Another thing is my dream is to work in esports but from seeing the way people talked about Remilia (first girl pro, is a trans girl) was disgusting and made me uncomfortable. The fact that people refer to her as ""oh yeah that girl player"" rather than talking about her abilities as a player. I don't want to be diminished down to a gender. I don't want to not be taken seriously because of who I am/present myself and my life would end up as being ""that trans person/nonbinary person/weirdo who wants to be special (because it seems no one gets what nb is)"" rather than actual attributes I have.

I do feel dysphoric over parts of my body, I like the idea of having this feminised body and in an ideal world with no sexism and gender really not having an impact on the way people act to each other I would be way more comfortable being perceived as a girl but that's not the world we live in. I want to look like a girl and feel like one, but I can't handle the loss of the male privilege I benefit from and the very uncomfortable attention girls are given in society. I don't know what to do anymore. For the longest time the only thing on my mind has been ""transition, become as close to a girl as you can and then maybe you'll be happier/in a better place to handle your depression/mental health"" but as I'm now well into my transition all I can feel is despair and a bleak outlook on the future. All I can think is ""when I go to uni will people accept me there"", ""when I go to uni if I join a sports team like I want, how is this going to work? I wouldn't feel comfortable playing with the guys or changing with the girls and everything I want to play seems gendered. Also there's rules on competing that means I'll have to jump through loads of hoops to play"", ""do I want to wear a skirt and potentially be attacked/harassed as I don't pass fully, or just wear trousers and hope people just leave me alone"", ""people are staring at me I can see them look at me then whisper to their friends whilst looking directly at me, I feel like a freak"". I mean my mum even called me a freak a few days ago (wasn't relevant to being trans but definitely made me think about it and feel crap).

TL;DR: I'm very confused on my identity. I don't like being gendered male but it feels more comfortable/better than when I'm gendered female by strangers. Don't think I'm going to be able to handle being treated as a girl by society (the inequalities they face, the unwanted attention they receive largely by guys) due to a few experiences I've had/heard. Also I don't think I'd be able to live as nonbinary person who largely ""don't exist"" within society in terms of they way people see gender being so binary and the options in which we have on official documents. I feel dysphoric and depressed with life. Transition was this thing that I felt I had to do before I'd be able to actually live and I had the courage to do, but now it feels like something I won't be able to do or cope with, something that isn't going to make any of my problems better but provide me new ones. Life feels utterly hopeless and I'm losing a will to live (I would never want to transfer my suffering onto my friends but I feel closer and closer to wanting to die). I don't know what to do.

Kym_Of_Awesome,asktransgender,First steps of SRS? MtF,"Hi all! I'm Kym, and I've been on hormones for about 3 months now. Everything is going well. (boobs are great and convulsive orgasms are sweet!) Unfortunately I tend to get really bad genital dysphoria which often leaves me an unexplainable wreck. So I need SRS, however I'm not really sure where to start, what to look for, etc. I know a year of hormones is a must and that I need 2 consult letters but I want to try to get the ball rolling as best I can so that I can right what is wrong and get living. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance lots of love! "

Imdisgust1ng,asktransgender,How do you stop hating yourself/How do you stop yourself from being disowned? (rant with question details at end),"This is going to be a rant, I don't blame you for skipping.  I just need to get this off my chest.  There's nobody else that I can go to.  It probably doesn't make much sense either, since I'm just going to be pouring my heart out.  Sorry about that.

I feel like my life is falling apart.  I haven't fully accepted that I'm trans but I know that I am deep inside; I just don't want to say the words, like if I don't utter them they can't be true.  I've ordered hormones without any intention of ever coming out of the closet, I'm just afraid that without them the temptation to take my own life will be too overwhelming to handle anymore.

I feel like a monster, like something that shouldn't exist.  I don't know what I did in another life but I'm sorry.  I want to be normal but I can't no matter how much I try.  It hurts to look in a mirror, to know that I have to keep living like this.  Even though this is how I should be living it just feels *fake*.  Like I'm just restraining something for the sake of society.  

I want to have self confidence, to be positive about myself instead of an eternal cynic but I feel like as long as this continues I never will.  Then again it would probably get worse if I ever did come out, every discrepancy and difference would just be another reminder that I threw away what I was born with to become a bootleg, a fake.

For a long time now I've refused to acknowledge this, heck I still refuse to admit it to this day.  Even when I ordered the hormones online I was making excuses.  Ignoring it.  ""I'll just take them for a little bit"", ""Just until I get this under control.""  It's just been building up inside of me for years, like a poison that has been growing, slowly taking over my mind to the point where I can't control it anymore.  I just want a hug and a shoulder to cry on, for someone to tell me that it's going to be okay and that it's just a teenage phase or that there's some pill that I can take to make these feelings vanish, that when I wake up tomorrow I'll be normal and this is just a horrible nightmare.

(Skip here if you don't want to read my ramblings)

As if that wasn't enough my grandparents just found one of the dammed hormones that I ordered under some demonic possession.  They know that they aren't prescribed, and once Christmas is over they're planning on calling a doctor to ask what it is.  I've never been this scared in my life.  They're the only family I have left, they're good people but they're **really** socially conservative.  Best case scenario they'll confiscate them from me, worst case scenario I get disowned.  I'm just a freshman in college, I'm not prepared for this.  What do I do?  I'm sorry if this isn't a real question but I don't have anywhere to go.

Claireskyes,asktransgender,"I think I'm transgender, but I still am confused, and I still have a desire to be male, what can I do in order to sort out my feelings?","My issue is that I don't know if I want to/need to do anything about transitioning for myself, I'm 18 and I don't know the future, I don't know what will happen with school, my career, family, and most importantly my relationships. The one and only thing I care about that makes me infinitely happy is to be with a girl and date them, marry them, and experience things together. What about college and if I meet girls there my freshman year? I'd miss out on a lot of opportunities to find someone I'd love if I were to transition I feel. I have a worry I wouldn't find the type of girl I really want so badly if I were to transition also. What if I want kids when I'm older as a male? I feel as though I have a desire to be a young woman, but I can't wrap my head around the idea of me being female when I'm older, and if I'd still like it. The desire stems from mostly clothing and makeup and the idea of having a female body. I don't really have a strong sense of dysphoria howeverI could live perfectly fine as a male, and I don't mean that in a sense of pretending. I'm still unsure if I'm transgender because of the post-fap guilt as it also is a fetish and desire for me to be female. I don't know what to do really in order to figure it out, and I find it easier when people ask me questions for me to answer in order to figure out my feelings. "

But sometimes I get this feeling that I'm just kidding myself with this whole trans thing, like I'm having some kind of mid-life crisis at fucking 23. I can put an empty bra on and put a shirt on over it, and since the bra still holds its shape it kinda looks like I have boobs, and I can look in the mirror and pretend I see a girl there. She's sort of bulky and muscular for a girl, with a boyish face and a butch haircut - not ideal, but still a girl (I'm lucky enough to not look super masculine naturally, although I'm still not sure I could pass before at least a few months on hormones). But sometimes I look in the mirror and think, ""there's a stupid man that thinks he's a woman."" Of course, then I immediately think ""no, you're just in denial. Stop thinking like that,"" like I won't even allow myself to think I might not be trans; but policing my thoughts like that since I was a kid is how I ended up just now figuring out I was trans at 23, and isn't this the same thing all over again? Like I'm forcing myself to believe I'm trans, because I'm afraid to consider the alternative, that I'm just deluding myself into thinking I'm trans as an excuse for some other issue I might be having... like I'm in the opposite of denial or something.

I know a lot of trans people have doubts from time to time, and like most other people I'm sure the doubts I'm having are bullshit, and they go away eventually... but it still really sucks to feel this way. How do you guys deal with it?"
tao-nui,asktransgender,Drugs and perception of your own identity,"Hi there,

I experienced some significant highs these past months, and I felt like sometimes the experience of my own gender and dysphoria was different. Sometimes I felt *way* more self conscious of my voice, or sometimes I felt like ""I could never become a woman, ever"". It's weird because I like to get high with my friends once in a while, but I can spiral into a whirl of toughts around the current state of my body, which is very male. It makes me question things more than I should, tho I am perfectly aware that this state is temporary and I shouldn't fight. The next morning my normal feelings are back.

MTF (4,5 months HRT) here. I'm DIYing with regular blood test and so far I'm really satisfied with my results. 
I can gladly look forward to the future which was not the case at all before.

However I've a question : I use spironolactone as my main AA (just received an eight months supply), and if I remember correctly some studies hint that it might prevent a full breast development when used by MTF.

I intended to switch to cyproterone after the end of my first year (when my spiro supply ends), but now I'm worried it could harm my progress to stay that long with spiro : if you were me, would you switch right now to cyproterone (my levels are already fine), or would you wait until the end of you first year of HRT ?

In short, does anyone know if long term spiro can permanently prevent the Tanner stage 5 of breast development, even if you remplace it with cyproterone after a while ?

Thanks again."

hello_myself,asktransgender,Do I sound trans to you?,"This is gonna be pretty long, just a warning.

I've been questioning my gender the past several months, since march or so. Since then, I've mostly come to the conclusion that I am indeed trans, and that I want to start HRT/transition soon, but I keep doubting myself, so I'm looking for some outside opinions.

I had a pretty average childhood for someone AMAB, never really any signs of being trans or super feminine, although my best friends have always, since I was a kid, been girls. I also really liked playing with my female little cousin, who was 4 years younger than me. We played mostly with her toys, dolls. I wasn't, however, only interested in this. I had a few other friends and we played roleplaying (like police and thief, or star wars stuff, that kind of thing) and I played a lot in the dirt with my best friend at the time, who was a girl.

I had a bit of interest in makeup as a kid, I remember once inviting a male friend of mine to experiment with lipstick, but he was super weirded out by this so we didn't, and since then I stopped playing with makeup and suppressed my interest in it, because I was a boy and boys shouldn't like makeup.

There was a thing a few friends at preschool did, that was showing each other genitals, and I was never comfortable at all with showing mine, so I never did.

Around puberty, I started having more and more body issues. I never liked how I looked, at all, and I could never really put a finger on what it was that I didn't like, but these issues seem to have only increased the older I get. I never liked having body hair, although I never did anything about it until recently. I never cared much about facial hair, but I looked more like myself, to me, when I didn't have a beard.

I've been at least somewhat depressed since about this time, and I always felt there was something wrong with me that I had to change in order to be myself. This, being trans, is the first thing that stuck with me as the right thing to do. I thought about tattoos, body mods, playing instruments, and while all of those seemed like things I wanted to do in my life, none seemed enough. Sure, they'd add things to me, but I still wouldn't be myself. Being trans clicked with me, it seems right.

I always found myself tucking my penis when leaving the shower because I didn't like the bulge, and I never really liked wearing clothes that could show me having a bulge. 

I have always had long hair, and never wanted to cut my hair short. Thankfully my mother was cool with that.

I frequently found myself looking at girls in public and having a mix of thought of ""I wanna be with her"" and ""I wanna be her"", though most frequently it was the second option.

I've always liked female singers and envied their voices. One of my biggest dreams was to be a singer, but since puberty I've really disliked my voice because it's so deep, so I completely gave up on singing.

I've always envied lesbians relationships and lesbian spaces, I always felt like I should be allowed into lesbian spaces, not in a man believes he should be allowed everywhere, but more as a ""I belong there"".

A couple years ago I decided to start working out to see if it helped improve my self esteem, but I barely lasted one week because thinking of myself having muscles was just terrible for me, I didn't, and still definitely don't, want to have male muscle definition at all. When I started this workout I kept looking in the internet for ways to workout without getting muscles, because I just don't wanna be muscly, although if I were a fit/somewhat muscly girl I'd like it.

Recently, since starting questioning, I started experimenting with female clothing/makeup, and I really liked using lipstick and crossdressing with a stuffed bra + a female tank top. I haven't, however, experienced dysphoria due to not having breasts (although I really liked the stuffed bra, and preferred how I looked with it than without).

From all the possible effects of HRT, the only one that somewhat scares me is infertility, and I'm unsure about breasts, but I'm fairly sure I'd like having them, or at least not mind.

I'm seeing a gender therapist currently, and he's referred me to an endo (this is basically via informed consent, I asked for an endo and he recommended one), but I'm just looking for your insights into this little bit of my life.

Thanks for reading =)"
EvilKittyBoy,asktransgender,Finland HRT?,"I need to find a country to move to and I'm checking Finland.

I need to know how's the entire thing of being trans in Finland. I already have prescriptions and a diagnosis. However the prescription is awful, and the diagnosis says ""sexual identity disorder"", I never got proper healthcare for being trans.

However I have years of taking hormones, even more than the time of the prescription; I once stopped hormones for 2 weeks, and it was painful (literally) I couldn't sleep from genital pain, I was aggressive and aroused all the time and would throw up quite a lot for some reason. This was horrible, I was not even myself, and took me weeks to recover, I don't want this to happen anymore.

If I go to Finland, will I be gatekeeped because the way I got my medical history was not following the standards they do. Even considering my years on hormones. I'm also not stereotipically femenine, but I could not be more certain of what I want, and none can make me doubt.

NightBrewess,asktransgender,Trouble dating girls? MTF,"I used to be really into girls, I've always connected really well with other women and as a matter of fact one of the biggest motivations for me to come out as trans was knowing that I could still be a trans girl and date other girls.

However all that being said my sexuality has kind of fluctuated. Well not so much fluctuated as I just became really self-conscious. My ex-gf and current friend played a huge role in helping me come out, but when I came out I started getting really uncomfortable around her in a relationship sense. Every time we went out it was obvious to see who the ""cis"" one was in the relationship and what made it worse is I started getting really uncomfortable around her when we were both naked together, like body envy. We split up because I told her I was into guys and really wanted a boyfriend, she was very understanding and is now my best female friend.

The thing is though I really like the idea of being a girl who dates other girls but just have this nagging thought of ""girls who are into you are only into you because you have male parts and it makes it easier for them""(stupid I know) I also feel guilty when a lesbian is into me almost like I'm ""misleading"" them.


Anywho I'm 6 months into HRT and have become a lot more comfortable with my body. I hope once HRT does its thing (and insurance willing be able to get bottom surgery) I won't have so much guilt and envy around other girls. Have any of you been in a relationship with another woman where you still feel girly and not get jealous of your partner?"
PavementBlues,asktransgender,So THAT'S what it's like to come out to a loving and supportive family member!,"I came out to my older sister last night.

My previous experiences with family have been...not terrible, but not particularly positive. When I decided to come out to her, I was hoping for the best but unsure of what to expect.

She didn't even skip a beat. She was incredibly positive from the get-go, asked a bunch of great questions (including what my name was - she didn't even say ""new name""), helped me figure out a plan for telling our father and offered to be there with me, and ended the call with, ""I love you, sister."" After the conversation she even called our mom to let her know that I had told her, and during the conversation encouraged her to at least try to adjust and use the right name.

I keep thinking of last night and crying. I had no idea how much that kind of a response would mean to me. I figured that she'd be understanding, but I really wasn't sure of to what extent.

As an added bonus, the family member whose response has been the most hurtful has been my little sister, who I sort of helped raise as her only positive older male figure. Needless to say, she's really attached to me as her big brother and is struggling a *lot* with my transition. My older sister told me that the two of them were doing some Christmas shopping last weeknd and were trying to decide between two stockings, and that my older sister was in favor of one because she thought the other was too feminine. Apparently my little sister was insistent that she really liked the feminine one and wanted to get that one for me.

thing is, there are quite a few very 'conservative' kids at my school, but if i was out all the time, then i wouldnt worry if someone was going to comment on my 'girly-looking' boots (i sometimes wear female combat boots under my jeans instead of my regular shoes), and i wouldnt need to worry if i wore something that would make me worry.

Saturdalia,asktransgender,Achievement unlocked: First conversation with a therapist!,"Not really a question, I know, but hey, I'm pretty excited anyway! I just got off the phone with a therapist who has experience with gender identity issues, and it went great enough that I'm ready to move forward. And a literally few seconds after that, I got the email that said my new insurance policy has been set up, so I'll be able to start appointments ASAP. Freaking yes! I'm on my way!

I'm fairly new to all this, so I don't know everything, but in case that someone else here is is a similar place that I've been recently, a few things that I've learned...

1) You DON'T have to be certain that you're transgender in order to see a professional about your gender identity. That might seem obvious, but for me, because I'm still in the ""questioning mode,"" I'm still kinda up in the air. But that's why I'm taking this step. You don't have to call a therapist and say ""HAI I'M TRANS LET'S DO THIS"" if you're not ready for that. I always started off by saying, ""I'm in the process of evaluating my gender identity, and finding the best way to relate to who I am once I figure that out, and I'd just like a comfortable space to do that."" They should understand where you're at, accept you, and not try to push you. Don't worry if you're not sure how you feel, that's kinda the point.

2) On that note, I actually got in touch with several potential therapists before I found one who felt perfect for me. And every email exchange and phone call I had was free, no insurance info, no commitment necessary. And it was *totally confidential* from the word ""go."" So if you're just exploring options right now, no real plans yet, go ahead and call 'em up. It's weird and difficult the first time, of course. But the more you talk about it, the more practice you get, the easier it becomes and the better you get at expressing your needs. When you're ready, go for it.

3) It helps if you call with some idea of what you want to say, specifically expressing what you're looking for from the experience. This is my first time seeing any kind of mental health professional, so I actually made a list of three specific things I was looking for in a therapist or counselor. So when I called the last one, and she was supportive and knowledgeable, and mentioned two of the three things on my list word-for-word, I knew I had found what I was looking for.

And finally, this is totally unrelated to a therapist, but it always bears mentioning: you DON'T HAVE TO HATE YOUR BIRTH GENDER TO BE TRANSGENDER. I've never been totally at odds with my assigned gender (it was always just this thing about me), and so I delayed thinking seriously about my dysphoria for a long time until now. Even though I knew I was different, and that I probably wanted to live as a female, it took me years to get to this point because I didn't absolutely hate being male. I don't regret it that much, but now I'm ready to explore whoever and whatever the real me is. So, I just want to say, if you think it will make you happier, and you have the ability to do so, go for it!

LaraFeuer,asktransgender,When life gives you hints,"Not a question, just wanted to share. 
Ok, so I'm still trying to accept, that I'm trans and life just comes by and dropped me this hint. 
In japan there are these gacha machines everywhere, where you can get one out of maybe five figures for little money. The thrill is, you don't know which one you get. I was using one for the anime Ranma 1/2, where the protagonist can change the gender by touching cold and warm water. I was holing to get Ranma-chan (female), but got Ranma-kun (male). The figures have a little chain to hang them somewhere and i hanged him down on my bag, but after a few days ghe chain opened and I lost him. 
A little disappointed I used the gacha machine again and got Ranma-chan!

TL;DR: Life let me lose the ''male'' and obtain the ''female''"

I have more than enough to do that and not run out before my three month follow up. I'm afraid of pissing off my endo though. 

My rational for doing 0.5mL every week comes from here: http://transhealth.ucsf.edu/trans?page=guidelines-feminizing-therapy in the initial dose table for this drug. (thanks to the awesome person who tossed me that link the other day, btw) Should I just do it and tell the endo that's what I did in three months? Should I message the endo and try to get permission to do that? Should I just do what the fuck she told me to do and shut up about it? :\

allkindsofconfused,asktransgender,Healthy ways to increase body fat?,"I've tried looking through some of the fitness subs etc, but they mostly discuss gaining weight in order to gain muscle... I'm 24, around 59kgs (130lbs) and 5'11 with barely any body fat. So I'm looking to gain fat, not muscle. 

I've been on HRT for just over 4 months, and my hormones are in the right ranges to want to start gaining weight. 

My weight has been constant for as long as I can remember. Even before transition I was never happy with it, and I've tried eating super healthy on a good routine to no avail. I've also tried eating super shit food as often as possible, which didn't help either...

I actually don't enjoy eating so really only do the bare minimum, not for any aesthetic reasons - I simply don't enjoy the process. I don't do much so I don't need great amounts of energy, but it seems even when I do my appetite barely increases.

So I'm hoping some of you might be able to enlighten me on some good ways to gain fat without gorging myself on excessive amounts of food, but also won't put my health at risk?

Things that worked for you, or what should theoretically work for anyone would be great!

I know this comes up now and again, and I've tried to search through the sub for what I'm looking for with no luck. So if anyone can point me in the right direction that would be great!

Akaquestion122,asktransgender,Can HRT make you gay?,"Background info: 21 MTF, 4 years HRT, stealth

When I started HRT, I was perfectly bi. Over time since I've started HRT, I feel that I like men entirely, and women don't seem to have any sort of appeal in *that* kind of way. Like if one kissed me I wouldn't be offended, but I wouldn't seek it out. Is this even kind of normal?"
sftbo,asktransgender,"might be trans/non binary, really don't want to be","So this is going to be long. For some background I'm 21 AMAB and in my 4th year in University. I'm also bisexual and earlier this year was found out by my parents and lets just say thing could have gone better. Now the issue at hand is that quite  recently my gender has start to become an issue to me. Like  now it feel like something is just off. However things that make me doubt that i'm not cis is the fact  this feel very all of the sudden, unlike my sexuality which i knew since i was 10 and it took me till i was 18 to  come to terms with it and accept my self, I really cant think of any other time in my life where I didn't feel right with my gender, It was always someone else defining it and me just saying ""well ok"".  Once i start questioning it I would rationalize ""well I dont feel X so I probably not"" of course I tried this sort of reasoning with my sexuality and convince myself  I was straight, at least until a cute boy crossed my path. One thing that stood out to me is I had tried on makeup and when  I look in the mirror  my face look quite feminine and I it felt good looking in the mirror and seeing that. Before I didn't really have a problem with my face or body, but after I start to think about having a body that match with this ""look"" whatever that means. I also like the look of women clothing and the idea of appearing androgynous to people. Something about it being free of the constraint of gender feels so relieving.  However I still have rationalization for why I'm not trans/non binary.  Also the fact that trans people aren't view by society in the best light ( I'm the type of person that while not closeted, but likes to keep to myself and if transition now  that would be hard to do) also given the fact that I would need to  come out to my parents again( wasn't even ready the first time)  not to even mention that this new administration in USA well probably make transitioning medically harder. Idk right now just feels like  the most inconvenient time for this to happen to me, and I dont know if I'm not or if everything else is influencing me otherwise.  Also finals week is happening and thinking about this is making getting work done more difficult then it needs to be. 
TL:DR  dont know if I'm trans/NB  and I'd rather not be.       "

RedRobyn21,asktransgender,Daddy issues,"Kinda long story, sorry 

So I have never had a good relationship with my dad. When I was like 5 him and my mum split up after an argument where he trashed our living room. He has always had a nasty temper on him, and hit me a few times when I was young out of rage. One of these times was when I went over to his house for the weekend wearing nail polish and after which, very quickly scared my exploration of femininity away. I kind of subconsciously blame him for me coming out at 20 instead of pre puberty? 
 
Anywho, he has two other kids (my half brothers) which I love very much, but very rarely get to see because of how poorly my dad and I get on. After telling him that I was transgender, he cut me out from their life from February to November this year, and didn't want me anywhere near my little brothers. We spoke briefly in November about meeting for Christmas to see my little brothers and family which was all well and fine. 
 
When he picks me up to take me over to his house today, he sends my little brothers to their room so he can have a ""man to man"" talk with me (which I'm pretty sure was an intentional choice of words). He tells me how horrible my new hair is (dyed orange and in a female styled  ponytail), and that no matter how hard I try to fake it, I'll never be a real woman. He is very old fashioned in the sense that he believes males are superior to women and are essentially on this earth to give us children, and make tea... which is absolutely revolting. 
 
He asks when I start therapy, and I tell him it's in February. He says I clearly am in need of it since I'm ""clearly mentally unhinged"". He asks how I plan to pay for everything, and I tell him that our NHS healthcare services provide what is known as ""core procedures"" needed to combat dysphoria, which includes most surgeries with the exception of FFS. He argues that his tax should not be going towards my ""fairy lifestyle choice"", and that the choices I have made are going to tear the family apart. He says that just because I'm allowed to see my little brothers does not mean that either of them will accept me or treat me like a real girl, and what I'm going to be putting them through is cruel. 
 
That last part really broke me, I just started crying and sobbing. After I calmed down somewhat, the day went on as if nothing had happened. The rest of the family (who are also old fashioned, but still lovely) come over for dinner and my aunt asks me and my eldest little brother to stand next to each other to see how much taller my he has gotten. He is about a centimetre taller than me, with almost twice the size of feet as me which made me very happy, and then of course, my dad had to ruin everything and said ""oh wow he really has gotten taller, Ryan (me in boymode) has much broader shoulders though. 
 
I was dropped back off at my house like 2 hours ago and I just can't get everything out of my head. I tried to kill myself a year ago because of dysphoria, and was in hospital for a couple of days. I spent so long this year building up my self esteem again and forcing myself to believe that things are going to get better, and in the space of 24 hours he has completely crushed me and brought me back to square one. 
 
My mum says I should cut him out of my life and that he is poison, but I'm really scared I'll never see my little brothers again if I do and that they really will hate me for that even more than they do. 
 
Advice would be very much appreciated. Merry Christmas everyone ��

i'm 21, i've been a guy my whole life. i'm more or less a typical  guy, but for the past year or so i've been confused with my gender. first of all, i'm not traditionally masculine. i never get misgendered or anything, everyone knows i'm a guy but i'm slender, tall, not very hairy on my face/chest and i have slender/small hands and feet. not really a big deal.

i have been into crossdressing since i was about 15 or so, doing it on or off when i get the chance. for some reason it was really erotic to me probably because of trap threads on 4chan. i'm also bisexual(i've known since that time)

i dont know if i want to be a girl, or if i want to be a boy. it's like i want to be BOTH but NONE at the same time. i hate that i have to choose a box. for instance, one day, i'll want to be a boy, where guy clothes and do my hair cool and act masculine. but another day, i wanna wear a skirt with long songs and be super cute. it's weird. i don't understand it. is living that way possible in this society? just telling everyone sometimes i'm really feminine sometimes i'm really masculine? i just hate choosing.

so far, since i'm biologically male i've been comfortable being a more feminie side guy, metrosexual, clean, the works.

Today someone posted what we all wanted for christmas, so I started to think about it. I defenetly would love to try it girl clothes or shoes, but I can't hide that away from my dad. I was probably going to tell him soon that I had some weird feelings about stuff and I wanted therapy so I kinda had a way to cover it up a bit, but now I'm considering coming out fully to my dad.  

I was thinking of 2 ways, 1 is safer, via a letter, and 2 is more personal but riskier, telling it in person with my mom.

iamgirlmaybe,asktransgender,Can I get your opinion?,"(Writing on mobile sorry for formatting issues)

So for my whole life I've never really known that transgender was a thing until about middle school and even then I didn't think much of it, and sadly, due to the environment growing up we casually made fun of it, but as I got older and older I started developing ""girlish"" tendencies. Which was usually met by ""that's gay"" from my brothers, so I think it may have stifled any thoughts that would try to reach the surface, and so I continued to think nothing of being a guy, I had no issues with it after all. 

About a year ago I took a college course on the LGBT culture throughout America, and something about that class opened me up to this whole new culture. I was now somewhat interested in it. All my life I'd always chosen female avatars for games, I'd always envied them, I'd read manga with gender change in it and envied them.

My biggest question is am I really Trans? I always think about how I would prefer to be a girl but then I do a double take, I don't think I have gender dysphoria, at least not as bad as most stories I've heard. I could live as a guy for the rest of my life and be happy, but I think I would be more happy as a girl, but I don't think it would be worth it in the long run, I feel like I would need so much work to pass, I've got a big nose, strong jaw, and broad shoulders, so I feel like if I go for it, I would only be depressed with the outcome.

First I suppose it'd help if I said a bit about myself. I've felt gender dysphoria for the past two years, and I've repressed it because it felt wrong to be trans, and I also used to be the type of person to bash on feminism and joke about autism and such. I'm no longer like that anymore, and I don't ever wish to be. I just wanna be a girl. Now, I'd like to ask about some things.

1. I'm only 14. Does this matter for transitioning at all? I've considered waiting until I'm 18 before doing anything, and I'm scared about telling my parents anything regarding this.
2. If I were to transition to a female, I'd still like to keep my penis and not receive surgery to remove my penis and get a vagina. Is this possible? If so, are there any downsides? I believe I read that HRT stops spermatogenesis, which I really would not like.
3. I'm not really saying I want to, but if I wasn't interested in HRT, could I receive breast implants?

5. How much does standard MtF SRS cost? My family is very poor right now and barely getting by.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria
&gt;The main psychiatric approaches to treatment for persons diagnosed with gender dysphoria are psychotherapy or to support the individual's preferred gender through hormone therapy, gender expression and role, or surgery.[11]

It's like it's saying conversion therapy is the #1 thing used to treat it... or am I missing something?"

ZanetheShadow,asktransgender,Is my name choice stupid?,"Hey all, 

I'm starting to plan out my social transition in the coming months, but I'm a bit worried my choice of name is a bad idea. 

It's in my flair, but just I'm case you haven't/can't see it, I've chosen Athena as my new name. 

My ex (who is still a good friend) came up with it a few days after I came out to her, and it's felt right ever since. I feel like it's my name, if that makes any sense. 

However, I know it's not a typical name and I'm worried it's a bit too atypical/strippery.

Are these worries unfounded, or should I find a new name?

AlolaSandslash,asktransgender,Why am I constantly overcome with the thought to detransition? Does it pass?,"Has anybody have this happen to them? I see it's pretty common, and I'm assuming it passes as it happens usually happens with me. Still, when do these thoughts stop? As in stop, permanently.

I ask, because I'm mortified at the thought of not being able to pass. I've thought about posting in transpassing, but I've such a long way to go. Last time I did so, I didn't get much discussion. The help is still desperately needed, but honestly I am hesitant to try again.

Right now, I can say I feel like FFS is a must. So is work on my tummy. Then you have hair removal, plus the laser therapy to hopefully fade my stretch marks. Not to mention facial hair. All these procedures cost too much money that I just don't have and cannot get anytime soon. Satisfaction isn't guaranteed either when I do, and I hate feeling hopeless as a result.

This is when the thoughts of detransitioning start. Sometimes I feel like I wouldn't care so much about appearances as a guy, but even the idea of detransitioning makes me sick.

Other than that I'd like advice on what to do as I haven't been able to experiment much. That, and is there anything I can try to stop falling into this thought process?

Now my head hurts, and I need a drink. Or a hug. Or a nap. Anything but work, please. Only if I could be so lucky.

rubyfucker69,asktransgender,[FTM] The gay guy I'm flirting online with doesn't know I'm not physically male?,"Hey, so I'm FTM currently pre-HRT and I like men. I've been kind of flirting with a guy I've known for about a year, we met online in an (undisclosed) fandom. After taking a break from it when it went on hiatus, I started reconnecting with that group again and thats where the feelings kicked in. He's a goofy guy who usually isn't my type personality-wise but I can't help but blush when we get flirty.

My issue is that he's a cis guy who's very much into men, and although I do identify as male, I'm very much lacking in a certain area. I have dated a guy before but he was straight so he had no issue, but I have no experience with exclusively gay men so I'm kinda afraid of his reaction if I come out to him. I fear he would feel betrayed or ""catfished"" because the guy he's been talking with is ""actually a girl"".

I honestly don't know how he feels about transgender people in general so I can't gauge for sure how he'd react, but I can't help but imagine the worst. Losing him as a potential BF I can handle, but I would hate to lose him as a friend over this. We're not really getting serious, just casual flirting with winky emojis, but I feel like if it starts to then I should maybe come clean?

MadKingAyres,asktransgender,I'm working on a sci-fi world set in the future and just wanted to ask about something regarding transgendered people.,"So I'm working on developing a science-fiction world to base some art and literature in (if you visit /r/worldbuilding, you'll see what I mean). It's quite similar to Star Wars, if you want to think of it that way.

Anyway, I have been working on the idea of humans being able to mess around with advanced surgical techniques and the like to do whatever they want to their bodies. Additionally, they would be able to custom-design completely new bodies to their exact specifications, have the body artificially grown, and then have their consciousnesses transferred into the new body.

My question is this: would you, as a transgender~~ed~~ person, prefer to have your consciousness switched into an entirely new body that is the gender you desire, or would you prefer to stay in your base body and have that altered in the same way as current surgery allows us to do? I'm curious as to how you would feel about having a new body if it meant being 100% the right gender, rather than an altered body.

Sorry if this sounds offensive in any way, I just would really like the input of people who would actually know something about this sort of thing.

IrreleventPerson,asktransgender,How to deal with my shapes?,"Sup.

I'm very, very dysphoric about my body shapes, and I don't know how to deal with it.

For a quick run through, I'm 5'4, weight 131lbs, am on HRT since nearing two months.

I know HRT really starts affecting shapes later on, but in the meanwhile, idk how to promote shapes grow.

Right now, the bit of fat I got is stocked in my belly, it's not like, overly big, in fact, it almost looks flat, but it's not really.

However, my fat is mostly stored on the side of my belly area, or the waist I think it is, so it does the opposit of the feminine slick waist I want.

My legs are alright, so is my butt, altho I know I should start doing squats to work them out.

Ultimately, my question is that: Should I lose weight and then regain it to have it stored correctly, or will the fat I got naturally move to the new storage area? Is there exercises I can do to help promote a slick waist?

Oh, also, is there like... a time limit on the time I can lose/gain weight during hrt for maximum effect? Like if I only lose and gain weight in two years, will the effect be as good as if I do during he first year?

I'm in the United States [east coast] and was wondering if those who have been through the process or know how to go about getting surgery have done it.  Here's what I know so far:

1) I need two letters from therapists stating that I'm fit for sugery. [Does this need to be a psychiatrist or can it be a social worker or LMHC?]

2) I'm thinking about going to Marcy Bowers, from what I understand I need electrolysis first on my nether region; I'm also open to other doctors in the U.S. if people are aware of any good ones

3) I have insurance that seems like they'll pay for it; although I still need to make sure.  Anyone know of how much I need to put down for a surgeon?

curious-woman,asktransgender,"Breast massages, are you doing it yet?","If you have not explored your body in this way, you are missing out on pleasure and emotional gratification. There are many purported claims about massaging your breasts that are practical and that sometimes sound new-agey and pseudo-sciencey.

The main claims are that a breast massage will remove built-up toxins (this is true of any massage) and will help with shape.

I also think that breasts are powerful emotional sites and giving sensual care to them will be beneficial through a strong connection to the body, which subsequently means a strong connection to emotions

And, it feels fucking amazing (as a sensitive who is connected to her body)."
hatfulofmadness,asktransgender,"Had an FFS consultation with Dr Spiegel today. In case anyone is wondering what the consult is like, here's a writeup.","I know most people probably don't care about what the consultation was like, but I was certainly nervous before going in, and couldn't find any writeups about it, so on the off-chance somebody else in the future wants to know, here it is:

Parking at his location was difficult - street parking was taken, so I ended up parking in the lot of the grocery store across from him and walking the block to a crosswalk.

When I got into the office, I was greeted by a receptionist who asked my last name, offered me coffee/tea, and gave me some paperwork to fill out. Most of the paperwork was standard, but one of the forms included a clause about assigning copyright of any online reviews of him **to him** for a period of five years after FFS. I found this bizarre, and I'm not sure if it's even enforceable, but that put me off a bit.

After filling out the forms, I went into his office and waited a little more than half an hour for him, with people checking in every once in a while to ask whether he'd been in to see me yet. Eventually, he came in and introduced himself to me and asked what I was here for. I wanted to see what *he* thought I needed, so I turned the question back to him and asked if he could just assess me first and tell me what his thoughts were. 

This involved him looking at me and touching my face a bit (he asked first), and then listing off areas for improvement for me in order of importance:

* My jaw
* my cheeks
* My forehead (brow bossing)
* My hairline
* My nose

We talked for a bit about what on that list I was comfortable with, what I wasn't, and what the healing process would be like. I thought he had an excellent demeanor - he really put me at ease. He knew the school I went to for college, which was rare because it's a small school, and asked me about that, and just did a lot of small things to make me feel comfortable. Also, he was very obviously competent - something about him just said ""I know exactly what I'm doing"".

Because I had had Yeson for VFS, but was unhappy with the results, he put a camera down my nose to check out my vocal cords. In preparation, his fellow (who shadowed him) put some numbing agent in my nose. The actual camera-in-nose procedure hurt, but that wasn't because of the person administering it, it was just the procedure. 

After he left, an aide of his took some pictures of me at different angles (profile,  45 degrees, etc), got my payment info, and that was it!

They're booking about six months out right now, so the very earliest I could get scheduled would be this summer, but provided my insurance covers things, it's a definite yes for me. "

Conflicted123456,asktransgender,The point of no return.,"I'm personally not a fan of so many of these kinds of hopelessness threads, but fuck it.


So a few months ago when I hit an all time.low, I finally accepted myself as trans and it gave me hope.  

However, ever since that day I've lurked and posted on this sub for 12+ hours every single day.  I'm not sure why, its just an obsession that I can't stop I guess, when I stop reading, I'll be back again within 10 minutes even if I know there will be nothing new.

It seems like every minute of my life I'm stuck in my head battling doubt, its like my subconscious is constantly making me search for reasons to prove I'm cis (which is not what I want) though the logical evidence over the years says otherwise.

During that time I've had a few highs but mostly lows even though I feel like kinda happier in some ways, the obsession still brings me down. (I'm sure you can figure what feeling 'low' refers to)

Anyway I saw my disabled mam for Xmas yesterday, after 2 hours I walked out as I couldn't handle it any more, I just had to get out, stress and discomfort levels.through the roof.

Today I spent the evening with my dads side of the family for drinks/socialising or whatever.  The only thing I could.think and conclude while sat there was how I do jot fit into the family at all, what's the point.  After spending an hour there initiated no conversations and no one talked to me either, I basically just browsed asktg the whole time, so I left, incredibly sad and hopeless.

After being back home a few hours, I've had some time to reflect and I genuinely feel im mentally broken, and the day I accepted myself as trans was the point of no return, my mind has not stopped since that day just thinking about shit and I don't know if it ever will.  I haven't had any desire to do anything I'd consider fun since that day.  All I've done is basically trans related stuff, lose weight, mess about with clothes, makeup etc.  But I'm not sure I will ever feel any normality in my life again and this is all just gonna end tragically when I just can't deal any more.

For those who have been in similar situations, could you give me some psych ward survival tips?","My suicidal thoughts have gotten far worse than ever before. I have a plan, I have a method, I have a location, I have a few potential timeframes and I have suicide notes prepared. This is above and beyond anything I've thought thus far. 

I talked to my therapist about this today. She was understandably perturbed. Though on some level I want to be hospitalized to get the care I desperately need, I knew that it would be a financially, emotionally, and logistically difficult experience for myself and my loved ones. After 15 solid minutes of negotiation I managed to talk her out of it on the condition that I would return to see her on Thursday. I doubt I'll be able to talk her out of it again, so there's a good chance I'll be committed Thursday morning. 

I have never been to a psychiatric wing before and I haven't been to a legitimate hospital in probably 2 years. I'm concerned that I will be misgendered, deadnamed, and generally treated as a man by the staff--that kind of treatment is part of why i'm so suicidal in the first place. I'm also scared that I will be committed to long-term care, which will force me to flunk out of college, which will cause me to lose my apartment and job. If I get out, I will be forced to live with my parents again, and that is something I could not survive for long. 

So, other trans people who have been committed: what will happen when I go to the psych ward? How can I deal with the situation? How can I convince them to let me go free if they determine i'm not safe on my own?

So, I'm a 20 year old transwoman and I've finally started HRT (been on it for a month and a half).

I am very sad and angry at myself for not transitioning in high school or earlier.

I think about how I could have worn a prom dress, and how if I had started then how far ahead I would be now, instead of chasing this image of myself.

Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,"It's so uncanny, passing as the gender you identify as, after decades of living as the gender you were assigned at birth. I still haven't wrapped my head around it.","I've been passing as female for 11 months now, and it still feels rather like I've broken the fourth wall of reality, or like I have a superpower that very few people have.  When strangers gender me correctly, I still cheer internally (and conversely, I have nightmares in which people gender me incorrectly).  It's very difficult to process it, since my brain is still the same old brain it's always been, and from my perspective I haven't changed much at all.  Remember those 80's movies in which two characters switched bodies because of some magical artifact? It feels like I'm the main character in a movie like that.  Here's some of the crazier experiences I've had:

* A former neighbor who knew me 8 years ago asked me who I was, if I was my aunt, and if I'd heard from [my old boyname] lately and how he's doing.
 
* While trying to pass as a guy (before I realized how badly my guy mode had failed), I wore men's clothing, identified myself by my old male name, and strangers addressed me as Miss [boyname].
 
* While signing up for the gym, the dude I was talking to who was trying to upsell me asked me if I wanted to work out to look better for a boyfriend (bastard assumed I was straight! LOL!).  When showing me around the gym, he asked me to meet him at the pool, showed me to the women's locker room, and told me to walk straight through there to the pool, while he would go through the men's locker room.
 
* Telling my hair stylist that I'm intersex after they just told me that they're non-binary, and then them telling me that they assumed I was a non-intersex cisgender woman.
 
* The time I went with my mom to her appointment with her cosmetic facial surgeon after she had had her surgery.  She asked the surgeon how her face would look when she finished healing up, and he pointed to me, saying 'Probably like your daughter's face"".  That made me feel great, but I don't know if that's quite the end result my mom had in mind, lol.
 
* The time I went to court for my gender change, and the two cis lesbian attorneys who were helping me out met me there, and initially assumed that I was a cisgender woman and that they had the wrong person.
 
* Being asked a dozen times so far why I'm 13 years late in getting a pap smear by nurses, eye doctors, etc.  Sorry doc, there's no pap to smear.

I guess it might be more understandable if, prior to transitioning, I was like a makeup artist and presented like a very feminine gay man, or that I worked out in the gym non-stop so I knew everything there was to know about how to reshape my body.  But I'm just a nerd, really.  I walk around in jeans and t-shirts and a jacket and backpack and no makeup.  My body is probably below average.  It still utterly baffles me that I pass at all, and I can't make sense of it.  It really feels like someone cast a spell on me, so that even though I know I look like a dude in jeans and a t-shirt, everybody else sees me as a chick.  People tell me that I sincerely do look female, but given that I spent 32.5 years looking like a dude, it's hard to change my residual self-image to reflect the new reality.

Has anyone else experienced this? Where you pass, you can't even pass as the gender you were assigned at birth if you tried anymore, but your residual self-image is still that of you looking like your assigned gender, so you still struggle to believe it? Maybe the feeling fades over the years, and you just come to accept it as normal."

NobleSirGalahad,asktransgender,HRT health insurance help?,"Hi!

Long time lurker here. I have finally come to the decision to pursue HRT. I am under my parents health care plan, which is Aetna open access HMO. My university has a health center which is part of their preferred provider list and which provides transgender hrt care. I have made them my primary care physician. My question is, does anyone know what exactly is covered by Aetna open access HMO? I am under the impression that the hormones themselves are, but im unsure if the mental evaluation and other steps (this is part of the WPATH system) are covered. Does anyone know? Thanks. I hope that made sense."

As the title says, I have a stress and anxiety disorder and I'm wondering if this could partially of been brought on by me being a transgender woman. I must point out, at the moment I am still a questioning transgender woman, I also got bullied in school because everyone thought I was ""gay"" because I was so feminine, so the bullying definitely led to the stress and anxiety disorder too.
Unfortunately I don't have the money to go and see a gender therapist.... so how can I distinguish if my stress and anxiety disorder had ANYTHING to do with me always possibly being a transgender woman?"

thatswhatfreudsaid,asktransgender,Could someone with more first-hand knowledge/experience than I (cis lady) help me figure out if my FtM brother is getting the right medical care?,"Hi there, r/asktransgender! I'm immensely relieved there's a forum like this for questions. Sorry in advance that this involves a bit of backstory.

My brother is a 17 year old FtM transman, and has recently successfully gotten a legal gender change -- hooray! Just in time for college applications. He's also looking into starting hormone therapy very soon, and the money for that would come from our dead dad's trust (aw yeah, death cash). But because my brother's still a minor, my uncle controls the trust and has to like, vet all the money that comes out of it. Which is chill, he's been super supportive of my brother even if he doesn't totally like Get the minutia of the LGBT community, and he just wants to make sure all the right options are being considered for my brother.

SO, my uncle just forwarded me an email from my brother regarding some tests that his doctor's asked him to take in order to...figure out the right hormone therapy for him? I think? And my uncle is basically totally confused about all of it and wants to make sure that my brother's not getting taken advantage of and that the costs and tests and procedures all look...right. I have no experience with this as a cis woman, and I've tried googling a couple things but I thought it might be best to get my information from people who have actually been through this experience.

Here's what my brother said:

""My doctor wants my blood to be tested for the following things in order to proceed with my hormone treatment: CMP, CBC, AIC, FLP, T3 Free, Free T4, TSH, Testosterone, and Estrogen. 

I tried getting my test at [LOCATION] and they told me I had to pay about $1,260 up front in order to get the test done.

Due to time sensitivity of the test, I would have to get the test done [THIS WEEK]. I have tried to discuss a cheaper alternative with others, but it seems to be unlikely because I have no insurance.""

Basically, would be incredibly helpful if someone here could verify that this was all above board -- I trust my brother, but he's young and eager to get this going and also...from a less-than-LGBT-friendly place and I just...I worry. So if I could get some guidance so I can guide my uncle to figure out the best way to go for my brother, I'd very much appreciate it!"

SophieCalle,asktransgender,Callen-Lorde and finding a gender therapist in NYC,"Hello everyone, I'm generally a person who handles my own issues myself.  But, due to recently accidentally outing myself, I've spun out into a incredibly bad depression.  

I'm doing a ton of mindfulness to keep myself in check but it's becoming more and more difficult by the day.  I need outside help.  I need a therapist.

newaccounticreated,asktransgender,"Why is it preferable for pronouns to be specific to your gender, rather than gender neutral?","I read recently that NY mandates using the preferred pronoun of a person, based on their gender identity.  It seemed like a weird solution to the very real problem of misgendering a person, and I don't know any trans people in real life, so I was hoping I could get clarification on this board. :)

It seems to me that there's no reason for pronouns to be tied to sex or gender expression or gender identity at all.  Functionally, pronouns exist as a generic shorthand to refer to a person/object.  I don't understand how that purpose is furthered by having different pronouns per gender identity, anymore than it would by having different pronouns per political identity.

Even outside of trans issues, gendered pronouns already cause unnecessary issues, including adding complexity to sentences like, ""if a person is drunk, he or she should not drive.""  The gender of a person is entirely irrelevant with regard to drunk driving - why are we adding that cumbersome element to the sentence?

A really reasonable solution to this seems to me to be a singular, gender-neutral pronoun.  It completely fulfills the utility of a pronoun and doesn't add any unnecessary complexity or difficulty.

Having a multiplicity of pronouns based on gender identity, on the other hand, seems to exacerbate current difficulties and create new ones.  How could I even say ""if a person is drunk, he or she should not drive"" if the only exhaustive solution would be dozens of gender pronouns?

Additionally, since gender is based on cultural norms, and cultural norms change over time, as do each person's place on the gender identity spectrum to some extent, how can I ever be sure I'm using the correct pronoun for a particular person - since it could have changed since I was last informed of what it was?

It seems like, if we're going to change the current pronoun system (which I think we should), we should make it simpler, rather than more complex.  Especially when the utility of a pronoun isn't clearly furthered by being tethered to gender, whether two or twenty or infinite.  A gender neutral singular pronoun just seems so reasonable to me."
Lxndrphnx,asktransgender,Does it really get better?,"I'm 24, turning 25 in a few weeks. I'm a trans woman and I've been on HRT for about 14 months.

I'm definitely better off mentally than I was before HRT, but I've pretty much given up hope that medically transitioning is going to make me happy. I'm going back to therapy. Maybe a combination of HRT, therapy, and antidepressants will get me there.

throwaway_thingo,asktransgender,"Am I cis, ftm or something else?","Hi! You peeps probably get these sorts of questions a lot here, so I hope i'm not too much trouble but lately I've had some serious issues with figuring out who I am in terms of gender. I know for sure I'm currently bisexual, 19 years old and genetically female. However, I've never particularly associated with this: I've always been somewhat ambivalent when it comes to debates towards the genders, little rivalries and such, when everyone else was cheering on their fellow women/men and it made me feel left out, I couldn't care less about this crap.

I love my body a lot and although I don't take much time doing my makeup or anything like that (I don't like the way it looks on me, ew), and because of this a lot of people have said I couldn't be trans because of this and I must be a woman - they told me I didn't experience dysphoria. These people always bugged me but I figured they must know more than me, right? So I assumed I wasn't trans.

But recently I have been doubting that. A few days ago I was at church and there was this one person who I couldn't quite figure out if they were male or female by looking at them. And I just. Was overcome by thoughts about them. At first I thought I just had a bit of a crush on them, but it's not the same as my previous crushes and besides, they weren't really that attractive, they didn't turn me on. I think, I wanted to *be* them: it's a feeling I can't describe, though it isn't overwhelming it's the sort of thing that sits at the back of your mind. There's been a lot of situations like this where in a vague way I wished to be different, but it never really was very intense. This was a few months ago, and recently I told a cis friend of mine who is also a redditor about it since she seemed to know a lot about gender (imo i always get nervous when the topic is mentioned, as it often is on reddit). She told me maybe you guys here could help, so here I am, I guess.

JRSlayerOfRajang,asktransgender,UK; Where to look for FFS in the UK or elsewhere?,"I've never thought I needed FFS. I've avoid my face at all costs because I know it makes me really uncomfortable, all I've really had to go on is what my friends and therapist have told me.

I believed them, when they said ""I'd never lie to you about this."" They did, they were lying all along. They said I look like a girl now, that I don't have a visible brow ridge, that my nose isn't big it's normal, that my hair looks good, that I have good skin.

Today I found at that's all bullshit. Had a big Christmas party last night, I felt confident enough to be in a couple of the photos; I took up photography so I had an excuse to never be in front of a camera, I don't have any photos of me, not even from when I was young.

A friend posted a photo on Facebook of me and a couple of girl friends. And I realised what I look like. My brow ridge was fucking awful even in the photos from a distance, my nose is huge and manly, my hair's a fucking nightmare. I know you'll tell me I'm exaggerating or I'm wrong, but I'm not posting the photo here. Believe me when I say how bad I looked. There were comments on the photo asking ""who's the guy"" and ""lol why'd you tag that man as a girl"".

I've never looked into FFS. But now I realise I don't have any other option.

So, who would you recommend to get my brow and nose fixed? Feedback on surgeons would be appreciated, should I stay in the UK or leave it for this? How much will it cost? 

Between voice therapy and needing SRS I'll have to choose which to get first; SRS first or FFS first? I hate my face as much as my genitals, so the issue is which would affect my quality of life more. Either way I still can't have a relationship with anyone or be considered desirable or attractive.

Any advice would be appreciated. I saw that photo, broke down in tears immediately and felt suicidal again; I feel like a fucking broken record. Whenever things start to get better and I hope maybe something might change, something happens that drags me back down to the fucking depths and makes me want to die again. I feel like I'll never be free of that, no matter what I do, and transitioning isn't fixing it."

Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,"Wait, why am I now starting to experience genital dysphoria and a desire to have SRS?","I've been on HRT for a little over 17 months.  At 7 months of HRT, I was just walking around in guy mode and minding my own business when quite out of the blue, strangers started calling me Miss [boyname] rather than Mister [boyname].  Naturally, I assumed that this was simply a long unbroken string of flukes for the next 2 months, before coming to the realization that perhaps it meant that strangers saw me as a female, at which point I changed my name and gender markers to make sure that I didn't accidentally prove them wrong.  I guess that's when shit got real.  When I became a card-carrying female.  I had to expedite my plans; before my guy mode collapsed early on, people had been telling me that it would probably take me 2.5-3 years to fail at guy mode, so I had a nice, leisurely timetable.  When my guy mode failed ahead of schedule, I started thinking more intensely about having an orchiectomy, since it would be good to get off of Spiro.  Again, I had a timetable for getting an orchiectomy; I would wait until 3 years of HRT before making my final decision about whether or not to have one.  This seemed prudent, given the irreversible nature of the procedure, and the effects that a zombie apocalypse would have upon my ability to request refills of hormones from my pharmacy, and the fact that a lack of hormones would result in osteoporosis at a time when I would need to be in peak zombie-killing physical fitness.

My plans for having an orchiectomy remained the same until 3 hours after the polls closed on Election Day, when it became obvious that the new President of the United States would be Donald Trump, and I began to fear that with the repeal (and replacement?) of the ACA, I would no longer have the option to get an Orchie if I so choosed; in future years, I might have health insurance that doesn't cover transgender care, or perhaps it would, but with a very high deductible.  Perhaps I would be able to get an Orchie, but only at a high cost.  This realization that soon getting an Orchie could be much more difficult seemed to clarify matters, and I came to the conclusion that yes, I should get an Orchie.

Or should I? Then I started thinking about whether I should have SRS.  I had never before put any serious consideration into having SRS, and I once said here on askTG that I wouldn't have SRS if it were free and I lived in Thailand.  I didn't mind having a penis, I would have no problem using it with a sexual partner, and I think that both penises and vaginas are equally attractive so long as they're on females.  I used to think often that it would be nice to have both a penis and a vagina, I guess so that I wouldn't have to choose one or the other, and could minimize my regrets.  I have a very strong belief that you can be a beautiful woman and have a penis.  Pre-HRT I wanted nothing to do with the thought of having SRS.

Yet somehow I've found that I'm now mildly genital dysphoric, and thinking about having SRS.  I've been talking about it with my therapist for the last month or so.  When I see naked women who have vaginas (cis or trans), I either feel aroused, or jealous, or I feel inadequate due to my own lack of a vagina and feel like crying, or all three at once.

*If I could push a button and have a cisgender woman's vagina, I would push it right now.  (I've always felt that way, even Pre-HRT, even before realizing that I was trans; I would have been okay with having a vagina if I could have just pushed a button and become a cisgender woman)

*If I could push a button and have a vagina made by a good SRS surgeon, say Dr. Suporn, I would push it right now.

*If a good SRS surgeon such as Dr. Suporn were here right now and said ""I'm free for the next six hours, if you want SRS, follow me"", then I'm somewhat sure that I would follow him.

Perhaps as time has gone on, and I've settled into the idea that I'm female and strangers see me that way, SRS has gone from being something that I thought was unnecessary for me and unwanted, to being something that I think would be nice.  The more I become comfortable with being female, the more the thought of having a vagina in lieu of a penis becomes attractive to me.  Maybe that's why I started out not wanting SRS, and now think it would be pretty nice.

I guess it's a good thing I have my self-imposed 3 year waiting period.  Enough time to hash all this out with myself.  Thinking about it for such a long period will probably clarify things, and reduce my chance of regrets if I do go through with it.  I guess if it's just a phase that I'm going through, then the waiting period will filter it out."
thenewteddy,asktransgender,SRS without changing gender,"First off I want to apologize if this is the wrong place to ask this question; I'm not really sure where the right place is. 

I'm Teddy.
I'm 32.
I'm a male who lives in Canada. I was born as such.


Since I've been a child I've always wished I'd been born a girl. I won't go into great detail, but in short, the idea of going through the process to transition has always been in my mind. There's always been something that stops me.

I'm not really interested in changing my gender. Frankly, I personally don't put great value on my gender, and, for me, it seems like a lot of effort to put into something I really don't care about. If someone asks me what my gender is I'm liable to say ""default"" as that's how I honestly feel. I just go through the motions. I don't have any attachment to being gender male, but I also don't really have any strong desire to become gender female.


However, I have always wanted to change my sex. 

I still do.


I know some trans people, and I was talking about these sorts of things with a few of them online. I mentioned that I've always thought about this but that, at the end of the day, I always figured that I really just don't care enough about my own gender to bother. And as such, that it will be one of those things that, when I'm 60, I'll think back on and wonder if I should have transitioned, or if I made the right choice. 

During that discussion the idea of gender came up and I mentioned that I, personally, don't really weight gender very strongly. I was told in no uncertain terms that this could be offensive to some. There are those who struggle with their gender and being told that this very important thing is ""unimportant"" to me can sound like an attack. I want to say that it is not, nor do I intend it as such. I just personally don't place a great weight on it. 


After this conversation I gave what was said some thought.

And something hit me.


Why do I need to change my gender to change my sex?


I'm not sure I do.

Do I?


I honestly have no idea.

And that brings me to my question. 
Is it a thing to get SRS without changing your gender?
Could I remain a male gendered person who gets SRS to remove my male genitalia? 
Is that a ""thing"" that people do? Is it something you can do, or will people try to stop you?


All of the years I've struggled with these thoughts, and this one idea has suddenly made me think that it's all a realistic possibility. It's only been a day or two since that discussion and this idea, but I can't get it out of my head.

I guess what I'm saying is I need some help figuring all this out, and would appreciate some feedback from people more in the know than I."

ares19g,asktransgender,"Coming out, moving away together, breaking up, what now?","So I came out to myself as trans (MTF) about a year ago, and two months afterwards told my lady partner of 4 years, in a bout of tears, how I felt. She was very understanding, at least once I communicated how I wish this wasn't how I felt, and no one would choose to feel this way. She was distant for a few days, but she embraced me and told me she still loved me and wanted to make it work. We had been planning a move across the country, and I didn't think it was fair to come out after she moved away from her support system. 

Now we have moved, and settled in for 4 months. I haven't taken very good care of myself, I was basically a couch potato constantly engaging in escapism. That is what I knew, and how I dealt with my gender issues. I had not sought therapy, which I know was a major blunder on my part. Throughout the time of me coming out to now; the uncertainty of it all had her feeling shattered, and I was too thick to notice. Distance between us ensued, and the night before last she told me she loves me but doesn't feel romantic love for me any longer. When I came out to her I expressed that this sort of life change wasn't expected by either of us, and I would understand if she felt she couldn't romantically love a woman. So now my expression is in practice, only we are 2000 miles away from our families and our friends.

She tells me, both of us choking back tears, that she wants to stay here (in the single br apt we rent) to support me, but she would leave if I needed her to. I told her I did not want to make that decision while I'm dealing with emotional pain. The day after the relationship clarification I sought therapy immediately, and scheduled an appointment for later this week. I also stopped engaging in recreational marijuana use (which is legal where I am), and began to work out simply for the endorphin's effect. She asked for space, and though its been 2 days I feel as though I have provided that space. I've left the apt after 1-2 hrs of exposure and returned after she leaves for work. I hit a cafe downtown, bought a good Bill Nye book and read about topics that intrigue my mind. 

Self care is what I've always done to aid my mental state during a breakup, and it has worked every time. This, however, has been the first breakup where I cannot begrudge the other person their decision at all. My oldest friend told me I should do what I've always done, and have a 6 month 0 contact period. It worked like a charm when I'd dealt with emotional pain before. I start school (intensive 10 hr days 5 days a week) in 3 weeks, and I work all day on the weekends. I feel as though that distance will make it easier to be ""just friends"".

I need to say before I close this out that our emotional connection (sight of soul on eye contact) and bond has always been strong. Though due to her history of childhood abuse our sexual interaction dwindled the closer we grew emotionally. I'm trying to say that when I came out to her, my sexual needs were not being met and she knew that. I dead stopped trying to initiate sex at her request. So in many ways I'm in pain, but also I feel slightly relieved.

I don't want to move out (financial reasons aside) because I believe that with a little time and distance we can be friends, and still be around for each other. We grew together, and I am a better person having known her (she has expressed the same sentiment). So my ""advisers"" are giving me conflicting solutions, and I would like a more broad perspective.

I introduced myself and spelled my name so NO confusion .... and then - as he excused himself to the ladies and said he was headed to the locker room I said, ""great - as long as you see me as a ""he"" I'll go right along with you ... are we planning to shower?"" --- the women giggled a bit, I fumed, and then I just left early .... really too pissed to stay and do any more work out.....

So ..... now I'm at the coffee shop next door and guess who JUST walked in??!!?? Headed now to give him an ear full ... wish me luck ... someday I'm gonna get my ass kicked being too confrontational .... but that's me .....   ~Joelle

PS: Now five minutes later --- I went up to him and he just stared down and scooted around me and out the door -- asshole .......

PSS: HOW could this day get any worse????? I'm sitting drinking my coffee and there's only one other person here .... a guy who keeps staring at me, won't look away when I stare back, and he's holding his Bible ....  DAMN!!!!!! "
safiyah_angel,asktransgender,I'm finally starting to be really safiyah. ♥,"Hello there, i don't really know what to say.

First, my store before shortly:

I started everything in august, DIY androcur 50mg only. Felt good, but still had a lot to do before i could get estrimax. So, I was at a psychologist at october 10(yeh, waited a month), psychiatrist on october 26, endocrinologist at november 3, blood test on november 9, and at endocrinologist again for the meds on november 29.

And... I still can't believe i'm here, i still can't believe i'm taking these pills. Everything feels the same, but i'm not depressed anymore. I don't feel the pressure any more. I'm motivated. All i have to do is work and move away from home before i get boy mode fail. And i feel great. :) I'm just planning my future like any other girl at my age. I'm lucky i was able to start it this short time, i'm so lucky i have the possibility for it, I'm so lucky i don't have to worry about depression anymore. 

I just want to thank you all, who helped me here and made me feel good when i came home depressed. I wan't to tell every one who is still struggling please believe me it's worth it. :) Please love yourself and never give up, you're all lovely and worthy people. I wan't you all to be as happy as me i'm right now, because we deserve it. :) 

Thank you for everything reddit trans community. ♥ :) "

I will likely need moderate jaw work, some light forehead, some nose fixing, and possibly a few other things I don't realize yet.  I don't have a hyper masculine face, but 30 years of testosterone have done their job.  I'm not confident that HRT alone will give me the results I want.  
  
I would prefer to stay within the US, but travel within the US isn't an issue.  I am starting HRT this month and considering aiming to have the surgery done next summer, during what is typically the most awkward boy/girl months (months 5 to 7).  "
nezumipi,asktransgender,Coworker advice? Colleague I'm not friends with constantly brings up intro-trans topics with me,"I've got a coworker I'll call X.  X and I have usually gotten along fine, not best buds, but no problems either. We've honestly have had very little interaction. I never particularly liked or disliked X. A few months ago, I came out at work. Now, X keeps starting conversations with me on the topic of trans 101 kinds of media, like Caitlyn Jenner, or some reality show about trans people. I get that X means well, but it's really annoying. I don't want to chat about my personal transition with someone I don't know that well, and I'm not that interested in reality TV stars, whether they're trans or not.  It's sort of like if a white employee was constantly asking the one Hispanic employee what they thought of every telenovela ever made.

Jazz8680,asktransgender,Difference between informed consent and therapy?,"Like, I know that gender therapy can be an excellent way to understand oneself, but if therapy isn't an option is that what informed consent is?

here-mousse,asktransgender,What if I'm not strong enough for her ?,"Hello everyone, I hope you all enjoyed new year holiday :)
 [sorry for mistakes english is not my first language]. I know there is sub dedicated to people who date transgender, but I also wanted advices from you guys, and you seems nice so yea.

So I'm (F 20) currently dating a transgender girl (24 pre HRT), she told me right away at the beginning, and there is really few people that know. I always been know for being a really open-minded girl, I just don't have problems with people, I understand and don't judge people for who they are. When she told me, I just didn't gave any damn about it, like I knew it was going to be difficult, I understood what that meant, but it was not a problem for me that she was trangenger, i loved her anyway in a girl body or a boy body. So most of the time I just don't see any problem, and find myself really happy, like the day I bough her a beautiful makeup palette for chirstmas and was so happy when i saw her face when she opened it. But someday, I just have this huge wave of fear that goes right in front of me, like what if im not strong enough, and what if I feel myself to be unconfortable in some moment (I have a lot of anxiety problem), or to feel unconfortable during sex, or not to pleased her because of that fears...

So yes, thats pretty much the painting, I'm so in love with her but this damn though keep rushing in my mind and make me feel anxious. Any advices ? Thanks

cruxsofy,asktransgender,I want to be a girl,"I just want to be a girl. I just want to have long brown hair, pretty eyes, ear rings and a necklace, wear a cute bright red cardigan over a black t shirt, a scarf, and black leather pants.

I want to be loved by a man. I want to be fucked by a man.

My voice is deep and I sound like a cis male, my hair is short, my eye brows are bushy, my nose is big, my ass is small. I want to be a girl.

For a long time I have master bated to straight porn, I thought I wanted to fuck girls. Only now do I realize what I really wanted was to be the girl, my life is just one giant fantasy.

I am in high school, my only two friends are girls. I am blessed to have them in my life, they are the only one's who understand me. They have taken me to try on women's clothes, and even bought me makeup for my birthday.

I am too afraid to wear the makeup to school. I am too afraid to be myself. My parents won't help me get HRT and they think it is not worth the risk.

I am failing all of my classes. I do not try anymore. 

I just want to be a girl and live a normal life.

Never-be-Ashley,asktransgender,What do I do now?,"My girlfriend has been amazing. 
We've been together a little more than 2 years.
When i came out to her just over a year ago I didn't think I could ever transition.
I thought she'd be horrified and call me a monster and run away.

But she didn't.  Instead she told me I'd make a beautiful woman.

That changed everything.  Now I've been on hrt for 4 months and been happier in myself than I've ever been. 
I thought everything was great

But last night she told me that she can't handle being with a woman. She can handle me being trans and using my new name but not the drugs and the changes.

She's the best thing that ever happened to me. And it feels like I have to choose between who gets to be happy. 
Like I have to cut out my heart, or my lungs. 

We didn't break up. But neither of us know what to do now. I don't know what to do and I don't know who to talk to and I feel lost"

bigmeetch565,asktransgender,Anyone else feel the most dysphoria sexually?,"I feel like the largest part of my dysphoria is in the bedroom. I have never been able to get an erection with another person unless they were using their hands, even with the aid of viagara. (I can do it with myself just fine though) and I feel like this is a big reason for my dysphoria.

As time has gone on I have fantasized about being a woman more and more and it pleases me, but I'm afraid that its just a symptom of not wanting to feel sexual pressure.

When I fantasize about sex these days I imagine myself as the woman and I feel like I would be happy being a woman 24/7 but its most prevalent when imagining myself in the bedroom.

Anyone else feel this way too?

EDIT: As an aside I have had receiving anal sex with men and enjoyed it but still don't feel like it was all I thought it would be."
nuegerl,asktransgender,NSFW(sex talk): Why does transitioning later in life STILL feel like high school?!,"No, seriously.  I know people say things to you if you start to transition later in life (post teen years) like ""you get to be a teenager all over again"" and ""everything is going to change for you,"" but I was always thinking, ""ya, but I'm older now, I did that once already, I got this.""

So let's talk about sex.  Now don't get me wrong, I may have hated the idea of someone seeing my naked body pre-transition, much less touching it in any way, but I was no stranger to self-love back in the days when that was something you just did before breakfast...and after lunch...and mid-evening, twice.  And...well, you get the idea.  But I knew what I liked then.  And now with hormones those signals are all switched around and I'm still figuring them out, why is everything broken?!  I get that growing new body parts is weird and change takes time, but seriously!  I knew what boobs were, why are they so different now?  And sensitive?  And lovely?!?

Also, I thought I was on meds that killed libido, but oh no girl, it may have dried up for a bit but when it came back it was waaaaaay worse than before, but also different (if that makes any sense).  It's like I'm in heat now, sex isn't just a fun diversion anymore.  Friends keep having to remind me screwing random people is a terrible plan.  Grrr.  And sometimes it goes away for a bit.  But then it comes back all at once and I can't think straight.  Stupid. Body. Doesn't. Make. Any. Sense!

But wait, a weird awkward body, confusing sexual functions, and unrepentant horniness NOT high school-y enough for you?  Now mid-transition, I once again don't know where I fall in the social circles of my peers, dating is confusing, new and emotionally tumultuous like never before (I cry therefore I am), and it feels like on a regular basis I will NEVER find someone to love me because I'm a weird freak that makes no sense...well, that last part isn't new, I always felt that one of those, joy.

OMG, I'm an adult for crying out loud.  I have a drivers license, I drink responsibly, I'm jaded by our political process.  ADULT!!  Why is this so hard?  I did high school already, doesn't that help?!  It sorta does, but not really. blarg..

Hah, sorry, needed to get all that out.  Also, frustrated.  Sooooo frustrated.  Am I alone in any of this?  I appreciate you if you followed my madness with me through to the end.  Thanks loves!  ;3"
ContraltoInACorset,asktransgender,How to explain to family that the way they treat me implies they are ashamed of me?,"I came out to my family over a year ago, when I started HRT. After the one year mark hit a couple months ago, it feels like my body decided that it was time to hit turboes, and even in my 30's am seeing significant changes to my figure. I have outgrown all of my B cup bra's, have a decent figure, and said figure is apparent even in an oversized XXL men's shirt.

So, a bit of background, my family asked me to stop requesting that ***they*** stop deadnaming and misgendering me. ""It takes time"", ""You've been Uncle [deadname] for as long as they have been alive"", I offered to sit down and help explain to my niece and nephew, and my sister exploded, alluding to how she would kill to protect her kids, and I was not allowed to talk to them.

So, half a year later, I am no longer able to easily hide my figure. Worse, all of my winter clothing is light colored, which displays curves more easily. I called my sister up, told her that my figure cannot be hidden anymore, and asked to come over and discuss it. She came over, I AGAIN explained that I can no longer hide my figure around her children, and her initial response was to just brush it off as ""I don't know what you expect me to do about it?""

I suggest that her son has already had some odd questions over Thanksgiving, like why my Diablo 3 chars are all female(my girlfriend, Dad, and I play together often), or why my girlfriend would need such a large tool chest for makeup when she never wears any(yeah, that's actually ***MY*** makeup chest...). I then made the unforgivable suggestion, again, of answering any questions and helping to explain it.

She blew up even worse this time. She stopped short of reminding me that she'd willingly kill to protect her kids, stopping mid sentence after ""I told you last time that I would..."" to glance at my girlfriend whom was also in the room, before switching to ""never allow you near my children again"".

Talking to my Dad about it, he suggested that I could wear padding and a binder to conceal the changes, and when told that she keeps alluding to how she would kill to protect her children in regards to them finding out that I'm Trans, he only replied, in a completely level voice; ""key word here is her children, it is a perfectly understandable response."" Who's child am I? Why is it understandable for her to threaten to kill me...and he just not care?

My parents are wanting to ""talk about it"" tonight, but last time, they absolutely refused to allow me to suggest that they were acting ashamed of me. It's all just that it's so sudden, having given them 8 months to get used to it...it ""takes a minute""(hate that expression so damn much). They still refuse to use feminine pronouns or my name.

If them trying to hide who and what I am from the rest of my family isn't shame, then what is it? How do I get across to them that death threats from my own blood family just in case one of the ignorant notices that my gait has changed, or my hips or chest are more pronounced, or Thor forbid I actually wear fitted clothing...that no, that is not safe? That I do not feel comfortable with that hanging over my head?"
[deleted],asktransgender,"My final attempt at denial...One final ""am i trans"" thing where my defensive mind goes all out","I've seen a therapist 3 times now. In the second session she diagnosed me with GD. I've revealed it to my mom, one of my female friends, and partially to my wife. I was almost willing to try and go out of my way to get that diagnosis, but I didn't have to, because I ""aced the test.""

A part of me (a decreasing part) doesn't believe I am transgender. I graciously welcome your help in either affirming my manly sides view in suggesting I am meant to be a dude, or if these reasons alone are not enough to dispel the idea that I want to be a girl. I even like that word a lot...girl, woman, female, her, she...I have plenty of reason to believe I am transgender, but my suddenly bipolar man side wants to have a last stand, so let's give it one final shot and I won't post any of these ridiculous topics again.

Final disclaimer: I know ultimately this has to come ""from inside"" but my soul is too complicated, and this is new enough that I need to dispel some of these doubts before I can move on. So I really will respect and consider your opinions.

- I don't have any memories of looking at the mirror and disliking what I saw based on gender. I never liked myself, and always saw myself negatively, but it was self image, and not because I wanted to ""be a pretty girl.""

- This is shallow and sad, but I am extremely jealous of girls in their 20s and that is a huge trigger in my dysphoria. But I am not jealous of most middle aged women. In fact when I think of myself in the far future, I can't see an old woman...And not that I readily see myself as an old man either, but since I started paying attention to it, I've felt like I'd rather be an old man than an old woman.

- In college I had no sense of dysphoria. Not to say I didn't have mental problems. I nearly killed myself, and I apologized to God for my creation constantly, but there was no gender connection. Despite cross dressing and obsessing over the bodies of girls in high school, I was solely focused on finding a girlfriend in college and I didn't have temptations to cross dress or feel feminine like I did in high school.

- I have ADHD and take Adderall, and when I switched from Ritalin to Adderall again (I began on Addy, went to Ritalin because of the anxiety Addy gave me and went back to Addy because Ritalin made me want to bash my skull into a wall) that's when the switch went off of GD. I enjoy the emotional increase Adderall gives me, and I hav a drinking problem that combines the two and creates an emotional haze that enhances the feeling of dysphoria. My only counter is I've researched Adderall and alcohol and found no link to an increase in GD.

- I am someone who imagines and creates stories and worlds in my head. I constantly imagine myself as I walk around listening to music, like a music video playing out, of me as a badass guy that saves his friends or excels and impresses all the ladies at sports. To be fair, sports were a huge part of my youth, and I am among the best distance runners in my schools history (which is more an insult to the school than anything honestly). I was most often praised in my life for my athletic ability. Until college, when I suffered the unhappy triad...an utter destruction of my knee.

- I am quiet, reserved, antisocial, and have no interest in typical female shows/movies like the bachelor or anything on lifetime. I have to resist scoffing at some of the crap my wife likes, and I prefer deep, dark, emotional dramas.

- No one I've ever known seems to think I have had any traits of being a girl. My mom was shocked at the notion and told me she never saw anything that resembled me being anything but a boy as a kid.

- I like typical male things like video games, and sports, and nerdy stuff like Marvel movies and whatnot.

- The voice in my head is strong due to my imagination and strong introversion, but it's never been a female voice, its always been a male voice.

- I've struggled talking to girls and have tended to hang out and befriend guys in high school. One final counter to that may be that now I'm not in a high school atmosphere, all my deepest relationships are with girls. And I remembered when our group of friends hung out last time, I spend much more time talking with the girls while all the guys where downstairs talking about games and whatnot.

Finally, just to be complete: the quick summary of why I may be trans or have GD:
- Constant urge to wear women's clothes and be presented as female
- Euphoria when I was referred to by a female name, and a female pronoun, online no less.
- I seem to have a sensitive, caring, all loving personality that really just wants love and happiness to prevail even in the face of adversity
-Obsession with breasts that goes beyond being a pervert...as in I was afraid of dating a girl with big boobs because it would disturb me and make me potentially a bit jealous.
- The magic pill thing where in almost every situation and emotional state I would say I would take the pill and be female
- Strange disturbance and arousal looking at transwomen that have really succeeded in transitioning and watching a show or anime where a guy magically becomes a girl.
- Never hating my male body but fearing the facial and chest that eventually came, even to where I wouldn't eat bread crust despite liking it (grandpa said I wouldn't grow chest hair if I ate it).
- Despite not hating my penis, have a strong emotional response watching an animation where it becomes a vagina and thinking ""that's pretty amazing, I'd take that""
- I HATE my voice. I can't listen to it. And I hate farting. My guys friends always are farting, and I can't do it. It's super awkward for me to do it.
- A feeling of never belonging at multiple points in life.
- I still remember the first time I tried on my mom's women's jeans for the first time in middle school. And I loved it. I can't wear men's jeans, but I love the look and feel of women's jeans.

That's all the energy I have left and my wife is home haha. Sorry to burden you with another topic but this will be my last I promise! Anyway thanks so much for the help! "
uncansancio,asktransgender,Stressed and confused--help?,"Hi all,

Firstly, I appreciate your time. This is a long post... This is a throwaway, but this topic matters to me. I'm very sensitive, currently, and I really, genuinely, appreciate your patience and sympathy.
I'm mtf, just for context, and I just really need to talk to someone about this. Likeminded people. I'm afraid of being judged! Well, okay, here goes. Not sure how to say this.

Lately, I wonder if I'm really trans. I feel fake. Relatable? I have this horrible, nagging feeling that I'll never really know what it's like to be a girl. I know every girl is different, but... come on, you know? I feel like everything about me is masculine. I like women, too, and I know sexuality doesn't have to so with your gender--but I hate to say this, please don't judge me, but how could it not? I torture myself by looking at these two studies of enormous sample sizes, from 50-120,000 people, and found the incidence of gayness and lesbian ness to be so, so low (2% approximately in males and females, respectively). I know there's talk about how what people define as gay and what they call gay is different, etc., and I'm sure the critique of data can be made fairly, but how many women are realistically attracted to women? It's really showing to be such an uncommon phenomenon, whereas all I feel I see are trans women (such as myself) who almost exclusively like women (I'm not saying this to be hurtful, it's just my experience, totally anecdotal though, I'll give it that).

I'm left thinking, look how different my experience has really been that my sexuality is so uncommon in the group I'm trying to fit into. I also feel I'll never pass, and frankly I feel I can easily tell when someone is trans, that's to say that I rarely find that trans women around me pass, which doesn't make me feel good about my chances (bless them, I know we're all trying our best, myself included). I also feel jealous of women for having girlhoods, despite the fact that they usually fucking suck more than boyhood, which makes me feel pathetic for complaining.

Additionally, I feel hurt about my job... I'm a software developer. I know women can be anything, but really, it's like 2% of the tech industry is women (idk, whatever, miserably low). I feel like I would never have been interested in tech and programming from a young age if I hadn't been raised a boy (I feel like women are not raised to really pursue these sorts of activities, just my observation), I feel like everything that I am is just a guy, everything in my life that I am interested in is cuz my background, all my preferences, sexual or not, all my thought processes and associations, etc. I fear so much that I'll never be a real woman, that I'm a phony, that I'm doing this for attention,... All because some really important and formative years were spent as a guy. I can't change it. And I hate it. Worst part? ...I was happy as one too.

Sometimes I feel like I need to lie and say I wasn't, that I ""always knew"" or that ""my mind is biologically female""--maybe this is true for others, but I feel I'm lying to myself. I was happy as a guy, and I didn't always know. I just changed my mind, you know? I hate that I feel that I need to say I ""was really always a woman"", because that really was not true for me, and I already feel like my whole life is a lie. I can't stand putting up a front about my past. Why can't it just be what it is? Ugh... (And, frankly, I don't believe in brain science like that as it seems eugenicist and lacking in real evidence, but that's for another time, not important.)

I always ask, well, how would I feel about this/associate with this xyz topic if I was "" really a girl""? I always wonder what kind of experiences I would have had that would have caused me to have different perspectives. Generally, people raised as certain races/genders etc have common experiences, thus common psychology (variation, obviously, but ykno). For women, it seems the overwhelming majority are straight, want to be mothers, love the idea of sexual submissiveness to a strong, burly man, etc... And I... Can't relate. I know not everyone's the same. I know there are lesbians. But, I just don't feel I can compare to that somehow. I liked women my whole life, as most guys do. Then I decided to be a woman. And... I still like women. Exactly for the same reasons. People say your sexuality changes. Mine hasn't. I've tried to change it. It doesn't work. What am I doing wrong?

Aaaaanyways... Please help. I just feel like somehow lost. Sometimes I wonder if I should just go back to being a guy, which also makes me guilty, and also really phony for obvious reasons, but also because ""real"" women can't just take off the woman hat and turn back. It makes me feel fake, ugh! Can ANYONE relate? Please! I'm desperate. I feel I'm holding this inside for fear of treading off the beaten path of stuff you're supposed to feel/believe/say as a trans woman... And I can't relate to it.

There are also things I feel that are common in trans circles, like certain beliefs, and I just don't think they make sense and I often feel judged if I suggest disagreement, which only reinforces my fears. Maybe I'm in a funk. But I always have had this inside, ever since I started.

I have started to really get frustrated, I start to wonder if I'm in a SJ cult that encourages people to be queer even when we don't want to be, that queer life is glamorous, that I've let myself be peer pressured into this, that I'm fake, whatever whatever.
Please. Can anyone relate? Am I a basket case? Please help me. I feel scared."
KeiNameless,asktransgender,My brother is an asshole (CW: casual transphobia),"So my 20 y.o brother did something that really pissed me off today. To make a long story short we were doing some Kardashian bashing and the topic of Caitlyn Jenner came up. I made some remark about her not passing because she still has the same voice that she had pre-transitioning. I'm doing this to try to feel out what exactly his attitude is.

My brother then proceeds to take the bait and made a comment that really bothered me. He basically was like ""Have you seen what it looks like? Broad shoulders and no hips. It look like a dude with tits.""

Now, this might not matter to me if I was younger, but I'm fairly old and insanely afraid about not passing. I also know now that my brother is definitely not someone that I can confide this too. Honestly, the whole thing makes me feel really shitty and like I am an abomination. I feel like a freak and it makes me feel like I should just stay in hiding and do nothing until I die. 

Has anyone had any similar experiences and can offer some advice? I really need a shoulder to cry on right now. Sorry if this is a rant. I'm just pissed right now."
dakotadorkable,asktransgender,Need advice on how to be more confident,"Hello all you beautiful people! My name is Dakota and I really struggle with anxiety and self-confidence. All the people in my life tell me that I pass and look good, but no matter what I do I still feel terrible about my appearance and my ability to pass. I know passing isn't everything, but I just want to be able to live my life without feeling this constant extremely debilitating anxiety. My anxiety controls my life so much that I can't even go out in public without the serious risk of having a full blown panic attack. I hate it so much and I'm trying so hard to love myself and to be confident. I recently got out of an extremely abusive relationship that constantly tore me down and made me feel completely worthless. Her words still poison my mind every day and continue to warp my perception of myself.

I guess i just need some advice on how to be more confident and overcome my anxiety. It controls my life too much and I have to do something.

lecrazyunt,asktransgender,Things to do when you feel dysphoric?,"So I started HRT. But being home with my mom (not out) and the occasional doubts still occur sometimes. Especially body hair dysphoria. I know at the end of the day that I still want to transition but sometimes I just convince myself that what I'm doing is wrong. My mom triggers me a lot because she thinks I'm being cold to her but really I'm just hiding this side of me. I want to come out but she would be so devasted. 

What do you guys do when you feel like this?"

throwaway21235252523,asktransgender,"Questions about employment and ""no match"" letters","Hi all,
I am transgender MTF and I am having problems changing my name/gender with the SSA (mainly to due to transphobic employees at the local [small town] office giving me a hard time, I have all the required docs to change, and I've already changed my ID) and it's been dragging on for longer than I am comfortable waiting.

I'm missing too many job opportunities and I am wondering what is this ""no match"" letter stuff that I read happens if you gain employment while your name/gender is changed on your ID but not on your SSN. Is this going to out me? (I read that they no longer list your gender on no match letters, but my old name is very obviously male) Is it going to out me, or mess up my job or something? Also I'm in a small town, so if this no match letter is going to blurt out my old name, there's a big chance it's going to get blabbed all over town and I can't deal with that.

Or is it nothing to worry about and I can seek work until this is settled? Mainly what I'm talking about is from tsroadmap

Anyone have experience with what I'm asking about.

RembrandtsHat,asktransgender,I got a jerb. What to tell administration?,"So, I have a teaching license that is so new you could see the shiny if it existed anywhere outside of a database deep in the bowls of some state server.

Anyway, in my ongoing effort to find a place to ply my trade I just got hired on as a paraprofessional where I did my student teaching and substituted this semester.  I start in January and I'm still presenting male.  I plan to take things nice and slow on that front, and I want to give administration plenty of lead time.  

Lots of support from the colleagues I trust and all, but I'm at a loss from what to tell administration to prepare for.  My therapist has said she'll work with me to prepare some official letter, but I honestly don't know what I should ask for.  I mean, for instance, bathrooms are a non-issue because the one I typically use is single occupancy and right across the hall from the department I skulk about.  I've wee-ed in the girls one because the dude's was occupied, for example.  No one cares.

My goal has shifted to making everything look tidy and official, like this is not something I woke up that morning and decided to do.

I should add that I live and work in Illinois, so anti-discrimination law protects me.  Now that I've wormed myself into the school and the union firing me for being trans is going to be difficult as fuck.  I don't think the administration will be anything but supportive anyway.

So, suggestions?  What should I include in this theoretical letter?"

Another example is, even if people tell me that, cisgender people don't feel how I say I do, cisgender men don't live as women like I have been doing, cisgender men don't go and get HRT referrals like I have got, I still cannot accept and convince myself that I am a transgender woman.

I don't want to offend anyone who might be suicidal or prone to self-harm. In that case it's definitely a necessity. Is there something wrong in my brain or something, then?

ArmyDude956,asktransgender,Classic case of ignorant transphobia and the inability to read articles on display on Reddit (what a surprise),"This thread I'm referring to contains a lot of transphobia, so be warned.

So I was going through /r/all and came about [this post.](https://np.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/5kfpkq/pediatricians_condemn_national_geographic_over/)

The first and really only thing you need to know is that /r/uncensorednews is an echo chamber of alt-righters posting links from biased sources. See: the point of view from which everything is posted and the obviousness of how nobody did any research about the article that is the topic of this post.

So, the headline of the post (which apparently is as far as everyone got):

&gt; Pediatricians condemn National Geographic over 9-year-old ‘trans’ child on January cover

Oh no, that sounds awful! I better click on the article to see more information!

The highly respected news source responsible for this scoop is ""LifeSiteNews."" As you can see on the banner when you click on the article, ""LifeSite is the #1 most-read pro-life site on the Internet!""

So we're off to a good start in terms of credibility.

&gt; An **association of pediatricians** is condemning National Geographic over its decision to put a 9-year-old child who identifies as transgender on the cover of its January issue.

Wow, that sounds serious!

&gt; Michelle Cretella, MD, president of the **American College of Pediatricians**, told LifeSiteNews that National Geographic is “promoting a political agenda over science and the wellbeing of innocent children” by featuring a young transgender child.

So your key thing here is the American College of Pediatricians. The article glosses over who they really are, but luckily, Google is our friend.

&gt; [The American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds) is a socially conservative advocacy group of pediatricians and other healthcare professionals in the United States.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Pediatricians)

_________________________

&gt; [The group's membership as of 2016 is estimated at 500 members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Pediatricians)

(if anyone disagrees about just citing Wikipedia, look at the citations from the article)

Basically, the American College of Pediatricians is a tiny organization whose sole claim to fame is being one of the few medical organizations that actively opposes LGBT efforts (ex, [here's an article defending the ""traditional family"" on their own website](http://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/parenting-issues/defending-traditional-marriage)). They are not respected in the medical community for anything. My own inference is that they exist so that right-wing news outlets can say that a medical organization backs up their views, without having to have an organization that actually fucking matters agree with them.

If you want an actually respected pediatric organization to tell you about transgender issues, check out the [AAP](https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/Committees-Councils-Sections/solgbt/Pages/home.aspx), with some 60,000 members.

Of course, all this doesn't stop blind bigotry in /r/uncensorednews. Example:

&gt; [This is so incomprehensibly fucking stupid it gives me a nosebleed just thinking about it. **A six year old wants to wear a dress so we're going to let him identify as a girl**. I wanted to be a fucking ninja turtle when I was six, so maybe my parents should've tattooed my skin green and surgically implanted a shell on my back. Society has truly gone full retard. Thank God Hillary lost.](https://np.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/5kfpkq/pediatricians_condemn_national_geographic_over/dbnmp6u/)

If you try *really hard* you can almost make it seem that simple.

From what I can gather in the comments, these people think that kids are too young to know about this stuff, and that their biological sex should be assumed until they are old enough to ""know better."" That makes it seem like a choice, of course, to feel a certain way about your gender, which we all know it's not ([scientific source](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/)).

It literally took me thirty seconds from clicking on the article to Googling the American College of Pediatricians to know that the whole thing was bunk. The article doesn't say anything of value, by the way: read it yourself. It's just ""person from fancy sounding organization said this isn't good.""

TL;DR: People like being willfully ignorant of how shitty their arguments are if it helps them rest easy in being an asshole."

[deleted],asktransgender,I had FFS with Dr. Deschamps-Braly and Dr. Sara Wasserbauer ten days ago. AMAA.,"Hello, everyone!

Roughly ten days ago, I had facial feminization surgery with Dr. Deschamps-Braly in San Francisco. I also had hair transplants (using the hair that would've otherwise been wasted during my forehead reconstruction) by Dr. Sara Wasserbauer. I decided on Dr. Deschamps-Braly after much research and a consultation I had with Dr. Spiegel.

I had the following procedures performed:

* Forehead reconstruction
* Hairline lowering and brow lift
* Hair transplants
* Rhinoplasty
* Full-face fat grafting
* Sliding genioplasty
* Jaw tapering
* Upper lip lift

The total surgery time was upwards of 15 hours and spread over two days. They did a lot of work and they did it all very meticulously.

**I am the happiest I have ever been in my life.**

Despite it being so soon after my surgery, I already have _zero_ bruising, relatively little swelling, and look absolutely amazing by my own estimation and the estimation of friends and family. I was in no pain throughout the entire recovery and took only Tylenol and Motrin. They were very careful during intubation because I previously had voice feminization surgery at Yeson and I suffered zero complications.

When I went in for surgery, I saw a guy in the mirror and I was gendered male &gt;95% of the time in normal social interactions. Now, I am consistently gendered female by all strangers I've encountered in public after getting my nose cast off despite wearing gender-neutral clothes and zero makeup. 

Dr. Deschamps-Braly did an absolutely unbelievable job. He was aggressive with the work he did and I look _very_ different than I did before surgery—unrecognizable, almost. I wanted a major change and I got it.

In fact, in numerous areas, it feels like he almost read my mind. My cheeks in particular are _amazing_ despite me giving essentially no guidance whatsoever. The only part I really had any input on at all was the nose and he did exactly what I wanted there too.

Finally, I absolutely must say that he was incredibly sweet, supportive, and comforting throughout the entire process. He has the best bedside manner of any medical professional I've ever dealt with and I've dealt with a lot. His staff is similarly wonderful as well and have been very prompt with all communication.

I know it sucks, but I am not willing to share photos at this time because I value my privacy. If you have any other questions though, please feel free to ask!

Confused1999,asktransgender,Being Trans is making me depressed,"Hi everyone,

I have over the last year discovered that i'm Trans (i'm not 100% sure but i'm leaning towards FTM) I had trouble accepting it, not because I had a problem with transgender people but because it seemed so strange the thought that I was one of them I still have doubts and lots of reservations but I cant deny that I so badly want to be a guy in all parts of my life, so much so that its making me depressed. 

I want to physically be a guy be seen as a guy, I want my hips to leave, I want my fat to not go to my hips and boobs, I want top surgery, I want to have a male sex role, I want to be in a relationship as a guy, I want my face to be less round and more angular. But I know that I will never actually be biologically male no matter how much I want it or try to change it and that its going to make everything in my life harder, like getting a job or having relationships etc. I don't want to be like this I just want it to go away but at the same time if I stopped feeling like this and was happy being a girl I feel as if I would be disappointed as I want to be a guy. Im 17 I feel like i'm waisting the best years of my life the ones where I can experience things that teenagers experience and I want to experience them as a guy but I cant, I already feel like i waisted most of my childhood being a girl and i wish i could go back and do it again as a boy, I wish i figured it out sooner &amp; I don't want to waist the rest of it. I probably wont be able to get surgery or go on hormones etc. for many years to come. I just feel like what I want will never happen and that my desire is unattainable I feel like Im wishing for something that will never happen and Its extremely depressing I feel stuck. All of this and other things in my life (such as my dad not getting &amp; understanding and stopping me transitioning socially at school and home because he thinks i'm wrong) are really dragging down my mood and making me even more cynical, bitter and negative than I already was, the fact that I have diagnosed depression and anxiety disorders and multiple chronic physical disorders and issues doesn't help.

Sorry for the rant I needed to vent I just feel like my life and future are not really going anywhere and that i'm going to be disappointed

gender_question,asktransgender,(23/AMAB-questioning) Not sure how to move forward with gender confusion,"Hey everyone~!

I've been lurking this subreddit for awhile and I gotta love the support ive seen so far. I feel comfortable enough after reading threads to ask something myself. 

So I would say for the past 6-7 years, I've had mild-moderate feelings that internally I might be a girl.  They've ranged from feeling alienated from my male peers to a desire to cross-dress. The feeling isnt consistent - it largely comes out at, unfortunately, inopportune moments (Ex. being drunk as social events, winter time, occasional glances in the mirror) Some examples being that at my sister's bachelorette party, I wore the tiara and played as a ""joke"" that I was the prettiest girl there. This has come out on multiple occasions under the influence at party events and no one seems to be the wiser cause I play it for laughs.

I have concurrent anxiety and depression symptoms, which make me question basically every significant decision in my life and im highly unsure about myself in general. I am wondering what the next steps for me might be. I live with my parents right now and presenting full time is probably not an option. I've shared my feelings with absolutely no one. I have taken small steps like shaving my legs in the non-summer months and painting my nails in covert and they provide positive feelings most of the time. There is a part of me that is a little afraid of the permanence that comes with HRT and SRS, but that mostly comes from a position of not 100% passing than from the idea of transitioning itself. The changing of name or legal documents seems like a scary proposition.

Sorry for the word vomit but i Am at a loss as to where to move forward. How do I get to a point where I can say - yes I am female? I can provide more information or context if it would help.

verasgunn,asktransgender,I'm afraid that I'm just looking at being a woman that life is greener on the other side. Am I right or am I being ridiculous.,"I'm 28, and a couple of years ago something with a friend made me think of something that had never crossed my mind before, that I might be Transgender. 

I've never been super masculine, I know this and accept it, it's a part of me, but more than that, I've for a long time found myself fantasizing about being a woman, more than that, being a mother. I have long found myself drawn towards stories(admittedly this is often porn) where a character will be transformed from a man to a woman, or just get a little wistful when it happens naturally in the course of a story when I wasn't expecting. I don't feel like I was born in the wrong body, but when I think of myself as a man I just don't really feel much about it, and yet when I think of being a woman I find myself frustrated and upset, because I know that I'll never experience exactly what it is to be a woman. 

But my problem is that when I think of all of this, my desires and frustrations, that I'm romanticising something. I fear when I think of these fantasies of being a woman I am doing so while really just being a man deep down. I know on an intellectual level that being a man has certain societal benefits, and that being openly Transgender would be a challenge and while some of that worries me, I'm more terrified that this realization is something that I've come to from the wrong position. 

I have known a few Transgender people, including a friend online that I've met outside the scope of this idea, and we've talked about it to some degree. She's been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and at times she's mentioned how far reaching it goes, about things from when she was a child or that she had suspected it when she was a teenager and it makes me feel like a fraud. I've never been one to crossdress, most of my hobbies and interests now and from when I was younger are more commonly things a man enjoys. She'll mention how she used to pretend to be pregnant by hiding pillows under her clothes when she was little and I... once had a Polly Pocket as a toy. 

I don't feel like a woman, I don't hate being a man, I don't think I was born in the wrong body, and yet I wish that I was born a woman, and I'm afraid I only feel that way because I... I'm not entirely sure why,, but still, there's something about it that makes me feel like I'm convincing myself I'm something I'm not. I don't know what it is and it's really frustrating and depressing and I honestly don't know where to turn for answers."
dnalbes,asktransgender,NYC trans social groups?,"I just moved to New York. (My apologies to those of you who are thinking ""I know, you've asked me things repeatedly already."") Are there any trans groups that aren't support groups or aren't transition-focused?

To be honest, I transitioned long enough ago that my experiences are becoming increasingly less useful to people transitioning now (especially since I didn't transition here), so it's not so clear that I fit in a lot of support groups.\* However, I find life is generally enhanced by knowing other trans people, so I'm hoping to find some sort of social group/event/whatever. I actually don't really care if it's trans-specific--a general queer thing with a good trans contingent would work too. Bonus points if you know of a group that actually has non-binary people and people of color showing up regularly. (If there's nothing that can get people of multiple genders to attend regularly, transmasculine groups, please. But maybe mention transfeminine-dominated groups for other people's reference.) 

\*I really don't want to be that guy who transitioned five or ten years ago who shows up and thinks he knows everything there is to know about being trans and is gracing us with his presence when, in reality, he's just a jerk and not helpful."

pinkchips,asktransgender,"I hate that virtue only seems to matter if you're cis. Once people in your life find out you're trans, nothing else seems to matter - they see you as either a freak or an amusement.","I spent a lot of years living the best life I could, giving as freely of my love and time as I could, knowing that the day would come when I would have to come out of the closet.  
  
I gave freely of my money to make people's lives better.  I gave freely of my time to build people up.  I lived the kind life others would be proud of, hoping that some of that goodwill would transfer over post-outting and post-transition.  
  
But from those most closest to you to those you are only acquainted with, it seems to not make any difference.  ��  
  
No matter how friendly you were or how generous you were... or what you have accomplished in the closet, nothing seems to matter once they learn you're trans - except the fact that you're trans.  
  
It would be wrong to say that everyone treats you as a hated freak.  Some do, but still another large percentage do something far more insidious: they claim to 'accept you'... but regard you as more of a circus amusement than an actual human being.  
  
Those who actually accept you and still treat you as a valid person (deserving of the same love and praise as you had before)?  A rare and tiny minority.  ��    
  
I almost feel like it was a waste of time to ever be generous or kind prior to beginning transition, like, there seems to be zero correlation in people's minds to the things you've done (and done for them) pre- and post- coming out as trans.  As if being trans suddenly makes you such a horrible thing that you need to be treated with pity or scorn constantly.  And everyone is always so selfish, thinking only of how this affects them.  
  
""*Sure this is easy for you!  You get to be who you want to be.  But you're not even considering how hard this is on me.  You don't even care how hard this is on me.*""  &lt;-  actually said to me.  ��  Are you kidding me?  This is so easy for me?  Just go to the fairy's lake and make a wish, right?  So easy!  
  
I'm just feeling so defeated.  I'm not saying I don't have anyone supportive and truly accepting in my life.... I do.  At least I think I do.  But the majority of people fall into one of the first two categories.  
  
To them I am no longer a person.  I am a thing, to be either hated or amused by.  And people think that someone would just *choose* this, that they would choose giving up 'personhood' status in the eyes of most of society.

So inline with doing most other things private, what are my options in the UK for an orchidectomy, I'd rather not get it done outside the Uk.

Thanks

doughaway7562,asktransgender,"My psychologist said something really insightful today on my anxiety and transition, and I wanted to share it.","I was speaking to my psychologist about my anxiety and transition. We've made a lot of progress so far, and had a couple of breakthroughs lately. It's paraphrased heavily here.

Me: And it's been great. I've felt dysphoria - but last time, I did something different. I was able to tell myself, ""get up, look in the mirror, you're fine"", and when I did look in the mirror, I felt so happy - I was *cute*! 

Her: And how do you feel about their happiness?

Me: I'm just enjoying it, I guess

Her: That's great! That's a lot of progress on your anxiety. I was afraid you'd overanalyze it again, and find a negative perspective on it.

Me: Yeah. I feel like, with all the conflicts with my parents, and my ""friends"", I realized that even my real friends can't be there for me all the time, so I wanted to teach myself to rely on myself. So, I feel strong enough to say with conviction, it's not selfish to want things or get what I need, it's not selfish to be happy, that I deserve to be happy. That I can take pride that I'm transgender.

Her: One's parents are usually a reflection for their children. It's a shame that your parents refuse to be there for you, but you seem to now have your own ability to reflect for yourself in a positive way. 

Me: Actually... I know it's weird, but I've actually had times lately where I've looked in the mirror, and said encouraging things to myself. I started doing it because you told me that I have an amazing capacity to find the good in others, but not myself. 

Her: Now, I wonder why you weren't able to do this before? Where did this ability come from?

Me: I... don't know. It's weird. I used to mostly cry in front of the mirror.

Her: I wonder if - ***that you have the ability to reassure yourself now, because your reflection now better represents you.***

Me: [MIND BLOWN] (I literary wided my eyes and went like ""AHHHHHH"" when I realized how much sense it made)

Mind you, for the vast majority of life, I've went around completely unable to take action until I feel like I have the approval of others, and had a crippling fear of the unknown - I felt anxious ALL THE TIME. I never thought that transition would be such a key element in fixing my anxiety. 

TL;DR, Transition gave me the ability to love and care for myself, so that I could be strong for myself."
Shenandooooooooaah,asktransgender,What would colleges think about my letters of recommendation being from teachers who don't know that I'm trans.,"Quick question. I'm a senior in high school that just has a few more college applications left. Some of the schools I'm applying to are fairly selective, and have asked for letters of recommendation. I've disclosed my gender identity and wrote some essays about being transgender on the applications, but I am not currently out to any of my teachers. 

Would it reflect badly on me if my recommenders don't know this about me? (i.e. they wouldn't be qualified to recommend me if they don't know basic info about me, or I'm ""hiding"" information and therefore wouldn't be a good fit?"")

torienby,asktransgender,"Honestly, my family makes it hard.","So I had to go to a pre-Christmas Christmas dinner this evening with most of my family. I spent the entire night getting misgendered and my grandmother came over to me drunk and spent 20 minutes basically making me feel guilty for being trans.

My mood stabilisers are great, but they don't fix stuff like that. My friends aren't responding to me again too, not that it matters. I'm upset about one friend, I feel ridiculously guilty over getting his hopes up about something. I've annoyed another friend somehow and the only other one I trust is (understandably) spending all her girlfriend who she can only see for a couple more weeks so she's not speaking to me.

Honestly, if I had my valium with me tonight, I would've hidden myself away, taken a handful and hoped for oblivion haha. I guess that I still have bad days. I've got to do this all over again on Saturday and Sunday. I don't know that I can."
SealTeamSith,asktransgender,Is this all that life has to offer?,"I’m at the point where I don’t really know what to do anymore. I increasingly find myself withdrawing from a world that I’ve never really felt that I’ve belonged in to begin with. I’m depressed; I can easily recognize that. Finding motivation to do anything anymore is a bit hard. I’ve generally got no family that really cares about me and I think that the place where I’m currently staying is a welcome wearing thin like everywhere else I’ve ever been. I’ll probably be homeless within the next few weeks if a job interview on Monday doesn’t go well. Like I said, I just generally don’t know what to do anymore. I’m transgender and that doesn’t help things either. I started hormones in March and have been off them for the last 2 weeks because I’m now unemployed, have no insurance, and couldn’t afford them if I wanted to. That alone makes me feel like a failure because now I’m not even becoming the person that I want to be. This job interview on Monday scares the shit out of me and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should go as male or female me. If I went as male me, I wouldn’t be able to afford new clothes to begin with. If I went as female me then I may never get the job because such is life. I’m tired of being scared of people. That’s all that life has ever been for me. My parents beat me and forced me in a closet until they ran me off the property as a teenager, I lived under the rules of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell in the Coast Guard for 9 years, etc. I’ve just never felt like I’ve ever belonged anywhere. I generally don’t trust anyone anymore. A majority of the people I’ve even associated with just want to sleep with me. I have very few friends to talk to and there aren’t that many options for getting help that won’t just treat me like I’m crazy. I’ve tried to register for school, but lo and behold my military records can’t even be found so I can’t get a DD-214 to even be able to claim any of my benefits. I’m stuck in rural Texas with generally nowhere to go and I feel in the back of my head that the end is creeping up on me. I can’t even find anyone to help because I have nothing to prove that I’m a vet and can’t afford any other routes anyway. If I talk to anyone about the depression and that I’ve cried myself to sleep for about a month now from thinking about just ending it all then I’ll just be locked away somewhere and then still have to foot a bill for that, which I can’t afford either. My credit has been ruined and I barely have fifty bucks to my name. Literally, I have nothing left. I just don’t know what to do and I’m scaring myself. A lot. And I’m lonely. I’m tired of trying to even survive anymore. I'm at the end and I need help. Even general direction. I just have no idea what I'm doing or what to even do anymore and being stuck in my head isn't helping."
CharmFlicks,asktransgender,Just wanted some thought-out feedback on what you folks make of my situation &lt;3,"Hello. This is a throwaway account, I lurk here a lot though. I'm going to post in quotes a journal entry of sorts, where I try to ramble but include all the information I can.

I GREATLY appreciate any feedback or thoughts and I am very thankful in advance for anybody that really reads all of it because it's nearly 3 pages typed.... &lt;3 &lt;3

**I'm trying to work on the formatting**

""This document is my attempt to consolidate or collect all my thoughts about gender and being transgender (or not) into one place, to explain myself as well as I am able to. I started openly really questioning my gender identity in early 2015, I place this at about March/April of 2015. I’m able to pinpoint it pretty precisely because April 2015 was when Caitlyn Jenner came out and announced that she was transgender. (I worry that I’ve potentially been swept up into this identity crisis based on the surge in transgender people in the media and it becoming a more spoken about topic, with Caitlyn Jenner, Laverne Cox, etc.) 


I remember shortly before I began to really think about my gender (think within a couple months of Caitlyn Jenner coming out, so end of 2014/beginning of 2015) I ordered a few makeup products in the mail that I kept in a box in my dresser that I thought I would miraculously be able to do drag-like makeup just like all my favorite drag queens on RuPaul’s Drag Race (I’ve about decided that my gender crisis isn’t solved by “well I guess I want to be a drag queen”, I feel it’s more of a true identity crisis.) This precursor didn’t last long, but I feel it’s not without worth to mention.


With the release of the Vanity Fair that featured Caitlyn Jenner and her big interview/story I found myself starting my consumption of all transgender media, books, anything I could get ahold of. I watched so many YouTube videos (as YouTube is a major pastime of mine, I go there for everything) of transitions, I’ve subscribed to many YouTubers; MtF, FtM, and people all along the gender spectrum. I found myself envious of the trans women I was following. I wanted their experience of transitioning, I was jealous of their femininity, their gender expression, basically I found myself wanting to be them or to be like them. 


I didn’t stop at just watching YouTube videos. I’ve consistently watched any movie, documentary, or TV series starring a trans person or having to do with  trans people. I have over a dozen books written by or about trans people, of which I’ve read most of them (one that I feel the most connection with is Redefining Realness by Janet Mock). On paper this all sounds like some obsession but in my day to day life I just feel some connection or draw to being trans that I find difficult to explain.


Early this year (2016) I believe, Wesley and I almost broke up. I was completely to blame, and I almost lost him. I had been posting to Reddit, to r/asktransgender and r/MtF mainly. Putting my thoughts out there, reaching out to get some sense from the communities there if I were trans or if I were not. I also liked reading other people’s posts about their transitions and seeing their timelines and how they had changed physically. I also made a post to a reddit called r/askgaybros about my doubts in my relationship with Wesley (completely unrelated to my gender 
thoughts) during a week between jobs where I had too much time on my hands and thought a lot of stupid things.


Wes had seen me on reddit one day and decided to investigate. And so he had been seeing all (or at least some) of the posts I was making on the transgender reddit, and he had seen my other post about wanting to break up with him and wanting to be with other people. And so we broke up, for less than twenty four hours and I realized how much I needed him and how wrong I was, and we reconciled and have gotten back to a place where our relationship is healthy. At the time I told him I had been questioning my gender but had decided that wasn’t me and dismissed any notions of being transgender, so we moved on and I tried to.

Sure enough though I’ve gone through these periods of time where I feel that I could be trans and I think about it every single day, almost constantly. And other times I don’t feel that way, or I push it out of my mind and think I’ve finally kicked the habit for good, sometimes I even try to be overly masculine which isn’t me to compensate. I just end up confused, all the time. I feel as though I’m caught up in a hurricane of thoughts and confusion.
	

I like wearing makeup, I love the artistry, I love the way it can make me look and I love the idea of being able to do a full face of makeup like I watch a lot of YouTubers do on their channels. I like wearing nail polish, something about it just feels empowering. When I still worked at MedVet and when I had started accumulating a horde of makeup I would nearly every morning wear lipstick on my drive to work but have to rub it off before going in. I did this so often because I liked wearing it and I liked the way it looked, but I couldn’t handle the judgment of society. (I wonder sometimes how I would present or feel if I were free of the judgment of others or if I didn’t have the weight of societal norms and gender roles to deal with. This thinking is often unproductive because that isn’t a situation I will ever find myself in.) I remember wearing nail polish to work only once or twice, I had gathered the courage to do it. The first time someone made a comment, not a particularly negative comment, but just having it pointed out made me feel bad about it. The second time was during a high peak of my self-esteem and so I tried again, this time it was a rather nude shade so as to not be noticed very easily, and I remember wearing long sleeves that day to try to conceal it. I also remember wearing really poorly done and obvious foundation to work at MedVet sometimes, I was naive to think being ghost white and powdery wouldn’t be super obvious or look insane.
Currently I wear nail polish openly, though I do sometimes feel self-conscious of it when I’m dealing with a clerk at a store or if certain people at work have an opportunity to notice it (managers that I don’t have a day-to-day interaction with.) I still like wearing makeup, though I get frustrated at not being better at it, but I only do it rarely (on nights I’m home alone or sometimes I wear lipstick in the shower if I know Wes is busy.) Also worth mentioning that I just remembered, I have two wigs. Two wigs of rather long hair that I bought, or at least I told myself I bought because I wanted to do drag-ish looks and post them to instagram. What I’ve actually found myself doing with them the couple of times I’ve put them on it doing up my makeup, putting a wig on, and trying to take photos that I can believe are “pretty” or aesthetically pleasing. (At this point this is all feeling too real, and I’m starting to see there may be something “real” going on with me.) 


Some other similar things worth mentioning. I own a few clothing items from female clothing stores (things like button shirt/jackets, flowy shroud-ish things, that kind of thing), I don’t own any heels but I’d wear them afforded to opportunity. I’d like to grow my hair out, as having long hair is appealing to me.
	

On the subject of having dysphoria, I’m not entirely sure if I do. I don’t find myself in weeping fits about my genitals or anything that severe. During times where I am really, really am thinking I am transgender I tend to not look at my genitals and sometimes during sex I will imagine being penetrated as a woman would be. I sometimes fantasize about being a woman, not particularly in a sexual manner or anything, but just living as a woman, presenting as female, etc, etc. There’s a character in Hurricane Bianca that is a Southern transwoman and she has this big plantation-style house and wears feminine clothing and is rather gorgeous, and I was really envious of her watching that movie.
	

I take issue or feel uncomfortable being gendered with certain male terms. I don’t like being called the “father” of my pets as people sometimes will do, I’ve even gone as far as to call myself their mother or a gender neutral term such as “parent.” When I speak about my genitals I usually don’t say my penis or any other synonyms for male genitalia, I will often just say “genitals” when I talk about that area of my body. 
	

Something that resonated with me was reading something I think Jennifer Boylan wrote “My sense of having a woman’s spirit has almost never left me”, I bookmarked that in her book because it struck me and was something I just wanted to remember, to go back on. 
	

When it comes to thinking about transitioning, my biggest concerns are losing Wesley, being an ugly woman, and having regrets once changes have occurred that can’t be reversed. A concern of mine in this regard is shrinking my penis, as being on HRT would do. I wouldn’t want to transition to female and be a woman with a penis at all, but I also don’t want to shrink my penis if I don’t transition or stop transitioning, and I also don’t want to be 100% certain of transitioning but have a shrunken penis (I’d rather have a vagina then.) Basically if I live as male I want a penis, that is not shrunken. And if I live as a transwoman I want a vagina, no penis at all, shrunken or not. 
	

Growing up I was always drawn towards more playing with dolls and being allowed to have Barbies was a big thing for me, but I remember even then having a sense of shame about it, imparted by my father. And so I knew it was “wrong” to want those things at the time, and I would later try to play with dolls in secret even after my family thought I was over them and they lived in box in the spare bedroom until my grandmother gave them away. I remember from a young age standing in front of the bathroom mirror with my penis tucked between my legs. I remember having my towel wrapped around my chest as if I were a woman whose breasts needed to be concealed. I remember doing these things very well. I remember wearing light sheets or blankets around my body around the house. They would flow out behind me when I walked and had some poor sense of elegance to them. I would put sheets or towels around my head as if I had long hair like women so often have.
	

I remember one time in high school putting on heeled boots at Walmart with two female friends of mine and really enjoying being able to wear them, more than I think cisgender men do. 
	

I have always played female characters in videogames and identified with them, something I’ve read transwomen do, though I guess it’s something even effeminate gay men do though too. There are a lot of gay men that idolize Wonder Woman after all. 


12.13.16 Thinking Again
As often is the case when I find myself actively thinking about my gender identity I waiver back and forth and can’t seem to stop thinking about it. I tend to go between transwoman and genderqueer (or any variety of terms that seem to mean similar things.) What I notice about my internal reactions to these two identities are that I’m much more at ease when I say to myself “I am genderqueer” than “I think I am transgender.” I wonder if I find myself reacting this way because genderqueer is truly closer to who I am and so I’m more comfortable with it, or if I’m only less uneasy about it because identifying as genderqueer doesn’t come with the same downfalls that I can see identifying as transgender coming with (irreversible medical transition, potentially losing my relationship with Wesley, all the trials and tribulations of being a transgender person in society, physical changes from hormones [genitals, breast development], plus the fact that there’s a lot more “work” to do in being recognized as a woman than genderqueer [or “that guy that dresses a little odd and wears nail polish, etc].)


Being genderqueer and just expressing myself in X, Y, or Z way is an “easier” route than realizing I am transgender and the obstacles that inherently comes with. Also worth mentioning, I worry that identifying as non-binary, genderqueer, genderfluid, etc. are going to be transitional phases, with an identity as transgender being the inevitable result.

klop201,asktransgender,"Does anyone know any Scholarly or Peer Reviewed articles about being transgender or have you used any articles to ""prove"" to someone this is real","I searched but didn't really find what I was looking for. I am planning on informing my parents sometime after the holiday and I will probably be doing it by letter (I know it's cowardly but I don't think it's going to go well). They are very conservative and are going to say this is a ""choice"". They are also fairly intelligent people so I was hoping if I could provide them with some science behind it they would be at least willing to read it. 

I don't have much faith that they will won't disown me but at least I can say I put all the effort I could into it.

I have been searching Google Scholar and will continue to do so but I thought it would be nice if there was a thread that had multiple articles for others to reference as well. If I find anything helpful I will post here as well.

They don't have to be peer reviewed but if anyone has anything that they have previously used to ""prove"" to someone and would like to share I would appreciate it :-)"

lemon_heart,asktransgender,Estradiol Valerate injection plasma concentration curve?,Hello. I have a DIY question.

I have no other options than to DIY so feel free to give any tips you want.
debraMckenz,asktransgender,FFS - Deschamps-Braly: 1 month post-op update,"Scar: Still pretty red/pink but after seeing my hair lady last week, we seem to be able to hide it pretty well by simply moving the hair more to the front and side sweeping some bangs. Any other parts of it I may try to use concealer. Still using scar cream on it 2x a day and unfortunately that tends to grease up my bangs/roots.


Bumpiness under the scar (forehead): These have come down a LOT in the last week and oddly enough, simply wearing beanies and headbands over it has seemed to help the bumps come down. I also had a gf who had FFS years ago tell me that massaging is supposed to be good for that ....I asked the doc about that at ~ 2 weeks post-op and they dont recommend for or against it. Not sure what to make of that. The bumps still feel kinda hard themselves.


Nose: As stated in an earlier post, the slope of the bridge of the nose is really cool, cute even...I've noticed it at certain angles in pictures. But the tip / nostrils area is still quite big looking in comparison. Also the width of the bridge is still widening out to my eyes . Doc has me taping the bridge of the nose at night for now.


Eye trouble: My right eye has been kinda acting up a bit since the surgery. Because of the swelling and really bad bruising under that eye, I have to assume it may have taken some damage possibly too. I tend to find that eye dries out very easily and have had to use eyedrops a lot. Someone asked recently if I had a cross eye/ lazy eye issue and I was surprised but after looking at some newer pics I'm starting to notice some of what they mean. Hoping that will heal with time too and really hoping my vision hasn't gotten worse ...esp since that's my good eye....with a prescription of -7.


Overall swelling: The swelling that still seems to be an issue is really all around my eyes. So the eyebrow / orbital rim area is still kinda swelling down a bit and the cheeks are swelling up a bit. It ends up making my eyes look a bit too small for my face and kinda like I'm having an allergic reaction to something....especially when I smile. The doc office claims within 3 months most of that swelling will go away. Here's hoping...2 more months of this, oh joy.


Hair regrowth: In the scar line in front (and in the scar line behind all the hair) I can see little tiny hairs regrowing, yay! That'll take forever lol. Thankfully it's not too noticable unless I pull my hair back.


I go back to work on Monday. I'm glad I took a full month off but I'm still going to end up looking like I had surgery. So I guess it's good I had kinda told a few people I was getting my nose done. I dress pretty nice at work so I'm going to try to do my hair up good and go in dressing like I usually do....but then the rest of the week maybe go casual with a beanie. Until these bumps and the scar is easier to hide, it's going to be tough."
KaySOS,asktransgender,Breast shrinkage after switching to IM EV,"Hi,

I was having significant breast growth on 12 mg Estrace daily but did not feel well and my skin was very dry so I switched to IM EV 20 mg / 5 days hoping things would be better. And indeed, I felt better, skin was softer/smoother BUT my breasts shrank and are no more. Can someone explain why breast development is worse despite much higher levels of estradiol on injections? Are levels not steady enough and dropping too fast? From day 3 to day 5, levels went from 2,500 pg/ml to 1,300 pg/ml.

Genocide_Bingo,asktransgender,"My parents feel like they've failed before I've even told them, help!","So i just asked them to organise a doctors appointment because I'm 16 and can't organize one myself right now due to how my specific center works. I told them it was for 'mental health' but refused to elaborate further for reasons I'll list below. They've got me one but my dad feels like he's failed because ""I can't confide in him"" and my mom feels like ""I've let you down"". It hurt to hear that but right now I can't tell them because I want a doctor to confirm it :/ What should I do?

Reasons for not telling:

* My mom isn't exactly....sane. She's a lovely person but she's emotionally abusive without realizing and generally just the last person on earth you want to tell something. She failed school and so only has a very loose grip on anything remotely medical. She isn't very good with coping and she's on a cocktail of medications which make her very prone to ""emotional outbursts"" and ""irrationality"" (great side effects!). I don't think she could cope right now. She laughs about trans people a lot, though I don't think she laughs *at* them if you understand that. She's proud of having one boy and one girl but losing her son would be a very strong emotional punch :(

* My dad is very right wing and openly denies mental health exists. I've argues with him dozens of times and he refuses to believe it even though my mom has depression. He openly mocks trans people and men who behave too 'girly', even if they're gay. My dad takes pride in me being like he is, losing his son would also feel like being punched in the face to him. I feel like he'd just outright disown me or grow apart really quickly if I told him. I don't want to lose him :(

I'm going to see what the doc says, hopefully I get sent to a therapist/psychologist and get a proper confirmation before I choose to do anything but I'm sure I'm trans at this point. Too much of it makes sense to simply be a coincidence. I'm terrified that I just fucked the family over for Christmas but everything was boiling over in my head really, really badly and I *need* to speak to someone before I finally collapse under the massive pressure that's building. I've dealt 3 years with depression and anxiety but this is on a whole 'nother level."
Shockingpink13,asktransgender,I'm Going to Meet My Friend While Wearing A Dress For the First Time,"Pre-hormones

So, this Wednesday, I will meet my friend for breakfast.  The thing is that I will be wearing a dress.  I told him beforehand so as not to catch him off guard.  I gave him a text explaining how much better women's clothes make me feel and how, as his friend, I need to be who I am, myself.

He said that it was completely fine.  I just feel extremely nervous and uneasy about the whole thing.  While I have gone out in public a few times as a girl, I have never actually talked to anyone.  I'm not sure what to expect of the conversation, or if he will feel uncomfortable.  I'm worried that he will feel subconscious about what other people are thinking while we are talking (although, I would be disappointed in him as a friend if he was).  

What are you all's thoughts on this?

PathToHappy,asktransgender,When is a good time to come out at work?,"Hi everyone, today I'm officially at 8 weeks on HRT and just started a new job. Well the job I have had for years but I just moved to a new location and not sure when I should bring it up if at all. 

I work in cosmetics so I've always come in with full face of makeup and that is no issue at all. I'm more so concerned about when wearing boy clothes is no longer really an option as my body changes more. 

I'm taking my transition as it comes so I still present male aside from my nails and makeup that I've always worn since high school. So I by no means am planning to go in tomorrow in a dress and heels but just wanted to get some onions from others. 

My plan at the moment is just kind of go with the flow and not mention it unless it gets brought up. "
Outstandder,asktransgender,Can gynecomastia help breast growth?,"Into my early teenage years I developed a decent bit of growth in my chest to the point where I could easily fill an A cup or small B. This was all before I realized I was transgender and I've only now been on hormones for a month. I haven't seen any real growth in the last month (even though I daily check for tenderness and breast buds) and I know this is normal but I'm wondering if gynecomastia will make by breasts larger as they grow than they would otherwise? Or is this basically all I get?

As an extra question, could gynecomastia mess up my ability to find and feel breast buds? I don't think it would but I'm interested if there's anything on that."

stardropTabletop,asktransgender,Should I have my doctor amend my gender marker change letter?,"I just got a letter from my doctor that I'm supposed to use to change the gender marker on my social security and passport. Thing is, he did a couple of things in this letter that I wasn't expecting him to do.

First, he misspelled my name as ""Naiomi,"" which is strange because he's known me for several months now, but since I'm not actually using this letter to change my name, I'm assuming that's alright...?

Second, he mentioned that I identify as genderqueer. Now, he also followed that up with stating that I am ""transitioning from male to female,"" and he uses female pronouns for me throughout the letter (which is totally fine and felt really great), but is that going to be enough to convince whoever sees the letter that my gender marker should be changed from M to F? Or are they going to see the word ""genderqueer"" and immediately try to shut me down?

I don't know what to do. It took me about a month and a half to get this letter from my doctor, and I don't know if it's worth my time to ask him about changing the ""genderqueer"" part to just saying that I'm female. There's also the fact that I've lately been feeling that I may actually be some flavor of non-binary, and ""genderqueer"" seems to fit pretty nicely at the moment, so I might also feel a bit strange about having that changed.

But if my doctor identifying me as genderqueer in this letter is definitely going to hamper my progress, should I try to explain that to him and get a new letter?"

Unplugged_Fridge,asktransgender,How do I get my mom to come to terms?,"It took me quite a while to come to terms with being transgender having grown up in a conservative Christian household with a homophobic older brother and being very social anxious. When I started to come into my own as a person I stopped running away from these scary thoughts because they suggested I might not be normal which was a big no no in my house. When I saw all the timelines and imagined being excepted as a women in the future it just brought me so much joy. It took my wishing I had been born a girl every night from a shameful thing to something I shouldn't feel bad about but instead embrace. I was all the happier for doing it and I am a girl but after working up the courage to talk to my mom we didn't really see eye to eye on things. ""You are so brace for telling me... but I think your friends are influencing you"", ""I know you and this isn't you"", ""You never showed signs"", ""you can't be transgender or whatever, you look like a man"", ""a girl does not help carry in the Christmas tree"", ""Why is this so important to you,"" and when her boyfriend jumped in ""She knows what's best for you"", ""You can't possibly know what she is going through"", ""You are being selfish, you are only 16."" That discussion ended with me being told to suffer in silence and that their will never be any surgery or medication (hrt) and that I should drop this for my own good. I've always been scared of disappointing her and maybe to offset my brother I've tried to be the good child or whatever but this was the one time I came to her looking for help and I just feel my feelings were ignored. I have a therapist and I have a support system of friends I just feel like I'm not making any progress to being happier if I can't feel comfortable in the sanctity of my own home and come closer to actually looking and feeling how I want to. I feel a lot of what she says comes from fear and many misconceptions she holds about transgender people but I'm scared to ask her to educate herself or offer resources because I've been turned down before when having offered websites. I don't know. I know this is me rambling but I YOU could offer any help whatsoever I'd be so appreciative. Even if that means being more vocal despite the consequences or something like that. I'm not confrontational but I long for positive change and I want to stop hating my reflection or feeling each day I'm getting manlier or being pressured into getting haircuts I don't want.

Today, I got a package in the mail from my dad, who hasn't spoken to me in months. Granted, it had my deadname on it, but the contents (perfume, lady's razors, bath bombs, etc) were all very intentionally femme.

TL;DR I'm an uneducated fool who needs enlightenment.




From what I understand a someone who identifies as non-binary is someone who doesn't identify as male or female. 



Genderfluid: From what I understand this is someone who kind of changes what they identify as frequently (ish?). Is this even non-binary? Was I even remotely close on my guessed definition? How does this even work (wrong words but not sure how else to put it) and what does it feel like, assuming I have the right general idea on it.



Otherkin: First I'm not even sure if that's the right word or something made up in mockery. Anyway, I've never really gotten a solid answer on what this is and how it works and frankly I'm really confused. I've heard it's a joke, I've heard it's made up, I've heard it's real, I've heard all of these from this very sub so I don't know what's true at all. So what exactly is it? Is it when someone identifies as something else (fuck, this sounds horribly wrong and I'm afraid I'm going to offend someone)? Like I've heard of people identifying as/with animals and things of that sort but what does that exactly entail? The whole thing is really confusing and I don't really know anything about it.


Fictionkin(?): This one is even more out there, from what I understand it's when people closely identify with a fictional character? This just, I'm not even really sure what to say. If someone could give me an explanation on this that'd be great. 


Agender: Not identifying as M or F and just kind of being, right? Is this non-binary or something else? Or am I horribly wrong again?



Anything I missed: I'm not sure if I missed anything but if I did please let me know about it, thanks!"
Throwawayhelp98765,asktransgender,[SERIOUS] My trans BFF is being sexually assaulted. What can I do?,"I'm not a regular user of Reddit but, atm, I'm looking for some help and, perhaps, a shoulder to cry on. 

My best friend is dating a man who is sexually assaulting her and has been for some time.

Some backstory about him: He's lived with her for the last 2 years.  He is unemployed and has never had a full-time job.  He's never gone to college. He's in his early 20's, to her early 40's.  He also has severe social anxiety (to the point where he can barely leave the house) and is semi-estranged from his family.  

Some backstory about her: She's full time.  Fully employed.  Fully supporting him.  Forced him into therapy.  Not attracted to him at all any more.  Not in love with him anymore.  Definitely not sexually attracted to him anymore.  They don't even sleep together anymore (he's in the bed...HER bed....she's on the couch). 

She's told me several times about how he will try and get her to have sex, to which she tells him no.  She's woken up to him trying to penetrate her and she has to repeatedly tell him to stop.  He's picked her up and brought her to the bedroom with the intention of having sex, while she's saying ""no.""  

Tonight, she told me that, the other night, she woke up to a severe pain in her anus.  She turned over and asked him what he was doing.  Turns out he had taken out one of her dildos and tried to penetrate her with it.  She's still in pain from it. 

None of this really seems to phase her.  As she says, ""it's more of an annoyance or nuisance than anything else."" I'm livid and I want to go beat the shit out of him.  When I told her how angry I was, she said ""this is why I didn't want to tell you.""  My response was ""You shouldn't be concerned with MY response.  You should be concerned with why YOU think this is acceptable behavior.""  She said that the only way she'd break up with him is if he actually hit her.  She doesn't consider this a form of physical abuse nor violent. 

I can't legally call the cops.  She has to do that.  But, since she doesn't feel anything wrong is happening (she doesn't consider any of this rape), there's nothing that can be done.  However, it's taking it's toll on both me, personally, and our friendship.  I don't want to hear anything about him nor do I want to know anything about what they do together.  And I desperately want to protect her. 

I love her dearly.  She's been my best friend for over a decade.  I'm just really scared that he will hurt her.  And I'm very upset that she thinks this is acceptable or what she deserves.  

Thoughts? :(

*So an update:*
I reached out to a mutual friend last night.  She knew of the ""dildo incident"" so I felt more comfortable talking to her about it.  She didn't, however, know how long this has been going on or about all the other incidents.  Her other close friends HATE him.  That i didn't know.  She always downplayed their feelings about him or it's possible she didn't know how strongly they felt.  The friend said that both she and the other girl in the backseat dropped their phones when she told them the story.  They both had similar reactions to me but more reserved and haven't brought it up since.  In the end, they agreed there's nothing they can do and she gets too defensive about him so they don't bring it up anymore. 

I spoke with her today and her birthday came up (it's in a couple weeks). She mentioned her birthday dinner, which I always go to.  This year, the boyfriend will be there so she just wrote me out of the plans which, quite frankly hurt a ton, especially after last night.  I flew off the handle and said ""I wonder if your mother would be happy knowing that she's having dinner with the man who's raping her daughter.""  She said ""no, she certainly wouldn't.""  And that was the end of it. 

I've been sick to my stomach over this.  Literally.  I've been in the bathroom 4 times over this in the last 24 hours. Part of me desperately doesn't want to lose her friendship but another part of me couldn't stand hearing about him or certainly ever seeing him. "
MLP_Rainbloom,asktransgender,Serious question for my gf and I about post op surgery,"First, I want to say that my girlfriend is a trans woman and thinking about getting an operation to get a vagina. She has worries about things going wrong, and if her vagina will be able to take my penis just fine. I'm wondering if there's anyone who is post-op who can talk about their experience.
Another question we have is if there was any problems having sex with your new vagina. Were you able to take a penis comfortably afterwards compared to anal?
I am not trying to be rude and don't know how to put it but if anyone can respond to shed some light, that would be appreciated. Thank you

edit: Another thing I was curious about was if anyone could share some experience of how a penis felt during anal compared to how it felt with a post op vagina. Preferably if you had the same one in both scenarios. Was it that much easier once you had your new vagina or was it still a painful beginning that turned into a pleasurable ending like anal is?"

transgirlthrowaway42,asktransgender,HR Success!,"To preface: I'm using a throwaway so I don't reveal anything about where I work or who I am since I occupy a very niche IT job in a western Kentucky hospital.

I'm fresh out of grad school and I live with my increasingly senile and diabetic grandmother to take care of her while paying down student debt. So I'm at a pretty vulnerable point -- significant amount of debt, short work history outside of academic settings, and I started HRT 33 days ago in a job that I've only occupied for most of this year. Between being in rural-ish Kentucky, wanting to assist my grandmother, and pretty much falling into an amazing job (responsibility wise, not pay or benefits wise) I didn't want to upset the applecart. I had told my boss and several co-workers two months ago when I knew that HRT was definitely in my near future and I got a pretty solid response from them. It was all new to them but they had struggled to fill my position for some time, they loved my work, and they liked me. My boss went to the HR director and several other higher ups (with my permission of course) to let them know. That process had taken about most of the past month so I wasn't terribly stressed out but still really sitting on tacks. I got tired of waiting, took the initiative, and sent an email this past Friday to the HR director outlining the big areas of discussions (outing myself to coworkers, bathrooms, insurance, etc.) and providing some HR resources from HRC, Lambda Legal, and the society for HR management. Same day I get a phone call asking me to come up and chat which was a little nerve wracking.

He and I had a nice half hour chat that went really well. He wanted to be notified and present at all major phases (gender presentation, etc.) of my social transition at work to indicate support from the CEO and himself. I wanted to approach my coworkers individually which he was fine with but told me if that wasn't going well then we could do a group thing with him there. His own words were that if a coworker didn't like it then they could find somewhere else to work but he thought most would be okay with what I was doing. Because of the support, I'm willing to stay an extra year or two then I expected and it's great because I'll be able to change all my documentation including my degrees while working here. I'm starting to tell people tomorrow and I couldn't be happier!

It's also worth noting that very few of my coworkers like/trust Trump, although even fewer liked/trusted Hillary so I suspect most of them went Johnson instead.

I also decided to get an epilator as a reward for my breasts beginning to hurt/grow in order to better destroy the sporadic patches of body hair that I have -- it's got nothing on electrolysis! The bad news: I got cocky with the epilator and it bit my nipple so that's been hurting even moreso all evening.

tl;dr: Trans girl in Western Kentucky has a fully supportive CEO, HR director, and boss -- didn't expect any of it. "
Blackbelt54,asktransgender,I'm exhausted.,"I'm tired of having PTSD, I'm tired of being trans, and I'm tired of living in this world. I'm tired of the Sisyphusian battle of of trying to get better.

AshWhoSmilesAtDeath,asktransgender,"If I need to lower my testosterone level more, is Finasteride actually going to do that?","So when I first went to the clinic I'm going to, the doctor I saw was attentive to my concerns, and she talked with me a bunch about what we were going to do and why, drug-wise. In the times since, I've been given another doctor, who hasn't been or done those things nearly as much. Not to put him down! But it has created the following bit of confusion for me that I'm hoping someone here might be able to clear up.

So on 100mg Spiro daily for three months, my testosterone level dropped from 421 lc/ms pre-HRT, to 237 lc/ms. As noted on my test results, the ""target""/average female range is 10-55 lc/ms. My current doctor noted on the results, ""Your testosterone level is down, but we can get it down further if you want. We could increase your spiro dose. Let me know.""

Now as a quick aside - the first doctor I saw had told me I'd be placed on Finasteride, due to my concerns over my hair. When I came back for my second visit to actually receive my prescription, my current doctor('s fellow - I didn't get to see my new doctor at this appointment) told me I could start Finasteride later after we saw what Spiro did to me. When I finally met my new doctor this past week, I inquired again, and he told me it's ""a testosterone blocker like Spiro that just targets one specific type of testosterone."" He told me he could put me on that if I wanted, but I was feeling a lot less dysphoric after three months on what I was receiving, so I decided I didn't want to monkey with things.

Now that I was being told I ""could"" (and seemingly from the numbers, that I should) lower my testosterone more, and being offered more Spiro, I asked if I could start Finasteride, and whether I should take a combination of Finasteride and more Spiro to lower my testosterone (along with a question about another test result I was concerned over). My doctor responded to my email a couple of days later by telling me that he'd called in a prescription for me to receive Finasteride (and to answer my concern about the other test). He *didn't* say if that would be effective in getting my testosterone level down to where I presumably want them, just that the prescription for Fin was called in. So I decided to try and find out for myself. It's hard to find any reliable-looking information on it, but I've read that Finasteride doesn't actually drop the level of testosterone in circulation? In fact, by preventing the conversion of testosterone to DHT, it's actually effectively raising the level of testosterone in your system?

Soooo now I'm worried that I'm making a mistake, and that I really should be taking more Spiro. But I'm worried that asking my doctor will just result in another non-answer and change in prescription in a few days. I'm starting this Finasteride tonight, and want to understand what's going to happen on it! So does anyone here know for sure how this works? Will Finasteride actually lower my testosterone level? Will it lower them much? Will it raise them, instead? Is it even that important to lower my t-level? On his note in the results, it sounds more like he's asking me what I think, and I don't even know what the numbers mean. Sorry for the wall of text; I'm just antsy about this."

violaceous_trogon,asktransgender,A thank you and a farewell,"I'm not a well known or well loved user here. I don't expect any of you to love me or tell me how it gets better or mourn my passing. I just wanted to give a thank you to this community and let my loved ones know why I did it.

I originally had a super long post here about stuff I desperately needed to get off my chest but I figure nobody gives a shit.

Fact is my transition has stagnated because I'm too busy from schoolwork, and staying the same for so long has made me so depressed and driven me so close to suicide that I'm no longer fit to do my schoolwork. I'm gonna be on academic probation next semester and there's no way I'm gonna get magically unfucked in the month long christmas break.

I'm such a fuckup and a failure on so many levels. Please don't tell me that I'm not. Telling me lies about how great or loved or brave or kind i am will not help me. I'm haunted by my past failures, my current failures, and those failures left to come. All I've ever done and will ever do is screw up.

I'm not fit to do work, I'm not fit to transition, I'm not fit to study. So what the fuck am I good for? If I keep going I'll fail, become a leech on my loved ones, and eventually kill myself. If I stop everything, institutionalize myself, and focus on transitioning, (which I desperately desperately want to do), I'll automatically fail out of school, bankrupt my family with medical bills, become a leech on them and eventually kill myself. If I try to kill myself and fail, I'll be hospitalized, possibly become seriously and permanently disabled, become a leech on my family, and either kill myself or live a long and miserable life tortured by my failure and inability to die.

My only option is suicide. It's the most selfish act I'll ever commit, and it fucking hurts to think about how much I'll hurt my loved ones, but at least I won't have to deal with that myself and live in shame. 

I am going to kill myself and I'm going to make absolutely sure it works. Chances are someone's gonna see this and send me a message or a caring comment. For a time it might seem like I'll live. I'll probably make more posts after this one. i might seem happy. I might not kill myself right now. But you cannot and will not stop what's coming. Not you, not me. Nobody. 

I'm indescribably grateful to all my inspiring trans siblings and loving allies on this subreddit. Though I doubt i truly know any of you I love you all the same. reddit's trans communities have been sparkling beacons in my blackest days.  /r/asktransgender has saved me before but that was back when I could still have been saved.

If anyone i know in real life is reading this after the fact, I've left detailed goodbyes to my friends and family and instructions on what to do with my posessions, how to conduct my funeral, what to do with my body (if it's found), etc. There's a note on my desk that will help you access it.

I love you all. I just wish I could have loved myself too.

Good night. Goodbye.

edit: i doubt anyone is reading this at this point. i'm not dead yet. i still have my suicide note, i still have my plan intact, i still want to die just as much, but i'm not dead and I think i'll unfortunately stay that way for a while."
Jassy2cute,asktransgender,When did you go full time?,I'm considering going full time right about now at 3 months in on HRT (MtF). I've been told I pass even before HRT so I was wondering when did you all start going full time? Before HRT? 3 Months after or more? What was your reasoning for choosing that time.
torienby,asktransgender,I'm having a very bad day.,"I woke up this morning feeling really manic. It's the first time in a while, I thought HRT had killed the manic episodes. I had to go to my counsellor's appointment this afternoon, but before that I had to help my sibling book an appointment to see that counsellor because they're questioning and very unhappy right now (which makes me very unhappy).

 I saw my counsellor, told him that not only wasn't my depression not getting better, I'd had to start anti-depressants and that my suicidal ideation had gotten to the point that my parents wanted me to be hospitalised. So, long story short, now I have to see a psychiatrist in a different city to get my possible bipolar disorder under control, plus I have to see a new doctor. I'm just so over this. I'm so tired, and I find it hard to get out of bed in the morning.

The last fun thing of the evening was when I went out to dinner and ran into my grandmother who gave me crap for not being in a good mood. My dysphoria's killing me and my depression is the worst it's ever been.

[deleted],asktransgender,Regrets over SRS.,"Good morning everyone. First of all, throwaway account for obvious privacy concerns and what not.

3 months ago I started this ""dream"" (nightmarish hell) that is SRS and it's recovery. Dilating is Hell, everything is sensitive or sore, my fucking leg movements are, while better than before, still pretty limited. I feel constant stinging and burning sensations pretty much around the clock in my crotch area.

This is probably the most suicidal I've ever been since before I actually transitioned. This ""vaginal canal"" (which is actually a fucking open wound) has given me nothing but grievances and Jesus fuck am I tired of it. I've actually been considering asking my surgeon whether or not it's possible to just close this pseudo-vaginal canal or just get rid of it all together. I wish somebody had told me even just a third of what hellride this was going to be.

But nobody didn't. And now I'm stuck with this nightmare. I'm pretty much considering just stopping dilation. ""The canal will shrink"" so fucking what? Maintaining it is pretty much keeping my whole fucking life prisoner of this thing. While I didn't like what I had before, at all, it still allowed me freedom. Sure there we're somethings I had to account for and have extra carefullness. For comparison this shit is like going from parole straight into solitary confinement.

So, I've lived in the U.S. (Virginia, specifically) for all of my life so far, but I'm going to Scotland in August for a couple years due to school and obviously I'm going to need a passport. I don't have one yet, and I'll need my birth certificate to get one. Thing is, that's the only thing I haven't gotten changed. I've gotten my name and gender all legally changed, from my drivers license to social security, so trying to get a passport with things with different names and genders on them might be problematic. I've been looking online to try and find out how to actually change my BC but anything trans specific says I need to have srs to get it changed? (Not to mention it's mostly all legal speak so it's kind of hard for me to understand). I've gotten everything else changed with my hrt letter from my doctor (been on hrt since February), can I change it with that? basically can anyone please ELI5 the process to change your BC in Virginia? 
Thanks!

scared2transition,asktransgender,why do I pass better as a woman when I am dressed as a man?,"this is a paradox, a crazy paradox. When I started my HRT and laser facial hair removal, I started getting ma'amed in boy clothes. I got a big head and I said ""wow! If I am being ma'amed in boy clothes, with no make up, no earrings, no female hairstyles, IMAGINE when I dress unambiguously as a female"". That couldn't be further from the truth. I know this sounds crazy, but when I wear boy clothes and no make up I pass more as a woman than when I wear make up and feminine clothes... and, no, I do not dress like a show girl or caricature.

tao-nui,asktransgender,"I've never been scared for my life in the street before, and I never thought my first bad encounter would be another transgender person","Hi there.

I can't believe it happened, I never thought my first bad experience with streets at night would have been so quick, and so unexpected.

I was going back home from a party organised by a member of my lgbt community for his 30's birthday. Great night, absolutely beautiful people, I'm happy that I went there. I was in a knee long green dress and black heels, with my makeup and a wig.

On the way back with my friend (Queer/agender adorable person), we passed by two transgender sex workers that were waiting for clients. I was so happy at that moment that I couldn't stop smiling for the image of all the persons that were there at the party. I smiled at those two women and thought ""Hey, we feel the same."". I was feeling proud of my gender and gave them that back with a simple smile.

But it's not what they saw I guess. As soon as we passed by one of them reached for my head and pulled my wig off my head, and threw it on the floor along with my cap. She looked at me straight in the eyes with anger in her eyes, and said something along ""Ha. Yeah, it's a wig"". I stood there, completely stupefied my what happened. I took my stuff and looked at them with a face that probably said something along ""What, the fuck?"". My friend grabbed my shoulder and we walked away. I heard a ""Cunt. There's no work for you here"". I got angry and scared and began to feel like I wasn't safe. Minutes later I heard a person following us and kicking leafs. My vision tunneled and I accelerated as much as I could. The person was getting closer as we were arriving at my gate, we passed it and almost ran to my door. We heard the person behind us saying ""Please? Hey! Please?"". He eventually went away as I couldn't find the keys of my apartment. Nothing else than that gate and a stair was separating us from each other, and at that moment I was terrified for my life.

I eventually found my keys and we went safe inside. I couldn't breathe really well and I felt powerless. I was in heels, with a dress, and I wasn't able to defend myself that way. It took me a good 10 minutes to calm down.

In the moment I started thinking about all those transgender women that were killed for being themselves, and I *realized* that I could be one of them if I wasn't careful. It struck me like a train and I never thought I would feel that fragile and powerless one day.

And now I feel almost dirty. I've been labeled a sex worker, agressed, insulted, and followed by a creep in a window of 10 minutes. I don't know which of them is the most horrible. What the fuck human race? I was smiling at you and you made me feel like I was a prey. I knew those things from an observer point but fuck, this feeling is horrible.

On the bright side: Thank you for being alive you all. last night was a gender switching party, and I felt like Lgbt people are often incredibly beautiful just by being themselves, happy and fabulous. I dreamed all my life to meet such people and there you are, shining with a confidence that made me feel home.

**tldr; Went home from a gender switching party, got agressed by two sex workers, pulled my wig and my cap off, I got insulted, and if it wasn't enough I got followed home by a creep. I feel betrayed.**

Edit : I not in any way shaming the sex profession, when I said I feel dirty it's because I felt assaulted and humiliated. Being called a sex worker also made me question the way I personally looked, like any woman I feel hurt to be called that when my intention was clearly not to appear like one. Other that, I greatly respect that tough job. 

I also have to say that this was rather violent, as my wig was pinned to my real hair by a comb pin at the front. 

Also someone said prostitute was a slur, I didn't know that. I'm sorry if I offended anyone, my intention was not to blame someone else than those particular people last night.

I am not sure why this is but before I kept believing I might be trans but that is in the end entirely up to me. If I was for sure I think I would want to transition.

There is the problem that I am scared but also the worry that this is not true but just my sexuality being skewed in some way. The feelings I feel of a surge is usually non sexual so its not that.

This is a short post. I am just alone and feeling an extreme sense of being stuck and hopeless alongside melancholy."

And I know transgender is an umbrella term but is often used with the connotation of someone that is MtF or FtM, so that's how I generally use it.

I feel that I could definitely be genderqueer (I'm AMAB btw), but I don't know if I'm comfortable with that identity over transgender because being GQ is less of a drastic ""change"", whereas if I were to be transgender (as in wanting to pursue transition to female), that's a lot more to personally accept and a lot more changes (at least for the level of transition I would desire).

myfemside,asktransgender,Can you give men an idea of what starting over in a new gender would be like?,"I'm a male who is 46 and married. I've been questing things for awhile but have never had the guts to fully embrace my feminine side, which I suspect is a big part of me. I've taken some small steps in the past and I feel this is truer to who I am. The thing is... it's terrifying because if I went down this path, I'd be completely starting over. I'm pretty sure my marriage would end and while I think my family would support me, I'm not sure if they'd know how to relate to me.

In other words, they are not the type of people who would say this is wrong or disown me but I just have a feeling they would not know how to relate to me any more since they've seen me as a male for most of my life. 
I pretty much know this would end my marriage. We have issues with my wife expecting strict gender roles as it is with this implication that there are ways men and women are supposed to act. She would not take it well if I came out to her that  I may relate more as woman.

So..I've been wondering what dating would be like. I'm not gay (although not opposed to trying sex with a man) but I can't see myself in a relationship with a man. 
So I guess I am wondering what my options are as a late 40s man to find women who'd be interested in a tall transgender guy. 
Basically I would be looking at completely starting over. I'd have a relationship with my family, friends and probably ex wife but it would be very awkward and I'd need to find new support system or
social network. 
Sorry if this is rambling, I'm not 100% convinced that this is the right path and I realize it would take steps and not happen all at once but I am just trying to do the mental exercise of seeing what life would look like on the other side of this from people who have done it. "

Nyeehh,asktransgender,[NSFW]Having Trouble... uh... getting off...,"This is pretty personal, but idk where else to go with this. Posting from my gonewild alt because I'm too lazy for a throwaway.

I'm 18, mtf, nearly 8 months HRT, and for the past few months I've been having more and more trouble bringing myself to orgasm. I've had limited success with vibrators (occasionally can do the trick, but not usually), have never been able to get off ""jerking,"" and haven't been able to try anything anal in a long time (I really love it, but lack of privacy and annoying cleanup don't make a good combination). I was even involved in a threesome with a friend lately and couldn't get off from grinding or her trying to use her hands (no penetration). My nipples are a BIT more sensitive than before and can occasionally get me turned on, but they don't typically help much (and especially not when I play with them myself). I don't really know what else to do, my sex drive has definitely changed, but I'm still a horny gal with her needs, and can't seem to get them. I feel turned on mentally a lot, but my body just doesn't seem to agree.

Also, the few orgasms I've been able to get haven't changed much and still feel pretty male (and I can't have multiple in a row), is this normal at this stage on hormones? These have all been directly from my... unladylike parts, haven't been able to try much prostate stuff (and can't feel anything there from directly between my legs, I've tried)."
aklgtw,asktransgender,"[NSFW] I was literally just in the middle of a threesome between my spouse ( agender, female-bodied) and our attractive cis male friend when he got a little freaked out and stopped everything.","This is the third time I have started to have sex with a man and had him stop things midway through it on account me being trans. 

I'm 31,  MtF. My spouse and I had some friends over tonight for beers and games. All but one of our friends left, and things started taking a flirtatious turn with our remaining friend who we'll call ""James"". 

One thing led to another, and after treading water for an hour or so, James finally kissed me. After a while this pretty much led to everyone getting naked except for me, as I opted to keep my pants on specifically because I didn't want to freak our friend out. 

We asked him multiple times if he was consenting and he was interested, and he said he was. My spouse and I started kissing him and slowly working our way down his body. I'm more interested in males than my spouse is, so I think they were doing it mostly for my benefit.

Anyway, after a few minutes I decided to go for it and started going down on him. He started moaning and acting really into it, and for a couple minutes everything was great. Then I asked him if he'd be willing to stand while I went down on him and he suddenly stated that he was uncomfortable with the whole situation and wanted to stop. So, we stopped right away, and he started talking about how he sees me as a woman but also can't get over the fact that I am genetically male. 

He's crashing on our couch downstairs, and I'm writing this because I'm bored and horny and it occurred to me tonight that the biggest cockblock in my life is apparently my own dick. Ugh. 

It's so hard to find straight men who actually think of trans women as real women and are interested in having sex with us in a normal, non-creepy kind of way.

UltraViolet7,asktransgender,So my professor is potentially a little transphobic or transignorant. Confront or ignore?,"Professor ""L"" has made a few questionable remarks throughout the semester, all of them coming off as a little ignorant and bugged me for a while. If they came from any other professor I would've done something immediately, but L has set a tone in this class that welcomes inappropriate humor, himself a black belt of sexual jokes. This has made it difficult to tell whether he's being serious with these transphobic remarks, as he's even passionately gay-friendly. It's just hard to say if he's one of those ""LGBT allies"" who are actually not so accepting of the T's.

I'm not going to bother listing some examples that I've heard because they'll certainly come off as harsh and insensitive without the right context of the class's humorous atmosphere, which is why I'm worried about coming off as too sensitive if I bring this up with him. Additionally he happens to be teaching one of my favorite subjects, a continuation of which I'll be taking next semester which means another semester with L. Also, I'm currently coming out of my shell in terms of androgynous clothing on-campus, and given another semester he's bound to find out I'm transitioning.

My gender identity epiphany (because all of my struggles in life now have a single cohesive explanation) and consequential declaration to my wife last week has been rather bumpy. Not terrible as we're trying to work through and stay together. 

The worst is when she's processing what she's loosing and all I can do is feel guilty because I've hurt the women I love by being honest about who I am and want to be.

My biological mother doesn't like anything I want to do at all, but has somewhat coming to terms with the fact that I am her child.

I have my own money saved, despite it  it being too much, and honestly do not plan to live with my biological mother much longer, and want to transition as soon as I can for best results.

I've read it's not recommended, but would like to self-medicate anyways. I have family who are in the medical field who I feel could tell me what to do and what not to do.

ReimiS,asktransgender,Today was a damn good day! (long read),"So, starting the day off I knew I was going to file my legal name change, so I figured it was about time I told my little brother that I'm trans. I had been putting this off for months, afraid that learning his cherished ""big bro"" was actually his sister might cause some issues considering how he looked up to me and bragged about me growing up. I sent some texts to get the conversation going, told him I had something big I was dealing with and I was scared to tell him. He reassured me, but it still took almost an hour (and a dozen rewrites) to finally hit that damn send button. 7 minutes latter... ""I'm cool. I have trans friends. What do you identify as?"" I about broke down crying... He asked me my new name and picked it up without a beat... dammit I could just hug this kid to death.

So high off that I proceeded to head to my bank to get my name change notarized, scared that I would face issues since this is a conservative area. (and I list that I'm trans as the reason I'm filing for the name change, and my chosen name is decidedly feminine) The guy looked it over and signed off on it without skipping a beat, no funny looks, no questions, just smiles...

Skip to the courthouse. I head in, they inform me I'm missing several pages and forms needed, this scares me, and the lady proceeds to help me with all of it, bringing me the missing forms, helping me fill them out, and again, no odd looks, whispers or unhelpfulness... I pay the fee ($50 less than I expected too!) and she tells me I should expect the approval in the mail once the judge signs off on it... And I shouldn't have to publish the name change in a paper either. Holy Shit, that was it!? I was that stressed over this!?

Needless to say I was walking on sunshine after that, went to lunch with my Mom following that, had a good meal, then helped her with some Christmas stocking stuffers for her step grandkids, on the way out someone she knows yells for her to come over, I get in the car to avoid it. They are over the top screaming, happy catching up, I'm just freaking out that they will ask questions or something... which they did. ""Is that your daughter?"" ""Yes"" ""What's her name"" ""chosen name"" *Screaming* ""HI chosen name!"" 

Needless to say I'm kinda freaking out over this... It's like, holy shit, everything went so well today that I'm almost scared that something equally bad is coming to even it out, I'm not used to having things go this well for me... I'm just so happy right now.

Sorry this wasn't a question, but as anyone who has followed my posts knows, some of this has been stressing me out for the last month, and I figured some good news and positivity would be welcomed.

I was told that they were mailing me a packet I had to fill out and take with, and I'm assuming that the surgeon will probably take a look at my chest and be able to estimate what kind of results I could expect? Which will suck, but focusing on what I'll be getting out of it in the end will help. And I've got a few questions I know I want to ask, but any suggestions for good ones in case I don't think of them would be helpful. 

The only other weird thing is, the surgeon is one that the doctor who handles my HRT referred me to, and I'd never heard of him before, and couldn't find any reviews or before and after photos or anything for specifically FTM surgeries. So I'm a little concerned about that, although I'm definitely going to ask if he has any before and after photos at the consultation. But if anyone happens to have heard of or had any experience with Dr. Buseman in St. Louis Park MN, that would be awesome."
creepyriver,asktransgender,Seeking FtM/FtNB with PCOS and/or Ehlers Danlos Syndrome to answer questions.,"I'm in the beginnings of figuring out how I'm going to transition in a non-binary way, and I've been trying to figure out how I'd be affected by the hormones and top surgery. 

I'm on Spironolactone (for hirsuitism), and I'd tried going off of it, thinking that I would gain muscle easier and start to look a bit more butch. Instead I gained water weight and turned more busty and curvy.

I already shave my face everyday from the PCOS, and I'm not really interested in getting hairier. If anything, I'd like to be less hairy. Would drilling my ovaries help balance me out in any way?

I've wanted to be without my size D breasts since puberty, but I fear my figure will be strangely imbalanced if I have broad hips without breasts, which is why I'm interested in a low dose of testosterone. I am also excited about the promise of easier muscle building, as stronger muscles would help my scoliosis. 

However, I fear how my body will heal from top surgery given the Ehlers Danlos, and wonder how strange and asymmetrical surgical results might be taking into account my scoliosis. I was considering getting not a complete removal of all breast tissue, but possibly an A cup, if that's possible. However, I'm not sure if the hormonal imbalance from PCOS and spironolactone might cause my breast tissue to regenerate, in which case I'd rather go totally flat-chested.

I'm in the process of finding a gender therapist, so I know some of these questions will get answered by a professional, but Ehlers Danlos is understood by few, and I'd like to hear anyone's personal experience with these issues."
throwaway26122016,asktransgender,Cis people: How are you comfortable with their assigned gender?,"I'm 16 (coming up for 17) and I am wondering if I am trans or not.


I'm trying to get my head around how cis people are perfectly fine with their assigned gender. It seems such a strange concept of never wanting to be the other gender.


I wish I were born female. Every time I see someone who is female (trans or cis) I get a little jealous, upset and angry. I look at myself and I see a guy. Knowing I'm going to grow up as a man worries me unless I do something about it (Which I can't).


Surely cis people must feel like this too some degree? I've felt like this all my life, and I haven't really been aware that I had these feelings until this year. Maybe I've just had it for so long I don't know anything different.


Or do cis people feel like this, and I am cis who just thinks they are trans? Maybe I am just a crossdresser or a crossdreamer? I honesty don't know :("

I'm not sure how safe or if they'll be like a big scar or anything, that's why I  asking. And I'm not saying like D cups or anything, I'm just not fond of the idea of Cs or kinda big Bs. I'd prefer medium or small As. Also, since I'm not on hormones (or even get to dress girly, not gonna bore you with that here.) will I maybe change my mind once I'm on them?

For Trans:

On the ""am I trans part 2"" YouTube video I identified w/ 5 of the 7 ""signs"" of gender dysphoria

- I've only been able to crossdress handful of times (all sexual, which has confused me)

- age 14-15, would pray to wake up a girl every night, pray for brain transplant machine, want aliens to abduct me and change me to girl, wishing I was put in witness protection so I could get a sex change disguise lol, curious about reincarnation

- always having had sexual fantasies as a girl

- took gender tests and got ""female"" a majority of the time

- fascination by gender bending themes

- majority of time choosing female avatars, including female names on some email accounts

- Seeing attractive girls, wanting to be w/ them and imagining being them at same time

- Maybe felt some jealousy of women 

- most dreams in past few years as female, feeling very happy in them, hoping to go back asleep to continue them. Also lucid dream to try to be female in them

- possibly having ""phantom breasts"", feel something missing in chest area at times



Against Trans:

- not really having dysphoria, at least body dysphoria i think

- enjoy lots of typical ""guy"" stuff

- not depressed/ in fact pretty happy"

YharnamSeeker,asktransgender,Should I come out to my parents now or at a later point?,"So I told my doctor first to get the ball rolling on the medical side and recently I told my best friend. That was super scary told him over coffee but he was super nice and supportive about it wanted to know everything and told me hes got my back no matter what. Even offered to be there when I eventually told my folks which honestly i considered.

Im torn jumping between defiantly wanting to tell them soon to thinking maybe I should wait. Its frustrating because each decision has valid reasons. If I tell them now or soon then thats everyone I need to tell to be atleast open about who I am so I can stop hiding. Im watching more and more YTers who are trans and learning all kinds of new things like makeup but doing this in secret is impossible I can't pursue any kind of toe dipping and just have to keep pretending full time.

However the counter argument for telling them later is that it could be 2 years before I begin medical transition and thats kind of the point everyone really starts a full life transition and I feel it should be the same too but that means if I come out early ive got 2 years of my family knowing but me still not been able to do very much about it and still pretending to the whole outside world. I don't want them to see me once I tell them as just the same as before for so long after because they might think im lying or confused.

ScrambledScreams,asktransgender,Horomone treatment question?,"I was wondering if I'd be able to just stop at a certain point while on testosterone. I'm not new to the knowledge of horomone treatment, but am not very educated on the subject.

So, a bit of clarification I guess. I'm afab, and identify as a guy/trans masculine. Male/gender neutral pronouns, I dislike female pronouns, the whole shebang. 

However, there's still a part of me that, occasionally, likes being feminine. Soft and gentle makeup, flowing dresses in pastel colours and floral prints, etc. If I choose to start taking testosterone, would I be able to stop at a point where my voice was relatively androgenyous? Are there voice surgeries or something that I'd be able to undergo to achieve this? 

Everyone (biologically) male in my family who has achieved puberty all have really deep voices, and I wouldn't want testosterone to give me as deep a voice as they all have. 

Thanks in advance!"
BabblingBaby,asktransgender,Am I even trans???,"So this is going to sound really weird. Biologically speaking, I am female. With that being said, I dress like a female, have feminine tendencies, and just like all things femme in general. I wear makeup and high heels and have long hair and all of that fun girly stuff, but for the past two and a half years I have been having these weird ""urges"" or ""desires"" to have a man's body. Like, I want an adam's apple and broad shoulders and a deep voice (like a man's voice) and a more defined jawline and stuff like that. I kind of wish my breasts weren't there and I most definitely don't want to have ovaries or a uterus. If I had the money I would've gotten them taken out a long time ago. Even if I did have a man's(?) body I wouldn't stop dressing like a female. In fact, I would probably dress more like a female because I feel more comfortable expressing myself in the ""correct"" body. 

I don't know. Am I weird or is this just a phase?"
The_Wispy,asktransgender,I miss my dad...,"Around a year ago now, I came out to my family as trans. I told my father first because at the time, I trusted him the most in the world. Sure, he was old fashioned, but I thought he was also somewhat open minded and would eventually come around after being caught off guard by it.


I think I made a post here about it that day, but his response to me was driving out from the place we were having lunch at, driving to a park and lecturing me for two hours straight. Saying he saw it coming for a long time ever since I started doing ""f***** things"" and not being like other boys. Telling me that I would not transition and one day I would be looking back, as the father of my own children, laughing at this ""silly time"" in my life. Asking why I would even want to be female because apparently they never used logic and only emotion.


At the end of our talk in the many ways I was wrong, he asked what I wanted from him. All I asked for was to him to support me. No cash, nothing to help me transition, only to have his support, as someone in my corner.
&gt;""The only support you'll get from me is taking you to church to get fixed. Maybe join a youth group, talk to some guys.""


My 2nd sister took his side, blaming me for ""choosing to be this way"". How I probably hurt him somehow by being myself. That anything he told me was right and justified, because of my ""choice"" and being his son.


It's been a year now since I last spoke to him. I work as a delivery driver now and pass by where he lives fairly often now. I find myself missing the community, missing my old room, the dark, quiet nights. Missing him...


How nice it was to eat ice cream together...


How he would make me feel loved...


Always giving me confidence to be stubborn in the face of the wrong...


If I took one thing from him, it was that stubborness. I won't call him, he'll have to find me if he wants his daughter back. Gain back a daughter, or lose a child because he wouldn't accept me.


Goddamn it still hurts though. I still have trouble dealing with thoughts of him... I have every justifiable reason to hate him for abusing me as a kid and throwing away our relationship, but part of me wishes he was still around. Even if he wasn't always the nicest, I still trusted him the most.

MedicinalSpectre,asktransgender,What's a thing you're tired of hearing from other trans peoples? [nsfw language],"Sorry, I need to vent. 

* ""I don't have anything against ___, but--"". Seriously, this is almost as bad as ""I'm not a racist, but ___"". Stop fuckin' saying this, cats.

* ""How long have you been on hormones"" is not okay for a first date type scenario, alright? I don't mind sharing with anybody but the presumption I will share with *you* about *this topic* because TRANS is a little reductive of us both, yeah?

* Overcompensation. When cats like Kate Bornstein (gold star if you had to supress a sneer) talk about ""second puberty,"" they're right only in so far that trans people tend to go wildly overboard with their gendered stuff at first blush. Too much make up, super guy-ism shit, the works. I'm totes guilty of this to an extent, I think we all are, but dude c'mon, have some self awareness. That flannel is hideous and that eyeshadow ain't working for you, quit it.

* Constantly tiptoeing around each other. Man, just talk about stuff, just ask questions. I'm not a dainty flower, you aren't a babby, let's just be open about it. We don't have to through around slurs to qualify for a frank conversation, c'mon dude. 

* Caitlyn Jenner transphobic comments. She is as much a transwoman as you or I. Quit it. It's not funny or cute to be a huge fuck and misgender cats just because they suck. 

Bonus round!

* The unstated assumption that we all need to be fawned over by allies. It's sweet if my friend goes ""you look alright,"" that's cool. ""Oh you look like such a princess/dafodil/glass menagerie"" is just like, dude, c'mon, it's alright I got this.

epicelurean,asktransgender,Am I trans or are these merely symptoms of OCD? Or is this something else?,"First of all, I know you're trying to help and I really appreciate it, but there's no point linking me the stuff typically linked on this subreddit as I've read them all. (Null HypotheCis etc.) I've looked up tons of resources but I still can't figure myself out. Sorry for the length but I had to make sure I got everything in.

From puberty onward, I knew there was something I disliked about myself but I didn't know exactly what. I hated pictures of myself, etc. I wanted to be small, I didn't want to be strong and I certainly didn't want facial hair. I viewed older teenagers with dread, it was as if ending up masculine was inevitable if you're a boy. On the other hand, I felt disgusted with myself about this because hey, I certainly couldn't be gay!

At the age of 17 or 18, after I stopped being homophobic, I allowed myself to explore my more feminine side without the guilt I felt before. I don't know how to explain this exactly, but I started feeling some kind of happiness (not sexual) when I thought of myself as feminine or whenever associated a certain feminine trait with myself. I especially liked did this whenever I was among other people, in secret of course. I felt sad whenever I learned about some feminine trait that I couldn't associate with myself, for example the fact that women see colors in a different way than men do. I'm biologically male so I knew that was something I didn't have. I also learned about Klinefelter's syndrome during that time and I was convinced that I had it. (Probably not, doesn't really matter) This may seem insensitive but I really wanted to be a Klinefelter's male because that meant that I was closer to being a woman than other men. One day, it dawned on me that I really wished that I was born a girl. It hit me like a ton of bricks until I realized that there was nothing I could do about this and I felt incredibly sad. I didn't know anything about transgender people and hormones so I thought they were biological males who dress like women and have a single ""sex change"" surgery to feminize their body. I thought about this a little, realized that there's no way I was going to do anything like that and noped out.

Like a week afterwards, I tried looking up transgender stuff on the internet to make sure I wasn't and this time I found out about dysphoria symptoms and nothing seemed to apply to me. I realized how absurd it was, trying to be trans when I clearly wasn't. However, soon after I started feeling jealousy for girls, even on tv shows. I never felt this before but after I read about it as a dysphoria symptom, I started feeling it. It was like my mind was trying to convince me that I'm trans. Still, I decided to settle on being a feminine guy.

I still felt I was too masculine, I always felt the need to cover my forehead with bangs in order to have a less masculine facial structure. I wanted to be as slender as possible and I was always self-conscious about my shoulder width. Once again this is difficult to explain, but since as long as I can remember whenever I pictured myself in my mind it was always different to how I actually look, I picture myself as having a more feminine facial structure. (Still a boy though) Seeing myself in mirrors is almost surprising and I dislike what I see. I sometimes spend over an hour taking pictures of myself in different positions, angles and lighting until I take one were I kind of look like I feel I should. Now that I think of it, this sounds insane.

I'm 21 now and a little over 3 months ago I felt like my life was getting nowhere, like I had nothing to look forward to. I decided to explore my repressed feminine side again and actually consider this transgender thing now. I started learning about everything transgender. (especially on this subreddit, I looked up TONS of threads) At that time, I wanted to be transgender so I felt relieved whenever something applied to me. However, no matter how hard I try, I could never figure out whether I was actually transgender. I soon realized that if I didn't think about it, it didn't matter to me so I wasn't feeling dysphoric, at least in the traditional sense.

I actually concluded that I wasn't trans like 3 weeks ago. I bought more masculine clothes than I was used to, cut my hair short again and was planning on starting to work out so that I can feel comfortable with my gender. I even managed to convince myself that I'd grow a beard had I been able to. I made sure I act masculine while hanging out with my friends. However, certain things started to trigger me. Sometimes I see a woman on a TV show and I start thinking, what if I was more like her? Things like that. I attempt to dispel these thoughts but it's like they start a chain reaction. The day after, I start thinking about whether I'm sure that I'm not trans and how there's nothing to look forward to as a man.

I also happen to be OCD. I don't know if it's like this for everyone with OCD but sometimes my OCD ""takes a break"" and it's much less intense for a few weeks. Then it's intense again and I'm obsessing over everything. After I started feeling trans thoughts again, my OCD came back in full force again. This is making me think that the trans thoughts may be a symptom of OCD although it certainly feels different. My trans thoughts are very mild and It's almost like I force myself to have them. I'm not sure if my mind is picking up irrelevant stuff from the past (mentioned above) and associating them with being trans, thus making me resign myself to being trans. I live with my parents so visiting a gender therapist is not easy. They'll find out eventually and I really do not want anyone to know I'm having trans thoughts while I'm not sure whether or not I'm trans yet. If was sure about it it would be a different story. Plus I'm also very socially inept and I can't imagine myself actually saying this stuff in real life."

I don't have gender or social dysphoria, just since I constantly question my self I can't think of anything else so it makes difficult to concentrate on other people's stories. I never wanted to be a girl, I don't want it now either. I was never true ""man"" as heteronormative but I grew up beliveing I was gay and that it's the reason I couldn't get along with other males, I could get along better with women but also not entirely. I couldn't connect with most of the people in my life and always felt like I am outcast, and now I know nothing. Like there are two sides of me one that is rational and doesn't have emotions that is masculine and all, but the other side is too emotional and made me believe I am woman. Does this happen often? When I try to think as woman I can't nor to behave like one, but when emotions come in place I don't feel like man. 
Hopefully someone will tell me what is going on, and how to cope with all of this. 
Thanks ��

YodaOnDMT,asktransgender,What options are there in terms of SRS for FTM,"Excuse my ignorance, I'm just interested to know.

I understand the options aren't great for FTM and seem to in involve some kind of implant into a graft that you pump up to get an 'erection.'

Does that even work in terms of your own 'gratification?'

What about surgical procedures involving enlarging the clitoris? Some sort of tissue graft inside the clitoris to increase the size so erectile tissue still functions around the neophallus (if that makes sense) Has that made any ground? Penis from a donor perhaps?

Seems like it's easier to transition for FTM in terms of 'gender role' and 'passing' but not much surgically."

Enjoy!

#Transgender Brains: What We Know

""But isn't it impossible to conclusively tell a male brain from a female one?""

While it's true that there is significant variance in XX brains and XY brains, there are certain structures that are distinctly sexually dimorphic. For example, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which is involved in a variety of cognitive processes such as sensory processing and planning movement and may be involved in bodily perception, and the hypothalamus, which (among other things) connects the nervous system to the endocrine system, are both [at least twice as large in the average male brain](http://www.bprcem.com/article/S1521-690X\(07\)00033-4/abstract) (the research is discussed by Swaab [here](http://www.functionalneurology.com/materiale_cic/389_XXIV_1/3373_sexual/index.html)). This same study reported that almost every section of these structures in trans people were found to have a size and cell type distribution that would be expected of the experienced gender. These results have been duplicated by subsequent research teams in [this study](http://transcience-project.org/paperdex/papers/Kruijver2000.html), [this study](http://transcience-project.org/paperdex/papers/Chung2002.html), [this study](http://www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com/article/S0022-3956\(10\)00158-5/abstract), and others. 

A [study by a different group](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4037295/) later investigated hypothalamic response to a particular pheromone-like steroid that is known to produce a predictable pattern of activation based on the sex of the subject in order to determine whether there was a difference for gender dysphoric subjects. This is particularly interesting, since such neural responses have been shown to be innate - no researchers have ever been able to change them through conditioning or environment. It was found in the study that gender dysphoric subjects began to present atypical responses that were more in line with their experienced gender at around the onset of puberty.

Other studies ([first](http://transcience-project.org/paperdex/papers/Rametti2011.html) and [second](http://transcience-project.org/paperdex/papers/Luders2009.html)) have noted significant differences in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, which is a network of axons spanning the brain to connect regions in the different lobes. The average fiber density and axonal diameter in FtM subjects was significantly greater than control females in most sections of the structure, and mirrored the control males. While MtF subjects didn't display masculine measures in this, they also didn't fall into female ranges, suggesting that while the brain was not fully feminized in this region, it also did not complete the process of masculinization.

I'll wrap up with the [Luders study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2754583/?tool=pmcentrez), which compared grey matter distribution between MtF subjects and control males and females. Both distribution of grey matter and the size of the studied structures were found to be significantly feminized, with both the control females and the MtF subjects containing significantly larger grey area than the control males in every region. The brains of the MtF subjects once again weren't totally feminized, as they still contained less grey matter on average than control females, but they were more in line with female rather than male brains."

So I've been thinking about waiting until after all the hubbub of the holidays to start looking into hormones and all that fun stuff. But it's all I can think about. And talking about it with my wife makes me feel like a giddy school girl. But like where do I start? I've done a bit of research and the HBHC in the downtown area seems like a great resource. However its about a 45min drive for me from the suburbs. So should I like see a therapist who is more local first? Or does HBHC do that kind of stuff and is more experienced with Trans peoples? 


**ASIDE**.   At this point I'm feeling great about finally admitting to myself who I really am and taking steps to make my innerself become my outerself. The only things that casue me worry are when do I come out to my parents. I'm fairly sure they'll accept me evntually but I think it might be rocky at first.

Before you unload your argument, let me tell you a bit about myself. I'm young, a teen, and ever since I was 10 I began to feel wrong in my body. I began to think I was a boy trapped in a girl's body and I was terrified of puberty. Now, a few years later, I still feel uncomfortable as a female and being treated as a female, but find it impossible to imagine my life as a male. I have dysphoria about some things, but most of the time I just feel trapped by gender as a whole. It's reached a point where the very idea of getting dressed and going outside depresses me (I already have severe depression).I thought I might be Agender, but now that I've seen the mess going on with SJWs and their protests, I've begun to think differently.

What do you people think? Please be kind. I am simply seeking information on something that has been bothering me for quite a long time."

Now, I don't have many issues with my body but I still know my brain isn't a woman's brain or female; it's male or somewhere strongly leaning there.

321321321yawaworht,asktransgender,A few odd questions by an uncertain and terribly curious person.,"So... for a few months now, I've been tossing the idea of going MtF at some point in the near future. Medical insurance here is great and would cover most of the costs associated with the whole thing, so it's really down to me, and I'm not sure where I stand on the matter, which, to be fair, may be an indication that this would be ill-advised. Nevertheless, I find myself obsessed with the idea.

**My first question is this** - has anyone gone through the whole process of HRT+SRS out of pure curiosity or simply because you were growing bored with your current body? 

I'm asking this because I don't really think I experience some kind of dissonance where I feel as a woman stuck in a man's body. Rather, I feel like I would enjoy a female body more than I enjoy a male body. I imagine myself as a female equivalent of myself and it seems more... right to me than my current self. It's not that I feel like being a man is actively hurting my quality of life, but rather, I feel like I could be happier as a woman. I feel like I enjoy acting feminine much more than I enjoy acting masculine, though, as a man, this is obviously a problem in social environments where being a man and acting feminine may attract negative attention and bring problems later on.

So I'm wondering if anyone here went transgender kind of just for the sake of it rather than feeling trapped in the wrong body or something like that.

**Second question**: Are there any ways to tell how well your facial features would translate into the other gender during HRT or is it an absolute crap shoot? 

I think my greatest fear about this by far is that I'll turn out to be ugly in my own eyes. I don't want to become a woman if my female self would be less attractive than my male self was, by equivalent standards. 

**Third question**: HRT... what can it do to you in terms of your sexuality and libido? what has it done to you personally? 

Oh, and, probably a stupid question but I'll ask it anyway - does HRT have the potential to alter your sexual orientation, or do you keep your orientation as it was before? in my case, will I, in effect, become a lesbian if I do this, or is it possible that I'll develop an interest in men?

**Fourth question**: HRT-induced Acne. How bad is it? and how bad is it if your face is already somewhat prone to acne? does it get better? 

**Fifth question**: On the subject of an SRS vagina, I have a few rather intrusive questions, so you may want to skip this question entirely. So, how does stimulation work? how does orgasm work? does it get 'wet'? are there any changes to your refractory period? can you masturbate as if you were born with a vagina and enjoy it the same way? and finally, does urination work like you would expect it to?

**Sixth question**: In terms of maintenance, what things must you do for the rest of your life? I know about dilation and I imagine you'll be taking hormones for the rest of your life, but is there anything else? 

**Seventh question:** How long did it take you to fully adapt lifestyle changes that would generally be required for you to comfortably integrate into society as the gender you've transitioned into? what I mean is, if going MtF, how long did it take you to adapt all the elaborate cosmetic routines and change your behavior and body language to seamlessly reflect being a woman? (Of course, by ""seamless"", I mean ""seamless"" in most social environments where certain things are often expected of a person of their gender, I understand that a lot of this is relative)

**Last question**: What health hazards are associated with MTF HRT, which ones have you personally suffered from and what counters exist for them, if any? 

Answers to any of these questions are much appreciated."

The the most common thoughts are probably, ""what if I regret transitioning"" and ""am I even transgender"". I'm very confused you see, because I'm already living as a woman and have been for some time.

See, I'm not uncomfortable necessarily with being male. Sure, i do prefer women's fashion to men's, I do prefer to be treated like a woman (have doors opened for me, etc), but, does this mean anything?

hollylykki4662,asktransgender,My friend and his gender issues; I want to help him but don't know how to (I'm not an expert in LGBT issues).,"I have a friend, 28, we'll call him Bill. He's AMAB but told me he thinks he's bi-gender. Not transgender, that's certain. Well, he says he's a non-op MtF who doesn't want/need surgery so I'll accept that as what he means by not transgender (although would that count as transgender?) Bill doesn't have the time to post here so I'm posting on his behalf. I've changed names for privacy.
We're in the UK (if location is relevant here...)

He lives at home with his parents (nothing new here, really) and can't really afford to move back out for financial reasons.

Bill had told me three weeks ago that he has a female alter-ego, Michelle, who's the same as him, in terms of interests and also attracted to women (like he is as Bill) except she dresses very femininely. Bill has very macho interests; gaming, computing, cars, football. He says Michelle is a more feminine version of him but not effeminate but not a tomboy girl either.

What I know from Bill is (he's a very good friend who I see every so often; maybe due to our busy lives not that often) is that he has had gender issues, he said once he thought he was non-gender binary but realized that was the ""wrong fit"" for him, and that he thinks he's bi-gender?

I'm not an expert in LGBT issues, but is there a big difference between bi-gender, genderfluid, genderqueer? What are the major differences between them?

Bill told me that he worries this will affect his dating life; as Bill he's attracted to, in his words, ""uber-feminine women"", and that as Karla, well, he's attracted to the same.

From what I know about Bill and his female alter-ego, he has told me it's not crossdressing or fetishism, but he's also too afraid to actually try and buy clothes fearing he'll be outed as a pervert/fetishist (he lives in a small town, and there's a New Look, other fashion stores etc.) and said his area isn't great for LGBT issues and awareness is low. He said his parents don't know and he can't store women's clothes at home for when he's Michelle for fear of suspicion and worrying about parent's reaction (his town is fairly conservative).
He said he wants to look feminine even though he is (his words not mine) a non-op transwoman / bi-gender person.

He also said to me he thinks that he'll look like the stereotype of a butch lesbian due to the way his face is (even though he shaves) despite the fact he wants to dress feminine for when he's Michelle. He said he's too afraid to buy sports bras/crop tops / leggings etc. (what he likes or would like to wear as Michelle) and actually dress as her in public for fear of homophobic/transphobic attacks. His area's a small town around by Prestwich (if you know where I mean).

He said he can't really lie to a potential date that he's not a woman (he says he's a male lesbian/male non-op MtF) and he said he's read in the papers about women faking being men with fake penises and some autistic girl in London who tried to seduce women by being a man and is worried about how to avoid that (these were in a lot of British papers... you'd have to Google for more info on them; one was a woman in Chester, another an autistic girl called Gemma in Surrey, UK). He wants to be honest about this in dating but worries people won't believe he's being honest. His partial issue is where to meet people other than OKCupid.

On the issue of pronouns, he has told me he likes he for Bill (when presenting as Bill), she for Michelle (when presenting as her) and dislikes they/ze etc. I know pronouns are a common topic here but is it strange to want two different pronouns depending on form you're presenting as?

Basically, he's asked me for help and as much of a friend as I am to him (known him since I was 14) I am no expert in LGBT issues so have come here for help.

I will show him this post so if you could help him I'd really like that! "

actually_its_clara,asktransgender,15yo boy (Closetted MtF) - Don't like masturbation?,"Usually I'm able to do it just fine when my phallus is IN my underwear (not boxers), but when its OUT of the underwear, I have always felt extremely uncomfortable with seeing and feeling it outside, let alone masturbating with it. Whenever I watch a particular video where another male has his thing OUT and is playing with it, that just makes me super uncomfortable to (and not just because its a man. I'm sexually attracted to both males and females) I don't use anything special on my hands except my own saliva, but that's about it if it matters. I dont think so though, since I just feel uncomfortable just seeing it out of my underwear with an erection.

I was just posting this here wondering if it could have something to do with my dysphoria? Or is this just normal, because generally, I am fairly comfortable with it (At least most of the time)?"
IrreleventPerson,asktransgender,Anyone encountered a chase,"How did you deal with it?

I live in a very weird town and ""bicurious 30+ y/o men"" are legion, inevitably a lot of them turn into chasers.

Three weeks ago, I was severely outted by a unwary friend who thought ""being trans is cool, no point in hiding it"" while eating in a fast-food and after I got up to leave to work, some 30-something creep came and asked if i'd be free to hookup cause he heard I'm trans and he was ""quite interested in shemales"" (uggh)

I just noped out and walked away, fast.

How am I supposed to dealwith situations like hat? I'm certain itll happen again.

Edit: Anyone encountered a chaser irl?*

Bantha9,asktransgender,Highly in need of support!,"Recently I got into a flamewar regarding transgender issues. The other participant is making fun of being transgender, doesn't take the issues seriously, and seems to be against transgender-ness to a point too.
Approximate quote: ""Well yeah don't be surprised about this happeming in the world (NatGeto 9 year old Trans topic, I'm sure we'll all familiar), where parents raise their sons like girls or vice versa, and later them becoming transgender."" He also seems to be strongly in support of traditional gender roles.

So he seems to believe that being transgender is in, at least some cases, a societal effect (and if that's true, it's bad for some reason for people to turn out trans because of those effects). I've informed him, that being transgender, as far as I know, a biological effect that is there from birth. He disagreed with an anecdote. Now he's currently posting ""memes"" about the topic, like if that's a comprehensive comment about the subject, sort of like: ""Their father realized that she's trans: well it seems that he has to accept that his son is the man of the house from now on."" With a picture of an apparently female looking person in a crazy wig.

BUT! There is light in the darkness! We have spoken a bit under this post, and he says he would welcome any scientific studies on this topic! So if you would be so kind to link peer-reviewed accepted scientific papers about in the ballpark of ""is being transgender really a thing/biological phenomenon/what causes it"", with you just shortly wrapping up the conclusion of the paper in a few words I would be extremely glad! Even more than that, since I'm super interested too about the actual research going on in this field. Thank you very very much in advance."
transorwhat,asktransgender,How can I tell if I am transgender or just going through a phase?,"How can I tell if I am transgender or just going through a phase?


I want to see a therapist, but I feel a bit stupid, because what if I go and she says I'm not trans, just going through a phase or something? Plus I have no money whatsoever. 


I'm 17. I've never really experienced dysphoria until recently, when I discovered about being trans. I've read that was dypshoria and the null hypothesis. That was dypshoria relates to me more. However I have had quite a few signs of being trans from as young as 3. 

I get quite upset that I was born male and not female. I do feel anger in the inside and I get a little depressed. I can still function day to day, however I constantly think about being transgender from the minute I wake up to the minute I go to sleep. Literally, constantly. I had a filling at the dentist the other day and I was thinking about it while he was drilling in my tooth. That's how constant it is. I can distract myself from it if I am with other people, or playing games or watching something, but the thoughts are always there.


I'm worried that I might not be trans and that I am a confused cis-guy. I don't want to be. I'm really confused.


Thanks"

versitas187,asktransgender,I came out to my mother as trans woman and now I am having doubts. Are my doubts real or am I right in saying I am transgender?,"Technically, I came out to my mother two weeks ago, but she didn't respond until now. She asked me why I was transgender. I told her that I don't see myself on the mirror and that my reflection feels alien to me. I admit, I don't have strong gender dysphoria. I don't want big breast or anything like that, but I want to get rid of all of my body hairs and I want to maintain smooth skin I have. I don't like my face very much either although my face isn't ugly (It's average). I get miserable when I have a beard. I feel disconnect between myself and my body. I have small, but constant desire to become a woman.

First, my mother told me that it is only cosmetic changes and it shouldn't affect me that much even if I transitioned. Second, my mother told me that my personality was extremely masculine. She told me that I am headstrong, strongly independent, highly opinionated, overtly ambitious and doesn't have that softness that women have. Before I say anything, it is sad that all of these characteristics are viewed as masculine. However, it did give me some doubts. It is true that I have strong personality, sometimes to a fault. What if I don't fit in as women if I transition? I don't plan to change who I am when I transition. Would I not be woman if I am strong personality? Finally, my mother argued that I want to transition because my body is easiest one to change. Few years ago, I was severely depressed and I had suicidal thoughts. Anxiety overwhelmed me and, for two years, I failed and dropped most of my classes and I am currently taking gap year to rest. Thankfully, I can say depression is gone and I have dealt with it. Depression was not about transgender though. I spent most of my high school years studying all day and slept only three hours a day. I got too much stress and anxiety on my own expectation and need to succeed. It got too much after college and I just collapsed. My mother told me that, to change myself, I am transitioning to woman because I don't like myself and I want to abandon my past self. First, I am fine with who I am mentally. I like my personality. However, it is true that transitioning into woman felt like abandoning who I was and my failures a bit. It is true that there are many things I like to change including myself and my life, but does my desire to transition come not from, gender dysphoria, but from desire to escape my past self? I don't know.

I feel guilty posting in this subreddit because my gender dysphoria is really mild. I think it is there and it doesn't go away, but it is more of static sound than a loud noise. Sometimes, the reflection on the mirror doesn't feel alien anymore and I can recognize the reflection as myself. Sometimes, being transgender sounds ridiculous to me. Isn't woman basically man with boobs and vagina and man a woman with no breast and penis? Am I just delusional? Is it less of gender dysphoria and more of escapism from my past self? Would transitioning change anything? I plan to transition, not because current dysphoria is bad, but because I fear it will worsen as I age.

Lastly, I know I should get therapy for this and I have one next month. It's just that I have no one to talk to or trust and you guys are only one I have. Have transitioning change anything for you? What did you guys do when you had doubts?"
Elena1270,asktransgender,Blouse in or out?,"Ok, Here is the deal, I do have leggings and obviously you dont tuck a blouse in with those, but what about jeans? I have always tucked my shirt in my jeans. Do I tuck my blouse inside my jeans or wear it out side like I do with the leggings?"
Mellowbelle,asktransgender,What is your opinion of Allison Woolbert?,"To make a long story short, Allison Woolbert is a trans woman who, before coming out, was convicted of molesting a child. As you can imagine, transphobes use her as an example of why being trans is ""wrong"". My opinion is that she served her time and I'm sure she will always have this hanging over her head. So she's not going to try anything like that again and people aren't going to trust her with their kids. If she were a danger to the public, she'd be in prison. But I do want to hear what some people in this sub think of her."
Joshfromdowney,asktransgender,Has anyone else wanted (or has) to transition(ed) but does not want breasts? 26 mtf pre-hrt,"Hey there. For about two months I have been exploring my gender with my therapist and partner and the more and more I talk about it the more I am convinced I am transgendered (probably gender non-binary or mtf). However, while I look forward to many of the changes that may happen with HRT, I feel uncomfortable with the thought of breasts. I have talked about this with my therapist, and I still don't feel fine with having breasts and having to wear a bra. Has anyone else felt like this?"
FelineKeylime,asktransgender,1mo HRT MTF Depression and weeping,"Hello! I havent posted here before, but been a reader a little now and again. I am suffering from depression from earlier and I got my diagnosis being transgender about two months back, started hormones on the 27th of oct. Since then, Ive been mostly depressed, tired and felt like i was about to break down and cried, today was the fourth day that i actually broke down and cried, just from friends over the net being so nice to me and helping me get through this.

Thing is tho, its not happy tears, they are full on sad and miserable ones and i seriously dont know what to do.

I know very well that this is what i want, but all the changes, moodswings and coupled with my depression, it makes me quite hesitant, since i feel mentally weaker now..

Im wondering if any of you have had the same reactions? Also worth noting, this time of year is always the absolute worst for my depression, but ive never cried about it before."
kipperonis,asktransgender,Anyone who's done fertility preservation?,"I'm close to being able to get on T (definitely within the next month or so), but I'm interested in having genetic children so I'd need to freeze my eggs before then.

Maypell,asktransgender,Am I valid?,"Do you sometimes accidentally misgender yourself and it takes you a few seconds to notice? It happens to me too much and idk it kinda makes me think that maybe I'm just cis and don't like the feminine part of my body... I feel the same when I look in the mirror and say ""I'm a boy"" or "" I'm a girl"" or ""I'm not a boy and I'm not a girl"" and I honestly don't know what to think accept from the fact that maybe I think that way because I wanna feel ""special"" I guess (I know it's not how it works and that it's a stupid thing to say or do but I can't understand myself anymore) ...
Plus I can't even tell if what i'm feeling dysphoria because I did get a binder and it made me feel super comfortable and happy but in general I don't notice my chest when I'm in public at least not that much... but when I'm naked it kinda looks like they don't belong on my body you know? 
anyway I just needed to get that out there and maybe you can help me somehow? sorry if that sounded dumb or something...

dragonheart01,asktransgender,UGH. Just need some support.,"I have a dad who is very supportive, but who I do not want to associate with because he has been extremely abusive towards me. My mom, on the other hand, is completely dismissive, has been supportive in other things, and is the only one who would be able to pay for a medical transition. My sister is neutral but swings back and forth between backing me and my mom. I have already decided for certain that I want HRT and I am saying a tentative yes towards SRS, and all my mom is willing to provide is puberty suppression. I am also only 15 so I can't get HRT yet and even if I was legible I would still need to raise funds since my mother would most likely abandon me. I just don't know how to deal with any of this anymore. I am barely passing in school because I am just sleeping off the day to avoid depression. Suicide keeps coming back as a valid thought, but I am too scared to do, but if I find a pleasant enough way I might just do it. UGH. My mother is not even allowing makeup or clothes or tucking or anything femme no matter how superficial.

Thank you."

ThrowawayTcurious,asktransgender,Difficult question,"So, I (cis male, 35) recently met a lovely trans women on okcupid. We've spoken online and it was really nice. She is an interesting person and she is also very attractive and feminine. I was thinking of maybe asking her out.
The thing is: I'm completely heterosexual and, even though I would be open to dating a trans women, given my personal preferences she would have to be post-op. I'm not saying it's the only thing that matters (I believe I'm not that shallow), but I already liked all the rest about her. The genital thing is, however, to me a necessary part of feeling sexually attracted. 

I know it is her body and she has total right to privacy, but I really don't want to pursue this romantically (since sexual attraction is an important part of a romantic relationship to me), if she's not post-op.

The question: Is there a polite and respectful way of asking her that, since she doesn't say it on her profile?

I like her a lot as a person already, and I'd really like to be friends with her, regardless of the answer. So, it's not about discrimination, just personal preference.

Thanks for your help!"

amon_erin,asktransgender,Head feels weird?,"So I'll have been on HRT for 3 months as of next Tuesday. I know lately I've posted quite often about feelings of giving up. I think I've worked out that it's the dysphoria presenting in a different way and teaming up with depression to make my life miserable. Plus, there's outside stress at work. 

Anyway. For the first couple months I would get headaches pretty consistently, but those mostly went away. I was worried those were a sign I should stop. Now my anxiety has me worried about other things. One of them is still my head. My head doesn't exactly feel great. Like my temples feel kind of weird. Almost like it's a tension headache? Anyone else have this?

It's possible my salt is low. I had my second blood test on Monday and my sodium was low, so perhaps that has something to do with it.

My anxiety likes to get the best of me and drive me to places I don't want to go. Like, I'm becoming more comfortable and feel like I'm starting to finally accept myself as trans. At least the last couple days. And, yet, my anxiety makes me worried that I need to stop because I made the wrong call with HRT.

Perhaps this is because I've been fairly inconsistent with the time I take my pills at (2mg Estradiol sublingual/50mg spiro twice a day). I guess I just need some reassurance that I'm not alone in feeling this way and that this isn't a sign I'm lying to myself (which I don't feel like I am). I know it's going to take a while for my body to readjust to this new, and as far as I'm concerned, correct hormone in my body. I'm just worried."

Malimestar,asktransgender,How to accept effemacy,"Hey people, not sure if this question comes across often but here is my problem:
I am 25 years old man and I grew up beliveing I was gay. But I have made a huge mistake by pretending to be someone I am not for my entire life. The thing is I realised I like men when I was 10 years old, even before I would rather notice a nice guy than a girl. But since I was rather effeminate, and would spend more time with girls than boys, in high school I started to change my self, i became more masculine and getting from one straight relationship to another I pretended I am someone that I actually am not. Now since I came out about month or so, my world fell down when I started to behave more like me, because it's like I don't know who I am any more, i never wanted to be girl, as for my appearance I always wanted to look more masculine I have wide hips and it made me feel bad about my self. The problem is that when I do something effeminate I feel different, I feel like I am woman, I am starting with therapy next week and hope that they will help me what is going on with me, but the thing is I never nor now want to be a girl, I dont have body dysphoria inside I feel very effeminate but don't know how to act on it or how to accept it. I always had small moves but didn't notice them before and it seems like I can't start loving my self for who I am since to me it seems like I forgot who I am anymore. Most of the time I act like I am used to (musculine guy) but never felt like that, I do enjoy thing that are usually agendered not manly not womanly, but why do I feel different when I do something gayish? I started asking my gender and I realy don't know who or what I am any more. It seems to me that when I do something naturaly I judge myself by telling that is something that straight man would never do! Has anyone had these experiences and how did it come out? I would like to accept my self for who I realy am but since I left myself 15 years ago I don't know where to start or how to accept something I have no idea about. I do feel I am effeminate but behaving like it makes me uncomfortable.  And since I started questing my gender I did try cross dressing and it was somewhat OK.  Didnt feel weird but nothing spectacular. Dress did fit me well :D since as I mentitled I do have wider hips  but thats all, it's weird but wearing dress made me feel more manly if that's possible. Please help. Sometimes I think I am deluding my self into not being trans but not for a moment I felt the wish to become one just that I would maybe fit better in womans role in the society, but thats not the point right?

Guy here. I have a great relationship with a magnificent girlfriend. She happens to be trans but my question doesn't really go about that. With christmas fast approaching comes also the giving of presents!

Now I bought loads of presents, some personal, some useful but nothing really regarding her transition. Especially since last months have been rough on her. The doubts, the insecurities etc. all taking a toll on her. But I'm proud to say that she truly pulled through like a real trooper!

Ultimately I want to give her something that says: ""hey you're doing great"" and/or ""I'm proud of you"". The kicker is, I absolutely suck at giving gifts like that.

madmusician,asktransgender,I don't know how I can ever possibly come out. (Vent ahead).,"I come from an extremely large and traditional Roman Catholic family (sans father, who is hardcore Christian). To give an idea of this my mother has 10 children, I am one of 26 grandchildren, there are 28 great grands, and 5 great greats about to become 9. 

I also graduated with my BME have been working the last 6-7 months in a factory.

I am absolutely terrified of ever coming out. I've heard my folks and sister (four years older than me) talk about trans issues and it disgusts me because of their clear transphobia and ignorance. My job... Hell I work with some of the scummiest people I know and my work has no policies protecting me and I have a suspicion that if I were to come out then I would find myself without a job pretty soon after doing so.

I do have a few close friends (close as in check in on me once and a while and have bought me some clothes/etc... Use female pronouns in private to each other along with my chosen name) but the temptation to come out is overbearing anymore. In fact I almost came out on Christmas. I just can't bear to hide it anymore, really... And desperately want to start HRT.

However if my folks disown me I have no health insurance and will struggle to afford it if I have to get it myself... And if work finds out I am out of a job and will likely lose my studio apartment, become delinquent on my student loans, etc etc. I am just... So fucked.

People will tell me that I have so much time ahead of me, but in my reality I don't. I am 24, nearly 25, and wished I would have started HRT years ago before puberty finished with my hips of all.... ARGH. So much... Too much just too many thoughts, fears, wishes, and more. My depression is overbearing anymore because of it and I just want to die.

Sorry for the rant.. just... Needed to vent. I have more to say and can expand upon but should probably just shut up now.

--After two months I'm using the #2 and #3 dilators. Should I be thinking about getting #4? I'd like to be able to have PiV sex.

--I'm down to twice a day per instructions but insertion is still uncomfortable and sometimes painful (once I get it in it's usually fine). Should I be thinking about moving back to three times a day?

QuestioningMtF1,asktransgender,Am I always going to have uncertainty over my gender?,"So here's my story. I'm amab 20yo, and have been questioning off and on for about 5 months. I'm at a point now where I'm not making any progress and want to stop questioning and move on. I've come to decide I'm probably CIS as I'm pretty sure I enjoy being a guy and don't have the desire to transition or be female. I feel like I can't let it go though and will always have an uncertainty about this in the back of my mind. This is due to 1) having tons in common w/ other MTFs here and 2) would have been diagnosed w/ gender dysphoria at the age of 13-15. These things really make me wonder how I could be CIS despite feeling that I am. Will I always have to deal w/ this uncertainty? "

So, I'm not the best at communicating and I'm a little nervous. 

***I really, really hope this doesn't come off as disrespectful or sarcastic.*** 

I'm being 100% genuine, I promise. 


I'm a female in her mid 20's.

But I've never ever fit the ""norm"" when it comes to my gender.

If anything, I'm more of a male stereotype.

thick and kinda muscular, short hair, likes to get muddy and sweaty. likes snakes and bugs. into carpentry. DOES NOT wear makeup or heels or dresses or the like. ears aren't pierced. never shaves my bodyhair. crude jokes, foul language. 

You know, all that stuff.

But

I don't think I'm Trans.. I've never felt like I'm ""a guy""..? I just think ""ok i'm female and i'm also all these things.""
and I guess that's what confuses me so much.

Because to me, anyone can do or like or be or wear anything regardless of their gender, right? 

So when I think about what MAKES a dude a dude or a lady a lady

I can't... really come up with any *real* separations between the two. Anything I come up with is just a silly socially constructed falsehood like ""oh, only girls wear dresses"" or other goofy shit.


So.. what is it about a ""man"" or ""woman"" that makes someone feel like they ARE that rather than what they already are? What's the difference? Is it.. just a genital thing..? That makes even less sense to me somehow..


Again, **I'm not trying to be rude or make any kind of point or hurt anybody's feelings!**
I'm just looking for some understanding. It's hard for me to empathize with transgendered individuals without it, and that makes me sad. 


I'd really appreciate some discussion!"
Jazz8680,asktransgender,How long does it take for HRT changes to become permanent? (AMAB),"So I've been questioning heavily for the past few weeks. I'm planning way ahead, but when I go off to grad school in the fall of next year (or even during the summer), I'm considering going to an informed consent clinic to try HRT. I think I'll really enjoy the changes and it'll finally put my mind at ease. 

But in the event that I don't like what's happening, how long does it take for changes to become permanent? I've read that things like fat distribution and skin softness will reverse if I stop, and breast tissue won't reverse. What other stuff will reverse and won't reverse?

How long do people typically try HRT to see if it's right for them? How short is too short and how long is too long? Especially when going through informed consent when seeing a therapist for a note isn't possible. "

Queenrenowned,asktransgender,Getting overwhelmed,"I just need to say this to other people and I don't know anyone irl to talk to about this. I'm just getting really overwhelmed by all of this and I'm not sure how to keep myself grounded. It keeps on getting worse the older I get, because maybe I'm putting things off too late but I can't bear to talk to my parents about transitioning (I'm out btw). I don't feel like I can escape as both exits look so daunting. I just needed to get this off my chest, thanks for reading."
queerquestioning,asktransgender,Currently Questioning and Unsure About HRT and the Future,"I have always had a feeling that I wanted to dress up in female clothing, this started when I was very young and questioned why I was not allowed to wear a dress or makeup. As I grew older I found myself asking other friends (mainly boys) if they had felt the desire to dress in women's clothing (usually the answer was no and it made me feel more ostracized). As I entered into grade school and high school I would actively seek opportunities to crossdress (usually Halloween). I still felt strange at the time (namely because I went to an all-boys Catholic school). As I have grown older I do feel very attracted to women, never really felt attracted to men, and have always had the opportunity to cross-dress with girlfriends, to a limited extent. 

Quite recently I have had the opportunity to date a very accepting, wonderful person. She herself has never dated a girl, well-versed in Queer theory, and helped me to better ask questions which had plagued my mind, namely about gender. 

Even more recently, I had the strength to come out as Queer -- I truly don't feel to be one gender or another, I sometimes do express more masculine traits but also many times desire more feminine traits. Since coming out as Queer, I have had a rush of energy where I have explored this more, bought full wardrobes of female clothing, and even a wig. I have also begun to seek talk therapy.

However now, more and more, I have this desire which has been racking my brain daily. Just thinking about it has pulled me out of depressive thoughts (and I am usually very happy-go-lucky and optimistic). Lately I have been thinking about actually undergoing HRT and beginning to take estrogen, antiandrogens, etc. I am not sure how far I would want to go though -- or if I have the courage or even doing the right thing. This makes it all so much more complicated because even though my current girlfriend is accepting, I think she wanted me to stop at Queer -- and I feel as if I am going deeper as wanting to actually be seen as female (and actually identifying as a female consistently).

I suppose my main question here is this: 

How did you know it was time to begin HRT? How did you know that you were going to begin? Was there ever any regret? Tell me your story! Is it too early in my questioning to begin considering this? Thank you for any and all advice and stories!"

But is that dysphoria?"
swallowingadamsapple,asktransgender,Where to go from here?,"Back in August, I was diagnosed as Gender Dysphoric by my psychologist, but did not get a letter and cannot go back because he is now retired. Do I need the letter or just a diagnosis to start HRT? I have heard that informed consent is easier and faster, but I think it is only available to those over 21 here in NY (9 months). 

I feel more able to transition than ever before because I have fully accepted that I am trans, no longer have any doubts, have lost the anxiety and fear that I used to have that would prevent me from doing things such as shopping for female clothes, telling others that I am trans, and care less about what other people think. However, my parents (who I live with) still don't accept it very well. I feel like they either will not support me, or will give me some kind of reluctant support, which will both make attempting to transition more stressful because of their potential reactions and is inspiring me to handle this on my own by getting a job to fund my transition, which will be difficult because of school and many employers that would not want to hire a trans person. I used to care about how my parents felt and thought that transitioning would make me feel guilty, but now I don't care what they will think, but want to wait until after Christmas to tell them again.

I have also been trying to figure out how to use makeup and speaking in a realistic female voice. I am at the beta stage for my voice and I still need to perfect makeup. I have also never presented as a woman in public, but I think that my biggest obstacles to passing are my dark beard shadow and thick eyebrows."

conf4sed,asktransgender,dulcigender?,"What's the general opinion of ""poorly-contested"" non-binary identities, such as those listed here: http://nonbinary.org/wiki/List_of_poorly-attested_nonbinary_identities

For example: ""dulcigender. (Coined by transmomoi). An aesthetically-centered gender that is associated largely with stereotypically feminine things (such as pinks, frills, buns, and general cute things).[75]""

I mean, my understanding of being transgender is to have gender dysphoria. Being interested in stereotypically feminine things like ""pinks, frills, buns and general cute things"" can't constitute a new gender, it has nothing to do with gender, it's just fashion.

Yet according to the website, if at least 10 people identify as it, or evidence that lots of people identify as it, or it's notable because of either a popular news story, or a website has allowed it to be chosen as a gender, or a community has been organised around it, it can be moved to the page of formal non-binary identities.

Who honestly agrees with this and thinks that if someone identifies as something like dulcigender, that they are actually transgender?"
Malimestar,asktransgender,Need information about FEELING trans,"So, since there is no transgender person in my town and there are any few in my whole country I figure this is the place to ask, and everyone is wellcome to put their toughts here. 
The question is HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE TRANS? 
For the last 15 days I have been going trough hell abou not knowing if I am trans woman or gay man, now I still don't know but I accept both possibilities. I know it is not connected and that people should not mix those two but hear me out, for the most of my life I believed to be gay man, but behaved like straight dude, when I was younger I did feel a bit feminate and I wanted to behave manly so much that I have locked down all of it. Didn't have any problems with my behavior loved my body my penis whas my best friend, I felt guilty for behaving like straight man until I Couldn't take it anymore and I came out. Next 15 days were best time of my life and I felt wonderful, until one night I was high and question popped in my head was I woman all along? Do I FEEL like woman. 
What does feeling like a woman feel to you? Becouse I don't know if I am feeling like a woman or I have suppressed my effeminate side so much that now when I came out I can't handle it, like I don't know how to be effeminate. I don't have any gender dysphoria nor social, it feels weird when I talk to my self in female word ( I speak serbian, so my lenguage is gendered in every way). But the feeling of falling in love with a man for the first time was so beautiful that I was in clouds, but that didn't last long and he left, that was the moment I felt like left woman, my emotions were strange to me my heart broke. And than I started asking my gender. Also having sex was so pleasurable but also weird in a way since I haven't done anything down there for years (I am bottom). 
So how did you feel like a woman? 
I don't feel like woman when I write this nor I feel like one 99% of the time, but in some momets strange feeling goes trough me especially when I do something effeminate.  I started asking my self what makes me woman, or do I want to be one? My answers are I don't know and no. But than ferfull feeling goes trough when something inside me says you will have to. Becouse l do enjoy having penis but in my mind woman cant have penis. I was not able to touch it nor I can think of sex these days like I became asexual in a way. In my deepest core I do behave like a woman, but not a 25 year old girl I feel like I have atributes of a 50 years old woman :D but non of this makes me one, feeling emotions behaving it is all human not woman or man, yet since this confusion started and I can't get rid of it, it feels like he'll,  I started questioning my every move, do I stand like woman do I tipe like woman do I drive like woman etc. And I know that still none ov this makes me one. 
I want to be a bit more effeminate but when I try to it doesn't feel right, yet sometimes I have an urge (two nights ago I felt tingling in my hips, I wanted to do a catwalk but when I did nothing happened). So can anyone of you tell me what the heck is going on with me, ond sorry for the long post, it's just part of everything I am going trough :D 
Allso i do feel like all of this will make me stronger person  (if it doesn't kill me) but if I am trans woman where do I start, does that mean that all of my manly decidions were false and my whole life was a lie, becouse it feels like anyway yet I don't know weather this was because of pretending to be straight and blending in wrong way or because I was woman all along and didn't know I was one.

AmeliaVoyax,asktransgender,Hormones before HRT.,"Hi!  TL;Dr at bottem. I have been doing research as we all should, and I was looking into what I can do to achieve a more feminine look before starting HRT. I'm going to be in the closest for a very long time, Im already growing my hair out and going to get it cut in April.   
  
I was looking at hormones that could help, mainly progestogens and I was hoping somebody could shed some more light on them for me. I've been on the Wikipedia page and reading about some good benefits for MtFs. (Mostly fat distribution is what I am interested in)   
  
The main problem is that I only seem to find cremes online, personally I think cremes are ineffective and don't compare to pills.   I would love everybody's opinion on hormones I can take before I start HRT.   
  
Edit: the main reason I'm not starting HRT is because of my anxiety it's very severe and controls basically everything in my life. I fight it as much as I can, going outside is super hard especially with this -30 weather but I still manage to make a trip outside atleast once a week. I even made this second account just Incase my 1 friend who's on reddit ever finds my other account and checks out my posts. It's going to take me atleast a year before I can even talk to a doctor about it, if even then. Thank you all for the comments so far.

TL;DR - what hormones in pill form can I take to look more feminine before starting HRT. Since I'll be in the close for years. "

My endocrinologist says that I will definitely not turn anything near as feminine and pretty as a cis girl because I am already through puberty and my genes don't allow my body to make this stuff happen, my parents still think that I magically turn into a real girl. My older sister is the only one who understands it and knows that my body can't do this, probably because she is a doctor.

ffsthrowaway26,asktransgender,"Has anyone here had conservative FFS, and then second FFS after realizing round one wasn't enough?","Basically, the question is in the title.  I had full FFS recently with a good surgeon, and as the swelling goes down I realize it wasn't enough.  And it's not because of unfixable issues with my skull/face.  I was lucky enough to have a skull size comparable to my cis female friends, and the distance between my eyes and mouth is pretty standard for women.

The problem is that for the first full FFS, I feel that we went too conservative.  My surgeon and I agreed to not reduce my jaw width, but the chin work we did made the lower face look wider than before because it emphasized the untouched jaw.  I hadn't considered this.  We decided not to lower my hairline (despite doing forehead work), because he thought my hairline height was ok.  Now my forehead looks female, but it just looks too high/huge.  I was hesitant when he asked about how much fat transfer to use for the lips, and now while they look slightly fuller, they still look too thin.  They practically look the same.

Looking back, I realize that it was signals I was sending my surgeon.  I went in with a huge fear of being too aggressive and coming out looking unnatural, and I emphasized that more than once.  Now I realize that was a mistake.  I will ask about revisions once that time comes, but I have a feeling the work I need done is more than the typical scope of an FFS revision.  Plus, it's not like it was a surgery mistake.  I feel like I wasted so much money because of my hesitation.

Now I'm realizing I will need more work done, and it's my fault.  Has anyone else experienced something similar?  What did you do/how did it work out for you?  Is this a common thing that happens - the first FFS job not being enough, and then getting more FFS down the road?  I'm just looking for others who have been through something similar.  Thanks."
TheGZella,asktransgender,I was accidentally sexist in RPGs for years :/,"I either flipped a coin or switched back/forth for character gender when given the option, both in video games or on the table top.

Once I accepted my status as a transwoman, I realised almost every male character was some kind of caricature, moron, and/or nutcase.

I guess it boils down to just plain not understanding the male psyche, but I still feel bad about having this view of men.

Snap decisions with little regard to the consequences, reactionary behaviour, ""might makes right"". Ugh. I can't believe I did that.

Well, my first DnD character was decent, if ludicrous. That whole campaign was nutty. I should have moved on from that, though.

On the flip side, every female character had a code to live by, thought things through, used diplomacy honestly, avoided conflict when possible (that is to say, not in Skyrim ;P )... 

It was such a facepalm moment. One more thing on the list of ""Why did it take me over 30 years of denial?""

tachibanakanade,asktransgender,How long does HRT continue to change the body? Did low doses fuck up my transition?,"I've been on HRT for 5 years. My dose for estrogen remained constantly low compared to other trans women throughout that time (.5 mL (out of a 40 mg/ml vial) for injections, 2mg for pills, recently upped to 5mg in pill form), my estrogen levels were never checked. My doses for Spiro and Prometrium remained the same too (200mg spiro, 200mg Prometrium).  
  
I worry that keeping my dose so low compared to other trans women fucked up my transition. I achieved C cup breasts, fat redistribution was decent (I'm fat though, so it's hardly noticeable), and I pass in all my normal encounters with non-chaser cis people...but I feel like more could have been achieved.  
  
So my questions are: now that my estrogen dose has been increased to 5mg, will it make a difference? Will HRT still change my body 5 years after starting it? Also, did my doctors fuck up?"

[deleted],asktransgender,Feel like I'm getting pushed into stuff,"So my mum, therapist, GP &amp; some friends know, but that's pretty much it. Everyone seems to be cool with it but I feel like I'm getting pressure from my family's side to tell everyone. Two main things:

* my mum thinks I should tell my siblings about ""my plans"" as soon as possible, so that they can have enough time to ""prepare mentally"".
* I'm going on holiday to visit other family members tomorrow, and my mum is suggesting I/she tell them before we go because otherwise they're likely to make comments e.g. ""lol that's a girl's hat you know! Why are you wearing one??""

I know she means well and is trying to reduce harm/me feeling uncomfortable, but equally it just feels like I am getting pressured into telling people now when in fact I don't want to yet. Just makes me want to run away from it all. 

Any advice on how to deal with this? Am I being overly sensitive?"
Jazz8680,asktransgender,HRT while questioning?,"I've seen a lot of people here who haven't figured themselves out yet, but are still on HRT. Is this a common thing? Like if I'm not sure what I am, but want to go on HRT to see how it affects me, is that a valid option? And if so, what are the steps to do it?"
ILikeSchecters,asktransgender,How can I stop worrying about validity?,"I’m driving myself crazy with waiting. Ive been on hormones for a tad bit over a month in a half, and I’m starting to stress myself out. So far, I know I’ve had changes. Im much more emotional and I find myself crying at things I used to just not care about. My skin is slightly softer. I have breast buds, too. The entirety of my nipple is super hard and painful to touch. They started forming about two to three weeks in - but, I haven’t seen much of a difference in the past week or so. Obviously, something is happening, but for some reason, I can’t keep myself from accepting that and just let it happen slowly. I’ve had my T and E levels checked, and everything is where it should be. I know it isn’t logical to expect changes so quick, but I can’t emotionally stop myself from wanting them and pretty much obsessing over it. I spend much more time thinking about it than I would like. Im currently home on break and can’t stop looking into mirror and seeing if there’s any noticeable change. Especially with breasts, I just don’t quite know what to expect, or what to look for. I know, obviously, that you get buds, then boobs, but I have no clue what is in between. 

I feel like my comfortability to be myself is so focused on whether or not I see differences. I feel so horrible that I have not been able to be my true self with my family like I am with some of my friends. They have been so supportive - hell my mom got me some super pretty jewelry for Christmas, and she’s only seen me dressed once. Yet, the thought of them seeing me as myself makes me feel like a fraud. It’s definitely tied into me looking for changes. I don’t feel valid. Almost all of my actions for the past month have been tied into looking for some sort of validity, some sort of green light that says I can go. I won’t feel like a girl until I see boobs, soft skin, even thought when I look at myself and pictures of myself in girl mode, I actually feel good about it.

I've been on hormones (estrogen 4mg/day, spiro 200mg/day) for coming up on five months and while it has done incredible things for making me feel more comfortable in my body, some issues are coming up and I'm not sure if they have to do with the medications themselves or are things I've dealt with my whole life and am only now starting to understand - I'm planning on seeking help soon but was wondering if any other people on transfeminine HRT have had similar experiences?

I find myself feeling sometimes like I am interacting with the world through a fog, looking and focusing on things becomes more difficult, and I feel very divorced from my surroundings - it doesn't seem to happen in response to specific things but is worst when it occurs when I'm around other people because it makes interacting with them practically impossible. I'm just really not sure if these are associated with taking the medications or if they are things I am just dealing with now in the process of becoming a more emotionally self-aware person in transitioning. HRT has almost completely eliminated my dysphoria and the idea of it being also responsible for this is really scary - has anyone else felt anything similar or found any ways to help mediate it?"

Jazz8680,asktransgender,A couple of confusing things I could really use help understanding NSFW,"(AMAB)

So today I went out with my friends for the first time in like a week. I've kept all my gender questioning things bottled up inside but have been slowly expressing them more when I am alone. The feelings I feel are real, but I still don't quite know if I'm trans. 

The weird thing was that the dysphoria I was feeling while I was alone almost completely disappeared when I was with my friends. Like, it was reduced from like a 7 down to a 1.5. What does this mean? 

This creates another question. If I'm looking at my identity and how I feel, which feelings do I trust? Do I trust the ones I feel when I'm alone by myself, or do I trust the ones I feel when I'm surrounded by friends? 


(NSFW) Another thing I wanted to ask about was masturbation. I used to do it every night before I went to sleep. It helped keep me fall asleep and my kept me numb to my emotions. I think it helps me stay focused on school. 

Once I stared seriously questing I stopped so that I could explore these feelings more, since I started to realize that I was just numbing myself. A couple of weeks went by, then last night testosterone won and I had to masturbate to relieve the stupid testosterone induced sexual tension. Afterwards it was like I had erased all my feelings. I just felt neutral about gender, like I had never really questioned it. I really disliked how neutral it made me feel. But here I am now, a day later, questioning again. 

It was a really confusing experience, and while I don't really have bad genital dysphoria, I didn't like that it made me so confused about what I actually felt. 

Any thoughts, advice, or similar experiences? "

transtacos,asktransgender,MTF HRT - Should I add Progesterone?,"I'm currently on my third month of HRT. Up until this month, I've just been getting up to my ""normal"" doses (2mg 2x daily oral Estradiol and 50mg 2x daily Spironolactone). I've heard about some people taking Progesterone in addition to their regular HRT, either pills or cream, for breast development. I've had pretty good results on just my E alone (noticeable breast growth in the first few weeks), and now that I've started Spiro I'm seeing even more results.

Now, I've heard a lot of different things about Progesterone. It works. It doesn't work. Increased risk, little reward. ""OMG I GREW BOOBS OVERNIGHT!"" And the testimonies are from people on hormones that are different or named something other than what I'm taking. And then there's the wait-until-you're-a-year-or-more-on-HRT-to-start crowd versus the do-it-whenever crowd. 

It's so damn confusing.

So now I've got a few Questions: Should I ask my doctor (next appointment in March) about adding Progesterone? Is it worth it? Does it work? Should I wait a while before I start? 

Thanks in advance. &lt;3"
leviathan_t,asktransgender,Honestly not sure what to think right now...,"A bit of backstory, came to terms with being mtf trans several month ago and have been on HRT for about a week now.  No one knows except for my sister who was initially very supportive but I've suspected hasn't actually really believed me or isn't in fact okay with it.  

Before I get into what happened today, want to mention that since I came out to her I have definitely noticed that she takes every opportunity to essentially lecture me on the struggles of women and so on.  This in itself isn't a bad thing at all, except it obviously made me feel terrible (although I never said anything) since she implicitly did it in a way to exclude me from this grouping, as if I was one of these supposed despicable men out raping relentlessly or whatever.  In either case, it was obvious that she definitely only saw me as male and would likely continue to do so.  Alright fine.

So today the topic of rape actually came up and needless to say it did not end well.  The main thing that set it off was that she made the claim that its better to just convict all accused men of rape since there are far less of them then the victims.  I'm obviously not okay with ""guilty until innocent"" so pointed out that this is flawed.  This immediately got her to scream at me that she's been raped and that every female she knows has also been. To make a very long story short, she said the following after:  
""That I am not a woman, nor ever will be.""  I actually finally brought this up when she kept lumping me in with all the supposed terrible men while she was yelling at me.  I asked her straight up, ""So obviously, I'm not a woman then?""  Which her response was explicitly ""Of course not.""  She basically made the connection that anyone saying what I was saying, couldn't be a woman. ""That I am unable to talk to women"" and am ""not ready to?""  And lastly, ""that I will never understand how hard it is to be a woman.""

All in all, this has really messed me up on several levels.  Her comments don't have me questioning or anything since at this point I know who I am, but that in addition to her rape bombshell and the way the argument progressed showed that whether truthful or not, she obviously intended to use it to guilt me into agreeing with her on certain political points.  Not to mention, it sort of shamed me as a transwoman implying I am some sort of fraud which I really thought was fucked up unless I agreed with her.   She made the argument that as a woman, you had to automatically believe any other woman who claims to have been raped.  I didn't agree but excluded her own case stating that she falls under the category of someone I trust &amp; know (although that is questionable at this point), but my disagreement to her was evidence showing I cannot be a real woman.

Not sure what I expect from a response, but if anyone actually took the time to read through all of this, certainly appreciate it.  I'm sort of at a loss on how to proceed.  Part of me wonders how to repair this relationship, but the other part wonders if the things she said were truthful and not simply out of spite, whether that is something that I should even do.  Its also probably worth mentioning that as of now, my sister is basically my only support in real-life when it comes to this which is a total bag of shit."
--harley--quinn--,asktransgender,Why do I even bother?,"I'm seriously having trouble finding motivation.

Not that I feel like I'll ever look remotely ""good"" anyway. Not to mention paying for shit is already an issue in the first place.

Bokken1603,asktransgender,"If you could take a pill to cure gender dysphoria, would you?","Basically I've been struggling a lot with understanding and accepting the transgender community. I used to come from a very hateful place, but I've since opened my mind, met new people, and I feel like I've made a lot of progress.

As I understand it, being transgender is usually a treatment for gender dysphoria. If you're a guy with gender dysphoria, your brain thinks ""I should have a female's body, this is really wrong"", and you feel uncomfortable and depressed.

Being transgender is like a treatment for that disorder. You change your body so your brain thinks ""hey, now I have a woman's body! Everything feels *right* now!"".

If I have that correct, then my question is: if we could invent a way to change the way your *brain* thinks about your body, would you go that route instead?

Instead of changing the body so it fits the mind, we would be able to change the *mind* so it fits with the body.

I'm asking this because I think that a pill would be so much less hassle for people suffering from gender dysphoria, and we should definitely get scientific research and funding for it in order to develop it."

justsallygirl,asktransgender,[psychology of transition] how do I deal with guilt?,"This topic comes up on the forums, in my personal life with friends and family, and in my own head pretty often. I certainly haven't perfected the approach but I've come to the following conclusions. Perhaps it will help others struggling with the question. 

----

""**How do I deal with guilt**? 
--
&gt; *Why do I feel it in the first place and how do I move on? Good things happen and then I find myself feeling guilty about being happy. It's so cyclical.*"" 
---

---

*how does one deal with guilt*... which is another version of *""how can I be kind to myself despite the past, despite the digressions of self, despite actions to the contrary to that which I now know to be deviations from my truth?""*

I can go into a lot of variations on the subject. the simplest is to just let the past go, let it be in the past. accept that it is out of the realm of control, that you cannot change anything about what happened or what you feel guilty about other than to change how you *perceive* the past to be. 

there's a distinction there between revisionist history and revising your interpretations of positive and negative. our minds are programmed from a young age to desire a system of binaries; black/white. cold/hot. good/bad. male/female. right/wrong. 

all of those are nonsense of course. they're just words. but words carry so much meaning with us, as our primary shared means of relating that which is inherently unrelatable... even in our internalized dialog. the past is mutable. but what is real and what is memory - they're both just responses of our senses, synapses firing. wht we're left with is an imprint of the sensory realm by which our brain *at that time and place* perceived it to be. and so with that mutability, is our past really so essential to how we experience and feel the *now*? it all gets to a bit fuzzy when hormones start to change the sensory realm - when now we can see in color a life that previously was limited to greyscale - back in The Before Times.  

so with memory, and therefore with guilt, it's important to remember that we are not the sum of our pasts; yet we would be nothing without the memories of that which we had sensed during the Now of Then. so how do we store those senses of Now... and how do we recall them accurately? does it matter? 

the remembrance - the guilt - this action begets introspection, which is inherently positive because it implies the potential for change. guilt is a neurological process by which we evaluate events and create direction into the future by means of our current capabilities of reason, logic, and emotion. guilt catalyzes change. 

so to stop feeling guilty... to stop what? this? to stop how we feel in the Now? to stop how we store our memories of the sensory realm? that's impossible. 

Guilt is from the Old English 'gylt' -- *""crime, sin, moral defect, failure of duty.""* it is of unknown origin, though some suspect a connection to Old English gieldan ""to pay for, debt,"" but OED editors find this ""inadmissible phonologically."" -- it's all just nonsense, these words. 

when you really look back at the past, you did what you did with what you had available at the time, in your best heart, to carry you until you came into being *Right Now*. **there is nothing to feel bad about**. not from the past, not from the now, not from the you inside that is aching to come out and to become what will be you Then, which is eventually going to be Now before you know it. 

you get over the guilt and the pain from the past by accepting that there is nothing to *feel bad* about in the first place, because inherently *you are a good person*; worthy of love and compassion, doing your best and seeking truth -- which is a nebulous term, ultimately, but one that says we are moving in a direction that leads us to the calmest current... the current that brings about positive change, the current that does not fight against the realities before us, the current that accepts and embodies the struggle and understands deep down that the struggle is all we have - and inside of that struggle is beauty and the inevitability of which all humans face; completion. we live in so much contrast... we are capable of so much binary and so much in between; the spectrum of emotion is what makes us whole. how can there be room for guilt, a word based in flawed language of years gone by?

so. what is life but change? for good or bad or mistakes or pain or challenge or even non-action... life *is* change. existence is nothing but movement towards and within the current. our ever changing now. 

where is guilt in the Now? it's nothing more than a word that explains previous programming from our earlier days that has no place in the Now. no regrets, no guilt... **we are a spectrum and all of it is beautiful in its own ways.**

Saturdalia,asktransgender,"I feel like I had a ""guardian angel "" today?","This is a weird story, so maybe I'm reading too much into it. Today I went shopping for girls clothes for only the second time, at Goodwill. I felt fine about doing it, but only under the pretense of ""I'm shopping for my girlfriend don't I have such shitty taste lol??"" since I'm nowhere near coming out yet.

The cashier was a woman who didn't seem super nice -- not mean, just not very talkative to the people who came through in line before me. But when I put my skirt on the counter and implied that it was for someone else (and I thought I was being cool about it), she immediately got really nice and we talked about the CD Walkman that I was also buying, never mentioned the women's clothing. And then, instead of bagging it in the typical translucent plastic bag, she got an opaque reusable bag from under the counter and used that. Didn't mention it, didn't charge me. And as I was walking out, she said goodbye and ""Stay out of trouble now."" Which is such an odd and specific way to end a conversation. Later, I looked at my receipt and there was no item for women's clothing, just two that read ""electronics"". It all seemed like she was trying to help me ""cover my tracks"" and be covert. And she was so quick to not bring up the skirt in conversation, so that I would be comfortable. It might sound like a stretch, but it seemed like she was looking out for me. On top of all that, I would have guessed that she was transgender, although of course I hate to assume, and it was far from obvious. 

I dunno. Anyone ever have an experience like that? I didn't think I needed that but it made me feel really supported when it could have been awkward or difficult.

I obsess over all these details, like ""I don't have enough clothes,"" or ""I'm too fat"" or ""It'll be weird at restaurants when the waiter sees a male name on my credit card"" or just the basic ""People are going to look at me funny for the rest of my life because I'm too tall/masculine/whatever."" And if none of that works, then my brain plays the ""Maybe you're not really trans"" card, which is bullshit but still trips me up even after all this time.

Is this a sign that I need to wait, or that I need to just push through it? That's what I can't decide. I don't want to do something I'm not ready for, but I also know that I will let fear keep me from doing things that are good for me if I'm not careful.

Most cis girls I know either don't have glasses most of the time, or wear contacts. I've got very poor eyesight, and need my glasses on all the time. They are also fairly large because of this (not hipster large, more like needs to be a certain size to actually hold my -7 lenses.) 

Contacts just don't do it for me, I can't see as well out of them. I also can't get super femme frames because I still have need to present guy mode sometimes. 

Maybe I'm just over stressing this, but does anyone have any thoughts for me on this?"
[deleted],asktransgender,any gamer trans girls feel dysphoria from playing games?,"I want to know of I'm not alone. does anyone else, pre op/hrt or post op/hrt like really ""manly"" video games? I like shooters like cs:go and doom, (I play a doom mod that adds in really intense gore) RPGs like skyrim, and a lot of fighting games. I know I shouldn't feel this way... but I sometimes feel like I'm too manly to be a girl, in the fact that I have a lot of traditionally male interests"
henrysthrowaway,asktransgender,Waaaa! First male fail!,"Two+ months into HRT now. My muscles have toned down, but my breasts are still tiny(and tender). I don't think I really pass but I try my best.

I was told my first male fail is going to be fun. I didn't believe you guys.

I was wrong. There I was, in a hotel waiting for my date. I'm dressed in unisex clothes, jacket, make up and looking at my phone when the bell boy came asked me ""Can I help you, miss?""

I was ecstatic. I have had my male fail 15+ years ago when I had long hair, but that was before I realize I'm trans.

Do remember I live in Hong Kong,  a not-so-trans friendly city where people don't bother to recognize and correctly gender you if you don't pass. The bell boy genuinely believed I'm a girl. To see my effort to pay off makes me super super happy.

Yes, you guys are right. Your first male fail can be fun.

Very fun!

I'm jumping up and down inside and I'm going to jump up and down when I get inside my flat tonight."

QuothTheSeagull,asktransgender,Productive things to do in early transition?,"I started HRT (mft) and electrolysis in early November and already it's become sort of routine. That's not really a bad thing, but I have a burning desire to stay active and productive for transition related things. I want to do everything I can now to make transition easier in the future. 

So far all I'm really doing is voice training and a daily 5 minute butt exercise. I feel like I could be doing more but I'm not sure what! I'd love to hear what some of you did to pass the time and stay busy in those awkward first few months of transitioning.  "
honaka_namnah,asktransgender,I don't know if I'm strong enough. Advice?,"I'm almost 30 years old now and I've only known that I'm trans for 5 months. For years I knew something was wrong with me. Nothing I tried worked and I developed insomnia, depression, addiction and eventually I became suicidal.

And then 5 months ago when I had completely given up, when I had written my suicide note, I suddenly got my answer. It was the first time in my life I actually listened to what my body was telling me. It was my last day on earth anyway so why not have some fun and for some reason I found myself standing in front of the mirror with women's clothing ... the fuck? I was devastated, not because I was trans (I was glad to have an answer) but because I had only found out after I had completely lost hope.

I knew I had to transition so I started as soon as I could but my heart doesn't seem into it. I had tried so many things over the past decade when I still hoped that ""this might be the thing that will make me happy"". I feel like I lost that ability to hope. Nowadays at the end of the day I would still be content with dying. I get these glimpses of how my life could be and I'm overwhelmed with sadness because I honestly don't know if I'm strong enough to get there.

I'm seeing a therapist. I'm taking anti-depressants. Doesn't really help.

I'm sorry about this depressing post but I was kind of hoping if there were people in a similar situation that got through this. That would be good to know. I just don't see it atm.

**tl;dr:** Found out I was trans only after I lost the will to go on. I started to transition but I don't know if I'm strong enough to hold on because I feel broken from how things unfolded."

Malimestar,asktransgender,Transphobia or homophobia,"Dear people, I need help
I am 25 years old man, since I was 10 years  old I knew I was gay, but since I live in pretty homophobic country I started acting straight had a lot of girlfriends. I was nevery bullied in primary and middle school, but I couldn't relate to my guy friends, I was always better with girls and they made me feel comfortabe,  never wanted to be one of them or so but just never was violent enough to be part of boys group. Since highschool started I grew in phisicaly masculine man, I am attractive and made a lot of friends guys and girls, yet since guys don't open so easy and I am very talkative I still am more connected with women in my life. I feel i am very effeminate in fact but social status made me behave like like masculine. I came out 40 days ago, and it was all flowers and rainbows, but than I fell in love with a man and soon my heart was broken. During these few days I was happiest gay on earth, but when I started behaving like I felt it didn't feel like me, I kind of felt like woman. Like I would naturaly stand in tipical woman posture, and I would would feel in my gut that it was different me. Since I have no idea of gender roles in gay relationship I was very confused. And than one day out of sudden question popped in my head ""are you woman?"" Ever since than I can't get rid of it. I hid from being gay for so long that making me one made me think of my self as woman and I am not sure if I am homophobic and can't accept I am gay or trans phobic and can't accept the fact that I was woman all along but couldnt see that since I was behaving all manly. I never enjoyed so many manly activities nor womanly I was always in the middle ( camping, swimming), I wanted to be part of the group but since there is no openly gay society in my town I was coping with what I got and now it makes me miserable.  Thinking of my self as woman makes me miserable, I know I am not manly enough I can act on it but now since I came to realisation that it was all a scam I can't continue to be friends with people I have known for my entire life. I don't have gender dysphoria and I am happy being a boy, but my mind keeps fighting one part of me says you are effeminate gay man and that's it but other side says you are woman. I don't know how to behave effeminate, and I question my self is it possbile that I can't accept the fact I am effeminate and that it would be easier to be woman instead of it. I have few hours a day when I am happy gay man few hours when I say OK you are woman and feel desperate, and 20 hours fighting over and over (and crying every 2 hours is MUST) . Please help me. Is it possible for someone to be transgender without even the slightest wish on it, no dysphoria no nothing, just that at some moments when l let my feeling flow I felt like different person and that I felt like woman (at least that's how I would describe it) 
Sorry for the long post but as you can see my head is spinning all day long about this.  "

Twons,asktransgender,Can I expect safety in small towns?,"For years, I've had a dream of just leaving home and walking. No real destination, just wander around, on foot across the country. I've slowly been preparing for it. I hike a lot and have tested on treadmills to confirm I can walk miles and miles and feel fine later. I've done a few brief homeless stints so I know I can sleep in the most uncomfortable of places without fatigue. I've practiced fasting before. I know I can survive on peanut butter for days.

This has always just been a dream, but circumstances are lining up to make it a good time for me to leave. My lease is expiring in two months, rent is paid up through then, so the next couple months of work is just money in the bank. If I don't do this now, I probably never will.

I'm concerned for my safety though. I'm MtF but don't pass as a woman. I've had enough problems looking like this in a fairly liberal city (I'm in Minneapolis now). I can't imagine how people are gonna treat me at the small towns I'll pass through. Maybe it'll be easier to pass; small towns have less exposure to trans people so they're more likely to shrug off my more masculine traits, but I don't know how much I wanna chance that. Alternatively, I could easily just do this trek in guy mode and be completely safe, but my ID has my girl name and gender which means no going to bars, and if I get in legal trouble, it's gonna take days to convince small town sheriff that that's really me.

My current plan is to head towards the west coast. I've heard I can find a good life out there, and I'd love the scenery along the way. I'll probably meander quite a bit. Currently planning on taking two or three months go get there. 

I guess my main question is, how safe will I be looking obviously trans in the rural west? I'm talking Idaho/Montana/Dakotas. Also, anyone in Minneapolis wanna drop everything and go for a walk?"
sad_girl_k89,asktransgender,Am i trans enough to be medically transition/medically be considered trans,"I've been going nuts with the thought of ""Am i trans enough?""...i basically am pretty feminine, present female, love learning about cooking, love having make up though i'm lazy to put it on and i love pro wrestling and rap (yes rap), besdies liking these two things and maybe liking comedians like George Carlin, i can't think of anything else that's not feminine about me. I love been soft, emotional, nurturing, growing up i never wanted to be a dad but always wanted to be a mom, there was a point in my life (in my teen years) where i acted mascline to kinda protect myself from bullying (which i had been ever since kindergarden basically for being soft, gentle and effemenate) and tried to fit in but it never felt right actually only made me feel worse because i was diverting from who i really wanted to be...am i trans enough in your guys opinion?"
blue_sword456,asktransgender,what do i do,"so, my mom scheduled me to see my therapist tomorrow, to hopefully have him refer me to a therapist that specializes in transgender stuff, and then just last night she remembered that my little brother has his band concert tomorrow as well, and that the appointment will need to be rescheduled AGAIN!

i honestly dont know if i have it in me to wait another week. before she told me i would see him on tuesday, i was hoping to see hi on monday (which is when i usually see him), and now, i may have to wait another week. 

as i said earlier, i dont know if i have it in me to wait another week. my dysphoria has been a real pain in my ass when i have nothing to distract me (eg, video games, youtube, etc.). i know its unhealthy to avoid my problems altogether, but i cant think of much else. corssdressing has lost its touch with helping me work through my dysphoria, and the same goes for practicing makeup. 7cups has failed me as well, just a forewarning for anyone who might comment a link to it. looking at womens clothes and shoes just makes it worse, knowing that i wont be passable as i am if i tried to wear it in public. 

im kinda mad at my mom for this, but at the same time, i know it wasnt intentional for her to forget, but still, i was kinda riding on the appointment being tuesday. 

i just wish i didnt even have these issues in the first place."
AFloridaYankee,asktransgender,Name Change in Florida--need assistance,"Hi, has anyone done a name change in Florida (or is a lawyer in Florida) who can walk me through the steps? All the info I can find online is the forms and I'm not totally sure how to fill them out. For example the ""plaintiff/defendant"" part: is that [My Dead Name] and [State of Florida]?"
gelbkatze,asktransgender,[MA Name Change] I created a guide to help submit a motion to waive the publication of name change requirement and for the impoundment of records.,"Not at all a question but still something that I thought might help I could not really find anything on how to create/submit a Motion to Waive Publication of the Name Change. I went through Bristol county court (who were surprisingly great about this) but from my understanding the process should be the same throughout the Probate courts. I was able to get the publication for a name change to be waived and I did not know if a sort of template would be helpful. 

For starters, Bristol County Probate Court has their own website independent of the mass.gov site that not only lists the required forms in a checklist format but also includes direct links to PDF's. That section of the site can be found [here](http://bristolcountyprobate.com/legal-name-change-adult.htm) . The form specifically need to use for the waive of publication is the generic ""Motion"" form which can be found [here](http://bristolcountyprobate.com/pdf/cjd400.pdf). 

To impound (seal) your file, you essentially just need to use the same form with the same explanation, that was used for the Motion to Waive Publication. For the latter I did not need to stand before a judge and the process,start to finish, took about a week. For the impoundment of my record, I did have to appear before the court but all I had to do was essentially swear in and attest to the veracity of the submitted motion.  

[Here](http://imgur.com/kaG8cUQ) is an edited version of what I submitted to the court. The form can be a little daunting so I highlighted the parts that needed to be filled in, and with one exemption, my explanation for the motion. I have always found presentation to be key, so while I am sure I would not have encountered any problems if I submitted a handwritten version, it certainly does not hurt having the document typed and in the proper legal format. I hope this helps!"
OriAJ12,asktransgender,Should I be feeling guilty?,"My first time posting anything to Reddit, so lets see how this goes. To clarify everything. I only recently came to the conclusion that I'm Trans(I'm really good at repressing feelings) and I've found myself a lot happier and want to put more thought into it, but want to start transitioning by this time next year, maybe. I was the youngest of four children, the one boy of three girls. My oldest sister has six kids, the four girls are the oldest and the boys are the youngest. My sister lost custody of my oldest nephew when the youngest was maybe a year old, so since then he's never had another boy around, other than me. He's about 7 now and it's pretty apparent that he mimics me, he dresses the way I would dress, he shares many of my likes and dislikes, an he even claimed my room when I moved in with my father(who I detest, that's a whole other story). Its just so apparent that I've kind of been that ""big brother"" figure to him for quite a while, but now things are changing. I feel like he's losing an uncle and the ""male"" figure he's looked up to for a long time, and I just feel like I'm abandoning him and I kind of feel guilty. "

Lilstephanie,asktransgender,I Started Injections.,"Tuesday night I went to my HRT clinic to learn how to properly inject myself.  When I saw the needle I was concerned at how thick it was.  I said to the nurse,""that's gonna hurt!""  She informed me it's only the needle to draw in the estrogen and then I replace that needle with a thinner one.  Thank goodness!  Then she showed me how to do things.  My delestrogen comes in 20.  So I'm supposed to inject 10 or half.  They didn't have delestrogen in 10. I think it's mg. But it's not much liquid it seems.  But it's hard to push in.  I was surprised at how much it didn't hurt.  I was expecting it to sting badly.  What's bothering me a little is I feel psychologically like I should be doing it daily.  When I was on sublingual pills I did it twice daily.  So I felt like I was getting more e and it felt like I was getting a nice flow of e into me.  With this injection it seems like such a small amount and it's only once a week!!!  What do you think of injections?  Are you happy and do you feel they are doing a good job of feminisation?  Thanks for your reply and feel free to add anything else about injections.  I injected in my thigh a little to the side.  She had me pinch it as I stuck the needle in.  "
ifeelshittyaboutmyli,asktransgender,Dysphoria worsening as SRS date approaches,"God, where do I even start. So, recently, I realized that my endo had changed my diagnosis, from Gender Dysphoria to GID, and it's... been tearing me up in side, and I'm not sure why. It just makes me feel like there's something wrong with me... and I guess there is, my genitals that're getting removed next month. Still I hate that label. My next appointments in 6 months, but you know, I've been thinking, my body, just really doesn't feel feminine. I've gotten a lot weaker, but my muscle mass looks the same. I have hardly any curves, and my boobs don't even fill out an A cup bra yet, though they've been getting bigger the past month or so, thankfully...

I feel sad more than anything. I want decent hips/boobs, is that so much to ask for? I thought my e levels were good, but I guess, after reading some posts, they're not, and that's why I'm so... underdeveloped. I'm at 115 pg/ml. I've been on e for a year now just about. This is the highest it's ever been. I've been on a 10 mg dose since October, and a month later it was still the same exact value. My t level is all the way down to 20 something finally, since last month. My spiro dose has only been 100 mg. 

I feel this crushing weight. I feel trapped. SRS is so close... so very close. I see and hear people talking about how unless you have a vag, you're a trap, and it's just awful. I don't want this thing between my legs, and I'm so happy it's going away, but it's like having to go to the bathroom I guess. I remember a few times in high school, since I didn't use public bathrooms, I'd hold it in, and be fine on the bus ride home, but as soon as I got to the bathroom, I'd nearly piss myself, like the piss was trying to force its way out the closer I got to the bathroom, as if my body was trained via some sort of conditioning. 

I've been thinking of upping my spiro dose to 200 mg, because it almost feels like the e tablets are suppressing the testosterone more than the spiro currently, or something. I remember when I first started it myself, I lowered my t levels from 500 to 124 just from a 2-4 mg dose of estrogen. I don't know. Stressed, just wanna feel better about my ugly body. Not even sure what to ask. It's a rant. Help, maybe? I don't know. I won't lie, sometimes I entertain jumping off a bridge, thinking I'll get a do-over, but I know I wouldn't.

Edit: I've come to the conclusion... I can't wear dresses, of any kind. My bust is small, my waist is small, my hips are small, but my shoulders are huge... not because of the bone really, but muscle that won't go away (I used to be a heavy lifter). I look like a guy because of it whenever I don't have sleeves that drape over them, and in order to get those sleeves, I need really big sizes that drape the rest of my body, basically plus sizes, which make me look awful. I guess I'll have to take this dress back, shame."

obvious-statement,asktransgender,2015 US Transgender Survey Results released,"The annual US Transgender survey for 2015 was just released. Full report located [here](http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Full-Report-FINAL.PDF).

**Excerpts from the Executive Summary:**
&gt; The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS) is the largest survey examining the
experiences of transgender people in the United States, with 27,715 respondents
from all fifty states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico,
and U.S. military bases overseas. Conducted in the summer of 2015 by the National Center
for Transgender Equality, the USTS was an anonymous, online survey for transgender
adults (18 and older) in the United States, available in English and Spanish. The USTS
serves as a follow-up to the groundbreaking 2008–09 National Transgender Discrimination
Survey (NTDS), which helped to shift how the public and policymakers view the lives of
transgender people and the challenges they face. The report of the 2015 USTS provides a
detailed look at the experiences of transgender people across a wide range of categories,
such as education, employment, family life, health, housing, and interactions with the
criminal justice system.
The findings reveal disturbing patterns of mistreatment and discrimination and startling
disparities between transgender people in the survey and the U.S. population when it
comes to the most basic elements of life, such as finding a job, having a place to live,
accessing medical care, and enjoying the support of family and community. Survey
respondents also experienced harassment and violence at alarmingly high rates. Several
themes emerge from the thousands of data points presented in the full survey report.

**Pervasive Mistreatment and Violence**
&gt; Respondents reported high levels of mistreatment, harassment, and violence in every
aspect of life. One in ten (10%) of those who were out to their immediate family reported
that a family member was violent towards them because they were transgender, and 8%
were kicked out of the house because they were transgender.
The majority of respondents who were out or perceived as transgender while in school
(K–12) experienced some form of mistreatment, including being verbally harassed (54%),
physically attacked (24%), and sexually assaulted (13%) because they were transgender.
Further, 17% experienced such severe mistreatment that they left a school as a result.
In the year prior to completing the survey, 30% of respondents who had a job reported
being fired, denied a promotion, or experiencing some other form of mistreatment in the
workplace due to their gender identity or expression, such as being verbally harassed or
physically or sexually assaulted at work. 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
5
In the year prior to completing the survey, 46% of respondents were verbally harassed and
9% were physically attacked because of being transgender. During that same time period,
10% of respondents were sexually assaulted, and nearly half (47%) were sexually assaulted
at some point in their lifetime. 

**Severe Economic Hardship and Instability**
&gt; The findings show large economic disparities between transgender people in the survey
and the U.S. population. Nearly one-third (29%) of respondents were living in poverty,
compared to 14% in the U.S. population. A major contributor to the high rate of poverty is
likely respondents’ 15% unemployment rate—three times higher than the unemployment
rate in the U.S. population at the time of the survey (5%).
Respondents were also far less likely to own a home, with only 16% of respondents
reporting homeownership, compared to 63% of the U.S. population. Even more concerning,
nearly one-third (30%) of respondents have experienced homelessness at some point in
their lifetime, and 12% reported experiencing homelessness in the year prior to completing
the survey because they were transgender.

**Harmful Effects on Physical**
and Mental Health
&gt; The findings paint a troubling picture of the impact of stigma and discrimination on the
health of many transgender people. A staggering 39% of respondents experienced serious
psychological distress in the month prior to completing the survey, compared with only
5% of the U.S. population. Among the starkest findings is that 40% of respondents have
attempted suicide in their lifetime—nearly nine times the attempted suicide rate in the U.S.
population (4.6%).
Respondents also encountered high levels of mistreatment when seeking health care. In
the year prior to completing the survey, one-third (33%) of those who saw a health care
provider had at least one negative experience related to being transgender, such as being
verbally harassed or refused treatment because of their gender identity. Additionally,
nearly one-quarter (23%) of respondents reported that they did not seek the health care
they needed in the year prior to completing the survey due to fear of being mistreated as a
transgender person, and 33% did not go to a health care provider when needed because
they could not afford it.
2015 U.S. TRANSGENDER SURVEY
6

**The Compounding Impact of Other
Forms of Discrimination**
&gt; When respondents’ experiences are examined by race and ethnicity, a clear and disturbing
pattern is revealed: transgender people of color experience deeper and broader patterns
of discrimination than white respondents and the U.S. population. While respondents in
the USTS sample overall were more than twice as likely as the U.S. population to be living
in poverty, people of color, including Latino/a (43%), American Indian (41%), multiracial
(40%), and Black (38%) respondents, were up to three times as likely as the U.S. population
(14%) to be living in poverty. The unemployment rate among transgender people of color
(20%) was four times higher than the U.S. unemployment rate (5%). People of color also
experienced greater health disparities. While 1.4% of all respondents were living with HIV—
nearly five times the rate in the U.S. population (0.3%)—the rate among Black respondents
(6.7%) was substantially higher, and the rate for Black transgender women was a staggering
19%.
Undocumented respondents were also more likely to face severe economic hardship and
violence than other respondents. In the year prior to completing the survey, nearly onequarter
(24%) of undocumented respondents were physically attacked. Additionally, onehalf
(50%) of undocumented respondents have experienced homelessness in their lifetime,
and 68% have faced intimate partner violence.
Respondents with disabilities also faced higher rates of economic instability and
mistreatment. Nearly one-quarter (24%) were unemployed, and 45% were living in poverty.
Transgender people with disabilities were more likely to be currently experiencing serious
psychological distress (59%) and more likely to have attempted suicide in their lifetime
(54%). They also reported higher rates of mistreatment by health care providers (42%).

**Increased Visibility and Growing
Acceptance**
&gt; Despite the undeniable hardships faced by transgender people, respondents’ experiences
also show some of the positive impacts of growing visibility and acceptance of transgender
people in the United States.
One such indication is that an unprecedented number—nearly 28,000—of transgender
people completed the survey, more than four times the number of respondents in the
2008–09 NTDS. This number of transgender people who elevated their voices reflects
the historic growth in visibility that the transgender community has seen in recent years.
Additionally, this growing visibility has lifted up not only the voices of transgender men and
women, but also people who are non-binary, which is a term that is often used to describe 
people whose gender identity is not exclusively male or female, including those who
identify as no gender, as a gender other than male or female, or as more than one gender.
With non-binary people making up over one-third of the sample, the need for advocacy that
is inclusive of all identities in the transgender community is clearer than ever.
Respondents’ experiences also suggest growing acceptance by family members,
colleagues, classmates, and other people in their lives. More than half (60%) of respondents
who were out to their immediate family reported that their family was supportive of them
as a transgender person. More than two-thirds (68%) of those who were out to their
coworkers reported that their coworkers were supportive. Of students who were out to
their classmates, more than half (56%) reported that their classmates supported them as a
transgender person.

**Overall** 
&gt; The report provides evidence of hardships and barriers faced by
transgender people on a day-to-day basis. It portrays the challenges that
transgender people must overcome and the complex systems that they are
often forced to navigate in multiple areas of their lives in order to survive and thrive. Given
this evidence, governmental and private institutions throughout the United States should
address these disparities and ensure that transgender people are able to live fulfilling
lives in an inclusive society. This includes eliminating barriers to quality, affordable health
care, putting an end to discrimination in schools, the workplace, and other areas of public
life, and creating systems of support at the municipal, state, and federal levels that meet
the needs of transgender people and reduce the hardships they face. As the national
conversation about transgender people continues to evolve, public education efforts to
improve understanding and acceptance of transgender people are crucial. The rates of
suicide attempts, poverty, unemployment, and violence must serve as an immediate call
to action, and their reduction must be a priority. Despite policy improvements over the
last several years, it is clear that there is still much work ahead to ensure that transgender
people can live without fear of discrimination and violence."

Anyway ! The names I am currently considering are (in no particular order):

Elijah, Elias, Anthony, Drew, Dennis, Donovan, Luke, and Luca (so everyone can get a feel for what kinds of names I like)

Ellis and Lyn (Lyn is my current middle name, but I felt that it wouldn't matter that much that its feminine if I chose a more masculine first name; plenty of cis guys have feminine middle names right ?)

So ! Does anyone have any suggestions for other names I could look into ? (it would be especially good if you could find one that goes well with at least one of the middle names im considering). thanks in advance for any responses ! :)"

violaceous_trogon,asktransgender,"IN SEARCH OF A MIRACLE: If I don't find a roommate who goes to my university in a week, I'll be homeless next semester. I'm so scared. Can anyone PLEASE help me?","I'm so sorry if these types of posts aren't allowed. Mods can delete this but I don't know where else to turn. I've exhausted my other options. 

I go to Iowa State University. My roommate just notified me that they'll be moving out of our shared, university-managed apartment at the end of the semester (in 9 days). I'm very angry right now, but that's irrelevant. Fact is I will not be able to afford the place alone. The system won't let me pick a random roommate. Even if that *was* an option, I wouldn't take it because recently Iowa State University's been increasingly ""alt-right"" (white supremacy posters put on campus, significant Trump supporter population, nearly hosted a Milo Yiannopolous event but canceled it due to massive protest) and, being trans, it's inherently dangerous to choose a random person. 
As I was saying. I can't pay for the apartment on my own, and due to the manner in which my roommate left/the amount of time left in the semester to figure this out, I would be forced to pay a $4.8k contract cancellation fee to move out. I'm not eligible for exceptions. I can't afford that fee at all. So I **HAVE** to stay exactly where I am and I **HAVE** to find a roommate within the next week. 

Please. I've posted in several places and even though i've gotten offers to move into other peoples' places, nobody will move in with me. If by some god-given miracle the stars align and a fellow ISU student of any gender (who isn't a freshman; freshmen aren't allowed in my community) needs a new home, **please** contact me immediately. You don't have to be trans, or LGBT, just a tolerant, decent person. Please. I don't know what to do.

**EDIT**: I managed to talk to someone at the Department of Residence today, and it turns out **I will neither be responsible for paying my roommate's portion of the rent, nor be required to get a new roommate if I don't want one.** Turns out I would only have to pay for the whole place myself if I lived in a pet-friendly apartment, which I do not. The space will still be listed as shared-ownership even if i'm the only person living there, and only reverts to private occupancy status if there is a pet living there.

I'm going get all of this confirmed in writing tomorrow, just in case the person I talked to today was wrong. Thank you all soooo much for your help, with emotional support, offers of spaces, help baffling my way through legalese, and in general for just being awesome.

And as an aside, it's heartwarming to know that there are so many of us in Ames and the Ames area. Though I know trans men and non-binary people, I only know one other trans woman, and now I don't feel quite so alone, even though i'm probably going to be living alone for a little while.

I've been working on coming out to the people closest to me, where the toughest was coming out to my wife, all though it seamed i had nothing to fear, all i have received is support, in fact she has been pushing me to take small steps here and there, which has greatly improved my moods.
Currently i am only out with 2 people other than my wife, her sister and her sisters boyfriend. I knew my wife would need someone to process it with, and i did not put any restrictions on who she can tell. 
I won't be coming out to more people until after Christmas, but our plan is to slowly do it to each person at a time and hope that they understand.

So fare the reactions have been along the lines that they have thought about it before, since i actually act feminine in many ways, and a lot of the masculine is kinda clunky and forced.

in a few months i am starting DIY, and after some time i will head out to my doctors and get started on a regular HRT treatment.

I'm turning 30. I've never kissed or had sex. I've avoided intimacy, maybe I'm on the autism spectrum, but when there's emotions and intimacy involved I just feel dysphoria.

I'm also fairly confident I want to start Estrogen, but I worry quite a bit about that because I always see MtF girls talking about how they always wanted boobs, and how happy they are with them. The thing is, I'm not sure at all if I want breasts.

I don't think I would dislike having them, and there have been times in my life where that fits (I always felt unconfortable taking my shirt off, and in the past few weeks I experimented with crossdressing - stuffed bra + female tank top - and I liked it), but also I never felt like something was missing there, nor did I envy girls, specifically, for their breasts, although I envied them overall. I wanted to be them.

The other effects of HRT (feminizing my face, fat redistribution, less muscle, less body hair, etc) all seem appealing to me, but I can't help but wonder if that could be a cause for regret later on. I'm honestly just overthinking all this, but I'm a bit scared of taking this huge step and then having to backtrack later.

Also, has anyone here felt similarly towards some effect of their respective HRT and started anyway, to later find out they're completely fine with the change?

I just had a minor panic attack that I had misinterpreted anxiety as trans feelings. Thankfully I was able to ground myself in knowing that there were other instances where that explanation makes no sense.

So my question is, did anyone else with an anxiety disorder have trouble with their transition? And, if so, how the heck do I deal with this? Because I feel like it's going to either result in me stopping or me becoming a statistic. And I'd rather not do either of those."

GM - Masculine Gender Role - T Score 40 
GF - Female Gender Role - T Score 56

So, you know, flying under the radar thing while I sort out my own stuff.

Well, tonight I went to my first meeting of our school LGBT club, and we have a number of trans students (it's a big school, some 2500 kids).  Tonight was light since it was a makeup meeting given the holidays.  I know we have a few transgirls in the school, but our sparse population landed me with two transguys only, and while I've been putting together a list of local resources on trans issues that may relate to our kiddos I realized tonight I am lacking in transdude stuff.

I also realized as a substitute teacher I had both guys and totally fucking misnamed and misgendered them (all I have, often, is a roll sheet).  I feel kinda bad, but I did not know -- though in one case I kinda did suspect.  We even had a conversation about another issue.  Point is, not on purpose, and it won't happen again, unless they ask.

Bread-kunn,asktransgender,Need SRS to Change My Sex on My Birth Certificate And I Don't Know What to Do.,"I'm 18 and attempting to progress my transition. I've been on hormones for almost a year and a half and I pass very well. I want to live full-time as a woman.

I've gotten my name changed but now I've reached a hurdle. My IDs and almost every form of identification I have say I'm **male**. 

This makes living as a female really awkward. I need to present all this information for jobs, schooling, lots and lots of things. People WILL notice and I'll be outed. 

To get this corrected, I'd need to get the sex on my birth certificate changed to female, however my gender dysphoria really only applies to my face and to a degree my body, but seemingly not my genitals. I have very little desire to mutilate myself.

So this is really dicking me over. (Pun intended). 

I'd have to get severe irreversible surgery just to present fully as a female in life. Even if I did have dysphoria down there, I think I'd like to think on it more because it's a serious thing with massive consequences if I decide I no longer want to be a woman.

Is there a workaround? What can I do? I'm feeling really stuck. I just want to live life as a girl. I look the part, I act the part and this stupid thing in my pants that no one would know any better about except for via my IDs is keeping me from being happy.

TheNameIsOlive,asktransgender,"Suddenly questioning everything, I don't know what to do","Hey Reddit,

So it's been about a year since I've started to consider myself ""trans."" I'm pre-everything, and out of the closet to only a few of my closest friends, whom use my pronouns and feminine name whenever they can. I've crossdresed in private a countless number of times and once in public, and I have to admit, simply wearing feminine clothes and makeup makes me feel so incredibly happy. I was sure about my transgender-ness until very recently, when I made this account and began to regularly browse this sub. (this is an alternate account I made for queer shit, some of my friends whom I'm not out to know about my main one) 

A lot of the struggles you all have seemed to describe I just haven't experienced, or at least not to the extent others have described. I get dysphoria - mainly bottom - but its not nearly as bad as how some people have described it, and I'm worried it could be all in my head.

I keep trying to convince myself that I am, in fact, a girl, but I still subconsciously think of myself as a man. And to be quite honest, I am still comfortable presenting male: while I prefer to be feminine, I don't feel that urge to transition nearly as strongly as what seems to be, well, everyone else here. I'm scared that I've made a mistake, I don't know what to do.

TLDR, I've spent all of the past year questioning my own gender identity, and when at last I finally felt certain and comfortable as a trans lady, I'm back to doubting myself, and I don't know what to do. Are my feelings even real?"
uncansancio,asktransgender,I'm curious about the LGBT population breakdown?,"Hi all,

I'm curious about specifics on LGBT demographics. I found really good surveys about the incidence of gayness or lesbianness in men and women in studies with over 50,000 people, and another with 120,000. They showed around 1.8% of Americans are gay, and 1.4% are lesbians. It also found the incidence of Americans saying ""I'm LGBT"" was about 4%. This is cool, but not specific! Missed opportunity, in my view, huge sample sizes...
I'm curious about surveys this large for the percentage of trans women versus men, non binary, etc., as well as their sexualities.

I'm mtf and want to show people what we're really about, but I feel like trans people don't get studied very often other than on specific topics. Really unfortunate.

I'm also just curious, on a personal level; idk, doesn't it seem like there are most trans women than men? And more trans women are attracted to feminine appearances, whereas trans men appear to be more attracted to more masculine appearance? I want to really test this hunch! Haven't found a whole lot, and what I did appeared to confirm these assumptions (not all), but also had small sample sizes. So that's not great.

Any cool studies any of you have found? We need more representation, for real!

Thanks a lot for your time."

koolio92,asktransgender,I don't know how to define myself?,"Hi everyone,

First of all, I'm still very new to this subreddit and social justice in general. Because of my cis upbringing, I am capable of dishing out transphobic behavior, I'm really sorry and please call me out on that!

Anyway, I am really starting to question myself, where I align on gender or if this feeling is just a 'phase' that will pass. I generally present myself as cis gay Southeast Asian 24 yo male. I was raised in a conservative household where I was expected to be male (and the law is not in favor of even my own sexuality).

For the past few months, I have been very dysphoric with my assigned birth gender. It first started out as a fantasy in the bedroom where I like to be submissive and almost always the receiving partner (bottom) but now, it has gone beyond that. I don't know if I want to be a female but I don't feel happy unless if I'm treated stereotypically like a female in a relationship (protected by my man while I care for him etc). 

It has come to a point that I stopped working out to preserve my small body and I shave my usually hairy body to look feminine. I dream about this all the time and my sex life has gone downhill because guys I had sex with all treated me like a guy and that turned me off so much. I don't like my penis and don't touch it during sex. Sometimes, I even picture myself without a penis. It's like I really want to be a girl. However, I am questioning myself because at the same time, I also don't know 'how to female' (sorry for stereotyping here). Because of my boyish conservative upbringing, I'm used to 'boy stuff' like video games, sports and not caring about my appearances. I don't like to dress up and I have zero clues about fashion/makeups. I know I'm doing a lot of harmful stereotypes here but my point being, I can't define myself and this has been bugging me a lot. I am very stressed from my overall poor, immigrant life and this dysphoria is not helping at all.

I don't know if this is a legit thing and I'm very afraid to talk about this with friends, especially trans friends of mine because there are people out there who have been feeling this all their lives and are actually violently targeted for this. I don't want to undermine the transgender community struggles because I'm still basically a cis-presenting male, which makes a very privileged member of society.

Again, I'm very sorry for reinforcing gender binary and if I was being transphobic, I'm so sorry!

Any advice is really appreciated. Thanks!"

For pre-hrt: how often do you dream about yourself as your desired gender, and is your body consistent across multiple dreams?

For hrt: do your dreams reflect your body as it changes?

For post-SRS:  Do your dreams accurately reflect your new genitals, and do you ever still see yourself with your old ones?"

Since I went through the early parts of transition (identifying I was trans, coming out, etc)  in the last few months, the stuff I have would really be perfect for someone else who is still in the early stages of figuring out their identity. 

I am likely to add a lot of miscellaneous makeup to this, but at the time of writing the included items are:

Digitallyendowed,asktransgender,Do you think I might be transgender?,"Where to even start. So I love being a man, and have always wanted to be the biggest, butchest, manliest man I can possibly be. However, ever since childhood I have had a very feminine alter ego that is or at least was specifically linked to sexuality.

It's a bit vulgar having to say this but I feel it's important: my first ever sexual encounter was with another boy and it was at an age where I didn't have any notion of how a male is stereotypically supposed to present and engage sexually, yet I was very naturally feminine. This type of thing continued until I hit puberty and started to get those more masculine urges, which took center-stage, however occasionally I would still bring out the feminine alter ego. This went on until 15 to 16 where the feminine side would come out more and more over the following years.

Eventually it got to the stage that I would go into a hyper-mascaline mode for weeks (and sometimes many months) as a way to supress and off-set these feelings/urges, but they would always end up nagging away at me, growing stronger with time, culminating with me giving in (which is always a very arousing, euphoric, sexual state of being followed by crushing guilt and an overwhelming urge to compensate by making myself more manly.)

Fast forward to recent times and I am quite into cross-dressing. Sometimes I will buy a bunch of weed and dress up every night getting high and watching porn. Occasionally I will just watch tv or movies or play on games, but still all femmed up and still smoking weed. The thing is that the x-dressing is not just sexual; I get a really light, fluffy, uplifting feeling from it, and I absolutely love girls clothes, and makeup, and just girly things in general.

Now when I see an attractive woman my natural reaction is to imagine what it would be like to be her, to have her body, hair, face, curves, clothes, lifestyle, attitude. I wont lie I am also very much attracted to her, but more so to the thought of being her.

So I started to question my gender identity, looking at resources, reading forums, all while getting high and dressing up, and ended up thinking more and more that I could potentially be transgender. This notion grew stronger and eventually I found myself saying and thinking that I am very likely transgender.

I found a question online about a magical switch that could turn you into a woman and my answr was a resounding yes.

But then I sobered up and back came all the guilt and paranoia and Iwent back into man mode. And I wont lie, I could live perfectly happily as a man; I love being a man, but I cant help wonder what it would be like to be a woman, and this desire and love for all things feminine always come back strong and get me eventually.

Do you think it is just a fetish or do you think there is more to it?

I suffer from anxiety, severe ocd and I did suffer from very very severe depression on and off for years.

LuckyNumb3rSeven,asktransgender,I feel like I'm at a stalemate with myself. How can I find out what I really want?,"So for the past few years I've felt pretty strongly that I'm trans most of the time, but whenever I get close to deciding to transition I get all these doubts that there's some other subconscious reason for these feelings and I just get very unsure in general. I'm having a hard time figuring out which of these feelings are real and which to trust, but I'm never doubtful enough to feel like I'm not trans but I'm never confident enough to commit to transitioning. I'm just 17 so I guess I have time to figure all this out while I'm still young, but I'm worried about how long I'll be stuck on this. If anyone here had a similar experience and overcame their doubts or if you have any advice I'd be really happy to hear it :)"

Frequently Asked Questions – Gender Transition

Q: If an employee tells me they are uncomfortable using the same restroom as a transgender employee, what do I advise them?  
A: Advise the employee that they can respectfully wait to use the bathroom or use a different bathroom.  Inform the employee that a transgender employee has the right to use the bathroom for the gender that they identify.  
Q: What do I do if an employee expresses concern that they have overheard a peer making derogatory remarks about another employee that is covered in a protected class?   
A: Thank the employee for bringing this to your attention. Explain to the employee that the derogatory statements are not appropriate and this behavior is a violation of company policy. Ask for more information including who was involved in the conversation, what was said, when and where the conversation took place, and any other facts that are relevant to the situation. Inform Human Resources of the situation.   
Q: What do you do if an employee expresses concerns about an employee going through a gender transition?
A: As a manager it is important that you stay open and listen to what the employee has to say. Ask the employee what concerns they have? Explain to the employee that the Company promotes respect for all employees. It is our core value to cooperate and work as a team and that is expected of all of our employees.  
Q: What if I notice a group of employees leering at a transgender employee?  
A: Instruct the group of employees to go back to work. Meet with the group of employees individually. During the individual conversations ask them what was going on and why were they staring.  Explain to them that their behavior was extremely inappropriate and could be grounds for discipline.  Meet with the transgender employee to ensure they are ok.  Explain to the transgender employee that the behavior of the leering employees is not appropriate and will not be tolerated.  Tell the employee that the leering employees are being dealt with for their actions and to let you know if anything else inappropriate occurs.  
Q: What if I notice an employee is not using the appropriate name or pronoun towards the transgender employee?   
A: Correct the employee and ask them to make a strong effort to use the appropriate name and pronouns in the future. If it happens several times then ask the employee if they are using the incorrect terms intentionally.  If it is intentional then inform HR immediately because this is considered harassment.


Q: What do I say if an employee tells me it is against their religion to accept gender change?   
A: Inform the employee that they need to treat every member of our organization with respect regardless of their personal beliefs. It is important that our employees maintain good, cooperative working relationships even if their personal values do not align.  
Q: How can I protect the privacy of our transgendered employee?  
A: We can be respectful of transgendered employee’s privacy by being mindful when we speak to them and ask only appropriate questions. A way to decide if a comment or question is appropriate is to ask yourself “Would you ask this to someone who isn’t transgendered? “   
Q: Where can I or employees find more information regarding gender transition?

Sarahisnotamused,asktransgender,I need help finding someone who does voice training. I have had absolutely no luck. Help!,"Hey everyone,

So, I’m a bit desperate and I’m hoping someone can help me. I’m pretty deep into my transition and it is past time that I start working on my voice. I’ve tried Youtube videos, I’ve tried Kathy Perez’s stuff…none of it has worked for me. I really need to have one on one lessons.

The problem is, I’m in Arizona, and I have tried and tried to find a speech therapist, vocal coach, SOMEONE that works with trans people here and have found absolutely no one. I’ve tried finding people that will do it over Skype but have had no luck (I found one website that claims to do it, but when I sent them an inquiry I never heard back). Does anyone know of someone who does voice training over Skype? Or, and this is VERY unlikely, I realize, does anyone happen to know someone in Arizona, specifically the Phoenix metro area, that does it?

You would be a lifesaver. Thank you, everyone!

Eve-Stirwin,asktransgender,Questioning my gender - How should I interpret criticism of men?,"Given that I read a fair amount of feminist-ish stuff (mostly because I think a lot of feminist ideas about consent and ethics are sooo much better than some of the religious bs I grew up with), it is kind of inevitable that I'll run across some articles that are critical of men - whether that be male privelage, mens' entitlement to womens' bodies, or toxic masculinity. As somebody who is unsure of their gender identity but still presenting as male, I'm often unsure of how I ought to take these sorts of criticisms, and of whether or not I ought to read them as applying to me. I feel like people are always telling men not to talk over people, and (trans)women to not let themselves be silenced, and I don't know what I ought to take away from that. I *really* don't like being made to feel like I'm a bad person from people whose opinions I more or less respect, and sometimes I worry I just want to be trans to escape from that guilt and frustration. I love being around girls and women and feeling accepted by them after six years of single-sex education, but I don't know if I'm trans, or just a shitty male feeling entitled to their attention. The fact that I'm attracted to women just makes matters worse, because it makes me feel like the fact that I so prefer to be friends and hang out with female people means I'm really so selfish that I can't be friends with somebody unless I'm like subconsciously attracted to them or something.

I don't know, any thoughts or advice?"

IrreleventPerson,asktransgender,Anyone else's hobbies massively changed since HRT?,"Like, before HRT, I would score easily 40 to 60 hours of gaming on Steam, draw random stuff and program.

Since HRT, I have a literal 0.0 hours played in the past 2 weeks, practically don't draw anymore and I also completely stopped programming.

Instead I started putting many hours on browsing subreddits and forums, went outside more and worked with clothing/hairdoing in my freetime.

I also became much more picky on the state of my room, it took everything for my 'rents to make me clean my room pre-HRT, nowadays I clean it like once or twice a week.

Is it related to the HRT itself or just with the ""liberation"" of being myself and transitioning?"

My girlfriend overheard a conversation they had about me while I was out of the room and they said they refuse to respect my identity because they ""don't want to give him the satisfaction"". 

They recently told me that while I was coming out they thought I was being a selfish asshole by expecting them to use a different set of names and pronouns and I'm basically allowed to stay in the house so long as I don't be an asshole again.

What do? It makes me feel like shit having this happen day in and day out but I had to come back home because I couldn't handle doing the adult thing. While I'm back on my feet now, I won't have the finances to move out again anytime soon. 

Anyone have any suggestions? I've tried sitting them down nicely and explaining to them how much it hurts me to be deadnamed and how badly it affects my mental health and I've tried reminding them casually when it happens. I feel like I'm out of options.

In October, I tried explaining my feelings in a letter about how getting gifts like that made me upset since they clearly were for a guy.

I'm not sure if I am trans, a feminine guy, weird fantasy or lack of female attention I've had is making me feel this way.

I call it ""dyphoria"", but I don't actually know if it is dysphoria or not.


I've always wish I was born female, but I've only really cared about it within the past few months. Like, it gets to the point where I feel slightly depressed that I was born male and not female, and I'll never be ""truly"" female, if I were to transition or not.


I've always enjoyed crossdressing, and my earliest memory of crossdressing was when I was 5 and I tried my Mom's clothes on as a ""joke"" (I enjoyed it, it wasn't a joke. I remember like it was yesterday).


Sometimes I feel like I want to transition just so I can wear female clothes, makeup, and feel nice and feminine. But, I don't really have a feminine personality at all.


I've never really been bothered by puberty. In fact, I liked the idea of growing a beard and I tried growing one for the past few years. Now I've completely shaved it off. I'm growing my hair long (I last cut it around 5 months ago) and I really don't want to cut it short (in the past I've had it short and super masculine). I don't have genital dypsohira or anything. 


I never really had any dypsohira until I thought I might be trans. Now I suddenly have a few dypsohric thoughts. I feel like I might just be making this up in my head, and I feel like I'm just doing it for attention or as an excuse to wear female clothes or something.



Can anyone help me?



Thanks

VeryConfused150,asktransgender,Could this be (social) dysphoria?,"For a long time I didn't think I experienced social dysphoria, due to not having issues w/ pronouns and whatnot. Though for a long time I've had social anxiety and this is mostly due to disliking how I'm seen and treated as intimidating/cold and unnaproachable/threatening. This causes awkwardness and largely seems to contribute to my anxiety. Could this be social dysphoria? Or is it a separate issue?"

fri30dec,asktransgender,"I've gone from a normal 16 YO teen to a dysphoric, angry, and depressed teen in 2 months because of dysphoria","(Sorry for the wall of text).


I've always had some discomfort with being male, but it hasn't been that apparent for the past couple of months. I been crossdressing since I was 5. I used to hang around with female friends when I was 3. My first ever friend was a girl.


At 12/13 I started cross dressing again in my sisters clothes when I was home alone. I'd sometimes play video games while wearing them, I even had phone calls with friends when I was all dressed up (they had no idea I was dressed up as a girl). Although I lived as male fine. I'd rather be a girl, but I didn't really care about it at all. 

In June, we had the Year 11 prom. Lots of people were dying their hair. I don't really like long-term commitment like dying my hair, so I never did. I got my hair cut short and masculine. Although I then decided to by a women's blonde wig. I never actually wore it to prom. But when I was there I knew I wanted to wear a dress. Seeing all them girls with long hair, dresses, heels, make-up, I knew I would like to wear that. But I thought ""I'm a guy, I can't"". So I didn't really think much about it. 

Then in late July 2016 I had a big fallout with my friends. I've always felt kind of detached from them, but it was never gender related. At this point I still didn't really know what transgender meant. I used to go out all the time with them, but after I fell out with them I'd just stay at home and go on reddit or binge watch on Netflix.
 

I somehow ended up reading about being transgender, and I realized I was pan sexual. But still, I still thought I was cisgender. I just knew I wasn't trans at this point.  I became obsessed with transgender topics. I knew all about HRT, SRS, and all sorts to do with transgender, and I still thought I was cis still. I thought maybe it is one of these obsessions I have that only last for a few weeks, but it wasn't.


Then in late august, September and early October I knew something wasn't quite right about me. I know I got tested for Asperger's when I was 3/4, but I was never diagnosed with it. I thought maybe I actually do have it, but I didn't tell anyone. I knew something was wrong with me, I just couldn't figure out what. I still didn't know it was gender-related at this point.


In mid-october me and a friend where talking about who is most likely to be what. For some reason he said I was most likely to be transgender. That really stuck with me. I told him no way that would happen, but I thought about it, and thought if I turn out to be trans and transition into a woman, I wouldn't mind that at all. 


Anyway, on October 21st, it was just like any other day. I went to school, came home, etc. But, then something just clicked into place about me being transgender. It was almost like, maybe it was. That night I read the null hypothecis, that was dypshoria, and it was like I was reading a biography about myself. 


Anyway, at first I didn't really have that much dysphoric thoughts. But the more I read on /r/asktransgender, and all over the internet, and the more experiences people have read, I started having them. 


I've now become so lazy, depressed, and don't give a shit about anything. On weekends, I am up until 5AM, I sleep until 3PM, and just go on my PC for hours on end, sleep and then repeat. I can't be motivated to do anything anymore. I have 7 assignments for 4 different teachers (3 of those are re-submits) due in on Wednesday. I was given them 2 weeks ago. I just have no motivation to do any of it. I haven't even started it yet. I have no motivation to get a job to see a therapist, plus social anxiety makes me nervous to get a job in the first place.

I'd rather be at home and sleep than be with friends. Every night I lie on my bed, just get so dypshoric, wishing I was born a girl. I have bursts of anger, I'll just hit kick my feet because I get so angry by it. Sometimes I think what is the point in living if I can't be AFAB. If I don't do anything about it, I don't think I'll be here in 2 years time, but that doesn't really bother me that much anyway. How much better would life be if I were born a girl. I could transition, but I'd still have a past of being male to haunt me. I'd still have a male body-shape. I'll never be able to have my childhood as a girl. 



What if I am making all of this up in my head. What if I think I have gender dypsohira, but something is causing me to think this. 
 




My family is homophobic and transphobic. One side of my family is religious. One family member even admitted they hate transgender people. No one knows except one or two friends that I might be trans. 






I want to go to a GP to get a referral to a GIC. But in my town it's sort of like everyone knows who I am (my dad is quite well known in my area, everyone know I'm his son). What if someone in the waiting room sees me at the doctors surgery and then tells my dad? I don't know what to do. I also have quite bad social anxiety and would probably not be able to speak to the doctor without feeling stupid.



I was completely fine until about 2 months ago. 6 months ago I was really sociable, I would motivated to do school work, I worked hard to get my GCSEs (The end of school exams). Now, I'm about to be kicked out of sixth form unless I do something about it. They think I'm being lazy, but it's not. It's this dysphoria which just makes me not care about anything anymore, and I can't tell them.



It does get better and worse throughout the day. Sometimes I don't have any dysphoria when I wake up, until the thought goes into my head. Sometimes it takes 5 seconds or a couple of minutes. If I'm on my PC, or watching something I don't really think much about it. I do live fairly gender neutral, all my clothes are pretty much gender neutral, which I think is making me be like this.


Anyone know what I should do? "
Gand-Elf,asktransgender,What am I if I have female days but I don't feel right identifying as gender fluid and being called they/them?,"Like the title says I have days where I feel more feminine, wish I had the body of a woman,etc, although it's definitely infrequently, like maybe a 3 day span once or twice a month. Most of the time, however, I love being a guy and all that comes with that. I just feel kind of lost and occasionally dysphoric. I'm bi as well, and I love that because I get to be turned on by all these hot people, but it seems all I get from having female days is sadness. I haven't told anyone and I'm not brave enough (yet) to go out in makeup or cross dress, but in the future I definitely would like to get into that. Would that help me feel less sad and awkward?

What happens that makes a male and female body so different? 

For example: what makes a 180cm tall AFAB with broad shoulders and other masculine characteristics pass as a woman; but a 180cm tall passable AMAB transwoman not really pass upon closer inspection (to me)?

Hope you get what im trying to say and i of course hope this doesnt offend anybody! thank you."
HardlyImaginary,asktransgender,My experience with Dr Agarwal at the University of Utah,"So I just had my post op for top surgery with Dr Cori Agarwal at the university of Utah. I'll start by saying I had a very good experience with her and would recommend her to others if asked. 

The university was super helpful and understanding when my bank screwed up the payment 2 weeks before the surgery. They worked with me to get the issue resolved and were awesome during the whole ordeal. 

Finally get in for my pre OP, met everyone who would be involved in my surgery. Come back the next day and got checked in.

Dr agarwal met me in the exam room, we talked for a bit and she marks me up for surgery. Nurses and the anesthesiologists come in and get me all hooked up and drugged up! No pain from the injections even though they had to move it from my hand to my elbow (I've got small veins). Conked out after a few minutes.

First thing I remember after waking up is trying to stay awake and feeling nauseous. Got some crackers and water, was released and we went back to the rental, where my mom took care of me for the week. 

Now a few years ago I had surgery on my wrist, and was out of it and in pain the whole week after. This past week I've been mostly lucid and pretty comfortable  (till these last 2 days), I barely got nauseous and was pretty regular. 

The only discomfort came about in the last couple days. I was just so itchy and uncomfortable from the tubes! Today I had them taken out, but I threw up on th way to the university. Got there, the valet parked our car and they got me some juice and water to settle my stomach while they did the drains and bandages. Very little discomfort, it was over quick... And wow am I impressed so far with the results. I don't think I could be happier. 

The scars are thin and flat, nipple grafts took 100%, and the bruising is minimal. And I'm super flat!

Overall, the doctors were friendly and super helpful, I had little pain and discomfort, the process was easy, and I'm super happy. 

If anyone has questions feel free to ask! "

Transissue13,asktransgender,How can I go on like this?,"I'm MAAB. I'd say about 2/3 of the time I'm fine with this. However the other 1/3 of the time (happening usually in 1-4 week increments) I experience intense dysphoria and begin planning my transition to living as a woman. Then overnight it's gone, and I'm fine with being male again. I suppose what I am is genderfluid, but it really doesn't feel like it. It feels like sometimes I'm a cis man, and sometimes I'm a trans woman. There's no ""fluidity"" there. There's a very large barrier that I happen to cross over.

When I'm feeling male, I feel like I dodged a bullet by not beginning to transition into a woman. I would experience dysphoria just as strongly as I do when I'm currently feeling female. It seems like I'm damned to experience dysphoria no matter what I do. To stop feeling dysphoria when I'm feeling like a woman I would have to start HRT, get surgery, etc, which would leave me dysphoric when I'm feeling male.

Another issue is my sexuality. When I'm identifying as a woman it seems clear enough. I'm a lesbian. However, when I'm feeling male, I believe I am what's called a ""guydyke."" I'm a male who's a lesbian. I don't really understand it. It's like I can't enact my own desires. For me, it's not simply fetishisizing lesbians as a straight man like it's often called by critics. I do not feel romantically satisfied or sexually aroused by partaking in straight relationships. It like when I'm feeling male, I can only experience romance/sexual attraction vicariously through others. It's hard to explain.

Anyway, does anyone have any advice for how I should resolve these issues? It seems that my options are:

A) Remain male and continue to experience dysphoria about a third of the time and have no romantic relationships

or

B) Transition into a woman and feel dysphoria about two thirds of the time. Be able to be in relationships but experience the societal scorn in addition to everything else that comes with transitioning

transdatethrowaway,asktransgender,Potential date- important to know?,"Hi all.

I'm a gay (cis) male and I've recently started chatting with someone who identifies as male. The online interaction thus far is heading toward a physical meeting with potential romantic implications. 

That said, I have strong reasons to believe this person is FtM transgender male. I won't go into details about why I think this but I do have a strong suspicion.

My question to you all is: is asking this person about that rude (assuming he is trans)? My gut is telling me that there is no polite way to ask but I do feel that if a meeting has potential romantic/dating implications, I'd want to know up front what I'm getting into so as to prepare for that dynamic. I really don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but I guess I can't control how the person responds. 

Thanks in advance for responses, criticisms, or general advice. "
ifuwmon,asktransgender,"(M17) My name feels wrong, and I always write as the opposite gender. Are these signs of gender dysphoria?","Whenever I write stories, I always end up writing in the first person as a girl named Jane. She is very similar to me in personality, just the opposite gender and with a different name. 

It doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes hearing people say my name or even seeing it written out makes me anxious and uncomfortable, like it's something that is supposed to represent me, but it isn't quite right.

I enjoy writing because I can take on the character of Jane and leave myself behind. Has anyone had similar experiences to this, and could these be signs of gender dysphoria?

actually_its_clara,asktransgender,Thoughts on this post?,"I'm a 15 yo who's suffering with gender dysphoria atm, and I wanted to hear other people's thoughts on this post I saw on Candid:

""OK FOR ALL OF YOU TRANS TEENAGERS OUT THERE: STOP IT NOW. You only feel this way because you have raging hormones. I guarantee that as a full adult you'll regret transitioning. If you're a teenager and experiencing dysphoria, wait until you're an adult and that problem will go away. There are very few people who are legit trans, which I define as someone who actually understands how much of a change they are making in their life and is an adult. For all of you teens, shove your confused hormonic minds back in the closet until adulthood and see if you feel the same way. So many teens become trans and it ruins their life because people bully them then they realize it's not actually what they wanted and it was just their hormones acting. And most teen trans people get depression and try to kill themselves. Please, don't do it unless you know this is your destiny. If you're a teen, no matter how much you think it's your destiny, it probably isn't and your mind is playing tricks on you to ruin your life.""

Any thoughts? Should I follow this? Is there truth to it?"
anothtransthrowaway,asktransgender,I got an invite-- should I visit relatives for the holidays?,"So I was recently invited by some relatives to spend the holidays with them. I had already originally planned to do so last year, but then I went full time earlier this summer and so that plan went immediately out the window. My relatives have a pretty standard celebration of the holidays from year-to-year and I had decided that I didn't really want to go back while full-time and experience violence and harassment from the rather non-accepting people in their town. 

However fast-forward to now and it turns out they'll be going away for the holidays..... to a middle of nowhere holiday town which in all likelihood probably also has a substantial not very accepting population. Not to mention that I don't really know how my relatives feel about me being a girl to begin with. 

I visited over the summer (around the time I went full time) and it was kind of the worst. I spent close to a week just crying because of how upset I was. I'm not sure though about the upcoming holidays. Am I stupid for hoping that they may have gotten over it? They did send me an invite right? I just don't want to spend more time crying and regretting my decision because I gave someone a heart attack because I wore a dress. I've already ""ruined"" enough celebrations and I'd rather not be the selfish wh**e who destroyed the holiday season. 

On the other hand, if I don't go, I'll probably end up spending it by myself in my apartment where they've just informed me that they'll be ""cutting down costs by reducing heat"" this month. So what do you all think? Is it worth it? Should I go? Or will that lead to the only gift I'll be opening being a box of regret? Thanks

LoveIinus,asktransgender,Getting male-fail up down left right but unexpectedly.,"So I'm on hormones for about 3 months and 2 weeks? Originally I was going to wait till 2 years on HRT before going full-time. But ever since the 3rd month the hormones seem to be giving its full effect. I'm suddenly get male-fail and being addressed as Miss, 小妹 (how you would address a young lady) and all sorts of female pronouns. People are getting so confused and they ask me if I'm a guy or girl whenever they see me. Obviously I'm not ready, I wanted to wait for 2 years, but my cover is getting blown.. I gotta wear a cap every time now and even then my co workers tell me ""you look very feminine O-O"" 

This is me with no makeup, wearing boy's Long sleeve Ts, really short shorts and female sneakers. I have short hair and am growing out but it's a feminine cut. It's the Korean girl hairstyle with wispy bangs on the front and the two Long ends tucked behind the ears but the Two Long ends still growing out. My breasts are so obvious now I don't know what to do.

I'm still not comfortable and I need time. Now I'm avoiding going out unless I have to work. I wanted and still want to wait for 2 years. I want to be identified as a female with pretty Long hair. A part of me is ecstatic whenever I'm getting all these compliments about my complexion and male-fail comments, but a part of me is scared to death and want to stay at home until my hair grows out T-T

For anyone who is losing faith seeing no changes please don't. Things will turn out the right way eventually and when it does you will be shocked!!"
Inkaria,asktransgender,How do you accept your body?,"My dysphoria pretty much took my life and ate it up (and spit it back out again. ew.) and I can't stop it.

kernalmustache,asktransgender,How should I handle this issue with my roommate?,"I'm pretty open about being trans with my roommate and with my friends, and I haven't been hiding from the other people we often hang out with, but sometimes my roommate will get excited about something I do and will end up making it very obvious that I'm transgender which makes me uncomfortable. There's also the issue that a couple people who I've met because of her have asked me about being trans within a few hours of meeting me.

The most recent issue was that I got some makeup brushes I ordered in the mail. I was excited and I told her about them and she loves makeup so she got even more excited than I was. Later that night her mom came over and she was telling her mom all about them and asked me if she can show them to her mom. Again that night she had some friends over and they were all doing their makeup and she asked if she could borrow a fan brush from me. I know that none of the people she has let know about me being trans are going to have any kind of negative reaction or else she wouldn't be friends with them to begin with, she's not the kind of person who would put up with that even though she's cisgender, but I'm very careful about when and who I'm openly trans with. Even anonymously I'm careful about it. Just being a subscriber to this subreddit was a big decision for me.

I don't want her to feel like she's made some huge mistake, so how should I address this to just ask her to be more careful when it comes to my gender identity?"

Dont get me wrong, i was never like.. strong ? But things i did befor realy easy, are now incredibly difficult / impossible to do.

Are these effects cause of the hormones ? My endo said that i have a very low Testo lvl ( like noone existent ), is it because of that ? Anyone have same experience ? Thanks for answering^^

friendsKnowMyMain,asktransgender,Anyone wanna help give me some talking points against this article someone used against me in defense of hb2?,"I know this is a conservative rage the person is a pretty hardcore Republican it seems. But he has a ftm trans friend so he totally gets us and thinks we are making big deal over nothing with hb2.

He cited the article below as an argument that hb2 makes people safer and it's good it created another charge to stick perverts with (it didn't which I already pointed out but whatever).

My main argument against it was that this was gender nuetra restrooms with cis males and females and not simply allowing trans individuals into their own restrooms. That this would have been a crime had it been two females so gender wasn't the entire issue. That they didn't totally abandon the policy but kept one per floor per housing. That the article didn't say whether trans individuals were allowed in the bathroom they identified as but only that their were gender nuetral restrooms to give them a place to feel safe. So they may let mtfs in the female bathroom for all we know and this was for people not comfortable in either.


Any other talking points would be great.

Ithrewitaway842,asktransgender,Crossdressing and gender identity,"I guess I would like to know what everyone here thinks about the relationship between ""just crossdressing"" and gender identity. There was a long time where I wondered if I could be transgender, but when I started crossdressing recently, only in private, it seemed like that was all I needed rather than a full-time transition. I love doing it, it feels incredible to embrace that side of me, treat myself in that way. And it's always difficult when I have to stop, because it's so comfortable being her. 

But when I'm not in ""girlmode,"" it's not that bad. I always have some desire to be dressed up, and I'd like to go out some day as her, but my life in boymode is fine. I manage pretty well when I'm not in a situation where I can dress up. But, on the other hand, I find myself doing it much more often, just about every day, and I'm getting more antsy to try being her socially, in front of other people. All this while I identify as male publicly, and unless I'm dressing up, being male isn't that bad. So it also seems like I'm ""just into crossdressing,"" rather than transgender. I love to be a girl a lot of the time, but I don't really understand what it means to identify as a gender other than the male one that I've had my whole life.

I'm not really asking if this makes me transgender,  because I want to figure it out for myself. But I am curious to hear about the experiences that people here have/had with crossdressing and as it related to their gender. Are there transgender people who start just with crossdressing, and if so, what made you realize that it was more than just a ""habit"" or a ""quirk""? "

Specifically quoting this part
""Why not capitalise on this new wave of gay traditionalism by bullying gay men back into heterosexual unions? Girls, as ever, are one step ahead: I’m convinced the newfound popularity of anal sex among young women is just signalling to fags that they’re happy to bite the pillow if it means bagging a sensitive husband who appreciates her choice of drapes.""

The problem with Milo isn't about his sexual preference or his race, it's that he uses being gay as a reason to justify what he is saying.  As if he thinks just because he is gay he can say things literally promoting bashing gay people in order to force them to reproduce. He and conservatives in general think that it's not homophobic because he is gay. No, I hate to break it to everyone you can be homophobic and gay. You can be racist and black or racist and white. You can be racist towards any race, you can discriminate against any gender or any sexual preference, and just being a part of that community doesn't mean you aren't phobic of your own community and promoting hate mongering toward everyone in the community.

Let's point something else out about Milo, one he takes advantage of all the freedom the LGBT community has fought for him to have for so many years while at the mean time saying those things should be taken away from him. He openly admits that ""Gay"" people should be forced back into the closet, so does he not realize that if we lived in a world dominated by this belief then he too wouldn't be openly gay because he would gay bashed. That he would be forced to be straight as well and with that his fame gone, he'd just be another hate spewing far right winger. No one would know that he was secretly gay and that's where he fails to see the logic and where most people fail to articulately point out in him is that his point of views are homophobic, and hateful. 

In terms of Blaire White, I've watched several of her videos, and read her tweets often. I rarely respond because I see how she will prop up people who say offbeat things that aren't truly representative of the lefts beliefs. She then proceeds to belittle these people and openly states that her family was supportive during her transition. She and Milo are filling what we would call in economics a demand for something. There's a massive demand from conservatives for gay people who will side with their view points, so once they found Milo bingo they propped him up, made him an editor on Brietbart, invited him to speak in universities across America, and then used the footage of people protesting as propaganda saying that the protesters were hypocrites. The same is true for Blaire White, though admittedly to a lesser extent. Her constant use of ""Social Justice Warriors"". as if everyone knew what that was and it was an accepted term on the left, to label something and then proceed to hate on it is what has led to her being a prominent conservative figure, with a largely male conservative audience as she has admitted to in tweets.

^If you dig through that tweet you will see me responding and then her liking my tweet which I find somewhat hilarious due to the fact that she didn't realize my political positions at the time.

Part of me wants to call her out for being a sellout and supporting Milo, on top of the fact that I don't believe she fully understands the depths of the conservative community. I've heard her reference white nationalists being angry at her, which has led me to believe she is Center right, but the things she says are obviously being propped up as propaganda for people to make fun of transgender people and call them ""SJWS"". I can't tell you how many times I've been called an SJW on the internet in the places I frequent even though I had no real idea about what a SJW, (I of course do now) is as I used to simply play League of Legends all the time. To be honest though her views seem to come from naivety. I don't think she's hung around many true conservatives or lived in a state where they won't hire you unless you've had your documents changed to match your gender, maybe I'm making excuses for her, but it seems to me like she's had a very easy transition. She had a supportive family, she's very pretty and clearly passed even before starting HRT, she's attracted to men and dates men, so for her it's fairly simple not to receive that much discrimination or even think it's real. I can relate to her in several ways, I was raised from a conservative home, I've had a relatively easy transition in real life in terms of the way I look and the relationships I've had, and the fact that I was located in New York, but there's a key difference between her and I that I think she lacks the perspective or empathy for. My parents completely rejected my transition, they intentionally cut me off the health insurance, and money, and pulled funding for college immediately, they wanted to kick me out but me being a very levelheaded person, and very convincing, convinced my parents to let me stay. She seems to lack that kind of perspective when I moved to Texas without my legal documents matching my gender having people not know I was transgender then having them figure it out once I had to show them my drivers license etc. I've changed that now of course, but that kind of discrimination in person hurts more than anything, to be qualified very professional person who is an extremely hard worker to be denied jobs simply for those reasons is unacceptable to me. I've experienced first hand what hate looks like, especially on the internet. When I first started transitioning I was a popular League of Legends streamer, I had quite a few partnerships and a contract with CLG. I had already started transitioning, getting the psychologists note, meeting with an endochronologist. I had been open and honest with my followers about transitioning though they all believed me to be trolling. Once it was confirmed I was not ""trolling"" and that I was actually transgender, a much more popular League streamer by the name of HotshotGG while on stream with around 20,000 viewers went on some extremely long rant about me and how much he hates transgender people &lt; using derogatory terms obviously, after he pulled my contract with CLG, and got me banned anywhere he had influence.

Reference these threads Blaire White if you don't believe transphobic people exist. I don't respond to any of these threads.

Read these at your own risk, they are extremely bad.

[Thread 2](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1763340)

HotshotGG quit literally was able to get away with threatening my life, offering people 1,000$ to kill me. Proceeding to fire out as many transgender derogatory words as he wanted and then proceed to blame me for it. 

I was stalked for years proceeding this instance, and was branded ""the t****"". I deem it approiate here to censor that. Many people have called me that in the game, me being a strong person refused to change my IGN. Refused to change my stream. I apologize for how off-topic this portion of my calling out Blaire White, but since I feel it's necessary and I know Blaire White will read this, to give her an example of something she doesn't believe is real.

I'm not going to sit here and defend Blaire or the ""SJW"" movement. I'm simply going to state why both are wrong, and this is why. All people regardless of race, gender, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, whether they be men or women, whether they be born any which way should be treated with dignity and respect. All these people deserve to be treated fairly under the law, and there should be nothing written in place that bars anyone for the way they were born or the lifestyle they live, so long as it does not hurt anyone else, from living in a fair and just society. That is the basis for any real left movement. That is the basis for anyone who despises fascism, and can see the bigotry and hatred for what it is. It's unjust when laws are written into place that bar gay people from the military. It's unjust when laws are written into place barring transgender people from the military. It's unjust when someone is stalking/harassing/threatening to kill me simply because I'm transgender, for when I respond calling them human trash for people to tell me I'm just as bad. That's ridiculous, I only judge people based off what they say and what they do. I judge people off of their choices in life not off of who they are. What I find most disturbing about you Blaire is your support of the bathroom laws. I don't think you understand that transgender people living in most states outside of the left states like California and New York can't change their gender without getting SRS on any identification forms, even then it's very unlikely they will get their birth certificates changed in places like Texas. That's what you fail to mention in your videos or you simply lack the knowledge, I'm not sure which quite yet. Whether you are as bad as Milo or not time has yet to tell, but when I see you bashing people for their religious beliefs, or hating on people in videos, I watched a video in particular of you making fun of this girl [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwM-MZjYof8) simply because she was obese and to you looked funny. The things that came out of your mouth in this video are a disgrace to the transgender community as a whole and you are poised to become the biggest sellout, and I can understand to an extent that 1, you're getting massive support from conservatives just like Milo does, and 2, you're making quite a deal of money off your videos and speaking at certain places so it doesn't benefit you in the slightest to think outside of the box and try to find counterarguments to right wing propaganda that you so vehemently defend, and find ways to defend. You, I and every other transgender person knows that if we could reverse time and transition in our teens we would have done so in order to stop the severe impact of male puberty on some trans people, I'm referencing one of her most latest videos here where she says trans children are ""child abuse"". I didn't even know transgender people existed in my teens, that's how sheltered I was.

You claim also in some of your videos that you were attacked by feminists have you ever been to somewhere like Texas or Alabama, and been openly transgender? I'm fairly certain I've heard you state you were from California. Transgender people in those states can't change their legal gender and are forced in many aspects to be called by their legal name, yet you continue to support this kind of belief system as if this is ok with you. You fail to pay attention to the cringe on the right, like the white nationalists, or extremely religious conservativism. You know videos referencing ""white genocide"", or how ""Obama is a demon"" &lt; literally something taken out of an Alex Jones video, he tries to use footage of a fly landing on Obama as a reason to justify that he is an actual demon. I will now return to speaking in an indirect way simply to talk to a larger audience. 
What's more frightening is Blaire seems to look up to these kinds of people even referencing Alex Jones on occasion. She references Milo which he openly believes transitioning(not the cure) is a mental illness that should be cured and that it's harmful for people to transition. The problem with most people is there failure to look at what Blaire is propping up and to simply just keep calling her a bigot, or racist, or whatever. Blaire seems to believe, and so too do her friends, that she can not be transphobic, homophobic, or racist simply because she is transgender. That is her and Milo's go to argument. This is an incomplete rant, but I had to type it somewhere as people need to call out Blaire and Milo in an aggressive straightforward way and explain why what they are saying is wrong. "

For those who have applied for a passport with a gender change/name and gender change, did you get back the doctor's letter that verified you have had proper treatment?

NicoleS997,asktransgender,Weight loss and starting transition.,"Hi everyone. I'm going to apologise first off for any grammar or mistakes. I'm writing this on my phone, and autocorrect likes to switch some words around on me. 

With that said I'm looking to start transitioning soon, but currently don't like where I'm at weight wise. I weigh about 184 pounds at about 5'10 currently, and want to lose as much as I can. So I started running more, and counting calories. Hopefully that will burn off a lot of the bad fat I've accumulated through testosterone, and beer. Mostly beer. 

Does anyone know of a good goal weight I should be striving for? As much as I would like to start transitioning today, I'm not 100% ready. But I still want to do what I can. I also hear it gets much harder to lose weight once on estrogen. Anyone have any good advice on what they did? Or know some cool secret to losing fat without gaining muscle?"

Is there anything I can do about this?

I figure FTM's could have some input as well, especially since it's not only transwomen that have this problem.

iamsoveryconfused_,asktransgender,Is this just a fetish?,"So pretty much the only thing that is holding me back from going full on girl mode, is that whenever I put on girls clothes or think about me as a woman or in girls clothes, I get a boner. Now, I've been crossdressing in by sisters clothes since I was 12 or 13, and I've always had that boner, but I've never reacted to it. It was sort of just there and annoying because it got in the way a lot. When I was about 17 I masterbated for the first time, and since then I've masterbated every now and then when I'm crossdressing (Mind you, I only crossdress when I'm home alone). Usually I just do it to make the boner go away so I can comfortably tuck, but sometimes I crossdress just to masterbate. 

It should be said that I'm attracted to women sexually, which is part of the reason that I'm confused.

I really don't want this to be just a fetish, and I fucking hate that boner more than anything right now, but I can't help worry that it somehow just is? Of course, you don't have the full story here, but... Help?

It should also be said that I live in Denmark, so there is no easy way for me to get hormones, it will be at least half a year before I maybe am allowed them."
[deleted],asktransgender,How do I justify it? (TW?),"So there have been a lot of major events in my life recently, the biggest of which was getting married to my wife. We were planning on having a kid soon, and it's got me thinking a lot. Our relationship with our families has been so much better now than it has been for the earlier part of the year. We've both received promotions at work. Life has been generally good. I was planning on coming out early this year, but I honestly don't want to ruin our relationship with our families (both families are traditional conservative families). I guess I'm kind of realizing now that other than making my life a bit happier, there are really no positives. It will make our relationships more difficult, raising a kid more difficult, and who knows how hard it will make our child's life. Also since I got married, there really doesn't seem like there are many more milestones left. I've already missed growing up as a girl, dating as a girl, getting married as a woman, etc. if that makes sense. It makes me feel as if there's no point in transitioning. It seems so selfish when I need to start thinking about my wife and future kids as well. With all the negatives it will bring along, I can't find a way to justify it anymore. How do you justify it?"

kt-silber,asktransgender,New permanent hair removal method,"I am an official guinea pig of a new hair removal method that's just been released. Today I had my first session and will be sharing what little information I have available about it. As far as I've been told, the product is called ""Light Hair Laser Alternative.""

This new product is a serum that is applied to the skin after waxing the hair out. I've had to described to me as being ""Like laser, but opposite of how it targets hair. It's very effective against lighter colored hair, but less effective against darker hair."" The company that produces it has not yet given any official data on how effective it is per treatment, but is said to be ""Comparable to laser,"" so I would guesstimate that 10-15% of the hair can be expected to be removed permanently each treatment.

After waxing the area, this serum is applied and massaged into the skin. [I was then given a vial of it](http://i.imgur.com/CcSvs2p.jpg) and told to reapply every few hours over the next 2 days. It smells a bit like shrimp and lemon, but at least it doesn't sting to apply.

Price-wise, this is *much* cheaper than laser or elecrolysis. As I'm an official guinea pig, my treatment is free, but I've been given some rough idea of the price. ~$20 for eyebrows/lip area, or $45 for full face. For comparison, laser was about $180/treatment for the first 1-8 treatments, and $90/treatment after that.

As I've only had my first treatment, I can't yet say anything about the effectiveness. I can tell you that if it works, it may be well worth it! It also certainly seems like something that we could do ourselves at home, though I certainly wouldn't be doing my own face."

amon_erin,asktransgender,Discerning gender dysphoria from depression?,"This is possibly the last question I'll ask here. My post about giving up HRT should have probably been my last post, but I'm not smart enough to know when to quit. I float between hating my male features and feeling indifferent to them. When I look at myself in the mirror in ""guy mode"" (which basically means taking off my wig and seeing the same face and body when clothed, but with a bald head) I sometimes just get sad and start crying. My genital dislike fluctuates. Like, I just went to the bathroom with the ""I'm done with this and I no longer care"" in my head and I saw my genitals and it just felt like something is wrong or there that shouldn't be? I don't know, I can't discern the actual feeling.

My Zoloft dosage got upped last week and I took the first new dosage today. I'm not sure if the antidepressants aren't making me feel worse. I felt nothing on the last one I was on, and now I'm on this one and I continually feel sadder and sadder. I'm not sure if it's the antidepressant, or the HRT. I can't discern which is which.

I feel like if I could have chosen I would have been born a woman, but I'm not sure I trust that feeling anymore. A while ago I made a connection between feeling emotionless and being male, and that's what this feels like. But at this point I feel like I've gotten so close to the finally internalizing that I'm trans in the past few days, but there's been something blocking me from doing so.

So I guess my question is, at this point, how do I discern between dysphoria and depression? Because I don't know.

I feel like I'm grasping at straws to try and be the person I wish I actually was, but will probably never be because they aren't real."

I just received my updated passport (name and gender) in the mail, and I burst into tears as soon as I opened it up to the identification page. They made me look really orange in the passport photo! Just kidding, they were tears of happiness for finally having matching ID (though it *is* true that they made me really orange in the photo).

I filed on the evening of November 21, with regular service (i.e., no rush fees). Together with mailing, it took them 12 business days and 17 calendar days to get my passport.

Putting on pants in the morning also just drags my head to bad places and no amount of mindfulness work seems to get me past it. I struggle massively with feeling fake, how I feel about myself is overwhelmingly more important to me than how the world treats me, and I just don't know how to feel right.

I used to try and focus the feelings onto a kind of bitter/angry resolve to rebel against the shit life dumped on me, and spitefully be happy anyway, but mostly I just feel hollow now. Daily task of grinding through the pain trying to be stable and support myself to not burden people I care about, hoping to save the money to get the series of surgeries that maybe one day down the light might hopefully make me feel content, and then I get to start living? I'm just tired of it. I feel like I've been proactive and worked hard. I basically force myself to exercise and do yoga, worked at CBT for two years, seen many therapists etc etc etc. But I'm living just to not hurt people close to me. I'm forcing myself up every day to try and not be a drain on them while I'm at it. But it's not for me, it's always to 'not bring shit down on other people.' 

And I'm just out of ideas. I just don't know what to do. My most freeing, contented moments were always when I could just dance, and be me, with no thought about what was going on around me, but even that now just feels like I'm going through the motions to not alarm the people who know me.

So month three of HRT has been really rough. Maybe I am a guy. That hurt to type. I like my breasts and the other physical changes. I enjoy having basically no interest in sex. And when I do do things, they're amazing. I don't want to go back  to running on T. I want to run on E, like I am now. But the problem is that I don't feel all that great right now, and I keep contemplating giving up. But I'm either too stupid or stubborn to quit.

If I didn't want to keep going I would just toss my HRT meds down the toilet. Every time I feel like I'm finally making progress on feeling good, I get knocked right back down and debate stopping. But I persist. I'm not even sure I'm trans anymore. 

I don't really want to stop but I'm afraid I probably am cis and should.  If that's the case I need to figure out how to get myself in the mindset to stop, because I don't know when to admit defeat and go back. Or how I can accept living as male again.

Teejsaurus,asktransgender,"Social security name mismatched with legally changed name, and employment?","So I got a job just over a month ago. I had legally changed my name earlier this year. A few weeks before I got this job I had finally changed my name and gender on my ID, and changed my name on my bank account. 

I still haven't changed it at social security though. The office is kind of out of the way, and I haven't had time really to get out there. Since I don't drive, I'd also be needing a ride there and back, and the person who usually gives me rides if I need them, works every day as well. So it's just hard to get out to the social security office basically lol. 

When they did a background check prior to me getting this job, they emailed me saying the names didn't match up, and I contacted them saying I had changed my name, and sent them all the paperwork from the name change, and they were ok with that, and the background check went through, and I was able to start working. However, I just received a letter in the mail from the company I work for saying the name they have on file, doesn't match up with my social security records, and the letter says I need to validate that the name on file with my job are ""exactly as they appear on my social security card"". And the letter says to call to verify my information. When I call, if I explain that I legally changed my name this year, but have not updated my social security, will it most likely be ok if I just offer to email or fax them the paperwork from my name change? It says I have 20 days to call and verify...or will I have to go to the social security office before those 20 days are up to update my name on my social security? 

Sorry if I sound stupid here or something. I'm just kind of confused. When I talked with the people doing the background check they made it sound like it was totally fine that my current legal name was different than the name on my social security info, since the name there was still me, just my old name. I just wish they had contacted me about this in the time between when I got offered the job, and when I actually started working, because I would have actually had time then to go down to the social security office. I work almost every day now, so it's hard to find time to get out to do much else, even things I really need to do like this. "
annaleecage,asktransgender,"MTF: knowing what orgasm feel like as a male, do you get frustrated with they way you orgasm now after HRT?",I hear people on HRT get frustrated because the orgasm on E is a lot different but at the same time E lowers your sexual drive right? So I guess I am curious how the brain and body chemistry is once a person is on HRT. I guess I am curious to know because how can other people be frustrated with their bodily functions when (i assume) their sex drive isnt really that strong anymore? Like does remembering what male orgasm feel like trigger anything at all? Sorry if this comes off as an ignorant post and I apologize in advance if I am not politically correct with my wordings.

faintoldrhyme,asktransgender,Why are there no services for FtMs?,"I live in a queer area of a fairly queer friendly city and have been here going on 3 years. In this time frame, I have seen countless groups, social events, and all sorts of resources for femme, MtF, lesbian, or nonbinary people. More than I can count. There is a very strong femme-presenting/oriented queer presence here.

However, there is absolutely nothing for FtMs. Literally nothing in the three years I've lived here and been part of all the LGBT groups and mailing lists etc.

I'm feeling really isolated. I know NB and femme-presenting trans folk have it hard, but why does that mean there can't be ANY services or groups for FtMs? The only resources that come relatively close are ""female and FTM events"". When I've gone to those, it's just been all women and then me, which is super uncomfortable, and feels like they're just lumping in trans men with cis women to begin with. Everything else I can find that isn't solely for femme presenting queer folks are these wild dance party raves. Meanwhile I've seen femme-exclusive outdoors clubs, poetry slams, book clubs, biking groups, general hang outs, movie nights, and so much more.

So, as of the last week I started questioning my gender and everything that goes with it. I don't know why there is like a voice inside me that tells me I am woman, and I try to work with that voice but simply can't. The thing is for last the 15 years I have fought with my self beliveing i was gay, i came out was happiest man alive, and than all of a sudden I started questioning what if I was a woman. And still I don't have an answer, but this deep voice gets calm only when I say OK I am a woman. Although I don't know what it means to be woman, I don't have usual gender disforia, my penis doesn't bother me, (I love him to be honest it makes me man) which is what I want to be (dilema: do I want to be a man becouse of my social status or becouse i am a man after all) , but last night I started crying just on tought that I might want to cut it of in future. Now I deal with different kind of questions, if l am female how should I behave, I have zero feminity visualy, but I have an urge to do something feminate and it feels weird when I do. Is it just fear or something else. And I feel so disconnected from the world, I feel like my whole life was a huge lie. Do l love my friends ( I have questined that earlier but thought it was because I couldn't love gay me, which is still an option), am I copy cat of other people and have no clue of who I am, were my decidions in life all wrong and now I can't see me in future at all. And also, if I am female, are my reactions to world around me my real reactions or just something I have learned and not me. I know noone behaves like they want all the way but now I find my self questioning my every move do I do it like woman or a man and how do I feel when I do it, it won't stop ( like how do I brush my teeth, how do i sit, and if I was female would I do it diferentely). And the thing is when I talk about this thing I feel like man inside of man's body who has a huge issue, when I think it's constant fight in head who am I, am I transgender person or gay guy. Buy the way at the moment I have no sexual interest what so ever to any group of people, ( had a small dizgust for gay, sorry it is just the way it is, I would like to be gay guy) and the questions are just coming and coming and I don't know what to do. And the most confusing part is that when I talk to people I enter my old hetero mode that was present before my coming out as gay and I am not sure what I am or where to begin working on my self. If anyone can relate or think can help me please do, I feel totally lost."

k_bigfella,asktransgender,Will I (or others) notice the difference?? (Ftm),"Hey Reddit, Kayden here I am a young (21yr old) newly transitioning trans man.  So, 2016 has been a huge year for me (in the good and the bad) and one of those good things was finally starting T in August! 

Being on T for about 5 months now has been for the most part a relatively smooth transition. According to the rough timeline of transitioning, now is around the time I gear up for the voice drop! And I've already started to hear a huge difference. (Hurrah!)

However, I have hit a snag that is frankly, a nightmare come true. So, in order to spare you the frivolous details here comes my question! 

Gender dysphoria is a biiiitch but I don't need to tell you all that, will I or those around me notice any reverting (whether in the pitch of my voice, or other physical manifestations?) If so, what am I too expect and what is the best way to counteract them?? 

My last dose of T was last Tuesday (it's a weekly dose of 200ml/km of T at .5) and it looks like I won't have the chance to take another dose until well into the new year (earliest is maybe the 3rd week in January.)

stellaproiectura,asktransgender,Facial hair regrowth after orchi?,"Hi all,

I got a simple orchi performed in July 2016. Here's my key stats:

- On HRT since Sept 2012, around the age of 19
- Prior to the orchi, I was on cyproterone at about 50mg, estradiol at 6mg oral, once per day
- After the orchi my doctor advised I halve cypro to 25mg for a week, then go cold turkey. I also moved to 4mg estradiol, oral, once per day.

Since the surgery I've had some rather mixed results. Blood tests show my full testosterone levels to be completely unchanged from T blocker days (from 2.0 before to 2.0 now, on a spectrum of 0.6 - 2.6 for female T levels, I'm unsure the measurement). 

However my skin has gotten to be a bit oilier. I have zits all over my face, and facial hair's making a comeback. After four years of having taken care of it, never really having to shave, my partner informed me that I should reinspect my face, since my whiskers have become noticeable. I have a bit of a thin layer of hair on my neck and -- not as seriously -- the faint hairs of a unibrow are also coming back.

Feminisation has also been mixed, since my breasts have shrunk a little, though my face seems to have had, years later, another push of feminisation.

My complexion on T blockers was clean, so this has all been sort of distressing. My doctor had nothing to say, just that ""I have to learn to deal with having some testosterone in me,"" and that no one else has reported this post-orchi phenomenon to her.

Has anyone else suffered these effects post-orchi? And what's my recourse now? 

I am probably going to experiment with my dosage again -- possibly estradiol twice a day and a minor dose of T blockers for a week or two to try and reset anything internally. I may also need to do another few rounds of laser on these reactivated hairs..."
amon_erin,asktransgender,I think it's happened?,"So today is 3.5 months of HRT. I feel kind of calm. Almost back to the place where I was before I started questioning everything. I'm still depressed, but that's nothing new. It's like physically nothing is really bothering me today. The stuff downstairs isn't my favorite, and I'm feeling a little unsure of my breasts right now, but I generally have liked them.

There's still a bit of anxiety, though. And I'm kind of foggy in the head, but not entirely. It's almost like the strong desire to be a girl is gone. But there's not exactly a strong desire to be a boy either. Given the choice I'd take the former if I still didn't doubt myself as much as I do. But I guess if I thinking about it that strong desire to be a girl is there.

Maybe some of this is from the SSRI and antidepressant working their magic. It still hasn't clicked that I'm definitely trans or definitely not a boy. I'm still a bit afraid, but maybe if I looked in the mirror and didn't still see a fat boy this would click. I don't know. 

Sorry this isn't a question.

Finding_Tara,asktransgender,1st time going home- unsure on how to present?,"Hi all, TL;DR at bottom. I'm supposed to to home to visit in a few days and am freaking out. I'm out to my family and they know I have been really depressed, so to their credit they have said things to me repeatedly like ""please, just come as you are"" and ""I want to see the real you"" etc. 

The thing is, I honestly feel really ugly because I'm pre-everything with shorter hair (except some laser) and I feel pressured by them to come back home completely done up to the nines with my (cheap) wig and maintain that at all times, even though I'm not full time yet- and I feel like I'm almost, letting them down if I don't because they might feel like it's something to do with them. 

If I thought I looked pretty or had a nicer wig and makeup etc I think I would be more okay with presenting full time during my visit, but if anyone could share their experience with the first time presenting as their correct gender around their family it would really help me out.

TL;DR: 1st time going home since coming out, family is supportive, feel pressured/pushed to come home dressed to the nines and present the entire time when I'm not even full time yet. Advice? Experience?"

amon_erin,asktransgender,Okay. I'm done,"This is my final goodbye. With the way I've been feeling I think I've come to the conclusion that I'm cis and have given myself gender dysphoria by starting HRT, I guess. 

It still doesn't make sense to me given everything I've felt, and I'm not really happy that I have to be who people told me I am. I hate that I get zero say in my gender and the body I inhabit. It doesn't seem fair. 

I guess this was just a fetish after all. Fuck. Maybe I'll stop crying eventually.

Good luck to you all.

Edit: I've calmed down a little and after thinking about it, I'm not done. I think depression is making this harder for me. I've been assuming the depression was getting worse due to possibly being on the wrong hormones, but when I think about it the last time I had a major depressive episode was in grad school when I was under a great deal of stress. Well, work has been increasingly stressful these past couple of months and that may be largely to blame for the way I'm feeling. Because I've noticed that as my stress level at work has increased, so has my depression. I think I'll be fine."
trlr2306,asktransgender,Am I trans if sometimes I like being/feeling like a guy? (some NSFW),"Hi asktransgender, I am currently a very confused, scared and worried 19 year old male from the UK. I have been obsessing over the question of ""Am I transgender?"". Doing so makes me feel more depressed and generally anxious but I can't really stop worrying about it because it's such a huge thing. In short, over the past few years, I have swung from answering yes and no to the question above without ever really feeling like I've got an answer. There are cases when I do come to some sort of a conclusion that I'm not trans, and for a while, I feel this sense of relief wash over me, and I feel like I finally can go on with my life. Usually this happiness and optimism doesn't last that long though before I go back to questioning. And I mean it's pretty obvious why I'm still questioning - I can't really deny the fact that I have had fantasies about becoming a woman. And from what I've read here, no cisgender person does that, meaning I must be transgender, and that sort of sends me into a panic, it's scary, and wierd, this idea that I'm transgender. And the cycle kind of goes on. 

The thing is though, despite what that would seem to suggest (i.e. it seems like there's is pretty concrete evidence that I'm trans) I still don't feel like that's the end of the story. You know the Null Hypothecis, where you ask yourself if it is more likely if you're cis or trans? Honestly, at different times, the answer changes, and I mean that genuinely. Like at different times, I genuinely will have a different answer, and not just in the sense of being in denial and not accepting it. It's kind of the same with the infamous button question as well - sometimes I know my answer would be yes, press it, even if I tell myself I'm thinking otherwise - but there have also been times when I've felt like I would genuinely want to avoid pressing that button, or at least I wouldn't have any desire to press it. This is kind of my problem - I don't feel like I fit the category for cisgender, but I don't really feel like I fit the category for transgender either. I kind of feel half-trans and half-cis, though I know it doesn't really work like that haha. I'll try and give some examples. 

As I've said, the biggest thing suggesting that I am trans is that I've had fantasies, exciting fantasies, about becoming a woman. Most of the time, these are sexual in nature, but if I am being honest to myself, I know there are times when it has not been just sexual. Instead, these fantasies can make me feel happy or calm. Even when the stories are sexual in nature, I've noticed the most exciting parts for me are when a male character experiences some detail that only a real woman could feel or experience. In particular, I have once or twice felt a particular thrill when imagining myself as an actual girl - i.e. imagining I was born as a girl or something. I haven't had any obvious dysphoria - physical, social, to the extent where it was kind of self evident - but looking back on my teenage years, and even in my recent past, there is this mild sense of something not feeling right - kind of not feeling like a real person, a bit depressed, just going through the motions. Sometimes I've thought that my personality, shy, generally a bit more feminine than other guys in terms of not being aggressive, being a bit more caring and kind, might have made me a 'better' girl than a boy. So sometimes being a girl would mean I would have less pressure on me. 

All of this makes me sound pretty trans. But I'm confused by the other side of it. Essentially, if I could sum it up in one  sentence, it would be that on the inside, there is at least part of me, if not most of me, that feels like a guy. I don't mean this in a bad way at all, but in a good way. I mean this in the sense that I feel like a really important part of my identity is that I am a guy. And sometimes, I feel more in touch with this guy part of me, and I start feeling good about myself. I start feeling like more of a real person again, it's almost like I've remembered who I am. As a kid, I never had any transgender feelings, I was just living as myself, and I was happy, and when I feel like I described above, I feel like a kid again, happy, optimistic, looking forward to the future. 
And it's stuff like the fact that I like to look good as a guy - the better I look the better I feel about myself. Like for example I like male clothing. I feel like if I was trans then I wouldn't actually care how I looked as a guy, because it wouldn't make me feel better. Sometimes, when I look at the changes that HRT brings on timeline and stuff, I think about how I would feel weird if those changes happened to my body. Sometimes in the mirror my body looks to have a bit more a feminine shape and I don't really like how it looks. 
And I think about my current life, about the elements of it that are determined by my gender, like how I interact with people, and I think I quite like it. I mean, thinking about it, I genuinely like parts of being a guy. Like, how a relative might say that I'm looking handsome, or talking to a girl as a guy, as opposed to what I imagine its like talking to a girl as a girl. The thought of being a father in the future, as well, is a nice one. What I'm kind of saying is that this isn't just a superficial thing, I feel like being a guy has some deeper significance for me.  
The other big one is fantasising about sex - like when I fantasise about having sex as a girl, which I have done, it is very arousing and exciting, but never at the end really satisfying, but when I fantasise about having sex as a guy the fantasy seems so much more real (if that makes sense), like I'm not even fantasising about being a specific sex, I'm just imagining having sex as me, and that's easier and more emotionally satisfying to fantasise about. Like when I fantasise about having sex as a girl, I'm just imagining the fantasy, but fantasising about sex as a guy is all about imagining the fantasy actually happening in real life. When I'm in this state of mind, thinking of myself as more manly really turns me on. 

The part where this gets really complicated is that I don't know if I'm just saying this stuff to stay in denial - I mean, I think I do genuinely like being a guy, but maybe I would try being a girl and I'd realise I'd love it, that all of the above was just some lie to myself, and that I'd never want to go back. Sometimes it feels inevitable that I'm going to be transgender, which I guess might mean deep down I know I'm transgender, and I'm just trying to avoid it. I'm a bit scared of that happening to be honest, maybe because I think it could happen, though obviously if I did love it I would be happier, which is ultimately what I want. Then again, sometimes I feel at peace and happy when I'm a guy, and the idea that I'm transgender doesn't worry me at all - I just feel secure as a guy. I just feel right. But all this second guessing and doubt makes it impossible to get an answer. 

So as you might have guessed I'm kind of all over the place. I feel like a very divided person, like parts of me are wrestling with one another. I don't really know which of my thoughts or emotions I should listen to. And this is just really messy, especially when you consider all the different things like what actually is identity, reality vs. fantasy, denial etc. so I feel overwhelmed a lot of the time and it gets me down (though writing it out has helped a bit.) 
I'm kind of just wondering if anyone had been in my situation and found an answer that has given them peace. I really just want to be at peace and be happy, and have an explanation for all my feelings and stuff. 
And yes, I know, I should look for a therapist, but I'm it very hard to actually make myself do it - maybe because doing so would force to me to acknowledge there is a real issue here for me to address. 
I guess what it kind of comes down to, in part, is that if I came to the conclusion that, in light of all the evidence, I was transgender, I would be kind of freaked out about what it would mean for my identity. I feel like it would screw all of that up and I don't know how I feel about that. And I kind of feel like while the idea of being a girl is exciting and part of me, if I lost my male identity, I wouldn't really feel grounded in reality, I might not feel like 'me' anymore. 

Apologies for the wall of text. Any responses appreciated.  "

SoontobeSam,asktransgender,"I asked my work to keep my transition private, I think that was a mistake.","I transitioned at work 6 months ago and when I arranged everything I asked HR to keep my transition relatively private, it was discussed within my department and they did some training course, but it didn't go any further in the company. 

I'm starting to see that while in the short run it insulated me from wider exposure while I was very self conscious, in the long run it doesn't matter who knows what and I'm much more confident in myself then I've ever been. I've also come to the realization that in not allowing the companies discussion to be wide spread I've created two issues. 

The first is rumours, even if I work in a separate location with just my department they still happen. The second I've come to realize is a much larger concern, I was really nervous approaching HR when I started getting ready to transition, I was the first person to do so in the company so I had no idea how they were going to respond. 

If I'd known that someone had gone before me, I would have been much more comfortable in coming forward and would have known that my employer would be supportive, but now it's been done and I kept quiet and someone else might be where I was a year ago sitting there unsure if they're going to have to risk their job to be themselves.

Do you think I made a mistake? I'm starting to think I did and that I should talk to HR to see if I can correct it."

Sellissa,asktransgender,"Closet MtF Transgender, feeling lost in life","*Throwaway account*

Forgive me reddit if this post is poorly written or lacks direction, I'm not really sure what I'm trying to say. I'm a little intoxicated and this is kind of a 'new-year's rumination' thing for me.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been a long time closet trans. I've wanted to be a girl long before I even knew transgender was even a 'thing', but I've kept these feelings hidden for the 23 years I've been alive, and it's had a serious impact on my social life, as well as who I am in general. I feel like I lack self-confidence, and am excessively introverted because I'm always pretending to be something I'm not.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm at this point where I've graduated with an Engineering degree, I'm living on my own with a comfortable and well paying job, so I have more free time than ever to question my identity. I've had the desire and now I have the means, so I am seriously considering starting HRT, but that's not really a decision I can make lightly. I know for a fact that I'm a female on the 'inside', but that's all it's ever amounted too. I feel too much social pressure to do anything about my gender, and as I get older I also have this ever-growing fear that I won't look very good if I do transition. As stupid as it may be, looking good is very important to me as well. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am the only son of a fairly traditional Chinese household. My parents started from nothing worked their asses off every day of her life to get me to where I am now and they have a lot of their hopes and dreams rested on me. (you know, the generic asian ""Bring honor to family. You must become doctor/lawyer/engineer""). I owe it to my parents to be successful in life, not bring 'shame to the family' or whatever, and obviously they are expecting grandchildren. 

&amp;nbsp;

Beyond just the debt I feel I owe my parents, I also just don't want to lose what I already have. I have a small circle of good friends, I have a girlfriend, and I hope I'm not being vain by saying as far as males go - I'm not too ugly either. I'm already 23 years old, I feel like it's a little bit late to transition and if I do transition at this point I'd be alienating my friends, putting my job at risk, and might not even end up 'passable' as a female. As far as my sexual desires go, I don't think I've ever been attracted to women - but I love my girlfriend and don't want to hurt her either.

&amp;nbsp;

On the other side, I'm very emotionally tired of this constant cycle between wanting to transition, yet being too scared to transition. I'm tired of living a life that I know isn't for me; I want to be myself, but I also feel like because other people dedicated their lives to mine, I also have a responsibility to dedicate my life to them. Transitioning would be a serious implication on that.

And uh... I don't have a conclusion. What are your thoughts, reddit?"

Second of all, as a disclaimer, I'm cis. I'm researching hormones and their effects, so my question is: how do hormonal treatments affect height and stature?

CyanMarble,asktransgender,My girlfriend's parents still won't accept her,"afab non-binary here.

My girlfriend has been out as a trans girl to her parents for over 3 years now and her mother in particular refuses to use the correct pronouns and actually doesn't use any pronouns when we're around. My girlfriend's father has actually started to properly gender his daughter but because he interacts with his wife often, he goes back to misgendering my girlfriend. 

I feel like it as never going to get better because of my girlfriend's mom. She just won't even try to accept her daughter as her daughter. I tried to write a letter to her mom once and her mom just interpreted as an ""attack"". I was even being extra nice in the letter...

Anyway, about a month ago, we were all (me, gf,mom,dad) at the store trying to get my girlfriend's cellphone activated and her dad misgendered her to the guy behind the counter and then he started misgendering her even though this random guy clearly looked a little confused (low visibility) and I was waiting for her dad to realize and correct himself but he didn't and somehow my gf and I both let it happen and I looked at her after and she was clearly dissociating and then l lost it just outside the store and started crying and walking away because of obvious reasons. I walked to my mom's place and immediately regretted leaving my girlfriend there...apparently they tried to defend themselves by saying ""it just takes time!"" And she mentioned it beeing 3 years and they just ignored her. 

We don't live with them but we have to interact with them because of financial reasons for the time being and I dont know what to do anymore. I want to protect her but her mom is so frigging shut in by her own issues.

My girlfriend's mom's excuse for misgendering my gf is that she had a dream about raising a boy after she aborted her first pregnancy (which she thinks shes going to hell for) and that her second ""son"" is now dead too so why should she have to accept her daughter now. Maybe she thinks shes being punished by god God or that my girlfriend robbed her of God's plan for her to raise a son or something delusional like that.

My girlfriend is really passive about calling by them out because she has tried before and always gets lectured about ""we raised you and fed you blah blah blah"". She just cant do it with her own parents anymore and I was calling them out for her for a while but nothing is changing and all my efforts feel like they aren't being backed up by her and I just feel like I cant call them out on my own anymore for her...nothing is changing and I feel so bad because my gf is still suicidal for these reasons and some and everytime something happens she dissociates for hours after the incident and I cant do fuck all to help. 

I told her to stop asking me to help change her mom's mind and stop being obsessed with trying to build a relation ship with her mom because nothing is working and her mom probably needs professional therapy if anything is going to happen.

I'm pretty sure her mom is scared of me and tries really hard to hide her transphobia when I'm around.

I dont know how to move forward. My mom says we need to get stable jobs and cut contact with her parents but easier said than done.

Sorry for any typos.

Tl;dr

My girlfriend's parents are transphobic and I dont know how I can help, if I even can help."

My girlfriend squirts too, and she says my description of the feeling is the exact same as how it feels to her, and I peed just before we got into anything, but I'm just scared anyway.

axlslashduff,asktransgender,One last question,"I just want to thank everyone who's responded to my questions on here, and have attempted to help sort through my confusion in regards to my gender (and to a lesser extent, sexuality). You all are very kind, and I wish you peace and prosperity in your search for yourselves and transitions. 

This might be the last time I post here, mainly because there's only so much advice the internet can give, and sometimes action and decision making are required as opposed to asking the same things over and over on reddit.

I've posed the question many times before. Am I transgender? I've come to the conclusion that I'm not. I have little to no dysphoria or discomfort as a man. I enjoy being masculine and cultivating bonds with my male family members and friends. Nor do I despise my body or constantly wish for a female one.

I questioned my gender due to my crossdressing and the fact that I have very intense sexual fantasies about being a woman and having a woman's body. It's the biggest turn on for me and has been since I hit puberty. I don't why, but it is. But usually after I masturbate the desire to be female goes away and I go about my day.

I believe I have what is known as 'transvestic fetishism' and not dysphoria or the outdated term 'autogynephilia'. Usually in people with transvestic fetishism, they get aroused by crossdressing but do not seek transition. That pretty much defines me and that's fine. 

Where the problem lies is that these fantasies and urges essentially dominate my sex life. My orgasms when thinking of sex with women are weak compared to the fantasies. I have never had a gf that lasted longer than 6 months. My sexuality feels like it is completely dominated and revolves around crossdressing and transformation fantasies. Nothing else does it for me.

At the moment, I'm just wondering where I go from here? I'm worried I could never be in a regular vanilla sex relationship with a woman and that I'm doomed to be alone. It's almost as if without the crossdressing and fantasies, I'm asexual. 

I recently fell for a girl I care a great deal for. I love her. But it bothers me that crossdressing and fantasy give me greater pleasure than the thought of being naked next to this girl. It sucks. And I feel lost.

Thank you to anyone who has kept on reading this long post from someone who is not even transgender. Thank you for your patience, time, and support. God bless and Merry Christmas.

I would like to get SRS, but mostly as a convenience thing rather than due to genital dysphoria. I hate tucking and I hate the fact that I can't wear panties/lingerie without being very uncomfortable. Skirts and dresses also present concerns, meaning that I rarely allow myself to actually go out as girly as I'd like to be.

I've been so dysphoric for the past week and it's driving me insane so I figured I would vent here, maybe see if anyone could just talk to me for a bit.

So I'm moving out of my parents place because they do not support me being trans, flat out refusing to use the pronouns I asked for and even going as far as to say ""I hate that you picked my middle name as yours."" Which wasn't even intentional mom, I just like the name. So I've been stressed because of that, trying to get myself ready before I leave which feeds into the next part.

When I'm on reddit I usually end up having transtimelines in my feed and I just out of pure curiousity click it and when I see those people... looking so cute and attractive, in such a short amount of time... I get super jealous about all of it, cupsize, face, hair, clothing, all of it because I don't really see myself as having any of it. I can't dress do to family, six months and I'm only an A-cup, I still think I look way to masculine in my face etc.

Eventually for me... Jealousy turns into anger and sadness, which feeds into the dysphoria and I just get so down on myself I don't know how to cope with it, I'm always asking my freinds to help me and I'm starting to worry that they are getting annoyed with me asking them for help so much. I feel like I'm being a burden on them when they have their own problems and issues that they want to work through and have solved.

LauraVex,asktransgender,Testosterone gone up since starting HRT? (MtF),"Okay, so I had my first visit with my endo back in August and she order some blood work. At the time my testosterone level was at 475. It took about 2 months before I could start HRT, October 2nd was my start date. November 30th was my last visit with my next one not being until like June. At my last visit she upped my dose (went from 25mg of Spiro to 50 and 0.05mg estrogen to 0.1) and she ordered some more blood work. I just saw the results and my T-level has gone up 25 points to 500!!!

Has this happened to anyone else? I have already started seeing some changes, for instance my breasts started growing almost immediately (Lefty is nearly an A cup at this point and Righty is still a little behind) and my facial features are starting to soften (that one is very resent and has been confirmed by a few co-workers so I know its not just in my head).

Test results aside, I seem to already be experiencing pretty good results. From what I've read, I am seeing changes a little earlier than a lot of people and haven't experienced certain other changes yet (my facial hair is growing back a little slower than before and spots on my legs the hair is already getting thinning and reverting back to basically being a step above peach fuzz).

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Should I be concerned? I am fairly aware of what I put into my body, meaning I've been eating healthier than I was 6 months ago (marginally, but baby steps, right?) and I've been drinking more water (not as much as I should but considering I used to never drink water I've greatly upped my water in take) and I work out but mostly in my leg/butt/hips/stomach area. I am kind of freaking out if you can't tell. I am worried that maybe my body is somehow rejecting the Spiro and estrogen? Idk if that's a thing or not. Oh, also if it helps my E-level is at like 32.

BigBoud,asktransgender,How do hormones for transwomen work IRL?,"Please forgive me if this is something that gets asked all the time, I don't follow this sub, but I have a genuine question for the transwomen out there. (Note: should add that I am not trans or thinking of transitioning, just interested to learn more.)

I understand that the common hormone prescribed as HRT for transwomen is basically a form of estrogen, which causes feminisation of the body. [According to some](http://www.theestablishment.co/2016/05/31/yes-trans-women-can-get-period-symptoms/), it may cause PMS-like symptoms occurring cyclically.

Does anyone here have experience of this? I admit I'm fascinated. I absolutely don't understand what's going on here, if this does happen, because I was under the impression that most of those unpleasant symptoms were caused by rising progesterone, and *falling* estrogen - but if you are on HRT, surely your estrogen levels are stable?

Please help me explore the subject!

EDIT: I'm not actually fussed about whether or not the changes scientifically constitute a ""menstrual cycle"", more interested in people's lived experiences and perceptions of hormonal fluctuation. (I mean, we're still not clear whether PMS is real or a social construct, so…)"
piscina_dela_muerta,asktransgender,Feeling happily overwhelmed.,"Last I spent a half hour just looking at myself in the mirror. I was wearing a tank top and jeans, no makeup. With winter clothes, I hadn't even really looked at my form in a while. Working 6 days a week in a hair net also doesn't give many opportunities to really do my hair. But I stared at myself and was so overwhelmed by the fact that I saw a girl in the mirror. And a pretty one at that. My hair is longer than it's ever been. My face is cute even without makeup. My form actually looks pretty feminine with a few more masculine features that will hopefully get worked out in time (damn shoulders). But really...I'm fucking pulling this off. Wow. "
HiddenLaura,asktransgender,If there was ever doubt in me...now there is none,"So I have been on HRT since 5/5/2016. I still believe that my levels are low (90pg/ml of E for reference). I do have an appointment with another endo very soon.

I recently took the plunge and ordered some forms. Now that they are in and I have been able to judge for myself how they make me feel. I can honestly say that it feels like I have been reunited with a long lost part of myself. Even if it is only temporary; due to them not being a real part of me.

Now all doubt, however small there was, is gone. I know that I am seeking the proper care and am on the correct path to subdue forever this ugly creature we all call Dysphoria."

[deleted],asktransgender,I've accepted myself as transgender and (mostly) come out to my wife. Struggling with fear and what the next step is?,"I really struggled to accept myself as transgender, and I'm sure that's a common problem. I had had depression and anxiety and OCD for most of my life and never associated it before this year with gender dysphoria.

Once I knew of its existence it created maddening stress and depression, and a couple times I lost it. The first time I ""told"" my wife I was having a meltdown and panic attack and admitted ""I might not want to be a guy"" and though I didn't back down that night I did eventually as the dyphoria from that disappeared. During that night she just was having trouble comprehending what I was saying and mentioned that I had been the exact opposite of a woman. Among our circle of friends I'm regarded as the one most into sports, athletics, nerdy video games, and I am the most athletic.

I told her later the GD was a side effect of my ADHD medication and brushed it off. Eventually a second panic came in and I admitted that the feelings were real and I was really struggling with them, but we didn't go much more into it.

My depression worsened, the dysphoria increased the closer I came to realizing how badly I wanted to live as a woman. Soon I realized my depression was partially because of GD but mostly because I was so afraid of telling my wife. My wife has not shown any, and I mean any, signs of being anything but starkly heterosexual.

The thought in my head that made me realize it was this: ""If my wife was all in and accepted it and was happy to teach you and she would be perfectly content being with you as a girl, what would I do?""

What I would do is probably get the letter from my therapist immediately to start HRT.

So last weekend I had another depressive emotional episode while I sat alone during our party with our friends and sent her a text saying I had GD and some things that wasn't necessarily new information but it was reaffirming it definitely exists. The ride home we talked about it and her reaction was not terrible. She was tearing up a bit and said that it will take time to process.

Few days later she asks me out of curiosity about some clothes I secretly had that I purged away. Like what kind of bra I got, what my jeans size was, and some other stuff, which ended up making her a little emotional again. She wondered why I'm just telling her now after dating for 8 years (I'm 28 btw) and she just doesn't know how to feel about her husband wearing women's clothes. She also mentioned that she knows this won't go away and I'll become a woman, and in fear I countered with ""well not necessarily; with therapy and anti depressants and knowledge of what I have I can minimize and live with it."" She is also afraid of what other will think or do to me and doesn't have an outlet to talk about her feelings about me.

Plus now our washer doesn't work, car battery dead, my car's headlights are out, she's stressed as hell at work, her friends brag about all the stuff they have and then complain about not having any money, and she just couldn't handle my revelation and broke down and cried most of the day.

I love this girl more than life. She is everything to me, and is the sole things that could stop me from doing anything. Fear of losing her also caused me to hide so much from her as I would just be depressed so often without her knowing why.

She seems to accept me for who I am, but I don't know what's in her head. I'm so anxious and scared and I'm not sure if I should push things on her right now or ""give it some time"" during which my dysphoria is going nuts. And yet I'm also still trying to convince myself that I would be better off as a man, and be a man, and raise a family as a father.

It hasn't really progressed farther in our conversations than ""I like wearing women's clothes and would like the idea of being a woman"" so there is no concept of me doing anything outwardly feminine in front of her or being referred to as she.

I'm also afraid of referring any reading or having her talk to someone because of language like ""she"" ""transgender"" ""change"" and I would be scared it would scare her away from me.

I don't know what to do at all. We just purchased a house like 2 months ago and got married a year and a half ago (shortly before I consciously discovered my GD).

Any advice or help would be great. I'm having trouble working because I'm so anxious and dysphoric and confused.

Thanks so much for the help! "

I'm 23 (although I tell people I'm 21) and post-op (I'm MTF). I had SRS with Chettawut a year ago and FFS 1.5 years ago with facial team. My transition was different from most of yours I think. I lived at home with my parents and droped out of college after depression/alcoholism issues related to me being trans. I've been in a cocoon for two years, just staying home, never going out. I have no friends.  
  
However, I plan on going to art school next year. I am finally going to start living I guess. I'm very anxious that I don't pass (I really need to work on my voice) and that people will know. And even if they don't, that me being trans will be an issue. I am straight and like men, but I'm scared I'll never have a bf. I'm a virgin and I might die one, it's awful. Tell me, is it likely that I'll find a bf one day ? I feel so lonely sometimes it almost scares me.

So I've been very slowly buying more and more things to experiment with my gender identity and expression when I'm by myself. I've worked with makeup, nail polish, shaving, and wearing boyshorts.

Portalboat,asktransgender,Does anyone have a list of endos in the Vegas/Henderson area?,"Recently, my insurance stopped covering visits to my current endo, and I'm quite confident that any new prescriptions from her are not going to be covered either.

Anyways, does anyone have a list of LGBT-friendly endos in the Vegas/Henderson area, and also any advice on how to explain my situation to them?

debraMckenz,asktransgender,Could my brother be trans too?,"My brother kind of had more of a typical transgender childhood than I did. He crossdressed in mom's clothes as a kid and stuff. He was 2nd born and they thought he was going to be a girl and had a girl's name ready. And he kind of rebelled at every turn of our childhood whereas I just tried my best to fit in....I never DARED to try on girl clothes. It seemed too scary to even go down that path.

He told me about some of this when I first finally came out at age 28 but he seemed to deny being trans or anything himself, it was just 'exploration'.

Now he's in his 30s and has lived life as a man longer than I did but he struggles with alcoholism and depression. But one weird fact is that he often wears his wife's panties...like to work or just in general under his clothes. 

I've talked to him a little about crossdresser vs transitioner stuff and he did flat out say he was fine being a man.

Just some things kinda all clicked the other night.....his struggles with alcoholism and depression and insomnia. I wonder if there is something deeper there (i.e.: being trans) that maybe he doesn't even want to admit to himself."

I feel like the way my body looks is giving me transgender feelings, but not in the way I've usually read about. When I look look at my body, I see a skinny waist, nice hips and legs, and smooth skin, and as ashamed as I am to admit it, not only do I just like the way my body looks, it kinda turns me on. But I also notice the aspects of my body that don't match the ones I like: my largish hands and feet, my slightly broader shoulders, and my face, which is androgynous at best.

The way looking at my body makes me feel is so confusing, and I really don't like it. On one hand, I wish I *did* have a more feminine, if not a female body, but I just don't know that this entirely matches with the way I feel inside, the way I feel about everything else.

I would really appreciate it if I could get some advice on this as it has been a source of constant mental torment for quite some time, it's starting to get me down. Thank you so much, I will reply as much as I can!"

HeadBandHalo,asktransgender,"Are seemingly innocuous statements like, ""oh! That's why you always had long pretty hair!"" Problematic for male gender expression??","So, since coming out to people in my life, I've heard a lot statements along the lines of ""oh I always had an idea!"" Or ""oh that makes sense about you know."" And like these statements always affirm my femininity, but looking outside from my perspective are these kind of statements partly responsible for limiting male gender expression? 

Here's some examples I've heard in my own life.

""Oh yeah well you were always so small and cute!""

""Yeah, you could never be a guy with an ass like that ""

""I mean, look at you. What man is that petite and sensitive? 

""So that's why you always shaved your legs!""

""Well you always had such long and feminine hair . 

""Guys clothes never really fit you, everything just looked off. Women's clothes definitely suit you more ""

""Yeah. You always had those dainty feet and ankles."" 

""Well you wore like dresses and tights sometimes. What guy does that?""

""Oh okay. The cross dressing makes total sense now.""

""Oh yeah, so that's why you went as sailor moon that one Halloween""'

""You got mani and pedis and shaved your legs. What guy does that? 

""Yeah when I first saw you from behind I thought you were a girl. Cuz the long hair....and your butt lol"" 

And numerous more comments about my long hair or rear end. Has anyone else here gotten comments like this in their life?? Do you feel like that remarks like these contribute to a culture where we heavily police the limits of male gender expression? 

I'm just curious to hear others experiences. I am from Texas where the gender binary is heavily enforced and the male ideal is a withdrawn stoic man. I do feel like certain people in my life view me , a gender conforming girl, as much more tolerable and ""normal"" than a flamboyant hyper femme gay man for example. Ugh the south ��

lunafiregold,asktransgender,Family Rejection?,"How do I deal with this? My parents have really laid into me the past couple of days, and I don't think there's a chance in hell of them ever accepting me. It seems I will be disowned if I transition for sure. 

They want me to seek out therapy. Not gender therapy or anything (on the contrary, they specifically don't want me to seek this...), just general therapy in the hopes that said therapist can cure me of these thoughts or something. I'm tempted to just go along with this to appease them but I think in the end it will all be for nothing when I inevitably end up transitioning anyway, and their rejection follows.

My mother has a visceral hatred for trans people, and LGBT+ people in general so I kind of expected this. But it still really hurts. She keeps making it about her, as if I'm just doing this to hurt her or something. I really don't know what to do. :( 

I honestly regret even telling them, but since I'm intending to start HRT soon I felt I had to. But now I wish I had just pretended nothing was happening up until the point I could no longer hide it, and then found a way to just cut contact.

DeadliestTulip,asktransgender,Two month anniversary on hormones! (NSFW),"Hi! So I've been on hormones for 2 months and here is an update!

Apparantly my estrogen is really high and I can't take my estrogen pills anymore. I still take my 200mg of spiro daily tho. By high I mean like 1780 highness on pills and this was a month ago. it's probably higher. Someone mentioned maybe I'm intersex and that's why. I dunno I'm honestly built like a girl. If it wasn't for my voice and facial hair you would mistake me for a girl.Well that and my lack of hair.  so if I had hair too lol.

I got some hair back!!!! Nothing regrew in the reseeding (sp) hairline tho. But I have new blonde hairs growing all through especially in the center area. I'm a natural blonde. Although you couldn't tell right now because my hair looks dead and It's not very long.

My chest hair has thinned a bit. My thigh hair not so much. My arm hair has also thinned a bit. More so in the middle. Not as much near my hand. My facial hair has thinned a little. My neck hair not so much at all. My hair grows much slower. I can tell because I only shave every thursday and by thursday it wasn't as long as it normally is.

My skin is noticeably smoother pretty universally. 

My penis doesn't ejaculate anything. It also shouldn't be there lol. My libido is still pretty non-existent. But I'm ok with that. I feel like I have control over my life and not on a penis schedule lol. I just don't care to have sex. It's not on my high priority of things. Before it would be. I'm ok with that.

My boobs have gotten larger. Like I can grab and squeeze. I still don't fill an A-cup tho. I have an occasional boob pain and itchy boob but nothing terrible. Once I had nipple pain but didn't last long.

I've had 4 Episode in a month of random crying.Nothing in the first month. I've had several occasions of being emotional. I had one break down recently where my dysphoria was really bad and cried due to sadness. Not included in the 4 I mentioned earlier. I was fine after an hour tho. The trigger was just a combination of thoughts from my letter of my blood results being pretty bad (high cholesterol and tryg's), to not feeling feminine enough, to feeling like a fake trans, to feeling why did I have to be trans, and just a bunch of shit rolled up in a burrito.

I've gained some hips not much tho. I can tell because I can feel fat that wasn't there before and I lost weight. (184 to 170).

I LOVE being a woman. It's a very strange happiness that I can only imagine that's how cis people feel normally. 

Okee I hope all of you are doing well. If you'd like to share or have comments please do so!? If you have questions feel free to ask. :)

Take care!

dra6000,asktransgender,How does everyone think about their parents?,"Super wall of text warning.
Divided up into sections for easier reading.
Skip to bottom for tl;dr

Introduction:
I needed a question for the title, and I guess that fits? I've mainly been wondering about my own parents. I'm 16 MtF pre-everything.  I post here every now and then and I mainly just look at others posts.

My Trouble:
Getting to the point, my parents have denied my request for HRT (including just blockers), say that being trans is a product of me being around too many sick strangers (my friends that I know through the internet), and a lack of a healthy lifestyle (this includes a few family issues).

This contributed largely to moderate depression last year. Yeah, moderate depression isn't ""moderate"" for those of you that don't know what it is. It means the depression starts to affect your life. At times, especially during Christmas Day 2015, I was in a lot of pain. I contemplated suicide and I even idealized it at some points. 

I'm not that anymore. Beyond anything, I have not fully recovered. I do not idealise suicide, but at the same time, I have trouble finding a point in happiness. I question happiness with cynicism remembering the fated Disney World trip during my depression, all fake smiles to please a crowd.

My Thoughts:
I have to question the validity of someone making me go through this without even questioning the research soley on judgement.

I understand that:
They did not mean it, they were looking out for me. They are parents. That's what parents do.

And also understand in contrast:
That your intent doesn't matter if you don't step back to question your own ideals.

Useful connecting to the points tl;dr:
I don't know what to think of my parents because they've done things that've just... I can't look at them the same way anymore.


*edit*
I seem to have forgotten to mention that my parents refuse to let me see a psychologist or psychatrist because they have convinced themselves that I am not open to change in the right direciton. I was seeing one for a while and nothing really happend. I think my mother mentioned at one point she said ""I showed no signs of being trans."" I will mention I was seeing her for other reasons. I'm going to be honest, she said it was likely I had ODD or Oppositional Defiant Disorder...? Whatever that is. When i was tested, I failed, badly, for ODD. Some psychologist. Ever since that incident, my mother who is the only one who would ever support seeing a psychologist (my father doesn't believe they work) has lost hope because of her time wasted on that first one (six months).

YareYare_Dawa,asktransgender,Do I somehow pass or do people simply not care?,"I know my title is worded very strangely but it's a thought hanging around in my head the past few days. I've only been on HRT for not even two months now but I'm fed up of presenting as a male in public, so when I do go out I wear women's clothing and use my girl voice I've been working on to speak.

Passing wise I can't say if I truly do pass somehow or if people don't care to give me a harder look at. Now I do have very long hair that I've grown out prior to transition, I've been working hard on my voice and isn't perfect, and the same goes for my makeup skills. Despite it all I still get called ma'am by cashiers and have people give double takes with my old license/name and I've used the women's restroom so far without any issue.

Back to my thought on it all: do I truthfully pass as a woman to people or as I said do they not care enough to give me passing glances and assume? Is this a thought that anyone else deals with at all?

Anyway, I am the manager of a very small store. It's me and two other employees and that's it. My line of work requires me to be pretty close to my customers, as I need to know a lot about what they're looking for. So a lot of my customers know me very well, and know that ""I'm female"". Or at least they assume I am.

I plan on getting T by May of 2017. I guess I'm looking for input on how to really go about doing this. I don't want our sales to drop or cause any confrontation because of my transliness.

Stephanie_B2,asktransgender,Why are so many religious conservative people in general offended by transgender people?,"What have we ever done to them to deserve this hate?

So yes, if we strip out minds off all religious prejudices, we might become human again, and start loving again...

Hylian,asktransgender,Normal amount of breast growth?,"I am mtf and have been on hormones for a little over four months or so.

elisegalea,asktransgender,Immediate coming out changes???,"So I'm pretty crazy which I think is mostly due to my testosterone still consuming my body. I'm so extra. Has anyone noticed that they chilled a lot after they came out? I will take hormones soon but I'm coming out first and I really just don't like who I am.

Tbh I already technically present feminine and I tell people that I'm gonna come out as transgender soon so literally everyone knows but I just haven't told my family so once I do that I'm good. I just worry that I'll always give off this ""boy in a dress"" persona- which I get we all fear but I guess it's just a super big concern for me because coming out won't even mean me presenting different. I'll literally be the same. So I imagine everyone will still see me as a male.

Also, was it easier for you to feminize your voice after you came out? I'm already very very feminine- my voice sits at around a C4 but my resonance is off. Did anyone notice any immediate changes after coming out? Was it easier to be more like a woman lol?

And for anyone, what was something you noticed happened right when you came out? ie. people's treatment of you, the way they spoke to you, how you were able to adapt to presenting entirely differently, etc. Just share your experiences!

Just a calmness I've never felt in my life, just being so ready and composed, it's not how I would expect it to be. I'm sure it will be difficult being away from my freinds who did support me in a new place but I have to do this for me, so I can actually transition, so I can wear what I want, sound how I want, be who I actually am and not have to pretend anymore.

Conflicted123456,asktransgender,Advice on visiting GP for GIC referal (UK),"So, i've been mentally preparing for a while to finally take action on my situation.  I've done a fair bit of lurking in various places to make sure what I wanted was right, see what other people have done, understand the process etc.


So I basically told myself today i'm going to the GP and getting the ball rolling today no matter what (due to the long waiting times).  However, I suddenly doing a lot of reading before I make my appointment today and I don't feel prepared at all and I have no idea what i'm doing.


My assumption was that GPs basically know nothing, they can just do the referral and that is the end of it as its not really and area of their expertise.  However, I feel I may not have kept up with the UK proceedure enough, as there are talk of changing name, going public beforehand etc.  (I truly hate and am uncomfortable about everything about myself).


There also seems to be the topic of which GIC to be referred to, as waiting times seem to massively vary.  I Currently live in the North East, but honestly I have no issue traveling across the county for an appointment if i helps significantly.


Any feedback on whats its like/what I should do/what I should ask would be greatly appreciated   


EDIT: It went absolutely amazing, a lot of worrying over nothing.  GP was really supportive and understanding as I had hoped she would be, her only requirement was that I was able to say that I want to be female (She was subtlety making it clear she just needed me to directly say it to be able to put the referral through).

CosmicMina,asktransgender,More hormone advice,"I found a good endo, finally. I have a question as I am now kinda panicking over the results she sent me and it was via email so there were no follow up questions.

My initial blood test was taken within 32 hours of an IM injection and my estradiol levels were above the high end. Once I finally got to see the endo we postulated that this was because of the test being at the beginning of the cycle when it should have been taken mid-cycle. She ordered another blood test as it was the end of the cycle to see where I was at. 

I got the test  back and the results were just low of the female range (taken less than two days before my next injection). Here is the panic, is this normal? She doesn't want to see me for three months, but I do not want low estrogen levels? She instructed me to do the follow-up test mid-cycle, which makes sense. I would like to divide the dose in half for a more even application, but in Korea hormones come in glass ampules.

Thank you again for the advice.

She is at least trying to understand me better, but every time I try to have a serious conversation about it, I get depressed and all of my thoughts go completely haywire.

So, the way I understand HRT right now is that going on just blockers is unsustainable in the longer term, given that osteoperosis is a concern. If I can get estrogen, this eliminates the huge risk of osteoperosis, but is it still advised that I get orchi before too long?

Also, how much should I expect to pay for FFS?"

It's constant, not matter how great my life is going, I always have his lingering thought in the back of my mind that I don't actually look like a woman, that I don't actually pass, that people just humor me, and I'm terrible at being a woman even though most things in my life suggest otherwise. Honestly I get that I'm probably just depressed and living with an unaccepting family probably doesn't help but I feel powerless to make this situation better. I've also been thinking that maybe I've just had too many bad experiences in my room (which is where I spend 95% of the time I'm home) and that triggers my depression. I really I think I need to move out, but if I move out, I would have to use my srs fund to support myself and if I do that, I know I'll hate myself.

Afterward, while standing in the line for Starbucks at the same store, I noticed the guy was still staring at me with that bemused expression on his face. Apparently, business was slow enough for him to take his sweet time to make me as uncomfortable and humiliated as possible. I couldn't take that level of discomfort and so I left without getting a drink.

Hopelessfox,asktransgender,"Girl likes me (mtf), but doesn't know I'm in the process of transitioning. We hooked up this weekend. Need advice.","So, this a predicament that I could really use some advice on. I'm in my mid-twenties and I've been on hormones (estrodial and spiro) for 7 months, i.e. I'm mtf. I don't pass yet and I've never tried because I'm still in the process of lazering the hair on my face. I've done 5 sessions and it's coming along, just slow. That said I still look way more feminine that I did 7 months ago and the changes are definitely coming along. 

The friends I'm out to have told me I have nothing to worry about. I dress using a mixture of men's and women's clothing, e.g. I  wear women's skinny jeans and jeggins from american eagle paired with a mens v neck and flannel button down. Things like that. I've taken to wearing a sports bra lately too because it's getting kind obvious that my chest is developing. I have a size 8 gauge piercing in each lobe as well as a cartiledge piercing in one ear. I'm growing out my hair, which I straighten and I'll frequently wear headbands. 

Okay, so the reason why I just tried to describe what I looked like is because there is this girl whom I've been developing a friendship with over the last couple of months. She is a first year student in our graduate program so she is a year below me. She also didn't know me before I started hormones so she has no sense that I've changed a lot lately.I have been really confused by my sexuality lately and that in combination with having lowered sex drive from the hormones and just the general nature of transitioning has made me avoid physical relationships. 

Anyway, long story short we ended up having sex this weekend and we spent all day Sunday laying in bed watching movies. When I say sex I mean oral considering I have no interested in penetration and my penis doesn't really even work well enough for that. She figured that out when I told her not to worry about me, even though she tried. We still had a lot of fun, and playing with her and kissing is totally fine with me. 

So my problem is she doesn't know I'm trans and that I'm transitioning, and I feel really really bad for not telling her. I'm also mad at myself for even getting into this. Thus my question to you all is what should I do now? I know I need to tell her, but I have no idea how to bring this up and what to say. Like do I just say hey by the way I'm trans? Should I do it in person or over the phone? Should I let her know that I'm still open to things? Ideally she would be bisexual (or something like that I guess?), but I don't know her orientation. I'm guessing saying something sooner rather than later would be the best course of action? Ugh, I hate that I've done this and I hate the idea of hurting someone. The whole thing also made me question if its even possible for me to ever be a legitimate woman. Like I feel like a fraud. Ugh.

I am married to a wonderful wife, am a MBA student and have a successful career in a corporation making seriously decent money. 

I have given myself a goal, to start transitioning by 30, or don't. A Shit or Get off the Pot sort of stance. There is not a day that goes by that I don't think of transitioning. Generally thoughts are ""When I transition...""

I am so scared to make that leap. I am scared of losing my wife (I have previously asked her in a ""non-serious"" manner, what would happen if I ever wanted to be a girl and she said she would stay with me and make it work), my career, my friends and my life in general.

Lately, the mentality has been getting worse. I stared into the mirror for nearly an hour thinking about how much I hate the man staring back at me.

We haven't been able to find any resources specific to our concern, so we've decided to ask other members of the trans* community to see if there's anyone who can help us. We have two main questions. This is quite a long one so apologies for the length.

Question 1:

E came out to us when she was 14 (she’s now 20), and while we were both initially quite shocked we love her for who she is no matter what her gender, and have always tried to be as supportive as we possibly can be. 

E underwent surgery in mid 2016 and at the time we were all made aware of her aftercare needs during her recovery by the team at the hospital and gender identity clinics. 

Since surgery E has been very neglectful of her aftercare.  Initially E would douche and perform recommended aftercare only when my mum pressured her to do so. Now she refuses to do it at all, and my mum is reluctant to pressure her further because it causes arguments. 

E has always had a somewhat questionable approach to personal hygiene, and when she was growing up she would tell my mum she didn’t want to wash or shower because she was so distressed by her physical maleness and didn’t want to see her body. Since she has had surgery, this hasn’t improved, but based on what she’s said to us, we don’t think E is reluctant to do aftercare because she is distressed, rather, she just seems apathetic. “I can’t be arsed to do it”, “I’ll do it later”, “I’m too lazy” is the language she uses.

Based on what we were told by medical and gender identity experts, Mum and I are very worried about E’s unwillingness to perform aftercare. We want her to have the best life she can as a woman, and certainly don’t want her to suffer any post surgery complications. E has always been unconcerned with passing. She doesn’t like wearing typically feminine clothes or makeup, and while we understand no trans woman should be pressured into passing if she doesn’t feel she should, we don’t know if her decision here is intertwined with her attitude to aftercare post surgery. Mum is unwilling to directly confront E because it causes extremely emotional arguments. Even as a young child E was very emotionally manipulative, and we don’t know if she is actually distressed by this line of questioning or is deliberately pretending to be because she knows it will make Mum drop the subject.

So our first question: Does anyone know of precedent for this kind of attitude to aftercare, and what should we do? We want the best for E, and we are very worried that she’s making decisions that will have severely negative long term consequences to her life as a woman.

Question 2

Six months ago E started a relationship with a straight cis man. Obviously, we have no problem with this. However, E hasn’t told him that she is trans, and has no plans to do so. She has just agreed to take a new job in the same company he works for, and there is now talk about her moving closer to where he lives (she currently lives at home). She also maintains lies to this guy about several other aspects of her life unrelated to her gender.

Obviously, we are very concerned that she seems to be making weighty life decisions based on a relationship that’s solely maintained through an elaborate web of lies, and we would be concerned about that no matter what her gender identity. However, her gender identity adds a layer of complexity that we’re struggling to untangle. 

We understand that a person’s gender identity is no business of anyone else, and no trans person should feel pressured to reveal that they are transgender to anyone. However, it seems to me there are issues of consent involved, and her boyfriend is basically going out with someone who isn’t who he thinks she is. 

Unfortunately, E’s boyfriend is very socially conservative and would be unlikely to take it well if she revealed herself. Knowing about the kind of persecution trans folk face, we are starting to become concerned about what might happen if he did find out, particularly if he found out she’d been deceiving him. 

We have tried talking to E about this, but she immediately becomes angry and upset (or seems to) and shuts down completely, refusing to speak about the issue at all. I have suggested just being more forceful and arguing her down, but my Mum is very reluctant to do this, because she believes E might run away or attempt suicide (she worries intensely about trans suicide rates). Personally I don’t believe E would do either of those things, but I do not want to confront her on my own because it might irreparably damage the relationship between all three of us.

So, question number 2:

Who trumps whom with the issue of secrecy? Is E’s right to privacy more important than her boyfriend’s right to not be deceived about whom he sleeps with? We just don’t know. Secondly, can anyone recommend a sensible course of action for approaching E about this?

We’re so upset and worried about her. We don’t know if we’ve done something wrong in the way we’ve supported her and we’re frightened that she’s making choices now that have the potential to ruin her life. We just want to help her have the best life she can, but she is extremely resistant to talking about any of this with us. If anyone has any input to offer at all we’d be extremely grateful.

transthrowaway84284,asktransgender,"I'm attracted to trans women (who I acknowledge are women), but I prefer cis women. And I'm sort of a trans woman myself. Am I an asshole?","I'm fond of describing myself as *transfemme*. To keep it short, I'm assigned-male, want to transition to become androgynous (leaning feminine), and I want to keep my penis.

I acknowledge that trans women are women, and I'm attracted to them as well as other femme assigned-male-at-birth transfolk, but I have a preference for cisgender women, and non-binary assigned-female femmes. Does this make me a horrible person?

It doesn't have anything to do with penises. I'm not sure what it is.

I think it might have to do with me being in the closet everywhere except online. I look and act like a dude, and think like one too, as much as I'd like to look like '90s Winona Ryder. I spend too much time around men, and their shittiness (not saying all men are shitty; just the ones I have to be around) rubs off on me. Sometimes I joke that I'm a man in a woman's body in a man's body.

Or maybe I'm just immature.

But to even it all out, I don't actually want to be with anyone, nor have I ever been with anyone. It's all theoretical. When I think of my dream girl, for some reason I always imagine her being assigned-female and femme. It doesn't have anything to do with uteri, or vaginas. I don't know what it is. I'm just an immature scumbag.

I feel like I sound like I'm pretending to be trans to make myself sound like less of a shitbag. Sometimes it feels that way generally. But I am trans. I look in the mirror and, while for years I didn't really care, I'm starting to become real disgusted by what I see, and extremely sad that I may never look the way I want. So yeah."
piscina_dela_muerta,asktransgender,Dysphoria and breach of trust. How to move past it?,"So I (MtF 21) have been dating this guy (FtM 20) for a couple weeks now. Pretty casually. Like, our dates mainly consist of netflix, sex, and long conversations about important things like our Harry Potter headcannons. I really like him. 

On our last date though, something happened that I'm having trouble moving past. He came over to my place and we had a couple drinks (he actually had a fair bit more than I did) and we watched Zootopia, had snacks, had sex, talked for a while ect. As per usual. It was a good night, we were feeling it, so we starting having sex again. It was the normal build up, making out, hands everywhere...then he grabs my dick, sticks it inside of him, and starts riding me....this is a huge no for me and I was kinda in shock going from """"What are you doing..?"" To ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING??"" And pushing him off pretty fast. 

I started having a panic attack while trying to explain to him that I have a lot of genital dysphoria all while he's trying to comfort me and tripping all over himself apologizing. He was very sincere about it, imo. He was drunk. It was the heat of the moment. After things had calmed down (he did a wonderful job of comforting me) I told him to look me in the eye while I said ""I don't blame you. I'm not mad. I still like you. I still want to be around you. I don't want you to leave. I don't want you to distance yourself from me. I feel the same way about you that I did before."" I repeated that to him 3 more times in the next 24 hours after that. And I mean it. But I'm still kinda stressed about it. Still a bit dysphoric about it. 

I'm also slightly upset with him because I wasn't wearing a condom when he decided to ride me. But we'll talk about that one later. 

What do I do to move past it?

Edit: a word"
understandinggender,asktransgender,PSA: Don't Go to Any Medical Providers Who Don't SPECIFICALLY State that They Work with Trans Patients,"Two weeks ago, I needed to get my antidepressant renewed, and after two years of therapy working through my gender issues, I decided it was time to talk to a medical provider about the process of beginning HRT too. I live in the Seattle area, but instead of driving all the way into Seattle mid-day (which is a pain) to see a transgender-specific clinic, I decided to try a medical facility in my Seattle suburb. When I called to make the appointment, I *specifically* stated that I wanted to take to the MD about my antidepressant *and also* beginning male-to-female Hormone Replacement Therapy. The scheduler who answered the phone asked a couple of (stupid, but harmless) questions, which I answered, and my appointment was created for a couple of days later.

On appointment day, I met the doctor, and she readily assisted me with renewing my antidepressant. From there, she seemed really uneasy, and it was obvious she wasn't going to begin the conversation about hormones. And after all the emotional psych-up I had to do to get to this point, I wasn't going to miss this opportunity, so I said that I had also come to this appointment to also discuss transitioning. The doctor replied something about how my file said that and ""I don't want to start anything I don't know about.""

Now, I appreciate that, in her own way, the doctor was honest about not being knowledgeable about HRT, but at the same time, I felt like, ""Well, *you're* not the one who is going to be starting anything - *I* would be the one starting HRT - so you're really saying 'I don't want to learn anything new to help you.'"" And though I believe the doctor didn't mean it to come off this way, it felt like a real brush-off, as if the crippling gender issues that I've spent years, thousands of dollars, and a lot of emotional turmoil understanding weren't worth her concern as a doctor. Lastly, I would have understood this reaction if I had just surprised her with this, but I had *specifically* made the appointment days ago with this request, so the doctor had plenty of time to educate herself about HRT.

I asked if she could provide me a referral to another provider for this issue, and she said that the person who does their referrals was in the office day, so she would check with that person and get right back to me. ""Ok, at least I'm getting somewhere,"" I thought. About thirty minutes later, the doctor returns for a millisecond to tell me the referral person doesn't have any referrals for this issue, and that person will call me when they have a referral. I thanked the doctor and left. Three weeks later, still no call from the referral person, I'm no closer to even seeing if I'm a candidate for hormones, and I feel like an idiot for not driving into Seattle to see a trans-inclusive medical provider.

Moral of the story: don't go to any medical provider who does not *specifically* advertise that they work with trans patients. It's a waste of your time, energy, and money to try."
M_LadyGwendolyn,asktransgender,Need help with letters for surgery,"So I'm scheduled to get breast augmentation Jan 18th. I have my letter from planned parent hood about hormones, but I apparently need two more, one from a general practitioner/primary care doctor which I don't have, and a letter from a PhD or MD therapist which I also don't have. Both my therapists that haven't seen in many months or years were both social workers.

dnalbes,asktransgender,Experience with One Medical?,"It looks like my new employer pays for One Medical, which makes some noise on their website about competence with trans people/our care and gives you a list of providers which they at least imply will prescribe hormones. Has anyone ever put this to the test? If they really have the sort of appointment availability they claim, I can try them out while waiting on an appointment with the other local options.\* But if they've been a disaster for multiple people, I might not bother.

(Of course, they claim all their providers are at least minimally competent when it comes to trans stuff. I've gotten burned badly by providers at clinics that claimed that in the past. If they hadn't said that, I'd probably be a little less wary.)

\*I have mixed feelings about the whole concierge medicine thing as a matter of principle. But if me going there shortens someone else's wait for hormones in the first place, that's a social good, right?"
Xaxasa,asktransgender,Can dieting make dysphoria worse?,"Okay, so I've dealt with these issues for a while now. Good year or two. Told myself I could contain it with just cross dressing, make-up, acting more feminine and some minor voice training. But it's slowly breaking me up lately.

Before this all happened I never really cared much for my body or maintaining it, but that changed pretty swiftly once I found my uh more feminine side, so to speak. 

However the dysphoria has been getting exponentially worse, especially the last four months or so. I started dieting around the same time because I want to get into HRT being fairly skinny. I'm eating about 1000 calories a day, and while the diet has had great effect (15kg~ down - getting closer and closer to my ideal weight), I've never felt as fat, disgusting and masculine when I look into the mirror as before. I've also lost a lot of weight around my hips and not so much in my face, which is making me feel absolutely terrible. I cry about it regularly. This may sound absolutely ridiculous, and I know it's really fucking dumb, but my chest is all flat again after the weight loss and even though I know it's just fat I lost, it's making me feel really bad too.

At the same time, dieting is giving me a sense of accomplishment and I definitely don't want to stop. I'm not going to stop. I don't have any physical problems and definitely feel a lot healthier in the body department. Not so tired anymore etc. So that's all good. It's purely in my head. I do have a diverse diet, from rice, wheat products and (mostly lean) meat to fruit and dairy products as well as fish. 

People tell me I look a lot thinner and amazing, but I don't see it. I see chubby cheeks, a belly and a nasty fat dude. Rationally, I know I'm thinner, because my pants and underwear are nearly dropping down onto my ankles when I go out into the streets, so how come I can barely look into the mirror anymore at this point without wanting to throw up?

So am I thinking my way into an eating disorder? Is this connecting to dysphoria? Can me dieting and being forced to inspect my body in the mirror daily be making my dysphoria worse? Is it the dysphoria that's making me want to lose this weight faster? Or is it just a coincidence?  I thought about maybe a B12 dificiency, but it just doesn't fit. 

Does anyone have similar experiences?

I also appreciate that it's from a source that produces creditable material about the world, culture, society, science, history, geography, et al. I wonder if it would really make a difference to some people to see/hear/read about this from such a different source than ""something I found on the internet.""

My title was a bit tongue-in-cheek [it's not out until Dec 30th anyway], but I truly do hope that passing this kind of informative, non-biased information onto our loved ones, friends and family, coworkers, et al, might help.

prescorted,asktransgender,"Two months into HRT, some questions about what's coming next","So, today is my two month anniversary of starting HRT! Started with a low dosage of estradoil/spiro for the first month then doubled it up to full dosage the second month. Still can't really believe I'm at this point. It's felt like a long time coming and I'm just so glad I finally gathered up the courage to start even though it took until 27 to do it.

Not too much to really report in terms of changes so far, at least that other people can notice. Libido/random erections have really dropped significantly. Started to feel soreness in my nipples about a week ago, feels like two giant bruises on my chest right now. Could swear that my skin is softer and body/facial hair is growing slower too. That just might be me imagining it at this point. Mentally I can't remember the last time I felt this great. I really attribute that more to knowing I'm on the right track in life moreso then the hormones though.

Been trying to do everything else I can to help the transition move along. Four sessions into laser at this point, results are finally starting to show which is super exciting! Been practicing voice for like 2 months and I think it's finally starting to sound good. Thinking about trying it out in person soon with some people.

I guess that's what brings me to the questions that are circling my head right now.

1) When did you start noticing more visible facial changes? I actually started taking care of my skin which has helped a lot. At this point most concerned about my jaw which is kind of angular and chin which is pretty wide and square. Kind of tall as well (5'10"") with what I guess would be average shoulders, not bulky but still very male. Don't think I can really pass at this point but I'm hoping hormones soften it up those features up at least a little bit. Staying patient but saving up for FFS if it ends up coming to that.

2) Once changes start happening, how long does it take for people to really start noticing? This one especially has been on my mind. I've read a lot of m2fs say they were on HRT for years and still presenting male without any issues. Just wondering what this means in terms of what I should expect. Given that I'm growing out my hair and going through laser, how much longer in my transition could I go without people wondering if something is going on?"

Should I go ahead and get a medium and have it tailored down to my size, or would I be fine getting a small? I plan on having it fitted anyway, but I'm concerned that a medium would come out too long and then the buttons would be placed weird (i'm fairly short)."

filipinense,asktransgender,Relationship is more important than [mild] dysphoria?,"I'm a cis female with a gender-confused male partner.

He says that while he wants to have boobs, he most likely won't get a surgery just for that. That he doesn't feel dysphoric about his dick at all; in fact, he loves it. But that he also feels envious of women sometimes. Still, he doesn't feel the need to present or be viewed as a woman.

I don't know what is going on and it's eating away at me slowly but surely. I really, really want to break up with this guy. I feel less and less attracted to him the more I think that he could be a woman inside - it's like going against my nature. But at the same time, I love him and our relationship is almost perfect otherwise.

He says that he loves me so much he could live with his dysphoria. After all, it's not that strong. Of course I don't want that. But he claims that his need to be with me is significantly more important to him that his need to realise his gender desires. I don't know if I should believe him.

SlYDeBbtyE3W1Mw1v43a,asktransgender,Got my HRT pills taken away and now I'm about to get kicked out,"My college keeps their dorms open over the break so I should be fine once I can get down there. I should have several days to leave.

I'm trying not to panic but my parents are in the middle of lecturing me about how society is manipulating me and I don't know how to make my own decisions and blah blah blah. They keep talking about how I'm wasting my money and that I'm a horrible person. My dad just said he never wants to see me again. My mom is still holding on to my three months of pills and I think she's going to flush them down the toilet. 

Anyways is it possible to go to my pharmacy and get more? Or do I have to wait until it's time to get refills?

Also, will not taking the pills (spironolactone 100mg and estradiol 4mg) for a week or two have any adverse effects?

Thanks, and Merry Christmas everyone.

Edit: Looks like my parents' final act of parenting will be dropping me off at college and never seeing me again. Too bad they took away my pills and a lot of my clothes too.

Edit 2: I found out where they were hiding my confiscated girl clothes! Now I just need to steal them back and find out where my pills are.

Edit 3: My dad change his mind about driving me back. I have friends that will help me though but breaking his promise was the last straw.

------------------

Edit 4: I made it! With the help of some friends I managed to make it back to my college dorm. Several of their families offered to let me stay with them for Christmas, but I ended up refusing all the offers. I just need some time alone right now after all that excitement. I'd also hate for my parents to get legally involved, though I am definitely no longer under their jurisdiction and they definitely have no grounds for a case.

I managed to get in contact with several people that will be able to get me reestablished at college and I know that I will have the support of my friends for the time being. I have all my finances in order, I have a safe place to stay, and I'll be heading to my pharmacy on Monday to hopefully get back on my prescriptions.

Thank you all so much for your support through this and I definitely could not have done it without you! \*Hugs* and Happy Holidays everyone!"

I changed my name on FB, told my friend about it, and made a post on FB to come out to everyone.

Because of his PM last week, I couldn't get the nerve to tell him my name.

Several of them have expressed open hostility towards transgender people. I want to leave the door open for them to be accepting (I've known some of these people for 20+ years), but also get the point across that I will cut them off and pack up my toys and go home if they insist on being dickbags, without sounding passive-aggressive.

Malimestar,asktransgender,Emotional detachment before transitioning,"Hay guys, I am writing this in hope someone would be able to explain what is going on with me.
I am 25 years old guy, at least I still am one, I behave like one and still don't know what the heck is going on with me. Since the age of 10 I knew I was gay, but I was running from it and I was trying to be as much straight as I can. I used to have girlfriends and try to do as many manly stuff as I could. I never felt I was manly man but that never bothered me. Up until 2 month ago when I came out as gay, and started living life as I wanted to. But allso my entire life I felt like I could not make deeper emotional connection to people, I have life long friends and people who love me but I don't feel I love them, in a way I do but it seems so shallow. One month ago I met a guy and fell in love and my heart was broken few days later, at that moment I still didn't think of me as transgnder  person but as of a gay man who got his heart broken. But than few days later I asked my self question was I woman all along? I never felt womanly, I was allways trying to be more manly, to behave more manly, and I did a great job, but being detached fromm deeper feelings I tought it was just me. But now I feel totaly lost, I dot have body dysphoria, I don't want to become a woman (not becouse of social stigma, but becouse I like being gay guy) but when I feel emotion I can't say for my self I am man. My psychiatrist told me I didn't have fatherly figure in my life and that's why I can only relate emotions to woman. Does this mean I am transgender, i cant sleep for nights and can't think of anything else. I have red somewhere that this can be due to the fact that my brain doesn't react to testosterone as well as it should if I felt like men, but why I have never had this problem before? It's not like I felt there was anything wrong with me but since this question popped in my head I have no peace. I say for my self I am woman and that makes no change to the way I feel and that is horrible. I mean I feel like me most of the time but can't think of anything else and whatever I do this questioning is torturing me. "
Looking-Glass-Alice,asktransgender,"To those who have transitioned, do you feel it's worth it?","This is the lowest point in my life. Beginning transition is the only thing I can think about, yet I feel like I shouldn't because I'm afraid of not passing and not being accepted. I'm afraid I might lose my job and be unable to find another one. I'm afraid of the hatred and harassment that I assume I would have to deal with. My life is hard enough without this gender shit. I feel like there's no way transition could make my life any better. Maybe my fears are justified, maybe they aren't. I figured I'd ask trans folk who have transitioned what their experiences are, positive and negative, so I might have a better understanding of the consequences."

jrw0303,asktransgender,Does this make me _not_ trans?,"This is something of a twist on the usual am-I-trans posts. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, because it seems very strange, but it's been gnawing at me for a while now, so I though I'd get it off my chest.

I've been taking estrogen and spiro at a low dose for a few months: I met with a therapist, and she thought it might help calm down some feelings of dysphoria I've been having, and the small amount of feminization I would get out of it would just be a plus. I'm not at a place in my life where I can easily (or reasonably) transition, so this seemed like a good plan.

However, as they say regarding HRT, YMMV. Despite being on a pretty low dose (100-150 mg of spiro/day, and 0.5 - 1 mg of estrogen) I've started getting noticeable breast growth pretty quickly.  I'm clearly still passable as male, especially if I'm careful about how I dress, but anyone getting a close look at my chest--and certainly anyone touching it--would notice that _something_ is up.

Even though this was something of a surprise--I thought I'd have more time at a low dose before things progressed this far--I don't mind it at all, at least most of the time.  I have some moments of self-doubt when I'm picking out my clothes in the morning and realize that some of my shirts are probably off limits, possibly forever, but when I'm alone in my head and not thinking about the social consequences of what's happening, I'm generally OK with things, even pleased.

This is where things get a little weird (and potentially embarrassing). Throughout this whole process, I've been taking pictures every couple weeks because I wanted to document the changes, if any, that occurred. What's surprising and a little disturbing is that I often become aroused by looking at these pictures, to the point where I've found myself masturbating to the before and after shots of my breasts.

How strange is this? Does my erotic fascination with my changing body point to me not being trans at all, but rather just a guy with a very strange fetish? I've long been interested in certain types of transformation-themed erotica (forced male-to-female transformations, weight gain, etc.)--is it possible my drive to start HRT is just an extreme outgrowth of that?

sreicros,asktransgender,I tried crossdressing and found it a bit confusing.,"I came across this subreddit a while back and it made me consider my own gender identity. Every so often I come across posts that seem to resonate with me deeply, usually from people who have never felt quite comfortable in their own skin. 

I'm a 22 year old guy who has been aware that transgenderism exists for a long time, but it's only this subreddit that triggered me into thinking I might be trans. I've always felt akward and different, but I'm not sure if that's been because of my gender. 

To test out my feelings I tried crossdressing. My flatmate was away so I tried some of her clothes. While trying dresses and bras I just felt like a guy dressed badly as a girl and it was really uncomfortable. But I also tried a skirt with tights and boots and it felt strange. I don't know what the feelings were, definitely arousal and excitement but also something else. Has anyone else experienced this? 

I should probably say I've loved women's boots for as long as I can remember. I used to think it was purely sexual, but now I'm considering that maybe I really wanted to wear them?"

It honestly just makes me feel like giving up...  :(

Some may bring up dosage, but since May, I've been on 4mg daily or higher and T has been properly suppressed.  I was even on injectable estrogen for 4 months until the shortage caught up to me and forced me to switch back to pills.

eeweew,asktransgender,"Trans guys that did present very feminine before finding out, why did you do that?","I (AFAB) don't consider myself trans because I don't feel like I have a gender identity at all, I am completely incapable of understanding what gender identity is. I actually learned that gender identity is a thing by learning about trans people. I have been uncomfortable presenting as female as long as I can remember, I actively avoid formal events because of this. I have no problem with my body, and absolutely no desire to be male (whatever that means). I just seem to have a desire to not be seen as female.

One strange thing that I have found is that in a lot of before pictures/video's from FTM's. Or even the first video's from some FTM YouTubers they present a lot more feminine than I would ever be comfortable doing.

I guess, that ""people are different"" is a valid answer to this. Are there some trans guys here that can give me more insight?"
emmaeliza04,asktransgender,but I was really happy as a guy for several years?,"For about two years now I've been feeling pretty upset about my body, my male presentation, people treating me as male... Took me a while to even think about myself as trans in any way but at this point in time that's the only explanation that really makes sense to me. Right now it feels like the only way to try and deal with this dysphoria, as it seems to be, is to try expressing myself as female, with clothes, presentation, pronouns, etc., and see if I find a more happiness and less disconnect in that identity.

The one thing that really bothers me though is that for three or four years in high school I lived so happily presenting as a guy? I can think of small things that may have helped, like my large female friend group, as well as some very close female friendships where tbh I wasn't really treated much like a guy. And of course I had problems in relationships as I always have -- I can't deal with taking on a very masculine role in a relationship, and since forever I can't stand anyone touching my penis (good lord let me tell you how confusing that has been until a few months ago). But when it comes down to it, I thought of myself as a guy, and most of my friends/peers/teachers/etc. treated me as a guy, and parts of that time period where the happiest of my life. I didn't feel the same super frequent heavy, tense sadness in my chest I now finish most days with, I didn't have this vague disgust with my genitals, I didn't look in the mirror and immediately wince at most of my body's characteristics.

I know I'm scared about the very idea of transitioning, between the knowledge of how impossible it'd be for me to pass, and the fear of receiving judgement from and losing closeness to family and friends. I just can't help but wonder, is there no chance of dealing with dysphoria without transitioning, and staying happy with a male identity, and feeling positive about my male body, like I did a while ago? I used to be pretty content with my body, especially around the time I started realizing some people found me quite attractive. Comparing that to now it's night and day, and I guess I want to know if my feelings about this are likely to stick this way. Is this gradual encroachment of dysphoria from nothing at all, to a daily pressure a common thing? And is there no chance it can go the other way and recede to as it used to be, without changing my presentation and/or transitioning?

Since transguys are guys though, I have all the benefits of that particular anatomy and Im still being intimate with a man. 

Unfortunately, that anatomy is completely foreign to me. I don't really know the first thing about how to please him besides going down on him.

discipleofgirling,asktransgender,Does anyone have the issue of feeling the need to completely reinvent themselves in order to transition?,"So where I stand now, pre hormones and all and presenting male, I really don't feel like a girl. Frankly a female version of myself doesn't even seem doable at times.

I unconsciously have a very ridged idea of what a girl and what femininity should be, so much so that I feel obligated to become a completely different person. I've been struggling with this a long time.

I recently had a breakthrough. Anyone familiar with tg transformation fiction will know there are several subtypes. One sticks out in particular: identity death. The character essentially gets taken over by a completely different personality and they forget they were ever the gender that transformed from. I was never personally fond of those types of stories, but I realize now that it is not far off from what I feel I need to do in order to transition.

Is it disrespectful to keep the old pictures up? Do I delete them? A lot of their early history is my history, too. What about photos up in my house, which clearly show them as girls? I can't figure out if it is better to just leave it all the way it is, or go back and delete everything. I can make a great case, either way. 'Why delete it? Nothing to be ashamed of! Honor it all!' Versus, 'They deserve to make the transition with privacy, and they didn't ask to be put on social media'. 

Also, any other advice you want to offer, gratefully accepted. I am doing my best to try to spot potential minefields before we hit them. Thank you!

Being dominant and selfish totally gets me off, and I'm not at all interested in ""bottoming,"" but oral sex has always felt extra intimate and emotionally intense to me (both getting and giving) and I feel like there would be something missing if I didn't sometimes have both.

For trans women who are generally submissive bottoms, is it a turn-off if a guy expresses interest in doing this to you? Do any of you actually _enjoy_ getting sucked?

If you do… are there any ways in which it feels different, or should be approached differently, compared to giving a blowjob to a cis man?"

My question is this, would any of you be willing to be a guest on my show. I am not religious and it will be an honest inquiry into your life as a transgender person. I am looking for LGBTQ+ adults with interesting stories that they want to share. You wouldn't have to use your real name or anything like that. I just ask that you share only true experiences. 

If you would like to be a guest on my show or have more questions, message me on reddit. You can also go to my Facebook page @ (Please don't mind the artwork and logo. I am just starting out and still working out the details. That was just a first shot at a logo for the show.)

I know you may be wondering if its the ""Straight up gay"" podcast why do you want transgender guests. Well, the original format of the show was for me and my friend to host the show together. I am a straight cisgender male and parent of a gay teen and he is a gay male. The title of the show was a play on the words.  However he was unable to do the show with me due to other commitments and I already purchased the domain name. So, I changed the format to be me hosting conversations with LGBTQ people and sharing their personal stories.

snaillo,asktransgender,What Should I Do While Waiting?,"Sorry for the long windedness of this post, but I wanted to write it all down. Mostly because I'm not sure where to begin or how to even say what I'm trying to, but also because I'm hoping to find people that will relate.  I will try to provide a TLDR at the bottom.

It has taken me 27 years to figure out who I really am.  Well... not really, I suppose I knew since I was about 7 and I got caught trying on my sister's clothes and makeup.  Back then, my parents used the words ""just a phrase"" and growing up I was supposed to ""grow out of it.""  So I spent the last 20 years trying to do just that: repressing any feminine thoughts and growing to be a man.

In High School I played every sport I could, trying to be a jock.  I was wearing a varsity jacket by my junior year, but I remember the longing envy of seeing girls in their homecoming dresses.  I graduated and was still confused.

So, I did what boys trying to be men have done for millenia... I joined the Army.  I deployed to Afghanistan in 2012, where I was wounded and awarded the Purple Heart.  Looking back it's probably the most ""manly"" (not saying Women can't do the same) thing I could've done... 

I met a girl right before leaving for Afghanistan.  And I fell in love.  Back then I used to think that sexuality and gender identity were the same (or didn't know enough about either to differentiate).  So I married her and she's been my rock ever since.

So here I am... I'm 27, I'm a Staff Sergeant in the Army, I'm married... and I'm still not happy.  I'm not dysphoric, at least I don't think so.  I don't hate my male parts... I just wish they were female parts.  I don't hate that people see me as male... I just wish I was female.

I'm sad it's taken me this long to figure out that it never was a phase.  But what makes it worse is now that I've realized it I have to wait further.

I want to transition now, but know that it's not possible.  One: I just accepted a new assignment as an Army Recruiter, and while Army Policy is advancing I would be forcibly reassigned.
Two:  My wife is very conservative.  While you never know what love can endure, she's my only support system for a lot of things, and couldn't imagine losing her.
Three: Financially I'm not ready.  My income is based around the Army, and I don't have a degree or anything else to support myself if I have to leave.  

So now for my question: what should I do while waiting?  I mean that both how can I prepare, and what can I do to feel better?  Is there anyway to prepare my wife/family?  Are there any active military members here who can set my mind at ease about my future in the military?

Sorry for the wall of text... **TLDR** :  Guy in the army waiting to become girl and doesn't know what to do while he waits.  Also, I know I'm sometimes intimidated to reply in a post so feel free to PM if you're more comfortable that way."

MsVenture,asktransgender,"On the topic of ""what are things to ask surgeons in a consultation for FFS?""","Hello there!


So I just want to preface this by saying that I've done the search through /r/asktransgender for previous questions like this one, and there were quite a few and I've also read the one post on the front page right now on expectations for FFS. 


I feel that I am aware enough of my own expectations going in, I know that ideally I want my nose/chin/jaw/trachea done and I don't expect leaving the surgery looking like a completely different person, just me  but with a more feminine face. I want to have this surgery done so I can stand looking at myself in the mirror and in photos and not be so dysphoric about my face anymore. My first post on reddit was on /r/transtimelines and that picture is still up if you really have to see what I look like.


All that being said, I have a consultation scheduled with FacialTeam in March, ideally I would like to schedule a few more and/or send some emails to a few other surgeons to look at all my options even though I'm not quite sure how to communicate my wants to them just through email or phone. 


My questions are, what are some questions that I should ask them during my consultation? 

Does anyone have any previous experience with surgeons in Los Angeles and San Francisco (since I live here and flying to Spain or Buenos Aires is a much bigger investment even though I've seen people fawning over FacialTeam, T-Change, and Di Maggio , though probably worth it because I hardly hear anything about Dr. Alter or Dr. Mayer and some stuff about Ousterhout though now that he's retired I guess it's Deschamps-Braly)?"
confusedaskfuck3434,asktransgender,I don't consider myself transgender but feel much more closely aligned to masculinity. Help.,"I don't know what to say really. My mind is swirling.

I enjoy some things feminine. Like beauty regimes. And I like dressing up and looking in the mirror and thinking that objectively someone would look at me and I think I'm pretty. I enjoy face masks and nail polish and makeup and all that shit.

But I hate having beauty defining me because it will be gone sooner rather than later and I hate how people treat me in day to day life. At work, at school, my friends, my family. So many of the shitty things that happen to me I have no doubt would not happen to a man because people wouldn't be so bold. People see me as a pretty woman and think I'm objectifiable and/or something they can walk all over. 

I've found myself wanting to dress like a man and even pass off as a man, which I can't, yet. But today I wore a big oversized man's coat and felt good in it. And I even though about getting a man's hair cut but I am afraid that once I do that I can't go back. And I do like men's fashion, like the hunting boots and camo tops and oversized shirts and shit.

Sexually speaking I consider myself straight but I don't have a huge sex drive and like traditional courtship which men today aren't into so I don't date much. 

I don't know what to do. In the end I really want to be a man and to have other people see me as a man, yeah. But I look in the mirror and see myself as a woman and wish I could be comfortable and have a future in her body. It makes no sense. "

pinkchips,asktransgender,Whenever someone tells me that I'm not a female because I never grew up in a cis girl's world...,"There is no fortune on this earth that I wouldn't give to be able to go back and live as a teenager and twenty-something as a female.  (I'm literally crying right now thinking of it).  
  
I didn't understand what was wrong with me.  I definitely wasn't like any guy at our school, but I 'obviously' wasn't a girl (my mistaken belief due to my transphobic Bible Belt upbringing).  I spent my teenage years and many of my twenty-something years alone and wondering what was wrong with me, why I felt feminine, and hated having to pretend to be 'manly' just to have any social experience at all.  
  
I knew it wasn't gay.  I knew I wasn't a straight male.  I didn't know or understand what I was, and I just sunk into a depression that turned around and ate its own tail a hundred times throughout those years.  Nearly every really great friendship I made in my life was with a girl, but my birth sex kept getting in the way.  
  
Every enjoyable and honest girlfriend I would have made from those years, gone.  Every boyfriend I would have had and honest relationship where I wasn't scared of a partner learning about my 'terrible secret'.... gone.  Those never existed because of the transphobic world I grew up in.  
  
I was a six year old child wishing desperately to just be able to go to school and be a girl, and begged my mom to please not let me grow up, please *anything but that* because I knew what it meant.  It would mean I would be a 'man' forever and lose any androgyny I had.  The girls who were my friends at school would really keep away from me then.  
  
I hated myself and hated my life.  Nothing really mattered or was important.  The grey days slipped away until now, in my 30's, I can finally confront these feelings.  
  
And unlike a cis girl, I will only get to live half a life as my true self.  And I'll have to deal with that.  
  
I didn't have the same experiences that a cis girl would have.... but I would give anything to have had them, and I'll never get that chance.  ������  
  
So it is an extremely hurtful thing to hear when someone says that.  I would trade all the years of supposed 'male privilege' for the life experiences of any girl, even one that wasn't glamorous or very pleasant.  At least that would have been a real life.  "
eye_r_bored,asktransgender,Questioning. How did you figure out your gender?,"Hi. I'm 24 AMAB and questioning my gender. A couple weeks ago I started seeing a therapist and she has encouraged me to reach out to people and maybe make some new friends. So, I'm getting out of my lurker comfort zone and putting this out there. I'm sorry for the length of the post, but I wanted to tell my story. The tl:dr of it is I've had intense desires to be female separated by periods of feeling like a normal male. For those of you in a similar situation, how did you learn that you were female or male or gender fluid or non-binary or insert chosen term here?

My background: 
I started cross dressing about 10 or so years ago (around age 13-14). It started out as a sexual thing in that it was arousing wearing feminine things. Over time that feeling has gotten less, though it's still there a bit. Over the years I've gone through phases where I've enjoyed dressing up more, and times where I didn't feel like dressing up at all. As I get older those times where I don't want to where women's clothes get fewer and fewer and now it's very rare for me to go a day without wearing at least one article of women's clothing. This expression of feminity has also spread beyond clothes: my toenails are almost always painted and I enjoy wearing makeup.

The issue of gender identity probably began around age 16. Again, it started with sexual fantasies before progressing to the real world, where I first seriously wanted to be a woman at age 19. After a couple months the desire went away and, ultimately, I dismissed the feeling as just a fantasy. A year later I got the feeling again. The feeling lasted longer this time, probably 8 or 9 months. It went away again and a few months later I started dating my girlfriend. I believe that being in a relationship postponed the return of or at least lessened the intensity of my feminine desires. In the roughly 2.75 years we've been together I've had just a few times were I desired to be more feminine, but never outright wanting to be a girl again until a few months ago. Around August the desire to be a woman came up again and this desire has come and gone many times since then (sometimes flip flopping multiple times in a day), which is unlike before where it would last for months. When it returns it feels more and more intense, which is ultimately what led me to seek out a therapist. 

In between these periods I feel like a completely normal guy, or at least a normal guy who happens to like wearing women's clothes. I've always liked stereotypically male things such as sports, math, science, videogames, etc. Also, I don't ever feel like I am a girl, I feel like I want to be a girl, which seems different from most of the posts I've read on here. All of this makes me feel like maybe I'm not a girl, maybe I'm gender fluid or somewhere in between. I'm struggling with how to figure out what is right for me. For what it's worth the only people I've shared these feelings with before now is my girlfriend and my therapist.

Has anyone had similar experiences? If so, how did you figure out what your gender identity is and how to express yourself in a way that makes you comfortable being you?

I'm very interested in hearing what all you lovely people have to say, though I'm about to go to sleep and I have work in the morning, so it'll be a while before I can respond. Also, if anyone prefers pm's that's good with me also.

Thanks for reading,

CurvyBritishGirl,asktransgender,Just came out. Girlfriend issues.,"Okay, so I came out to my girlfriend about a week and a half ago. She's taken it as quite a shock. As to be expected, really.

In the meantime, I've told lots of other people, my Mom, some best friends, and everyone has been really supportive.

The issue is sexual attractiveness with the girlfriend. She's straight. Really straight.

There's been a lot of back and forth in our discussions, from 'I love you and will support you' to 'I wouldn't find you attractive as a woman' and even 'Maybe if you were like, a butch lesbian kind of look, it would help'.

I'm not a girly girl, or anything. There will be no pink Hello Kitty t-shirts for me. But I would be a regular girl. I feel it's too much for her.

We've been together 5 years, would be married if we believed in it. Now it's leaving me conflicted as to whether I should transition at all.

Any advice is helpful."

Also this whole thing that I initially posted as a comment:

At present I'm only considering HRT. This is all very new to me and I think I might be bigender or something (still working all of this out and learning terms). Androgyny is kind of the goal for me I think, being able to present as what I feel at the time.
So I think I'd actually prefer to present as male some of the time, while undergoing HRT to become more feminine."
watermelon-n00b,asktransgender,Friend possibly indicating that they're trans - can't tell. Would appreciate thoughts/advice.,"I'm cis and female and if I'm failing to be a good ally at any point then I want to know.

I'm in North America and have an old friend in France who's like an electronic pen pal. This person doesn't use Facebook or Twitter or Skype but we do email each other regularly. We haven't seen each other in person since 2013 because we only cross the Atlantic so frequently and we don't tend to exchange any photos but we have a wonderful ongoing sequence of emails. They have become a valuable friend.

They and I used to just write emails in giant blocks of text without any greetings or closings, but recently they've begun signing their letters with a little sign off and a name. It's not actually the name I met them under many years ago, but a different one that is similar in spelling and (presumably) pronunciation. I haven't met any other people (French speaking or not) with this name and I tried Googling it and that didn't bring anything up but I think it might have opposite gender connotations. Or maybe it's neutral? Or could it be an old nickname that my friend doesn't realize they never told me about? (There are no hints from anything else. Their email address is surname dot first initial at company dot fr and their ""from"" name is their three initials and their [long, hyphenated] surname.)

The first three times this happened, I assumed it was just the ""old family nickname"" thing. But I'm starting to think that my friend might be trying to tell me that they're transgender (and/or genderqueer or genderfluid?), but a) I'm not sure, and b) if so, that's totally okay with me but should I just bluntly ask them about it? I don't want to mess this up, but I also want to make it really clear that I get the message, if it's a message. But then again I also don't want to make a huger deal out of it than necessary. I know transitioning is a major step but I also don't want to overreact or shove a positive reaction down their throat. We've only talked about trans people once and it was a really long time ago and I could have sworn I was the person who brought it up then. I think I'm overthinking. I'd love some feedback. Thank you!"
lgbtquestionthroaway,asktransgender,Confused about gender,"I really don't know where to start. Until the beginning of last summer, I was incredibly homophobic. I was raised to think that gays were horrible monsters, that sort of thing. Anyway, toward the beginning of the summer, I was sort of becoming less and less religious, which caused me to become less homophobic. A couple months ago I realized, I was bi, but when I think about gender, I just get confused.

Whenever I think about it, I just sort of get this jumbled up mess of confusion and thoughts I don't even understand, so I was wondering if anyone could help shed some light on what exactly I am. Firstly, when I was a kid, one of my distant relatives would let me put on their makeup. I don't really remember it well, because I was, like, 5 or 6, but I remember it made me happy. I don't know why it made me happy, and I can't remember if I liked it because it was comforting or if I just did it because I thought it would be cool to hang out with my cousin.

After reading advice from people on the internet who are trans, a lot of people have said that wearing clothes of the opposite gender helped them to figure out who they are, but that didn't really help me. Male, female, they were both just... clothes. I didn't feel any different in either.

I don't know what ""dysphoria"" is. When I look in the mirror, I'm often horribly uncomfortable with my body, but I don't know if that's dysphoria, my shitty self-esteem, or a combination of both. How do I even tell the difference? Something else I don't really understand is, how can I tell the difference between being trans and just being a sort of feminine guy. For example, I don't really try to act ""tough and manly"", and I'm fine with showing feelings. For hair, I really like androgynous hair, though I could never get my hair cut androgynous, since my parents are extremely conservative. How do I tell the difference between being trans but in denial, or just being a feminine guy?

Regarding the concept itself, if I just sit down and think about if I'm comfortable with my gender: Sometimes I'm pretty alright with it. Sometimes I don't really like it. Sometimes it's whatever.

P.S. Sorry if this was hard to read. I'm kind of tired atm, so I may not have been entirely coherent."
Einar_Eli,asktransgender,Trying to figure out if I am really transgender and if I should transition,"Hey everyone, 

Thanks in advance for reading this, because it's probably going to be quite long... I have been actively trying to discover my gender identity for about a year now (and by actively, I mean intensely as in thinking about it almost constantly and doing a whole lot of research), and there are some things I just can't figure out myself. I know a gender therapist would be a great option, but it is unfortunately not one I have since I still live with my parents (I'm 18).

The reasons why I think I am (ftm) transgender are the following:

1) I don't like my female body at all. My breasts and hips/thighs in particular bother me a lot. I have always been really self-conscious about my height as well, even though it's a perfectly good height for a girl (not that I'm saying there's any ""bad"" height, but it's just a teensy bit below average for a girl). This discomfort with my body started in puberty, but at the time I thought it was normal. I'd heard it was a difficult time for everyone and that it could take some time to get used to your body, plus I thought being ""female"" automatically meant you disliked your body because it is near impossible to live up to the media's ridiculous standards.  

When I was 14, I got anorexia. I believe it is deeply tied in with the discontent I felt going through my female puberty, although there were many external factors that contributed to it as well. I struggled with this eating disorder for a long time, and even though I am fully recovered now, I still get what I thought at the time was ""body dysmorphia"" - only now I tend to think of it in terms of ""dysphoria"". The reason I think it is dysphoria rather than dysmorphia is because it is focused on the ""female"" attributes of my body. I do have a bit of pudge on my stomach, but that doesn't really bother me. I don't like it, but looking at it doesn't give me anything close to the awful feeling I get when I look at my butt/hip/thigh area.
Also, while I was still in the grips of my eating disorder, there was not a single moment where I could make peace with my lower body even though I had lost so much weight that my ribs etc were visible. Looking in the mirror and seeing my thighs and hourglass shape - even if it was skin and bones - was a nightmare. I know, however, that this is not uncommon for ED patients, so that might not be related to gender.

2) I have always been a ""tomboy."" I hated anything pink or glittery or ""girly"", and I insisted on engaging in typically ""boyish"" activities like skating and playing with cars/action man. I hated wearing dresses or skirts - I would literally throw a fit whenever I was forced to wear one. I had a phase a couple of years ago where I tried really hard to fit in with the girls: I wore makeup and jewellery and sometimes even dresses, but I never felt comfortable doing that. Up until this day I hate ""female""-typical clothing, and I have been looking at the men's department in clothing stores for as long as I can remember, wishing I could just wear those clothes.

3) Female pronouns and gendered language makes me feel really icky. Whenever someone refers to me as ""she/her"", ""madam"", ""miss"", ""girl"" or any variety thereof, it feels so very wrong. There have been two instances where people have referred to me with male pronouns, and it felt amazingly right.

4) I've always loved it whenever I was better at something ""manly"" than boys I knew. It made me feel really proud of myself, whereas compliments regarding my femininity (e.g. You're a beautiful young woman) just made me feel plain bad. I loved that while performing in martial arts, I was one of the boys, or at least regarded as their equal. I used to be really proud of my body then too, because it was right before puberty and I had developed some muscle - which I now realise made me look like a young boy rather than a girl.

5) When I was younger, I always picked the male characters in video games and role play games. My favourite characters in tv shows, books and movies would also invariably be male ones, and I always identified more with them than with girls. I've always felt like a gentleman, too. All of my role models were and are men, and I always strive to be accepted, respected and appreciated by men - I used to think this was a really strange dynamic going on, and while that may be the case at least now the kind of validation I look for can be described as wanting to have something akin to a father-son relationship.

6) Jealousy. I've always been really envious of men for their bodies. I used to think it was normal to want to be a guy, because why wouldn't you want to be? It was kind of a shocker when I realised most girls were happy to be a girl. Personally, I couldn't for the life of me figure out why anyone would want breasts or wide hips or a vagina. I thought everyone wanted a deep voice and narrow hips and muscles, that everyone wanted to be tall and broad-shouldered and angular. I am not averse to the idea of facial hair either. In fact, I like all the effects of testosterone, except the possibility of male pattern balding and turning into a hairy monster.

6) I want to have a relationship with another man as a man. I am unsure as to whether I could date a woman, but I know 100% sure I couldn't do it as a woman. This is only one of many aspects of life I can only see myself doing as a man (I can't, for example, imagine myself as a middle-aged woman).

Now after researching this very thoroughly, I am still left with some doubts. I am fairly sure I am not cis, but I don't know if transition would be the right path for me. Besides the social backlash I would get, ""the external factors"", there are some ""internal reasons"" why I'm wary of starting transition. This are some of the reasons:

1) I feel like I look fairly decent as a girl - especially because of my figure - but as a guy I look really awful. So I like the way the ""female me"" looks better than ""male me"". This makes me wonder wether I would eventually be able to come to terms with my body and maybe even start to love it.

Sometimes, I like my body and I think it's just fine. In those moments, I think I could deal with staying like this for the rest of my life.

2) I don't know if part of this couldn't be an extreme form of feminism, of wanting to be valued as a woman but still be completely equal to men. Maybe I just have a really bad relationship with gender roles?

3) Maybe I just hate my body because I feel like I'm not skinny enough, not pretty enough etc, and not because I don't have a male body. Because I honestly can't really imagine what it would be like to actually have one. Maybe I wouldn't like it at all?
Sometimes I feel like what I really want is a very androgynous-looking body, which is not something I will achieve through HRT. Maybe I would be happy living as a gender-nonconforming woman? Maybe being a tomboy now and a gender-nonconforming grandma later is really what I'm looking for?

4) I don't know if I would fit in with other men, partly because of my socialisation as a female and partly because I feel like I'm generally more ""soft"" and compassionate than the average guy (I know, stereotypes, but still). I think in regards to mannerisms, interests, etc. I am somewhere in between ""masculine"" and ""feminine"".

5) Have I been reading too much about this? Watched too many YouTube clips about it? I sometimes get the feeling that I'm making myself believe I am trans but I'm actually a cis girl, part of the reason being that I ""want"" to be a man rather than feeling like I ""am"" one, which is what most trans people tend to say. I fear that I just ""want to be part of the LGTB+ community"" while I am actually just a cis straight girl.

I want to be 100% sure of this before I tell my parents / take a step towards HRT, because it's very likely that I will face a lot of rejection and I really don't want to end up halfway into transition only to realise that it's not what I want/need.

I'd really appreciate it if anyone could shed any light on this, because I'm lost.

Thank you!"
kaylarue,asktransgender,Grandma is throwing a temper tantrum. Any suggestions on how to handle this going forward?,"My grandmother is *quite* unhappy about my transition. Sent me a letter saying how heartbroken she is. Asked me to delete my Facebook so none of her family would see (so I made a new one with the correct name, ha!). Reached out to see what the Christmas plans were and she cancelled our yearly get together. My aunt later messaged me and (among other things) made it clear who's fault it was. 

I can ignore this for awhile but I know it's not going to go away easily. For those of you who've dealt with this, how'd you handle it? I (used to be) incredibly close with this grandmother and my late grandfather. Although this is what I expected it's definitely hurt a lot. "
Olivia_Jack,asktransgender,Attraction to women as a transgender female?,"Hello, I will keep this (more than likely very crude) post short as it is nearly 3 A.M. for me right now but this is driving me insane. I am a 19 year old pre-everything transgender female and I'm struggling to understand myself. I recently accepted, after a long denial period of many years, that I am a transgender female so I am catching up on understanding myself. One thing I am stuck on and cannot get past is my sexuality. I am attracted to both men and women. I do not understand why I like females as well. I know it might seem like a simple or pointless questiom but I can not get this out of my head. Does being attracted to women somehow make me ""less transgender""? Does it mean that I'm just confused? Is it as simple as just accepting myself as bisexual? Or could I just be so used to being ""closeted"" for so long that I just think that I am attracted to women? I apologize for such a crude question/post but I am just trying my hardest to understand mgself."
thr0wnaway101,asktransgender,"Another ""Am I Or Aren't I"" Question","Hi--I'm sorry to stick yet another ""hey, what's my deal"" post on this sub, but I think I need to verbalize this.

My situation's not that unique but I haven't really shared it externally, or at least I feel very alone and unsure of what I should do or whether or not I can trust my thoughts. I'm in my mid 20s, born male. Suffered from anxiety, stress, and depression for almost as long as I can remember (sometimes medicated, sometimes not). I've dealt with disliking my masculine body or wishing for a feminine one for years, always as a fantasy or an idea that came kind of unbidden. Of course, I didn't really know what to make of it or have any context for it for the longest time. I never really externalized that beyond growing my hair out, and fixating on the kinds of clothes I wore or on my weight--but I never overtly did anything to present as female, even though I was always fascinated with it, always wanted to be able to.

I'll try to get to the point--I just had a friend suddenly contact me because he was unexpectedly in town and wanted to hang out briefly. We did, it was nice--we unloaded our problems on each other and talked about life, like we always have. As we were talking about stuff (surely very intellectual and interesting and unique, blah blah blah), I was very strongly hoping that the conversation would somehow steer towards a point that would force me to admit to being trans. Or just to bring it up and see if he'd accept it. Or even broach the idea. It never did happen, and I feel both relief that I escaped having to deal with it or the potential embarrassment, and regret that I didn't admit it, get the chance to externalize it. 

I've been through one of my lowest points with depression recently, and although my life's pretty good by all objective measures (money, apartment, etc), I am totally consumed lately by these internal questions about whether or not I'm transgender and what that means. Or maybe I'm just bisexual and kind of effeminate, but that doesn't feel any better. I've actually even come out before: I once had a girlfriend that I admitted my feelings to, though I framed it as a fetish. That relationship didn't go anywhere, but I told my mom as well; she was supportive, but suggested that it was just my anxiety fixating on something. I resented that, but she might have been right. That was at least six years ago, probably more like 8. I saw a counselor at college regarding my gender identity, even admitted it to a few more friends. A friend helped me buy women's underwear; I worked a god damn construction job for a summer wearing panties underneath my filthy jeans, and I remember it making me feel good. Then I got laid and it kind of fell by the wayside, or maybe something else happened. I don't clearly remember, but I kind of backed off the whole idea of being a transwoman. Of course, the fixation on having a different physical form never really went away.

Now, years later, I've been having a hard time with anxiety and depression, and dysphoric feelings have come back very hard. I stress about my hair and my weight, about the shape of my body. I try to get away with more effeminate mannerisms but worry about how they'll be seen by friends and family. I fantasize about sex as a female or with men, but can't be certain if it's something true to me or just something that my brain is doing in response to loneliness and porn--and all of this leaves me feeling unable to trust my own thoughts.

I've been voraciously reading this sub for days, I know this isn't that unique--but nonetheless, I felt the need to at least externalize it a bit. Does anybody have any advice or anecdotes about relating dysphoria to anxiety, OCD, depression, etc? How did you deal with these issues? Thanks a lot if you've read this far, I appreciate the opportunity to put this out there to a compassionate audience."
Jazz8680,asktransgender,"How do you feel about the name ""Ezri""?","Hey guys, I've only just realized that I'm probably a trans girl (AMAB) and that it might be beneficial to try a different name and pronouns to refer to myself. Just to test it out. 

The name ""Ezri"" is actually from Star Trek DS9 (pretty nerdy I know lol). She's a character who is symbiotic with a worm in her stomach (gross lol), essentially. This worm holds all the memories of the previous hosts that it has inhabited, be they men or women or nb, to synthesize a new individual. I've always liked the name and always related to the character for some unknown reason (at the time). I think I liked her because she had the experience and memories that I wished I could have. Plus she was pretty cute (alright I had a big crush on her but whatever). 

I know that a name is a very personal thing and that in the end it doesn't matter what anyone but myself thinks about it. But I just wanted to see if anyone else thinks it's a pretty name like I do :) "
VVM258,asktransgender,"My therapist keeps asking me, ""But is that identity, or something else?""","I've been speaking with my therapist for the past several months about me (AMAB) questioning my gender identity. I was seeing him for social anxiety earlier, but at a point this year, for lack of a better term, I simply broke and admitted my gender issues to him. Although he isn't a gender psych, per-se, ""LGBT issues"" is one of his advertised areas of expertise, so he is, as to be expected, actually generally knowledgable about gender identity issues. However, he's perhaps not as comprehensively knowledgable as a specialist would be. He makes a good effort though.

After sharing stories and feelings about my problems, like being much more comfortable socializing with women, daydreaming about being a girl, or (ahem) crossdreaming habits, he will quiz me on whether I'm mistaking identity for something else. This is actually an obstacle and sore point for me, because for all my problems and grief about gender I've had since at least my pre-teens, I simply don't ""identify"" as a woman or feel with certainty I am one--that's why I'm questioning. I basically end up feeling like I'm on trial providing examples of gender issues I have, only to have them seemingly dismissed as something else because I can't say with a straight face that ""I'm a woman."" 

The question essentially feels like a dead end and is not helping my situation. Has anyone ever run into anything similar with their therapists when exploring their identities? I realize some on this sub are probably going to yell ""gatekeeping!"" in the comments but frankly I want to be gatekept because hormones aren't my goal, at least at this time. I simply want more comfort and understanding about my identity, and I don't feel like I'm achieving that at the moment.

And on that note, does anyone have experience working with multiple therapists? If I decide I want to talk to a true specialist about my issues, I don't feel like I necessarily want to stop seeing my current therapist either for my main issues, for which a gender specialist would likely be deficient."

The Document:

Foreword

I am writing this to you as I find having direct conversation with you about this makes very awkward and uncomfortable. I hope that this answers most of the questions you may have about this.

How Long Have I known I was transgender/How long have I felt like this?

-	6 Months

Are you sure This Isn’t just a phase or that these thoughts will probably go away?

-	The short Answer is no; these thoughts don’t tend to ever fade or go away no matter how much time passes or by trying to focus on other things. Even if they do go away briefly they always inevitably come back

Who else have you told so far?

-	Nan*  and younger brother*
-	I haven’t told grandad yet, so I am not sure if he knows or not
-	Additionally, I have also been speaking to people in college about this which has helped me greatly.

Does this mean you are gay?

-	No, who I am attracted to would come under sexual or romantic orientation which is a completely different thing from gender dysphoria. I have no interest in pursuing any form of romantic or sexual relationship with anyone at the moment or for the current foreseeable future.

Why do I feel like I want to be a girl?

-	Because I feel like I would be happier as a girl instead of a boy. I would like my appearance to be more female, such as getting rid of facial hair and body hair (on a more permanent basis), having breasts, having a body shape that is more ambiguous or female. It would make much happier if I could present as a balance of feminine and masculine which is what this would allow me to do.  I also find it difficult to fit into a male gender role and have felt like part of myself was missing or not quite right for a while.

Why didn’t I tell you Earlier?

-	I was afraid of how you might react and didn’t want to cause any problems. 

Am I doing this because of sexual reasons?

-	No this has nothing to do with sex at all. I am doing this because I would like to be perceived as a girl.

Will this change who I am?

No, I will still have the same interests, personality, relationships with people, the same ambitions (video game development/computing), etc. The only thing that will change is my gender.


How Would I go about transitioning?

-	Firstly, I would go to my GP and talk to them about gender dysphoria and getting a referral to GIC (Gender Identity Clinic).  Or by asking them to prescribe me HRT directly If that is possible or if they are allowed to do that.
-	At a GIC I would have several appointments over time which wold lead to an end goal of obtaining HRT which would allow me to start transitioning to female
-	As waiting times for GIC’s are quite lengthy at the moment (some have an appointment waiting time of over a year), I would like to go down the private route of obtaining HRT as a bridging gap until I can be seen by a GIC. This means I could possibly talk to my GP about setting up shared care between them and the private route to get HRT until I can go to a GIC.
-	Secondly, I would start adding more female gendered clothing to what I wear (Dresses, blouses, female t-shirts, jeans, etc.) Though this would likely only be at home for a while or possibly at college. This mainly because I would still probably present outwardly in public as male until I have a better chance as passing as female.
-	Thirdly, I would probably do voice therapy/exercises in order to get a voice that sounds female or is higher than the one I have at the moment.
-	Fourth, I would like to get laser hair remover or electrolysis to get rid of facial hair/body hair, I would like to do this fairly early so I can get rid of facial hair before it becomes starts growing rapidly.
-	Fifth, Get a female or Androgynous haircut (probably still a short one)
-	Sixth, be called by a new name and female pronouns (she/her). I already have a couple of ideas for a name.
-	Much further down the line I may look into getting surgery if I feel like I would need it and if I could afford it. This would be stuff such as SRS (Sexual Reassignment Surgery), Orchiectomy (Removal of testicles which would reduce or get rid of testosterone production) and FFS (Facial Feminisation Surgery). I am not saying I would do all these things or even some of them, I am just considering future options that is all.
-	I would like to eventually get my name legally changed by deed poll 

What is HRT?

HRT stands for Hormone Replacement Therapy. It is used to help a physical transformation of the body. In my case it would be estrogen as I want to transition to female. This would cause changes which I would really like such as these:
-	Reduced Body Hair Growth
-	Breast Growth
-	Body fat redistribution/ body shape changes
-	Reduced facial hair growth
-	Softer skin and possible reduction in acne 
-	Facial feminisation

A Side effect of using HRT is that I will eventually possibly become infertile, which in short means I will no longer be able to have children if I wanted to in the future. At the moment I feel it is unlikely that I would want to have children in the future anyway, so it isn’t that big of an issue to me. There is always the option of sperm freezing available if I did want to but again I am not certain I would to and I don’t know whether the NHS fund sperm freezing or not.

How Would I Pay for this transition?

I would rather pay for it with some of my savings (ISA saver) only, as I don’t want to have put a financial burden on anyone in my family or ask them for help with it, as this seems unfair and mean of me. You and Dad/Mom (Depending on which one of you is reading this first) seem stretched with finances recently so I didn’t want to add to that.

Why is it important that I transition?

I have felt varying amounts of depression over the last few months which I am pretty certain is because of gender dysphoria or at least linked to it. I have had occasional thoughts about suicide, though I am Pretty sure I would still never go through with it.
I can’t see a future where staying male would be very enjoyable or happy for me, I would much rather prefer being female as it feels more right to me.

pandachoco,asktransgender,Trying to get an updated Irish passport,"I'm trying to get my passport updated. Details from this post https://redd.it/5cw624 would suggest that contacting the Department of Social Protection in Carrick-On-Shannon would help towards getting an Irish GRC.

*****

I phoned the DSP at Carrick-On-Shannon and I was informed that as an Irish Citizen not born in ROI and living in the UK I was not able to apply for an Irish GRC. However if I were to move back to ROI, then I could apply for an Irish GRC and get my passport updated that way. My other alternative was to contact the Passport Office at the Department for Foreign Affairs and confirm with them whatever *medical evidence* was required to be supplied in order for the update to happen.

I'm currently waiting on a reply from them, but in the meantime has anyone been through this process already? If so, did the Passport Office ask for a surgery letter? Did you have to prove 'in use' of new name for two years?"
secludedprism45,asktransgender,subtle way of coming out?,"Hi, i'm not 100% sure that i'm trans but i know i would want to be a girl and live as a girl, i am a teenager (15) and kinda want to come out to my mother but i want to do it subtle she knows i cross dress and is ok with that, i currently have a skirt and many pairs of tights, i was thinking of just amassing female clothing until she asks me about it then coming out, has anyone done something similar?"
Marla__,asktransgender,I have never felt so scared in my life...,"Its only been a month since i have accepted the fact that im Transgender. Before then i would always tell myself, i cant im too big it would never work (Im 6'7""). Or i can't, im the only person who can carry on the family name. Or,  I can live as a guy, its just more of a preference thing to wanna be a girl instead.  Ive used every excuse in the book. Finally i said fuck it. Im trans...

Ever since admitting it to myself, i have been wanting to explode with it. Start HRT, star living the life. But there is one MAJOR problem with that. I cant, i just cant. I would have to come out to do that and im absolutely fucking terrified. I canr afford to lose more family, my mom is all i got now and i cant lose that too. People make fun of daddy issues well i got em, when he has tried to kill you, you got em. I cut off all ties to that side of the family, and because of it all i have is my moms. Hyper religious, church three times a week, mexican from mexico, somehow still conservative, and living in southern US. 

I want it, i want it so bad. I wish i would magically wake up as Marla and not have to go through all the angst, but that isnt going to happen. But i dont know if i ever will, i just cant do it. Im too scared. Im the person that bottles things up forever. I nearly had a heart attack at 16 from stress, so i know its not a good thing to do but i canr help it. Its who i am and so is being trans, but some people just dont understand that. 

I would LOVE to be a cis male. To not have these feelings, to not have to think about these things. But that isnt an option for me. Because im not, and i cant help it its not something i chose its not who i chose to be. Its just who i am, its what would make me happy. Let me be finally happy... Truly happy instead of those little bursts of it like when you find money on the ground. 

Im stuck between a rock and i hard place, and i dont know how to escape and i am absolutely terrified...

PS: They dont even know im not straight either, they continue on with their lives asking when im going to bring a girl home. I never have and dont know if i ever am. So ive never come out as anything. Ive always just portrayed the person they want me to be."

Total testosterone levels can range from absent to increased, depending on the condition. Male infants with hypogonadism or hypopituitarism may display micropenis or cryptorchidism.*

&gt; *Delayed puberty and hypogonadism in boys and men can be associated with primary or secondary testicular failure. Elevated LH and FSH are consistent with primary hypogonadism whereas decreased levels are consistent with secondary or tertiary hypogonadism. As men age, testosterone levels decrease, SHBG levels increase, and these changes result in a decrease in free testosterone levels.*

Samara_blue,asktransgender,(NSFW) Sex life pre/post HRT. I've heard a lot of different stories and wanted to dig deeper,"Alright, I have what is likely to be my final appointment on Thursday where I will likely get HRT. YAY! All of this is going to be great but the one thing that I do worry about is my sex drive. 

Now I've read soooooo many posts about this issue. Some people lose their sex drive, some people see it decrease and some see it go up. I've noticed a common trend though, a lot of the people who say they lost their sex drive claim they didn't really have much of one before HRT, are virgins, or not sexually active. Now I've personally been sexually active with my partner for the past 6 1/2 years. It's something I often didn't have a lot of dysphoria about because for years my partner treated me like a female in bed (you think that would have helped me figure out I was trans sooner but nope!). I would say my sex drive right now is on the high end. I normally have sex at least once a day, everyday and I masturbated a lot when I was younger. I know my kinks, and turn ons and my partner knows how to make me feel great. Even if they change I know we can rediscover them.

So do you think there is a correlation between your sex life pre-HRT and post-HRT? Is there anyone out there who had a happy sex life and then it completely went away on HRT? I figure it will go down for the first few months, that seems pretty standard. I saw a few posts the other day from people who said their sex drive went up after HRT. 

I know it varies from person to person put I'd like some perspective on this from other trans people. "

Throwaway498MH,asktransgender,[NSFW] Would it be OK for a man to desire GRS to get a vagina or a woman to get a Phalloplasty but not identify as the opposite gender?,"Sorry, this is just a hypothetical I have been bouncing around in my head. I must preface this by saying that I don't mean any harm by it and I by no means, desire to undermine any transgender identity across the entire spectrum.

But, I know there is a certain percentage of transgender individuals who transition but elect to not have genital reassignment surgery for a variety of reasons, one of which may include the fact that they may be comfortable with the current appearance of their genital region.

So under the assumption that this is a perfectly normal and reasonable approach to transition, one could conclude that it is perfectly normal and reasonable for a woman to have a penis and a man to have a vagina. So following on from this, would it be considered OK for a man to seek surgery to have a vagina or a woman to seek surgery to have a penis.

Now I also understand (as far as I know) that legally this is not really possible and surgeons will not allow it, as most (if not all) require full time living and hormones for an allotted period of time, but this hypothetical is assuming that this roadblock is not an issue. I also understand that the current social environment of pretty much all the western world would see this situation as wrong or unacceptable, so I guess I am just asking for what the trans* community's response/reaction to this happening would be.

Thanks and sorry if most of this is rambling, I'm just very interested to hear peoples response/reactions to this concept. Again, thank you for your time! "

sics2014,asktransgender,How common is it for trans guys to feel arousal when wearing men's clothing?,"I've definitely seen trans women describe feeling aroused when they first wore women's clothing. But I realized I hadn't seen any guys describe the same experience. 

When I bought my first pairs of men's underwear and put them on, I was definitely a little horny and even shamefully masturbated in them. Even wearing them underneath my women's clothing before I was out, was very thrilling. I've recently started wearing men's pants (after a real struggle trying to find some that fit my body... ugh). And I noticed how turned on I got when I wore them while packing. It's worn off as I wear these clothes more and more though. 

As I've never seen guys talk about this before, only women, I felt a little out of the norm. So, men, did any of you have similar experiences?"
Alyx86,asktransgender,Coming out at work as a transitioning trans woman?,"I work at a college as an instructor. I'm 2+ months HRT and will go full time this summer. However, my appearance is changing dramatically, and I find myself wanting very badly to come out at work right now. I'm self conscious about what people may be thinking about my physical appearance (i.e. I grew my hair out, I have shaped eyebrows, and my facial shape is changing...I used to appear very masculine with a big beard and crew cut). I'm also wanting to be open about who I am, and I want to feel more comfortable being an open advocate for LGBT college students. 

So here's my question. Have any of you ever come out in a professional setting as a transitioning person, a good while before going full time? I want to come out as a transitioning person this January, but I wouldn't work full time until the Fall Semester, next September. Any thoughts? Pitfalls? Experiences?

Also, as a little background, I know a lot of people say that academia is a great place to come out (it is, I'm sure), but 99% of my students are white-male and probably 90% voted for Trump...just saying."

Gialicious,asktransgender,7 months HRT prescription question (MTF),"I would never ask reddit for advice on my prescription but my OB/GYN is not available and may not be for a couple weeks. Please give me your feedback.

7 month HRT appointment was just last week and they uploaded my hrt results to something called MyChart along with the changes (if any) to my prescription. They are only having me take 1 extra estrogen pill otherwise everything is the same. Seemed odd to me based on im only 7 months in, I would think my prescription would have gone up again...

Without going into a longer story, did your prescription go up at 7 months? Did it stay the same? **I know everyone is different** but the clinic had a mixup and wants me to go back to my original prescription until they can talk to my doctor who is out with a death until who knows when. "
agent154,asktransgender,What is your opinion on coming out to everybody at work before you start to transition?,"I told a couple people at work (ones I have a decently close friendship with) that I'm trans, but I am not ready to transition yet. I feel like I want to ease into some feminine things though, like wearing more traditionally feminine earrings instead of the bog standard body jewelery horseshoe I was given when I pierced my ears last year. I'm wondering if I should give everybody a ""heads up"" just so I can clear the air and avoid some questions (or at the very least, avoid suffering jokes from coworkers who like to tease people playfully, and who won't know that they might be pushing the wrong buttons with me).

Obviously, everybody's situation is different. But I read once from a site that gives tips on how to come out at work, to not ""ease into"" it, if I remember. It suggests to let people know that starting on a certain day, you will be coming in dressed differently, and expect people to flip that switch in their head and start referring to you differently from then on.

But what's your take, and why?"

heavythrowaway1,asktransgender,"Hello, long time lurker..long term problem.","Alright troops, I'm sure this has been asked to death but eh, crowdsourcing advice from my fellow mammals is one of the beautiful things about the Internet - I should have done it sooner because I'd appreciate some empathetic feedback.
I (24/~~male~~/Scotland) have recently been seriously considering transitioning for the first time in my life - having always wanted to be a girl since as far back as I can recall.
After consciously repressing these feelings most of my life I cracked last week in a critical mass kinda way and I realised a few things: the technology is decent enough, the culture I live in is tolerant enough and although I am utterly frightened of not passing I know I would be happier as a female. Today I made an appointment with the GIC to get the ball rolling (for 12 cunting months in the future). There are several mental hurdles however that I'm contending with that no doubt some of you may have experienced or are experiencing right now:

* Doubt that I can handle the effort
* The almost cliche ""is it a fetish?"" because it's mainly what I masturbate to.
* Money for FFS and other stuff
* Not passing (definitely main issue)
* transitioning at University/balancing workload
 

I am not *totally* crippled by my desire to be female but fear immense future regret.

If I can ask I'd heavy appreciate a critical lengthy response to the specific points and how you handle(d) them. Help me formulate a game plan.

Cheers, 

Molly(?)."
scracher25,asktransgender,I'm scared that I won't be able to handle being myself,"For christmas, my mom got me some feminine clothes for the first time. I was really happy when I got them but when I tried them on, I hated it. I hated it because I saw such a male body wearing the clothes. Now I'm scared I won't be able to accept myself enough during transition to actually socially transition in any way. I'm afraid that I'll hate wearing feminine clothes because I'll see that I'm not really biologically female.

Anyone share these feelings? Does anyone have any solutions or coping strategies?"
IrreleventPerson,asktransgender,I can't feel feminine when people reject my feminity..?,"Like, if someone outs me, clock me and becomes rude, or if people refuse to aknowledge I'm a girl (family etc).

After that, I look at myself in the mirror and all I see is a guy with waxed brows and long hair. And I hate it.

Then I start hating everything about me, my face, my voice...

Even tho, in normal times, when I look in the mirror, I see a pretty girl (I'll admit, still early in transition, but I mean, I like what I see)

Then in normal times, I like my androgenous voice, even if it's a pain.

This feeling usually lasts for a day.

Do you feel the same? And what can I do to get rid of that state except waiting it out?"
violaceous_trogon,asktransgender,What do you do when the things that usually affirm your gender identity stop working?,"This past week has been the worst I can remember. Sure, it had some ups, but the downs were lower than they've ever been before. The week began with me being the closest i've ever come to suicide, then someone decided to harass me by posting my picture on a 4chan thread making fun of non-passing trans women, then I thought i was going to become homeless, then my soon-to-be-ex-roommate's boyfriend made me fear for my safety...take a look at my post history if you want. Or not. That's not really relevant to my question.

Yesterday I had to shave, since I still get disgusting hair on my chest and abdomen. Though shaving those areas is grueling and awful, seeing my body look so much softer when i'm done makes me feel really good. So I got a fresh blade and started my routine. Everything felt the exact same when I was in the shower. But when I got out, I looked like a god damn monster. I somehow managed to miss spots, which is something i've never ever ever ever done before. There was hair between my breasts that wouldn't go away no matter how hard or light I scraped the razor against my skin. I got so many cuts; they all still hurt. And the hair still wouldn't go away. So instead of feeling like a girl I walked out of the bathroom feeling like a man for the first time in over a year.

That was last night. Today, I went in to Target (not the best place but i'm poor) to look for a couple of clothing items I desperately need--sports bra and athletic pants since I resolved to finally become fit, and a hat and scarf because winter is here. I got into the fitting room and couldn't focus on anything but negativity. My hair looked like a dead cat, my breasts looked like man-boobs again, I could see so much stubble on my face and chest and belly, I saw my dad's ""love handles"", so many stretchmarks, so many MRSA and ingrown hair scars from when I shaved wrong and got infected. A monster. 

I dressed back in my old clothes, got rid of the ones that made me hate myself, headed straight for the frozen goods section and got a pint of Ben and Jerry's. So much for getting fit. I scarfed the whole container down and now i'm just sitting underneath a blanket so I don't have to look at myself. Honestly i don't even feel sad. I feel like a man. I feel like a failure. I honestly barely feel at all.

I'm guessing I could try other things, like practicing my voice (which I haven't done at all) or practicing makeup (which I have barely done), but i'm really scared that those will suddenly do nothing too and i'll be out of options and i'll just keep on feeling like the shitty person I was born as...

I'm not in a good place right now, on any front. This is by far the most dysphoric I have ever been. The only thing I want is to feel wanted and needed and loved. I want someone to hold me. I want to love myself again. But it seems i've forgotten how. 

I know a lot of you folks care about me; many of you care about me more than I care about me. I'm not going to die or hurt myself or anyone else. I'm just past rock bottom and don't know if I'll be able to come back up, or if gravity is going to suck me into the core. "
maxrevive,asktransgender,Ruining Christmas,"I've recently come to the conclusion that I need to finally come out, at least to my wife. Well I already came out to her years ago but told her I wasn't going to transition. That was a lie and I pretty much knew it. I thought maybe I could just let myself be miserable forever but I now see how ridiculous that was. 

Anyway I feel very compelled to come back out to her and start transitioning ASAP. I'm so done with this. But I can't do that so close to Christmas right? Would that be selfish? But then her birthday is in early January, and we have our friends' wedding coming up a week after that and we're both in the wedding party.

goreblood001,asktransgender,How would I know that I am not trans?,"So Ive been questioning my gender identity for a few months now, and Ive relatively quickly come to the conclusion that in all likelyhood I am a MtF transgender. The problem is, my mother is completely certain that I am actually cis and that I'm stuck in some kind of confirmation bias. I have alot of symptoms that I use as 'proof' that Im trans (like feelings of dysforia over all my physical male characteristics), but I'm scared that my mother is right and those symptons aren't actually real, but I'm 'causing' them because I've convinced myself that I'm trans and 'this is how trans people feel'. I can't really counter these fears, because I dont have a 'criterium' that if fulfilled, I would know that Im cis. So yeah, how could I tell that im deluding myself and Im not actually trans? 

btw, My mothers main reason for why I'm 'definitely' not trans seems to be because I never exhibited any girly behaviour as a young child, but tbh our communication isn't really good for obvious reasons, so she might have a plethora of other reasons that I dont know about"
cheesykeyboard,asktransgender,I have little to no motivation to do anything anymore.,"Hi,


So I've always been a little under motivation, but recently it's been getting so bad.


It's 00:50AM, I have an essay that needs to be handed in at 17:00.  I need to write around 5000 words, I haven't even started it yet. I can't concentrate on it, because all I am doing is constantly thinking about ""Am I trans"" or ""Should I transition"" and things like that. I literally have no motivation on doing it (Hence why I'm typing this).


This is making me not being able to work for college. I'm in class and all I can think about is things like ""What if I where a girl right now"" or constantly thinking about Am I trans, or am I just making this up in my head, etc. If I start working, my mind will go more onto the work, and it's just my inner voice constantly talking about me being trans, and I Just cannot concentrate on anything anymore. People will just say ""Just do your work"" but that won't do anything, because it only makes me more dysphoric.


Anyone else experienced this? "

Valoute,asktransgender,23 and confused: what's going on? [Long],"INB4 brick, sorry just gotta get it out somewhere.

Hello, I’m a 23 year old male and am legitimately curious if I am transgender. Since my late teens I have been doing what I can only describe as kicking a snowball attached to an elastic. Every time it showed up, I kicked it away only to have it come back without fault bigger and bigger. That snowball, being at first fantasies then dysphoria.

I believe it set it’s roots in my early teens: it may have been sooner than that, but those times are just a blur in that regard so I couldn’t really say. Nevertheless, in those days, I had lots of time to play video games. In every game I played where you could create a character I was always at a dilemma when it came to the characters gender. I didn’t know why, but I always felt compelled to create a female as it seemed natural, but at the same time it felt wrong: I didn’t want people to question why i’d only play girls. I remember that I also would pretend to be a girl sometimes in the way i’d talk to people and feel disappointed when people would ask if I were one: I never was a liar.

When playing these games, I often identified with the characters often imagining myself as them in my dreams. Mind you, sometimes these characters were male, but it was a rare occurrence in the pool of feminine heroes I had to choose from. I didn’t really think much of it, I felt like it was probably a fantasy many boys had: ‘’I mean what guy wouldn’t want to be a girl for a day?’’  I thought. I kind of realized this feeling was more tangible when I started imagining myself as a girl and no longer using the characters as a medium: that’s when it started to scare me a bit, but even then, I ruled them as weird fantasies. 

When I approached my twenties, the feelings became stronger: I fantasized more often, but I always pushed these sensations no matter how good or comforting they felt. Part of me also found them perverse and out of the question: ‘’Damnit you're a boy stop thinking like this’’. Eventually, the comfort of these ideas turned to dysphoria as if angered to be constantly pushed out of the picture. I would spent short periods of dysphoria followed by being perfectly normal: those days I wouldn’t feel like a girl, I never even gave it a second thought it was absurd to me. It’s hard to explain, but it felt like that happened to someone else: I couldn’t recall the feeling of dysphoria until it presented itself again.

 A short time before my 22nd birthday, the feeling was more frequent and I just couldn’t stand it so I had to tell someone: that someone was my girlfriend of the time. She was super open about it and said she thought I was genderfluid as I sometimes felt like a guy and other times a girl. The idea seemed to stick so it set my soul at ease for a while. When I turned 23, the relationship ended because our intimacy had been slowly dying out: I have never been a really proximate or affective person so I don’t know if my situation is in cause. The sex was rare and in some rarer occurrences I couldn’t finish because of dysphoria. I am not attracted to men, it was more like I didn’t feel like I was playing the correct ‘’role’’ during sex.

Nowadays, the dysphoria is more frequent. Being done with my studies and currently unemployed I have nothing, but time to think. Honestly it affects me in a pretty negative way, I usually am pretty energetic and light-hearted, but these days it’s quite the opposite: My sleeping cycle is completely fucked, i’ve mostly gone to bed a 4-7 AM and would wake up at 1-4 PM which is something I have never consistently done before. I am also cold and I feel hostile towards most people: I really feel like i’m no fun to be arround.

One of those nights, I decided to give it a go: I would commit to practice makeup and dress up as a girl. Eventually I did a good job, and the result gave me mixed emotions: it brought tears to my eyes seeing myself like this for the first time. On one hand, I felt happy as I looked like ‘’myself’’. On the other hand, I felt scarred as I realized this was not some phase, that I wasn’t normal. That night, I thought I might be trans and gave it some serious thought. Some nights I cry and get angry because it’s no longer a pipe dream: it’s becoming something that could very well be tangible, and a possible future. I get angry because I don’t think I can allow myself to do this for a few reasons. 

* Firstly, I would put myself in a very vulnerable state. I’ve always been very conscious about my appearance and doing things right: kind of a perfectionist you could say. I have pretty positive attention from girls although being very shy and I just feel like I would turn out wrong and become forever alone. I just can’t stand the thought of being ‘’in between’’.. If I could press a button and automatically change I would. (i am often complimented for my broad shoulders and ‘’announcer type voice’’ which is quite deep).

* I feel as if I would disappoint some people: my friends and family. Also that some people could decide to have a go at me and find my decision stupid or that I am ruining myself.

* I have completed my 3 year Canadian law enforcement course and would like it to be my career: i’m unsure i’d be able to do my job as a transgender as that would present dangerous situations and people wouldn't take me seriously. I've also done a ride along and seen some trans phobia among the policemen. There’s always the option of becoming a dispatcher, but I don’t know if that’s what I’d want

* I feel like I would probably regret it: mostly on days where I don’t have the dysphoria.. I feel like that’s how I should always feel.


Honestly I don’t know **what to think and what to do**. I would love for this feeling to just go away and lead a simple life you know? If you made it this far thanks for reading you’re a true warrior!!

Peace!"

I cried because I saw a kitten.

I cried because I scrolled back past the post about the happy child.

I cried because I was worried about a test and an essay (makes sense!)

I cried because I thought about the happy child again.

And I cried because I saw a flower I liked.

Now- I knew crying would be a thing, and I'm totally fine with that, it's actually a nice relief when I'm really worried about something, but how do I.... Do it less often?? Because I think this is a liiittle bit overboard. ��

Jassy2cute,asktransgender,HRT Update,"Hey guys I recall saying I will give updates on HRT MtF for anyone new or if you guys are interested. I am 3.5 months on HRT and so far I'm happy with the changes.

Changes so far
* **Breast growth!** My chest has small boobs now and I'm excited. I noticed my nipples have gotten bigger and my family are surprised every time they see me with a shirt off because my nipples are big and boobs are growing :D

* **Curves** appear to be coming in at this point. Its somewhat hard to say due to me being a little overweight (6ft tall 200lbs).

* **My butt is definitely growing and I love it haha.**

* **Face and Skin** is getting softer, I noticed my skin seems for smooth and is way more softer after HRT began.

* **Emotional af** I do get the mood swings lol. I cried so hard twice within 3 days once because I thought I was ugly. I tend to have this feeling of wanting t cry more over things I wouldn't before.

* **Orgasm definitely changed** Okay so I know people are saying it doesn't change until like 7-8 months in but I think this a YMWV kind of thing. I've have quite a few orgasms since start HRT and let me tell you...they are in fact different. Now I get a tingling wavy sensation after the explosive feeling of the male orgasm. So I kind of get both for now. However there were a few times I had to use the restroom but had to hold because no bathroom was near. I was looking on my phone, saw this hottie and my all time man crush [Tyler Posey](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Tyler_Posey_WonderCon_2013.jpg/220px-Tyler_Posey_WonderCon_2013.jpg) and a few thoughts came to mind and O...M...G I had thee most intense sense of pleasure come to my body. Looked it up and women say it happens when you hold you pee and think sexual thoughts so.... yeah.

* **Shoulders are shrinking** My brothers friend noticed my shoulders look smaller. I noticed a slight difference as well but nothing to major

I lost weight but that's because I haven't been eating as much as I use to, no height changes yet, and I don't think I will lose height but I'm hoping. Regardless I'm fine at 6ft tall.

I have also attached a link from google of a male chest with gynecomastia - the reason being that the puffy nipple and generally cone shape are very similar to how mine look - mine are just much larger. Thank you in advance for the help!

StuckInABadDream,asktransgender,The feeling when you are in the closet and it's haircut time...,"So some time ago my parents, family were complaining about how long my hair was. I'm still a minor and they were incessantly nagging me to cut my hair so I begrudgingly obliged. I really loathed it though. I knew it would grow back and by then I hope I'm as far away from them as possible (I live in a country where being trans is heavily stigmatized and cross-dressing is a crime) in a place where I can be myself without living under repression forever.


But I still couldn't bear to see my hair get slowly snipped to pieces like that. I always wanted to grow my hair long ever since discovering I'm transgender. Suddenly all those thoughts made sense to me. I realized that I could, physically, transition to be a girl and gain acceptance. My hair somehow represented that side of me. My feminine, authentic side. I wanted to dye it in color. I wanted it to flutter in the wind and feel it touch against my face. I wanted to look in the mirror and see *me*. Not this shell of what I could become.


It was like a stealthy symbol of rebellion. But I knew it wasn't my time yet. Still, biting your tongue and pushing through is hard. I've grown to be quite resilient and cold after living this life. I've learnt to be opportunistic. Hopefully, one day, I can truly be me, in a place where I am me. But until then, my place is in the closet and in my dreams."

She reacted by giving me a doubting (was it really doubting??) look and said I needed to think about this for out next appointment.

hello_myself,asktransgender,I feel weird referring to myself with female pronouns,"Hey everyone!

It just feels kinda weird for me to refer to myself with female pronouns... Not bad, and when my therapist uses female pronouns for me it's either good or indifferent, but when I try to use female pronouns for myself, it feels weird, I get kind of a lump in my throat, almost like it's wrong? But at the same time when my therapist texts me using female pronouns I smile, and I like it. It just kinda makes me feel like I'm not really trans, I guess, and that scares me because I'm gonna start HRT soon.

Also, I have difficulty imagining myself in the future, either as a man or as a woman, but when I imagine using a female voice it feels wrong. A big part of this feeling wrong is because I have a hart time really accepting myself as a woman,  although I've mostly accepted myself as trans, and so when I imagine using a female voice what comes to my mind is male me with a female voice, so it feels fake.

I  just feel weirded out by this... Has anyone had a similar experience to this? I feel invalidated by this, and it makes me a bit afraid of starting HRT, despite wanting to."

Killer_radio,asktransgender,I really need advice.,"My main question is did I make the right decision? here's the back story...

The past few years I came out to my friends and last year started to live full time as a woman. At the beginning I was optimistic, wide eyed and excited at the prospect of being the real me. But that feeling slowly faded and I was confronted with reality. It was lonely, I found it incredibly hard to make friends and meet people, go out and and enjoy myself because my social anxiety was turned up to 11.  I slowly went back to being ""part time"" but that wasn't much better. I hadn't told my family, (I moved out last year) but I gathered from several dropping several hints that I was going to receive no support from them or even out right hostility. Eventually, after a suicide attempt, I decided to face the question: is it really worth it? and would it be worth indefinitely returning to the closet? in the end I decided to, I hung up the old breast forms and went back to being a bloke.

If things were simple that should have been the end of the story. That me thinking I was transgender was an error of judgment, but.....

After a few weeks dysphoria struck back like brick to the face. It got so incredibly bad I started drinking. A lot. Being drunk made me numb, it didn't matter what gender I was so long as I had a vodka in one hand and a slice of pizza in the other (my diet went to hell due to the amount of comfort food I was going through as well). But whenever i was sober I was constantly angry and frustrated, it got worse when the booze ran out. After a huge emotional meltdown I stopped drinking and now I'm sober again. That little episode in my life only kicked the dysphoria problem down the road.

Which leads up to here and now. I have no idea what to do. Was going back to the closet a good idea? is there any way I can stamp out the dysphoria? or is it worth simply planning to transition, which would ruin my life but I'd at least be at peace with myself? 

Sorry for such an information dump, I just needed to share. It's a classic lose, lose situation but I hope sharing with people who know dysphoria will help clear things up a bit. Thanks for reading."

Just some of my pre-therapy sesh(today) thoughts

Over the years, from middle school to (almost making it thru) college, ive been gradually thinking more and more in black and white, though i didnt realize it till my therapist pointed it out.  I think its because ive been constantly looking for social communication and such differences between men and women, downplaying any similarities to women that i seem to have, and hating but emphasizing any similarities to men, to justify why im not a woman (im hard on myself and i cant stop)--

So more and more ive struggled to communicate with girls, trying to do and talk the way a man is supposed to (wgich i can only contribute to me growing in male culture and trying my best to emulate/be it), and now i hate that i come off as luke, constantly trying to flirt.  When i said this to my therapist, she said that maybe im just seeing my friendliness as flirting.  But i know that its luke flirting because i feel like im sorta contrilling or trying to show women how theyre vulnerable to emotional persuasion.  And i tend to often feel attraction to women, but also like i should talk a certain way to convey attraction, but its still like automatic that i do this without letting myself relax and just talk as a person and not as the expectation of a role. Trapped in my mind pretty much. But if i just relax and be myself, i feel myself gas internalized male wats too deep and so i have to rry and chanfe it, but changing it never works,..

..i need to catch up to female socialization but i dont have the guts to

 Its just, the norm of heterosexual interaction is ingrained in my brain and i still feel im seeing myself and getting myself perceived as a male, regardless of physical features (for instance, on telephone calls, but its also more tyan just voice pitch, its how my voice is used and the words and the tone and the emphasis) 

Even tho i know women arent easily emotionally controllable by men, ive got myself trapped in this loop of justifying my controlling actions as, well they can be controlled (like something on the red pill or something), so its why i shouldnt be one.  Also, its very worth noting im submissive as a person, more than ever these days, and i worry whenever i try and be more feminine, i end up being more submissive.  

Like i have all the answers for myself but i cant out it into practice. I know logically its crazy talk, but i dont know how to relax and be--because whenever i try to, i get stuck in all those terrible male loops of being what ive been trying to be for years, punishing myself for any show of emotuon and even feeling any emotion, i just detach.  Hell, neurologically id bet im not completely masculinized, which means im partially feminized, not to imply that testosterone is the end all be all goal, just that a lack of androgen is what causes/allows for feminization.  If anything i should embrace my uniqueness, but i honestly just want to be part of the binary. Genderqueer for me, for me would be settling with it, like how i feel about my male parts- ""Well, i guess thats what ill be because its what i am"" is essentially how i feel.  But the euphoria of being female, apart from the taboo and fetishy feeling autogynephilia (not blanchards bigot theory, i know and agree that it is, doesnt even account for bisexuality, but just the part about being aroused at myseld as a woman, and worrying that wont go away after transition) is why i want to be a female. I just dont think i can transition. It doesnt feel real, like to me and to everyone i know, almost like id rather keep it a fantasy, tho thats probably because i feel an obligstion to, like i should keep it a fsntssy. But now i also feel an obligation to transition now that im out to everyone. Havent found a name and feel oressure to for instance. And i feel i need to prove my femaleness. All these rules i make for myself right? External expectations control me one way or the other, regardless.  I know other trans girls have an easier time than me transitioning, but i guess im kinda tooting my own horn for being extremely 'good' at self punishment.   Sometimes i have moments where i think to myself, to my old name, what the fuck am i doing. This is all a big joke, transohobic thoughts, etc, stsrt using my old name to myself, tho i dont have a new one.  But i think male cultyre raising me just ruined me mentally and i dont feel right trying to transition.  Whenever i sit with one leg over another or other 'female' positions, i feel luke a joke, lying to myself, not natural.  But i don't know whats natural and whats socialized anymore in some aspects.   **Edit: not luke, *like*, typing on phone tho it is odd that i make the mistakes when i do, i sound crazier than i thought which makes me sound *even* crazier**

Also in general, ive destroyed my social cognition.  I used to be so capable and feel so much in response to ithers, so aware and emoathic but then i went to college and smoked the pots and got unstable, very unstable mentally, broke down social interaction cerebrally, had a pseudo psychotic episode, and now struggle to be normal and mature, luke i somehow regressed and subsequently arrested my social mental development in an attempt to fix the past and now its all worse because i still need to live as a 22 year old but instesd i dropped out of college and quit working and live with the parents and now im constantly controlling them because i cant handle even the slightest pressure they put on me so its how i fight it and i know its fucked up and wrong and its all more of a mess instead of less of one.  

Its like im fighting a war against myself, constantly denying my rationality and my emotions both. 

 (And no im not going on drugs, weed was aight but it gave me/induced my paranoia, alcohol is ehh cant handle it when im the way i am, just a downer and no tilerance on hrt, i tried antideps, 2 kinds, both made me foggy and myted in a scsry way, even tho the tragic irony is that im more detached and emotionless now than on them tho i think they actually had sometuing to do with it as i weaned off too rapudly and the withdrawl suckedsuckedsicked, they being the antideps. And antipsychotics scare me, that shit can shrink the brain and i dint think i needed it so yeah, just saying. My parents want to see more rapid improvement so im going to try CBT and DBT, yay more pressure. I habe moments where i 'see the light' and feel feelings, but i get overwhelmed and detsch too wuickly to stop myself.  Often those moments are when waking up from sleep and feeling awake mentally and going what the fuck habe i done to my life, im not living it the way im supposed to. Supposed to i need to remind myself. Ive shamed and embarassed myself on facebook, wronged people in my neglect of emathy and symoathy and theres no coming back frim that, cuz any time i stsrt to own up i beat myself down foe my past mistakes--and i know or create a self fulfilling prophecy that itll just happen again. Positive thinking i guess, seems like theres only posutive or negative and no realistic thinking, always tinted emotionally--another reason ti destch, dont do it it sucks)

Theres this great video on toxic masculinity that i ventured ti share on the red pill and they thought it was feminist gsrbage but i try to entertain all perspectives and they had, some of them, interesting opinions and points to make.  So in the video it said something poeerful that struck me on what ive become: ""nit a person, but a set of expectations"" or something like that. I do often feel like im constantly scting, being a charscter indtesd of a person. If i could harness this acting i could make a successful career, but no, its endemic to who i am as a person. Idk if endemic is the word tbh.

AnnaLogology,asktransgender,How much do the police know about me when they look me up?,"I know that no one will have the answer to this question and that in fact the answer will inevitably vary from place to place. But I got thinking about it because I recently got pulled over for speeding. I wasn't even going that fast! But it was snowing, so the guy was displeased with me. 

As a trans woman I don't feel secure interacting with the police ever. There are just too many shitty stories out there, too much power in the hands of assholes in situations where they are unwitnessed. 
 But I had been thinking since my documents are all changed and since I pass well enough to move uneventfully through a routine traffic stop, that I could just sort of relax. 

My name change was done about a year ago, under seal. So I'd been (kind of unconsciously) operating under the assumption that my deadname is out of the picture. But then as the guy was back in his car checking my records (or whatever it is they do back there), I got to wondering what it is that he actually sees when he pulls up records about me. What would show up if, say, I'd had a ticket in the year before my name change? I'm guessing that it would be my old name. Which would of course out me to him. Which got me wondering whether they might even have some sort of marker in their system indicating my status. Or would my deadname show up as an AKA or something? It's not like I have some vast criminal history or anything, but still.

One way or another, I'm thinking that when the guy runs my records he can see that I'm trans. Which feels....well, icky. It feels like it could create that scenario in which he feels ""tricked"" by me. Which is the scenario in which makes I feel more unsafe than any other.

The interaction with him went fine. He continued to call me ma'am and to scold and mansplain to me as the goofy old lady that I am. 

But it certainly got me thinking.

AitherInfinity,asktransgender,My endo and blood tests.,"My Endo is on the DFW trans-friendly list posted around here. She's really nice and supportive 80% of the time. But I've had a couple things that were weird with her:

She does not want my general doctor involved in my trans treatment at all. Like she was VERY defensive multiple times.

She also said I require surgery for a passport gender change (no) or a name change (not in my state). 

My lawyer for my name change was very sketched about this and asked for her name so she doesn't refer clients there.

She also drew my blood for hormone level tests and then ""the lab forgot to check E."" I had results from my general doctor testing E and offered to forward them to her and she refused citing ""they don't know what to test for."" I don't want to do this without an Endo unless I have to, and I don't want to out her as anti-trans unless that's what she secretly is. My next appointment with her will be 5 months with no Estrogen levels from her or that she knows of (my general doctor and I are monitoring it). Which I know is irregular and she should've had me come in to redraw blood.

Question about blood tests: since my GP ""doesn't know what to check"" can anyone tell me the blood tests she should be doing? She runs all the testosterone tests and she runs EIII(3) I think? I just want to be sure."
[deleted],asktransgender,This has been the biggest rollercoaster of a week I've ever had,"So Friday of last week I came out to my mom as transgender. Decided it was time to try and start HRT. Spent the whole weekend, including Christmas when I wasn't talking with family, looking up the process.

I was worried at how the process would be long and convoluted. Decided to talk with my family doctor first because he has known me since I was small. Scheduled an appointment this morning, and was able to get in later.

Went in, told him that I'm transgender and I wanted to talk about treatment options. The guy doesn't miss a single beat, and asks me how much I know about it, along with a few other questions. 

He had me do blood work to check my hormone levels, but gave me a lower dose of a blocker and estrogen to begin with, with the understanding we will adjust the dosage depending on what the results come in.

This time last week I was still fighting myself and unhappy with everything. Now.. I honestly don't know. It was always something I saw as a 'future me' thing and not in the present. This is doubly true because the original plan was to finish college in April and move out. So with luck I may actually be a decent length along by then.

I told myself that I wouldn't call myself by a new name or change internal pronouns until I was officially transitioning. So.. Hello everyone, I'm Selene nice to meet you?

Just on a sidenote did anyone else get a lot of questions about if you were sure? Its like, I've been sure for the last 5-10 years, the only thing holding me back was circumstance and internal fear.

Well last night I was at home watching a movie enjoying some libations and had the strangest experience. As I became more inebriated my brain began thinking I was full transitioned. My mannerisms changed, how I was relating to the move changed as well and I felt just so comfortable and free. 

I ended up catching a glimpse of myself in the standing mirror of my living room and for the first time felt dysphoric. Like all of this happiness and freedoms I felt came crashing down.

blaineisthetruth,asktransgender,I'm starting HRT next month and having huge doubts. Help.,"Apologies in advance for the wall of text.

Just like in the title, I’m starting Hormone replacement therapy in February and I’ve never been more terrified and confused.

Before starting I want to say that I have literally no one to talk about my problem -&gt; I can’t talk about this with my therapist or HRT doc because of how the “therapy” works where I live. You’re in doubt? Well then, no hormones for you! Come back once you’re sure!
I can’t say this to my group of trans friends because they almost instantly try to reinforce the idea of me being trans without really *listening* to my problems.
I can’t say this to my CIS friends who are in the know because although lovely and supportive, they struggle with the idea of transness in general, and they wouldn’t be able to help me with this.
I can’t say this to my family because while supportive they are literally waiting for any sign of weakness, any sign that my resolve may be a bit shaky. I don’t want to show weakness, at least not yet.

So here I am, hoping that you, beautiful people of reddit will be able to help me.
2016 was full of pain and suffering but also self-discovery and almost mind boggling changes. In January I finally admitted that I have a problem and came out to a friend, who became my closest friend ever. She helped me immensely throughout the year and I wouldn’t be here without her. Thanks to her I contacted a psychiatrist, started visiting a therapist every week, etc. Initially, I believed that I only wanted to try things out, so I started dressing up in my GF’s clothes while she was away, painting my nails, etc. I bought a wig and everything went swimmingly. I also found a super friendly group of trans people, who further confirmed the idea of me being trans. I was sure that I’m trans. Dressing up made me feel alive and incredibly happy. When I went out as myself for the first time I almost wanted to cry. All of this was a sing to take it further.
So I came out to my (now ex) girlfriend. It was the end of a relationship lasting almost 8 years.
Then I changed my job, moved twice and generally became far less masculine, for example I have long hair (sometimes I wear a ponytail and it feels great), I’m doing everything to keep a clean-shaved face. I became more open, friendly, and smiling.
I used to think that all those positive changes were the result of my ongoing transition and impending HRT. However, once I became somewhat content with my life (I’ve made some new friends, my less-male-me got fully accepted by my old friends, I’ve got a great job and I’m renting a nice flat) I started thinking… what if that’s all I need? What if I just pushed myself too hard with all this masculine bullshit? I almost stopped dressing up, stopped shaving body hair from my torso and arms &amp; legs and… I’m ok with that? I’m only dressing in women’s clothes when going to visit my HrT doc. It feels great to dress in female clothes but also incredibly stressful, like doing something enjoyable but also… wrong?
Then came the final problem, and probably the newest on the list: this not really masculine, colourfully dressed boy with long hair, seems to be really attractive. I’ve met a smart, cute girl which constantly blows my mind with her awesomeness. We’re not dating (I’m trying to hold my horses, it would be extremely unfair to enter into a relationship when under the surface I’m such a mess), just flirting but it got me thinking even more… why do I need hormone replacement therapy? Wouldn’t I be happier with someone like her, accepted even when being really more gender-fluid than masculine? Do I really want to take pills (or injections) for the rest of my life? Do I really hate my body so much that I need to do something so extreme? Do I really need female body and features that I want to risk everything?
Some background knowledge (some of it is NSFW):
I’m MtF and 27 YO.
My long term relationship mentioned earlier was extremely flawed, the girl cheated on me (emotionally) more than thrice and I felt extremely insecure with her. We also had some really serious issues in bed… we tried everything, but not sex proper because when trying to penetrate her she would scream out of pain or cry, she acted weird and I didn’t really know what to do or help her, she was my first serious GF so I didn’t have the experience. Likely it was all my fault, but still, she was adamant that she wouldn’t want to visit a specialist so we just prolonged the status-quo. We also had other huge problems and in the end neither of us wanted to  solve them. It wasn’t really a surprise to me that it just fell apart the moment I told her I may be trans. Is it possible that being in a relationship like that was the problem? I started to fantasize about having sex as a woman during my relationship with her… It all started from me watching trans porn. Is it possible that I feel better because I’m not with her, and not because I’m transitioning?
I never had any serious genital dysphoria. I’ve never had any problems with sex as a “man” although technically I’m still a virgin. As mentioned earlier we tried almost everything in bed so I can say that with certainty.
I always fantasized about being a woman, I used to imagine myself as one every night before falling asleep. I really like to dress up, wear makeup, I’m constantly shocked at the results of transitions found on r/transtimelines. I’m also really envious of them. Despite all of this I’m ok with the thought of not transitioning.
Do you think, considering all of the above, that I should start HRT? Should I give myself more time? Should I enter into the relationship with the girl I mentioned earlier? Maybe being in a normal relationship would help me more than pills? :("
goingcoconuts,asktransgender,Passing but not attractive?,"Does anyone kind of struggle with this? I somehow was lucky enough to pass regularly but in my mind, I've always conflated passing and being attractive as the same thing.

I'm happy enough that I could pass for a woman without much effort, it's just disappointing."

OutOfTine,asktransgender,How common is it to identify as genderqueer/nonbinary for a couple of years and only then realize you're actually MtF or FtM?,"I'm an AMAB nonbinary person, 20 years old.

I really think I might be MtF, but I worry that sliding over from boy to girl so slowly means that it's not legitimate or urgent or whatever, like that I'm just psyching myself out. I always hear about trans people who just immediately when they were 4 years old knew that they were trans, so they clearly understand themselves pretty well. Anyone have a similar experience/thought process to mine?"
Kyriann1315,asktransgender,How do you all deal with transphobia on social media?,"Basically the title. I've been pre- MtF transition for a while now, trying to get some stuff worked out before I dive into the transition. 
One issue that's coming up a lot, though, is the issue of social media. Whenever I start to feel like transitioning is something I could do, and I could really start to live my truth, I read comments on some article and read such hateful and ignorant remarks that it really makes me terrified to go through with it. 
I hate the body I live in, I hate looking like this, but I'm also beyond terrified to make the change. I know that not everyone is like the people hiding behind keyboards spewing hateful jargon..but it's becoming increasingly hard for me to not feel beyond terrified. 
What has or hasn't been successful for you all in dealing with this? Does it just stop bothering you after a while? Do you just learn to not read comments?

LisaLies,asktransgender,Let's talk about the transsexual medical system pre-informed-consent (trigger warning: trans history),"Hey y'all! 

I made a post yesterday about why you may not have come out earlier, but I feel some people missed the boat on what I was trying to say. It's understandable, I was kind of vague, and when I was writing it, I had just filed a police report that I hope will help end a very frightening couple of weeks. 

I want to talk mostly about transsexual women, because that's what I'm familiar with, but if anyone wants to talk about trans men it would be appreciated. 

What I wanted to get at with my last post, is the fact that it was never safe for many of us to even consider questioning, even just a few years ago, because the medical system meant to support us was also designed to torture us. 

The destruction of gatekeeping is something new, and in many places still ongoing. I work with many trans women, including many women who transitioned during the 70s, 80s, 90s and 00s. During the time of high gatekeeping, transition was hell. I can't repeat it enough, it was hell. 

If you weren't tortured and anguished enough to qualify for hormones, doctors would keep you in a sick holding pattern until you were, and then they'd often only give you the hormones if you could prove you could pass. Passing was everything. 

It was a time when you could choose between being 100% undetectable, or living in absolute hell, all alone. Not only that, but often to qualify for hormones, you had to have full time experience, so even if you didn't want to, you'd still have to live that hell, and be viewed as a monster and a freak by society. 

The type of counselling available mostly consisted of constructing a lie, and having your counsellor reaffirm your belief that you're a freak and you need to do everything you can to hide that fact. I have talked to women who's counselling involved their doctor critiquing their sexual attractiveness as a qualifier for further treatment. 

This is our history. These scars are fresh. These people who survived this hell are still with us, and are still struggling with the impact of the gatekeeping system. They're also struggling with the creation of a new definition of trans. 

As trans activists, we are quick to dismiss ""true transsexual"" women. We call them toxic, we call them hateful. What we don't consider is that they're a monster specifically crafted in a crucible designed to harden them and make them hate not only themselves, but anybody that draws attention to the fact that they're trans. That includes young trans and gender queer people like us, on reddit.

Why should we care? Because the crucible that moulded them is the same crucible that would have consumed many of us in its flames. We enjoy so much freedom now, but even 10 years ago, many of us would have been literally tortured to our deaths by the medical system, and if not to death, then to insanity. 

Older transsexual women often fear our activism erases them, and I agree that it's important that we don't throw them out so quickly. I do feel though, that we might fold away a bit of the horrors from our shared past, and write our own happy ending instead. 

If you have the stomach for it, you could listen to some of the older trans women talk. I feel it's important to know where we came from, however you should keep in mind that their brand of transgender was also crafted to bring other trans women into line, so try to stay grounded as well. You should also understand that you will face lateral violence and hate from some trans women who feel that your existence erases their identity or outs them, and women who are insanely envious of your self directed transition. Most older trans women are okay, but the wounds are still open for many. **Please be safe, and if you're threatened, go to the police.**

Blabberthrowaway,asktransgender,Laser/Electrolysis question,So I've had two laser sessions so far and my cheeks and side burns and neck and lips are almost completely done.

She says that there is no way laser could have cleared my beard that much and my hair is just in shock and it's goin to come back and I should just get electrolysis soon and move my laser to other parts of the body.

windlep7,asktransgender,God told me you were going to be a boy.,"I suspect this is going to be a major sticking point between me and my parents if I ever come out.

My dad was praying and reading his Bible, and felt God tell him he would have a son.  9 months later I was born.  

Now I'm an atheist, and I think it was a lucky guess (50/50 chance of being right). But how am I supposed to convince them otherwise, when they think God himself told them I was supposed to be a boy.

I know it's my life and I have to do what makes me happy, but I feel terrible knowing this is going to hurt them so badly.  Sometimes I think I should wait for them to die, but they're in their 60s and could have a good few years left.

I've been waiting for the NHS to help or do something for over a year. In the meantime I developed severe depression and on the back of several failed suicide attempts the NHS is helping even less. They won't refer me to Tavistock due to having depression.

I was put on fluoxetine and it didn't help. Citalopram didn't help either. The main course behind the depression is, I think, due to dysphoria plus some family issues.

I was planning on trying to self-med however my only source of income, EMA (I'm from Wales), was cut off because I dropped a subject I was failing so I technically only attend college part time now.

I now have zilch in income so cannot self-med.

I feel horrible, disgusting, manly and ugly constantly, I can barely talk to my social workers and therapists some days because I'm either too tired or depressed.

I'm feeling pretty depressed and am starting to get suicidal thoughts again

I am making essentially zero progress on transition because the NHS won't help, I can't afford to self-med and my body is far too disgusting and manly to socially transition yet and I doubt it'd help much anyway considering that I'm not even assertive enough to make my family use my preferred pronouns and girl name

anonblarg,asktransgender,"To my fellow late realisers, when did the dysphoria set in?","Hey,

As you may know from my first post here, I have only come to the realisation and acceptance that I am trans quite suddenly in the last few months. There have always been subtle signs, but I am very good at repressing my feelings and memories when they are inconvenient, so this has only become reality now.

Now at first I really didn't have any dysphoria at all, I was relatively happy with my males looks and I never felt disgusted at any part of myself really.

Recently now though, spurred on by the disappointing results of my weight loss so far, which I am very serious about as I want to be slim when I start hrt. I have started to more and more feel dysphoric about my face.

As I hope weight loss will make my face less pudgy and large looking, I am increasingly focussing on the parts of my face that are masculine and getting frustrated by them and continually thinking that I will still be masculine even after hrt and ffs because if them.

This is pretty much only focussed on my face, as I believe my body will be suitably feminine with hrt and surgeries (implants and body contouring maybe).

Genitals wise, I am still keen on keeping the General for now, but it'll be interesting to see if that changes in the future!

As I said, I didn't have any if this when I first realised I was trans. It probably is, but would you say this is my gender dysphoria starting to appear and increase as my mind accepts my new/true identity?

Tl;Dr: I am finding myself developing more and more dysphoria, if you also realised late that you are trans, how long did it start for you to feel dysphoric, and at what intensity (if you weren't feeling it before that is)?

Thanks so much for your help and Happy Holidays!

Agentjayjay1,asktransgender,Wanting intimate relationships when I'm probably not ready for them,"I was never good with relationships. So I never really had one.

When I started figuring things out, I stopped wanting it so desperately all the time, likely because I knew I'd be a mess for a while anyway. Now I'm certain of things, I've wanted to put myself out there. I'm attracted to women, btw. If that changes, I don't really care. If something works, then it works. I even keep thinking about getting myself into a group of friends of friends who meet up for glorified orgies. 

Thing is, I'm not attractive, not by a long shot. I might like myself a little better nowadays, but I'm not deluded. On occasion, I might look a little cute, but that's on a good day. A really good day. I'm pre-anything, so the illusion is sort of shattered the moment I take any clothes off. Even if I did get something going with someone, I'm still a bit of a mess. I feel like it's unfair to drag someone into that. I'm ""uncooked"" in a sense. Not ripe, neither physically nor mentally. Maybe by the time I've transitioned, I'll be past my prime anyways. 

I just keep having these feelings, and I feel like I shouldn't. Then again, that's how I initially felt about wanting to cross dress, and I was wrong about that. Any advice?"

-We are both in our Junior year of High school

-She came out to her mom a few months ago and this was met only with her basically saying ""this is not ok""

-She currently only lives with her mom, her brother visits sometimes from college and some extended family like    grandparents visit sometimes

-She has come out to maybe 10 friends and her mom. All of the friends have shown acceptance.

-Her mom seems to be scared of thinking that her ""son"" is anything but normal and what she planned out. A similar thing but to a lesser extent happened when she told her mom she didn't believe in God. The most her mom has done to show a bit of acceptance is say she would see a gender therapist with her. Her mom said she called and didn't get a response but I'm thinking she just didn't call anybody at all.

-We are both integrated pretty well into the LGBT community, we're in a club in school called the ""Gay Straight Alliance"" (she hasn't even come out to most of the people in that club either) if you've ever heard about it or know what it is. If not you can guess. We're also pretty close friends with an openly transgender guy. I have suggested she talk to him and I think she has tried a bit but not much has been accomplished. 

-She has been getting dysphoria about her body, voice, all that wonderful stuff for a while now. After reading that for MTF HRT the voice will not change on its own she tried practicing a female voice for a while but very rarely practices anymore (mostly because she's scared what her mom will say). She also shaved her arms and legs recently but after being found out by her mom about it she has been too scared to shave them again. 

-She does dress in her mom's clothes and makeup sometimes, she actually looks pretty good in a lot of them.

That's all I can think of for now. If I come up with more to add I'll add it in later. If you took the time to read this thank you so much and thank you even more if you have any advice it would be much appreciated.

secondaccount42,asktransgender,Should I Just Give Up On Myself?,"Hi, I've been closeted for a little over a year now (I've had feelings about it long before last year, but it was last year that truly had me looking at myself differently), and I'm beginning to wonder if I should even bother trying to transition, even as simply as socially with friends.  
So, for some quick background, almost as soon as I realized I may be/reasonably could be/probably am trans, my mom figured out. She claimed to be supportive of the idea, but it's come to the point where she points out any nuance of a detail to prove that I'm not trans. I'm sure it's only because she worries for my wellbeing, but at this point, all it's doing is making me wonder if it's even worth it. I've come out to a select few friends, who were all rather open to the idea, and almost every other friend who I haven't come out to, I haven't done so simply because I know that they wouldn't take it seriously. One such friend even tried to tell me that I wasn't asexual because it wasn't biologically possible.  
TL;DR: Putting up with being told I'm probably not trans by parent, causing further self-doubt than I have (I don't trust myself on anything, not even my immediate memories have meaning), is trying to transition to any minute of an extent even worth it?"
sics2014,asktransgender,"What was your first exposure to other trans people when you were younger, and how did you feel about it?","Whether you saw a media portrayal, a famous trans person, knew someone personally, or had it come up as a topic.

Probably a stupid question. I'm not really sure how to word it.

Did you suddenly realize that you wanted to transition like them? Were you brought up religiously and maybe taught that it was sinful, and actually believed so? Did you already have thoughts/fantasies about being a different gender than you were assigned, but just didn't know the name for it?

I can't remember the first time I was exposed to the idea of being trans, but I remember being completely indifferent towards it. I recall several times where the subject came up as a kid, like seeing a trans woman (or could have been a crossdresser) at the mall when I was like 8, and wondering why so many people were pointing and staring at them. It was certainly out of the norm, but I didn't get why it was such a big deal.

Even though I experienced quite a bit of gender dysphoria as a child, I never wanted to be like the trans people I saw. 

Maybe because I had always heard of trans women, and only trans women. So while I was having weird gender dysphoria as a preteen and young teenager, it never occurred to me that female-to-male was possible.

Then I saw something on TV about Chaz Bono when they were explaining his transition. He was the first trans man that I knew of, and there was definitely a moment of ""That's a *thing*?! You can do that?!"" I remember immediately becoming super jealous of him haha.

I think i'm probably trans (which is. a topic i'll get into Another Time but at the moment i'm unsure)

ANyway, for some context:
I realized I might be trans pretty recently (about half a year? maybe less?). I identified as a lesbian before that (""Im just really butch !!"" I said... haha hooooo boy.. are you sure)

For as long as I could remember before that, I always felt like my body was fake and falling apart. I don't know how to describe it other than that ?? I guess it sort of felt like my skin wasn't actual skin and my body wasn't an actual body and I felt like I wasn't real like everyone else. Originally i thought it was BDD but now I think it was probably dysphoria because after I realized i'm probably trans, it just stopped ??? 

I've honestly never felt better about myself in my life. Before, I used to find looking into mirrors extremely jarring and I would avoid my reflection at all costs, and if i were forced to look, I would feel disgusting and angry (I used to close my eyes during haircuts and golly gee did I have some bad ones because of that). I would feel so awful that sometimes I couldn't stand being out in public any longer and would go home. It got to the point where I felt like ripping out my hair all the time.

But now? If i catch my image in something reflective I don't care and I don't feel the panic anymore. I don't feel fake anymore. I can look at my reflection, and even if I look ugly ? I don't feel like i have to flinch or look away. I used to try so hard to view myself as a girl but now that I've stopped and started to view myself as a boy the feeling is just gone ? i was wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this, thanks for any replies ! :)"

Or that some guys think it's ok to reach under my skirt in a crowded train. Or press/rub behind me in the bus (happened last week.) or grab my vagina.
Or that they think it's ok to become violent when I don't want to be with them or tell them I'm a lesbian (I actually think I might be bi, because I've had intercourse with men. And I was once attracted to two men. One was just so, so kind and the other one was gay, so I guess I'm just useless. Even in my taste in men).

And I don't even get why it happens to me. Like, why did nature decide to screw with me?! Why couldn't I at least be straight?
I feel so unsafe when I'm out with my (now) ex-gf, like sitting ducks. Which, idk, I guess somebody felt they just need to remind me that this is what we were...


And there are so many other instances. This body seems to only bring me pain. Ever since I was maybe 11 I get searing cramps once a month and I vomit. And ever since I've gotten breasts it feels like they're all I am. And there are sooo many other things I hate about being female. I could probably write a whole essay on it.

And I'm told to cover up (ok, my breasts are too big, but I didn't chose that) and even though I do it's still useless. And I'm told to be careful and I am and it still isn't good enough. 

I know, I should be happy to be female and appreciate my body. Like, what right do I have to be upset when othersare battling with dysphoria? 

So, idk. I think I either have to transition to a man or at least become straight. Somehow. Like, idk how, but I can't continue like this. Is it better to be a man? It has to be, right? Most men I know seem so unfrightened.

And I actually live in a 'safe' Western country, my life can't even compare to the lives in women from countries with less 'equality'. So, like. Idk, I'm not trying to offend anybody, but I just can't. I'm lying under my blanket and sobbing and just. I can't. Maybe I was just not meant to be a woman. Maybe I'm just not strong enough to take being a woman.
Because there are rape survivors that can deal with this but I can't. I just want to wrap myself in a blanket and never come out. Or just find a boyfriend so I can at least sometimes feel safe. Or only have to worry about one guy. I'm horrible :( like, idk. So many others have to deal with much worse. So, it really doesn't matter what I think, it's not like it matters. Well, except for myself. Which, idk. I think I want to do."

tinyshain,asktransgender,How to deal with locker rooms/bathrooms?,"I'm transmasculine, so AFAB but have currently been on testosterone for ~4 months. I don't pass for the most part, though my voice is deeper and I have a masculine hairstyle and wear men's clothing. I'm sure part of it is my height, as I'm barely 5'. The only people that read me as male usually are elderly people who equate short hair = male.

Anyway, I'm a runner, but am unable to run at the moment due to an injury that's going to take me a few months to recover from. Instead of running, I've been swimming.

This brings up a few issues. I've been at the same gym for a year now, and am familiar with the regulars. I have always used the women's locker room there, but I feel like as I become more masculine-appearing as testosterone continues to take effect, I'm not sure when or how to make the switch to the men's locker room. I don't think I could continue indefinitely using the women's locker room, but I also don't know exactly how T is going to effect me, and maybe it'll still be a while before I pass.

This gym doesn't have any family locker/changing rooms, so that isn't an option.

I also still used women's restrooms, and if I go to another gym, I don't feel comfortable using the men's room. I don't feel comfortable in either gendered area, because I still feel like I look like a very small, albeit very butch woman, and not a guy yet, and I'm worried about reactions to me in the men's room. Also, at my usual gym, I'm worried about walking into the men's locker room and seeing someone that knows me as a regular, and thinks I'm female.

I was thinking I would just switch after I get top surgery, because that would give everyone about 4 weeks to forget about me, and then when I came back I'd be able to go to the pool without a shirt on and there'd be questions, but maybe less so? But now that I'm injured, I'm in the pool every day, and I can't really avoid using the locker rooms.

This long post is basically just me asking: when do I switch locker rooms and bathrooms to the gender I'm most comfortable with while also not making it into a big deal/bad situation? I feel like my height is an issue with passing, and while I don't think in a year it'll be the same issue it is now, since I'll hopefully look more masculine then, I don't know how to deal with appearing as sort of more androgynous for the moment."
Trilly_n,asktransgender,Do anti-androgens alone affect fertility?,"Hello everyone I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on this for me.

I'm a 20 year old DMAB individual who has recently begun to come to terms with their Trans  identity. I feel as if HRT is part of the path I want to take, however how it affects fertility concerns me. Is there a way that I can buy some time, so to speak, with anti-androgens. (unless any of you know of an extremely cheap sperm banking option) 

----------------------(v actual question v) -----------------------

Basically I would like to halt the masculinizing effects of testosterone while retaining my own fertility. Would taking an HRT menu that consisted solely of anti-androgens accomplish this?  If not, are there other/better options? 

----------------------(^ actual question ^) -----------------------

Do I have to suck it up and make a choice? Is there a magic cocktail of hormones and blockers that offer feminization at a fraction of the personal cost? Should I spread my seed far and wide while I still can? 

Thanks for everyone's time."
HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,Im worried hormones are nbing me emotionally,"Esit for title: ***numbing, phone typing m is next to backspace

Mtf, it should be the opposite, generally, right?  Feel more emotions and all?

I dont know if its the placebo of me being so unsure of my transness that i cant let myself feel right and good about taking hormones in the first place but ive still been taking them for over a year, and i just forgot again tonight, as i tend to do sometimes, and when i do, i start feelong and perceiving a lot more..pretty much.  Not to be vague but thats what it's like.  Thing is, before starting hormones i went on antidepressants for awhile, and before that i had stsrted smoking weed for awhile during college (came out a bit before dropping out) and i had some really mentally debilitating trips, i think im more unstable than most, often would end up sitting on the toilet contemplating my life (and strangely enough i had comstipation problems as a kid, seems related to that). 

 Its like i get dumber and less socially aware and emotionally aware and functional on hormones.  I dont know wtf to do in all honesty,  but i want to be a woman and transition and continue to grow breasts, naturally.  Nothing feels right male, nothing feels right female. I think i rushed my transition and now im stuck, trapped in limbo :''("
ellehutton,asktransgender,Trans girl with a work crush on Cis guy.,"Non-op Trans girl here, I need all and any advise. Hoping for some Cis perspective but all is appreciated.
So I started a new job 3 months ago. I had a trainer who was nice but hardly noticed him. About 6-8 weeks ago it was if he stabbed me in the heart &amp; now I have it bad. 

We work the same hours &amp; schedule, I see him all the time. I don't want to embarrass him or make him uncomfortable, so I have not said anything except to 2 close work girlfriends. Beside openly saying he's the best and always taking his side when guys jokingly rib him. But not being able to say anything is killing me. My brain leaves my body when he's around. I've cried 3 times at work because of the dam of emotion I'm holding back and building up. (The last was this weekend after working alone with him and his best friend all night. 
I left work 30 mins early sobbing) Mind you earlier that night a woman stopped me and said I was gorgeous and reminded her of a Victoria's secret model. So it wasn't a bad night at all.

He is in his early 20s I'm 30. He has a speech impediment. I only mention this as he doesn't seem to talk to other girls at all really. I'm sure growing up with a speech issue affected him in some ways. He speaks with my girlfriend (who was dating his work friend. Relationships and crushes seem regular here, I know of others)  myself �� + 1 of our female managers. Only when she talks to him. Literally that's it. 
He's worked here a long while, he will chat with small group of guy friends but half our team is women. When he talks to me it's direct and seems like their could be a spark. (I happen to love his speech impediment by the way, not fetishize it but it's like an accent to me. I love it) All of his work friends chat, joke, flirt with girls all the time, in a lot of ways I can tell he's just different than his friends. But still secure in himself.

Having said that ALL of his friends (and pretty much our whole team) include and except me which is awesome. I pretty much go by ""Sweetheart"" there.
They will talk with me all night joking, playing, sharing, complimenting. they've become my friends too.
This guy laughs all the time at the things I say (in a good way) 
He sits next to or across from me in breakroom sometimes when there are plenty of seats, high-fives me (which nearly causes me to faint from the electricity) so I don't think he is uncomfortable with me, which was a concern. We catch each other's eyes often, sometimes close and sometimes across the entire store and I die and come back to life every time. But getting him to talk or seemingly notice me is like pulling teeth.

I don't think I can take much more of this but something won't let me let go.
I fully transitioned this year as well, hormones, name and gender change, laser hair removal... In fact with a bf or love interest, I'll be able to say I've literally changed every single thing in my life within the last year. I've had crushes before but have to remind myself things are different now, the outcome can be different too. I have an unshakeable feeling that this is the direction I need to go but I don't know what to do!!!??? It's hard to trust my female intuition on this one.
Then add the work element.

I even thought of a Christmas present just to show I care and know what he would like but my best friend (cis girl with men lined up) said until something's established, that's not how sexual politics are played.
I only have 2 flirt modes, painfully shy or explicit (the latter is former self but something I can do no doubt, but I really don't think that's what this situation calls for.)

All I can find is info about dating a trans person or a crush from Cis to trans.
What about a pretty, smart &amp; funny trans girl who needs tips or ideas about dealing with a young, awesome Cis guy?

P.S. one of my Cis work girlfriends was literally in the same boat as of last week with a guy at our work.(I told you the feelings fly around this place) This past weekend they went out and spent 6 hours together and she showed me his texts since and it melted and broke my heart at once. I'm so happy for both of them but it hurts so much that they shot light years ahead of us in a weekend. Probably because they are both Cis gendered. ��

God help me, I just like him so much!"

I've been on hormones for just over 5 months now and I've never been happier; I'm passing 100% of the time (I was pretty passing before mones tbh) and I'm really enjoying life for the most part.  I started dating a girl about a month and a half ago--I recently realized I'm pretty gay.  She is the first girl I have ever been with and I've been so happy while with her.  She and I have gotten really intimate; we're to the point where we're getting naked and making out really heavily, she's groping my breasts and I'm obviously super turned on, she asks me if I want to go further, I say yes; she grabs my junk and everything gets....weird.  I've never really dissociated before--as far as I know--but I basically shut down and zone out completely, my genitals go numb and I stop feeling pleasure, then I'm suddenly freaking the fuck out and have to halt the entire experience and put my clothes back on and try not to cry--usually unsuccessfully.  

I'm not sure if there's much help to be offered here--I'm exploring the option of therapy strictly because of this occurrence--but any advice is welcomed.  I truly want to go further with this girl, I care a lot about her and I'm also horny as fuck and would love to actually get off lol.  But this is really getting in the way, I guess.

However, i kind of liked my old name: Tobi
Actually, it is Tobias (which i really dislike) but noone ever called me that and since Tobi could just as well be a girl's name, i thought i might keep it as a second or third name.

My problem:

I don't know any female names except October (which would be a rather weird name in Germany) that can be shortened down to Toby and even though just chosing Tobi/Toby as a middle name might be possible, i would highly prefer a name that is obviously female if not shortened.

It really is like gay porn was called ""faxxot porn"" or interracial was called ""nixxer porn"". If they did that there would be an uproar, so why does this shitty old name still linger with nobody questioning it?

A large company such as Pornhub could make a PR thing out of the change and come off as all progressive and stuff. Highly conservative people will of course threaten to leave, but they will be back secretly jerking off to gay and interracial porn again within a of couple days (At most).

2. For medical reasons, should birth gender be listed on Drivers Licenses or is this a form of oppression?
3. If someone identifies with both genders, should they be allowed to compete and apply for scholarships for both? Would this cause a sense of unfairness?
4. For people who identify with both genders, I have been told that it is because they feel both masculine and feminine energies. I feel like most people are like that, how is it so different? 
5. Is there some kind of authority I can reference? It seems from FB, every Trans friend I have seems to define what being trans is, and what pronouns should be used. These a frequently wildly different from one another, what gives? Is there somewhere I can read up on all of these topics where there is a consensus? 
6. For sports, if male discovers he is a madman at benchpress, but discovers his identity as well, is it fair to all the females if he competes directly against them in powerlifting? 
7. Is there a pronoun I can just call everyone to avoid offending anyone? Wouldnt this be easiest? I dont like asking peoples preferred prounouns because some people, particularly in smaller towns, are offended by the question. 
8. Would it be ridiculous to just make everything in our physical world apart from medical care gender neutral? No gender-based scholarships, no gender-separated washrooms? Or would this be unfair to other under-represented groups?

Would i be able to give a US doctor evidence (I assume i can print my medical records in the UK), such as med records and/or prescriptions from the UK and be able to continue taking them or would i have to start from the beginning again in the US's system? I'm not really sure how the US medical system works. 
I'm not really sure what i'm doing so any help would be appreciated thanks! x "

LaurenRhymesWOrange,asktransgender,"Weird Legal Question - How could I ensure my parents did not get to ""claim my body"" and bury me as my birth gender were I to die?","Let's say I were to unfortunately pass away. I'm not suicidal or in poor health or anything. I'm just saying, how can I prevent my parents from claiming my body as next of kin and burying me as a man were I do die?

Some facts:

-I'm unmarried. I live with my girlfriend (F24) but we have no legal marriage or legal partner thing going on.

-I'm 26 years old. Legally female in my state of residence - NY. Female on SS card. Pre-op.

-I currently have no will or living will or anything like that. Not sure whether that would even matter.

-I have a 75K life insurance policy through my work with my girlfriend as the sole beneficiary.

-I have a sister who is 22.

-My parents absolutely would do something like this if given the opportunity. I do not want to get into that. But they would do this and the rest of my family would support them.

I'm putting all my finances and shit in order for 2017 and doing tons of personal administrative stuff at the moment. Is there some way I - or anyone - can sign some legal document or utilize some kind of will that says ""If I die, ___ gets my body and decides what to do with it."" Or something that says, ""My official next of kin is ____.""

I've read horror stories about this kind of thing happening. I've also read plenty of heartbreaking stories from just a few years ago about cis gay couples who could not legally marry and the deceased's partner had no legal rights to anything.

If anyone with a legal background or similar experience could chime in, I'd really appreciate it! Looking for some concrete actions I could take."

Jenny_Starpepper,asktransgender,Emotional dissonance,"I remember crying as a child. I'd even say I was an easy crier. I was never shamed for it or given the 'boys don't cry' bit, but somewhere in puberty it just stopped. The urge for it was still there, and the psychological 'need', yet the action became painful. It's been that way since. 
My eyes get barely teary, before my throat burns and tightens up and the sensation is so unpleasant that the cry disappears. Trying to force it out just makes the physical pain worse and gets no emotional progress. Eventually it implodes to a depression and I feel so defeated by myself.
The more I think about it, the more being able to cry out some of this transition stress sounds SO good! But I've got nothing.

My therapist (who is totally cool and helpful as can be, but new to the counseling field in general) thinks it's an emotional dissonance that's not related to being trans. But I can't think of another reason for it. I still feel the emotion, it's the expression that's missing, and it started about puberty.

Does this sound familiar to anybody else? Did HRT help anybody with this? Could I have some psychological issue I'm not even aware of?"

SecretToEveryoneAndI,asktransgender,"I'm just now questioning my identity at 22, am I transgender?","EDIT: Yeah, pretty positive I'm a girl now. Thanks for the help everyone!

First off, hello! Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read and reply. I really appreciate it. Sorry in advance if I misspeak or say anything offensive, I assure you it's not my intent. It's also really hard for me to organize my thoughts, so bare with me.

So, as of a couple days ago, I've really started questioning my gender/identity. I always considered myself male, but for a long time I've wondered and fantasized about being female instead. I kept dismissing and pushing this away as ""just a fetish"" or ""even if I tried, I would never be accepted as female"". 

I had a long discussion with my BFF a couple nights ago about how uncomfortable I am with ""masculinity"" and ""machoism"" and when she questioned if I considered myself male, I really didn't have an answer right away (definitely a ""No."" now...) The possibility of me being trans was brought up and it sounded ""right"" if that makes any sense.

I've since had long chats with other friends and they recommended I check in with an online community and discuss it with people who've had experience with this... 


To list some things supporting why I feel I may very well be trans: 

*I've dreamed about being female or becoming female almost every night since I was 16 or so (I can't help but feel this is important/a big hint, apologies if not)

*I feel uncomfortable around men and get along much better with women (most my close friends are female, and I feel like I connect to them much more than my male friends.)

*My mannerisms (dramatic, eccentric, and emotional according to my mother) and interests have never really been ""for boys"" (then again, I never had an interest in make up or dressing up, I've always gone with what feels most comfortable to me due to sensitivity towards certain textures. I want to try make up and female clothes now.)

*(Sorry if inappropriate) when looking at stuff online for ""private time"" (I'm on a work network right now, otherwise I'd just say the actual words) I fantasize about being the woman.

I suppose it's worth noting that as for sexuality, I'm definitely attracted to women, not men.

I already told my parents and friends that there's a strong possibility of me being trans, they're all very accepting fortunately (which was a shock to me, given things my father has said in the past about trans people which may have made me very hesitant to explore my identity in retrospect.)

Sorry for the lengthy post, I'll answer any questions that come up, I really just want help figuring this all out..."
cdortrans,asktransgender,I'm worried that I might not be trans,"Hi, 



So I think I might not be trans, in just a confused cis guy, and I don't like it. I want to transition, but I feel like it's only because of my crossdressing that I want to do it, and the fact I might not be trans actually makes me upset a little. I'd love to transition, but I feel like I'll regret it. 


Anyone know what is going on with me? "
HopefulAndrogyne624,asktransgender,Anyone else had similar experiences to me?,"I would really like to know if there's anyone out there who feels the same way as me.

To start off with, right now, and since about a month ago (shortly before making this alt account) when I realized that I am transgender, I have understood the way I think a lot better. All the bad feelings I felt before make sense now, it's always related to some part of my body being wrong, as opposed to just feeling horrible and not knowing why.

I don't feel social dysphoria, I quite like it when someone refers to me as female, but it isn't important, and I am indifferent to male pronouns. I've never felt like a man, usually I don't feel like anything, but I feel best when I feel like a woman.

For all of my life since childhood I've not cared about my presentation at all. Messy, unwashed, greasy straggly hair covering my face. Only doing what was necessary to keep people off my back. Whenever I've looked into a mirror it's just felt quite strange to think that what's looking back at me is supposed to be myself. Except for a period of time during which I did a whole load of psychedelics, I felt like my body was mine, and looking into the mirror I saw what I wanted, or was supposed, to see; a more feminine version of myself. (except for that one time I was a kinda weird satyr after going to a death grips gig on lsd) Since then little parts of myself have felt right (my hands and the little birth marks on my body) but most everything else is a bit off.

At first I felt like I could live a decent life in my current body, I'm quite skinny, not especially muscular and have very little in the way of body hair. Staying in my current body isn't an option, however.  I'll gradually get more masculine because of all this testosterone being pumped around my body, which would bring a considerable amount of distress. I considered just AAs at first, but I don't want osteoporosis. Over time though, I've become more comfortable with the idea of developing all of the secondary female characteristics, and started to realize that the doubts I've been having aren't to do with what I really want, but tied to the idea that any kind of feminine expression is bad or ""gay"". Very much based on the way other people think I should be and not what I want. Now transition seems like a no-brainer.

Whenever I imagine myself in situations as a girl now, the self that I project in the daydream is much more strong and confident than if I imagine myself as a boy, and just feels *right*.

I'm worried about what other people will think, but in my mind I am absolutely certain that I want to transition now. I just really felt like I needed to write this down somewhere, and maybe see if anyone else's experiences are similar to mine."
armageddontomato,asktransgender,Anyone else here who doesn't give into the trans-community's trend of fear-mongering?,"Obviously, our safety as -humans beings- vary case-to-case, depending on specific factors such as environment, etc.

But for the most part I am quite sceptical of the notion that being openly trans is a ""death sentence"". I refuse to believe that I need to put in an extra 50 % effort than a cis-woman when it comes to passing, when there are so many masculine-looking and -sounding cis women out and about all around us, living just fine.

I refuse to believe I need to pluck my eyebrows and wear makeup and constantly look over my shoulder and has a ""convincing"" voice in order to live safety and effectively.

The ideas of ""living stealth"" and ""clocking"" are problematic to me because of the aforementioned.

Every time an SJW goes on a tirade about self perceived transphobia, I can't help but roll my eyes.

Every time a Trans celebrity like Lavern Cox opens her mouth, and speaks of trans women being in a ""state of crisis"" it seems like there is an ulterior motive, and agenda to keep us fearful of men and of cisgender folk.

Being transgender is a hard life. For many reasons. And our individual experiences are different each and every one of us.

But I refuse to believe that we are in constant danger. And I refuse to believe that I am the only one willing to stand up to the trans community over this.

PeppermintAngel,asktransgender,Anyone here ever trip on mushrooms? Did it have any effect on your identity?,"I've never done drugs in my life besides getting drunk occasionally. I was taught that all drugs were bad through D.A.R.E. and the like. Thanks to the Internet and Penn and Teller, I eventually learned that marijuana is not the addictive gateway drug that people made it out to be. Since I learned that weed can be smoked responsibly,  I've decided I would give it a shot someday, if I ever had the chance.

So I watched a YouTube video by ASAPscience last night about Magic Mushrooms, and supposedly the same can be said about them. Shrooms aren't some evil drug that only druggies and deadbeat homeless people do. And they're not addictive either.

Doing research, I learned how so many people called their shroom trip a life changing experience where so much clarity was brought to their life and they were able to identify all the bullshit they're living with. This immediately made me wonder what if a transgender person did it? Would they discover for sure whether or not they are trans? Would their clarity of thought bring affirmation to their gender?

Thats, basically what I'm asking. Thanks for your time."

Wed2249,asktransgender,I don't know what is going on with me,"I'm 17/MTF/Pre-Everything, and I'm so confused with my gender.


So I think there is a chance I have gender dysphoria, although it's only really been noticable since I realized I'm trans in mid-october this year. Since then time has been moving extremely quick.






I've always had a preference for female things, but I've never shown it. It's not what is expected of me as a boy. I do mountain biking, I act like any other teen boy my age, but inside I really wish I could be more girly, but I just cannot do it. I got no courage or anything. 







I have quite strong memories of being 6 or 7 and wanting to try on dresses. I remember I went to a fancy dress party when I was 7, and when we where looking for a costume, my older sister picked out a princess one and she jokingly said ""how about this?"". I said ""No, that's for girls"", but inside I wanted to wear it, but I knew I couldn't.






I also remember my sister also joked that boys turn into girls and girls turn into boys when they grow up. I said ""no, I want to be a boy!"" but I was actually excited about it. I never told anyone.






When I was 11 I always sat like a girl (legs together, or crossed). I used to do it to act like the other girls, but never knew why I liked doing it. I did it until someone commented on why I sit like that. I stopped sitting like that forever.







Then I was 12 I started cross dressing in secret. When I was home alone I'd like to try on female outfits (mainly from my sisters clothes). Most people that have a cross dressing fetish likes female underwear, stockings, but I liked wearing female outfits, and trying them on. It was more of a fetish, but I loved wearing them a lot. Although I always wanted to wear them out in public and not weird. I tried on makeup (especially foundation) and I loved how feminine my face looked. No idea why I liked it so much back then.







Fast forward to this year. My sister moved out in May, and I could no longer cross dress. In June, I bought a wig, and I wanted to wear it out in public (too scared to). My friend knew I had it, and he said I look ""like a trans girl"". I kinda liked him thinking that, dunno why though. This was before I knew I was trans.







Then about september my best friend stated to think I might be trans (the wig). He said that (don't know if it was a joke or not) I would be most likely to come out as transgender. Back then I didn't really know what being transgender really was, so I thought I wasn't trans, and denied it. I said to him if I would of preferred to be a girl, but that doesn't make me transgender. After that I started looking up being trans, but I was reading how trans people feel like in the ""wrong body"". I knew I wasn't like that, so I just presumed I wasn't trans and never thought of it again.







In October everything changed. I read things put on here, I some how ended up watching a video about trans people, and I started looking up being trans again. Then for some reason, one evening in October (14th October to be exact) me being trans completely clicked into place. It was like I've discovered some huge part of my life that I haven't been aware of. I'm getting all these memories (all said above) that all seem to match about being trans. I've never had gender dysphoria before, but after realizing I might be trans I'm now getting it. Although all the feelings I'm getting, I don't know if I am making this up in my mind or not, I have no clue. I don't like my voice that much any more, as it is quite deep. I am a little on the, lets say heavy side. I have man-boobs, and before I hated them, but now I actually like them and try and make them show more. Also my sex drive has gone right down after realizing I might be trans.






I don't have all the feelings like a lot of trans people. Like I don't have any genital dysphoria whatsoever. When I was taught about puberty I was excited for the changes I'd get, like growing facial hair, deeper voice, etc. 





The dysphoria I am getting keeps changing. When I'm alone, it gets quite bad, especially at night time. The other day I felt like smashing my phone up because I'm so confused. I see myself in 10 years time killing myself if I don't transition, or if I transition I see me being really depressed because I was born male and/or I don't pass. When I'm with friends I don't really get much dysphoria, and it's completely fine. But when it goes down, I want it to come back. When it goes away it doesn't feel right to me, despite only having it since october time. 


I also think this might be just a phase I am going through. In a few months time I will be fine, and I will look back at this and think I was just stupid thinking I am trans. 


Anyone have any clue? Anyone relate?



Sorry for the wall of text. I never planned on writing this much."
Kalabrese,asktransgender,Dating as a Transwoman? You're experiences?,"Hi there everyone. To start, I'm not a TS, just a feminine gay guy but I'm really curious about how dating works with transwomen. As a feminine gay man, it's very hard for me to find guys who are okay with my feminine personality and demeanor and for a while, I thought that dating would be easier for transwomen because they are women who were just born in the wrong body. 

But I've been scouring the interwebz and it seems like so many guys who are into transwomen only seem to want them for hookups and more often than not, want the transwoman to be a top which I wonder if transwomen are okay with that? 

I'm just trying to learn more about you girls and how dating has worked for you all? Is it really that difficult? You don't hear about FTM's having as much a hassle so yeah, I'd love to hear your experiences. "

apothanein_thelo,asktransgender,Thinking of quitting estrogen - not liking the changes. Feeling devastated and don't know what to do.,"I've been on low dose spiro for two weeks now, and added low dose estrogen into the mix a week ago.

The last two days I have finally started having sore breasts and feeling lumps form under my nipples ... and I don't like it at all. It bothers me, especially knowing that soon I will be past the point of no return. The tissue that starts growing now will never go away.

I was hoping I'd be ecstatic, but I'm not. I can't do this to my body. This is devastating because I was so looking forward to transitioning and becoming a woman physically ... until I actually started experiencing changes. I'd built this future for myself as a woman and now I realise it was all a mirage.

I'm seriously thinking of stopping the estrogen. I will stay on the spiro though, and possibly request my doctor to increase it - no way in the world I am going to let myself get hairy and stocky and balding like most men my age and older. I have a remarkably pre-pubescent body right now (even at age 22) and I'm not going to let that go away.

Yes, I know bone density loss is a concern when taking anti-androgens only. But at this point, maybe I'll just accept that I'll die of osteoporosis by 55. It seems better than being dysphoric as hell in an aging man's body, or being increasingly disturbed by having breasts."

OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,"I've been doing some thinking, and I'm going to begin a period of self-evaluation. And I guess a part of me wants your approval.","Okay, so therapy is going pretty swimmingly. But I've come to a point where I'm beginning to take a closer look into myself. What I want and what I think, free from the influence of the Internet and the people around me.

And, right now, I'm not able to say with any degree of certainty that I'm a transgender woman. This doesn't upset or scare me in any way, and neither does the statement ""I'm a Cisgender man"". 

I could be a transgender woman, and I'm sure most of you think that's the case, and I'm certainly open to that conclusion. But I also could be a Cisgender man, and I feel I owe it to myself to be open to both possibilities.

I haven't taken any steps back, and I feel like I've matured. And I think I'm getting closer to the appropriate state of mind to truly decide how I feel.

This isn't about whether or not I meet the textbook requirements of being trans or whether i may be wasting time and will end up regretting it. None of that. That stuffs bogged me down long enough.

This is about how I feel, and how I'm going to discover that in it's truest form. I'm going to experiment with being a guy, and also experiment with being a girl. 

I don't know why I'm posting this exactly, but I'd be lying If I said I haven't been influenced by everything I've read on here so maybe this is my way of telling you all What I feel I want to do and what's best for me. 

I know some of the people who gave me advice were in similar positions before and want to help me avoid the same mistakes, and that's very reasonable. But I've read too much into things like that and it's kinda messed up my true thoughts and feelings. I don't blame any user on here, and you all may end up having been right the whole time.

I'm 19, trans MtF, and planning on starting Hormones when I go back to college in January or sometime during that semester.  I would probably be doing it through an informed consent clinic, not with a therapists note (unless that affects price).  The other catch is, my parents do NOT approve, and so I am worried that they will have insurance not cover the hormones.  I am trying to get an idea of what this will cost me, considering that I won't get anything from then; What is the cost of your hormones, with or without insurance?  Thanks &lt;3"
vsmolbee,asktransgender,Unsure of what a post-transition me could look like,"I think I want to transition (MtF), but am afraid that it will be a miserable experience if I am unable to pass. I'd really like to be gendered correctly even when in unisex clothing and with a pixie cut, without having to resort to surgery.

I'm worried that my facial bone structure is completely wrong for that kind of look (http://imgur.com/rD2UQkL). I'd appreciate input as to whether or not my worries are justified. If someone has an /r/transtimelines/ or similar for someone with a similar bone structure to me, I would absolutely love to see it so I can have some idea of what I would look like."
Jazz8680,asktransgender,I'm scared I might be trans. How do you overcome it?,"So I think I might be trans. Ive made a bunch of posts about it recently, but the short story is that a couple of weeks ago I had this epiphany late at night (like 6:00am) that I might be trans. Lots of memories and emotions that I thought I'd forgotten all of a sudden came back. I don't know what caused it, it just kind of happened. 

So for the past two weeks I've been in this contradictory state of thinking I might be trans, and thinking that I'm just lying to myself and that I'm actually cis. 

I've been doing a lot of stuff to see what feels right and I really enjoyed wearing makeup and nail polish. I shaved my legs and bought women's underwear. Seeing myself in a more feminine way made me feel at ease, as if some unknown stress was relieved. I was home alone for a few days at school before coming home for winter break, so that's when I did the majority of my explorations. I wore makeup and really liked it, wore a tank top and really liked it, and I imagined being referred to as ""she/her"" and ""girl"" and I liked it way more than being called ""he/him"" and ""boy"". 

These feelings started off sexual as I've spent a lot of time reading gender-swap porn and stuff. Like I thought maybe I just had a feminization kink. But ever since that epiphany I'm starting to wish I was a girl doing everyday things. I find myself daydreaming about whatever it is I'm currently doing, but doing it as a girl. Like making lunch as a girl would feel a lot better than making lunch as a boy. Small stuff like that. Like just sitting here on my computer as a girl would be better than sitting here as a boy. 

But for the past couple of days I've been falling victim to fear. Its like I'm scaring myself out of being who I want to be. I'm scared of the possibility of being trans. What it would mean socially to transition is enormous. Family, friends, people I know at school, they would all be affected by such a drastic change as transitioning. Yet I cant deny my feelings. I look at women and feel extremely envious. Envious of their bodies, the way they compose themselves, everything about them. And I feel extremely jealous of all of you wonderful people on HRT, as well as my own friends who are transgender. 

I cant get over the fear of being trans and I'm afraid that my fear will continue to push these feelings back into hiding. I don't want to repress these feelings but I can feel myself doing it. 

Any thoughts?"
cursed_heart21,asktransgender,"I feel terrible, but I need to rant[TW:Angst, Depression, Anxiety]","Please don't hate me because of this rant, but I feel like I need to get it out there...

Okay here goes... my OCD has been so damn terrible that every time I read a detransition story or read about someone who ""overcame"" dysphoria without transition or people who believe it's all a lie, I begin to hate them because they cause me so much damn distress I just can't stand them... I hate how terrified they make me, I don't want to detransition like them... it's a fucking nightmare...

yungtransgirl,asktransgender,Am I really MTF? What am I thinking? Any answers are good answers,"Hi Guys and Girls and anyone anywhere in between. Recently I've been thinking more and more about transitioning, and I'm hoping to see a therapist when I go away to college (accepted yay), but I know I can't go now around my family. Anyways I have so many random thoughts I figured you are the only people I can really talk to.  
  
The first thing is if I am really transgendered. I have always thought about what it would be like to be a girl, and then a woman, for as long as I can remember. When I was little, it was just thoughts about clothes and hair, but when I started having more sexual thoughts, most of them turned into feeling sexy as a woman, or having sex, but as a woman. These thoughts never felt transgendered to me, and they still don't. I more recently, past two years, have started to think about my happiness, and if I would be more happy as a woman, and I think that I would, but thoughts like these sometimes get clouded by purely sexual thoughts, and I feel like those ones aren't about my happiness, or my identity, but rather just lust. Is this normal? Should I be feeling both these deeply personal thoughts, about my happiness and comfort, along with these highly sexualized thoughts? I sometimes feel as if I'm not transgendered, and simply fetishizing something that is so real for so many people.  
  
Also, something that also makes me question if I really am transgendered is that I know I am bisexual, I have had sexual experiences with both men and women and enjoyed them both passionately. Sometimes I think these thoughts are simply just a reflection of my bisexuality, and not of my desire to actually be a woman.  
  
Finally, and this one scares me the most. Sometimes, when I know I am a woman, I still hold back because I think that I can't transition because I won't be beautiful. I don't even want to pass when these thoughts come up, I actively want to be beautiful, a knockout. Again, I feel like I am simply fetishizing something that is a serious issue for so many people.  
  
Anyways, thanks for listening. BTW, I'm 17. Also, I will be attending college in D.C., so if anyone knows any resources for me when I am there, I would really appreciate that. In addition, if anyone browses this sub who has experience transitioning during college, and or in D.C. I would love to hear stories both positive and negative.  
  
With love,  
Haley(?)"

throwawaydddsssaaa,asktransgender,Thinking about a way to figure out how I feel,"I've tried explaining how I feel, to others and myself, about my identity. Sometimes people ask me why I can't just be a woman who likes masculine things and I've often wondered that myself. There's just this feeling I get, and it's been hard for me to pin it down and describe it, until it kinda clicked in the shower: it's the same feeling I get looking at a painting's color choices.

This is weird, but hear me out. At the most basic level, there are ""warm"" and ""cool"" colors. Both types of colors fulfill the same jobs: they fill in a painting and give it detail. And there's no rule saying you can't paint any scene any way you want. A violent painting can have pastel colors - it doesn't change the fact it's a violent painting, but the pastels can add something. Or, sometimes, the color choice can be wrong, or the painting might be missing colors to bring out its full potential.

That's it, that's the feeling I get when I imagine myself as my ideal presentation, or when I see parts of it. I get a different feeling looking at myself as I usually am, or understanding how I come off to others. It's different colors, and one of them doesn't feel quite right.

Of course in my case I kinda want to be one of those weird paintings that slowly changes color back and forth, if we're pushing with this metaphor.

I guess, how do other people think about this?"

OwlStar-Kat,asktransgender,Starting something and homework...,"
As many will notice, I'm new here (sort of), this is my first time writing something, but I've stalked for some time already! =p
Not sure if posting this here is the right place, but, as my therapist tells me, I should start interacting as my true self somewhere. It's been a month now that I assumed my trans nature to my therapist and last session she gave me some homework: ""It's time for you to try interacting with people who've gone through this road we're walking now. I't will help you to feel safe, even if it's online."" So here I am xD trying to come out for a bit as a trans woman.

You see, I'm really afraid to tell my mother, sister and girlfriend, but constantly feel the urge to; my therapist says it's a bit too soon, since I may not be ready for what may happen next. Sometimes I feel bad for hidding this and here's my first question: did you tell your family first and then started transitioning or the opposite? I've gone to the extent of using hormones without medical  supervision (stopped since it could really mess my health) and felt really alive when some changes in my body happened. Since my teen years I dreamt ""if it was possible to become a girl..., but wait! You like girls, you can't just be a girl with your stuff down there because it's convenient..."". My last 15 years felt like that, now I'm 30 and can't stand it anymore. I'm gonna change and should not be afraid, but no, I'm afraid as hell. How come one want's to be a girl in between? I feel lost, since everytime I think of doing a transition to female body without SRS, I imagine someone telling me: ""WTF you want to be in the middle? What a perv!"" But it's how I feel, I'm attracted to women and don't feel the dysphoria when I look down on my parts, but I feel disgusted of this hair covering my body, I hate the masculine form my body grown to during my entire life... 

I'm hoping someone here feels the same as me, can't handle being alone like I'm now. So depressive rant apart, I do apologize for my english (not native speaker) and it's my first reddit thread too xD (yaaay!) so please tell me if it's done right! \^.^

blumpkins_ahoy,asktransgender,"I'm homeless, suicidal, transgender, alone, and in an hour, I'm planning on confronting my biggest fear: coming out to my mom. Halp!?","Last week, I tried to kill myself. Within moments of arriving at the hospital, I received a text message from my housemate kicking me out of the house. A day after I was released from the hospital, my housemate demanding rent for January a week early. Within 24 hours, she was already threatening legal action. On top of all that, I'm staying alone at a friends' house and don't have the money to visit my family for Christmas. On top of all this, I was suspended from work upon returning after my hospital stay. Last night, I broke down in tears at the mere sight of other families gathered around their dinner tables on Christmas eve. I can honestly say that this is the lowest point in my life. 

Now that it's Christmas morning, I'm trying to maintain as normal of a life as I can, and not leave myself unoccupied. My mom and I are FaceTimeing in an hour to open presents, and I also want to use it as an opportunity to tackle my biggest fear. The only problem is, I don't have the first clue about how to do so. Its one of those conversations you practice thousands of times in your head, but when confronted with reality you freeze up. I need help. I need guidance. Most of all. I need to do this in order to show myself that I do still have some courage and willingness to face life. What do I say? ""Hi mom, you know how you had a son? Well you should've had a daughter."" ""Hi mom, I'm trans. Merry stinkin Christmas.""

Update: She gave me her full support. We talked for a good hour. I asked her if she trusted me, and she said she does. I cried when she told me that it doesn't change anything for her.

As you may be able to tell by my account's age that I have a tendency to put things back. I originally planned to come out nearly a year ago, but fear held me back. Every time I've meant to come out, I've stopped for some reason. From the weather to the way my shirt was folding over, I've always found a stupid reason to fall back, to find some other thing that I had ""really needed"" to talk about. Always... until tonight. (Sorry, I can't help myself from being a bit melodramatic)

After a long and emotional talk about some other drama in our lives, my mother and I were alone and the exact opposite happened: I had this sudden feeling that *now* was the time; that the time was right, and it wouldn't be right again for a while.

Although it went well (*really* well, all things considered), the spontaneous nature of it has left me in a bit of a bind. I had a text document of resources I planned to show to her, but in the past year I've gotten a new laptop and my hidden folder didn't quite transfer. Now I feel like I've left her in a bit of a bind: she has next to no knowledge of LGBT *anything*, and although I did my best to answer her questions, but I know that she'll have more and I'd rather her not end up on a site that will give her bad information.

MTN315,asktransgender,Joining Military? MEPS &amp; Name changes &amp; clearences,"FTM pre everything.  Since the ban is lifted I want to join in a couple years. After being on hormones and done with top and bottom surgery.


Anyone have any experience with this?


If you are post op do you disclose trans surgeries at MEPS?


Do you have to put down your old name anywhere? 

Is it going to mess up getting clearances if you need one?

Guess it's impossible to be stealth.





I have had anxiety issues due to being trans and coming from an abusive and very transphobic family. They told me to kill myself when I came out as a child. All the stress from being stuck with them gave me migraines and tension headaches. 



I hated gym class because it made me dysphoric so I faked asthma to get out of it. I've never had an asthma attack or anything. I got persribed inhalers but never used them. I got the flu a couple years ago and my dr saw asthma in my history and ordered me another one even though I told him I didn't have it. So I know its still in my file.


I don't get migraines anymore but sometimes get headaches. My headache triggers are family related. 


My anxiety issues and history of migraines are on paper. I recently got free health insurance through the state for being low income and saw a therapist a few times for grief counseling, because just lost the person I was closest to. I did it to get a letter for school to get a medical withdraw since I missed a lot of class while I was in the hospital with them. On the 4th visit they had me meet with a psychiatrist who gave a prescription that would help relax my muscles with the tension headaches. Don't plan on continuing counseling and my headaches are fine so I'm not even taking the meds.


Never been a inpatient anywhere. 


I don't get anxiety or headaches when I'm away from my parents.

Some of what they did to me was actual torture methods.


I talked to my therapist about wanting to join the military. She said since I was able to survive my horrible upbringing that she had no doubt I could do well.


But MEPS forms asks if you've ever had a history of asthma, migraines, received counseling of any type, depression or excessive worry, been evaluated or treated for a mental condition

They even ask if you've had a history of sinusitis and hay fever. Doesn't everyone have sinus problems sometimes? Isn't hay fever a normal reaction to pollen? Is it even possible to not have  reaction to pollen?

After reading many stories, I get the idea that this is actually really common amongst transitioners. Although it begs the question: what happened in the cases where the fear of being wrong was valid after all, and what was it then if not gender incongruence?
PS. I am aware of a few differential diagnosises like schizophrenia and BPD, but other than that I cannot find any meaningful answer to this.

EDIT: Thank you so far for the answers :)

I would like to specifically ask if anyone is aware of any stories where something else was wrong instead (after the initial transgender diagnosis). In other words, being misdiagnosed. I really tried finding answers, but I can't. The only stories so far where people detransition has to do with unrealistic expectations or social pressure / aggression and the like.

But I definitely don’t feel like a male inside either (not 100% male at least), or maybe I just hate being a guy and my masculine body. 



The thing that makes me want to transition and start taking hormones is the fact that I feel like I’d much prefer and actually LOVE to have a female body, and I appreciate and related to feminine qualities so much more than masculine ones. I want to be a feminine looking girl with a feminine body and long hair, but with a strong, cool and “masculine” personality.




I used to REALLY want to transition, but recently I start to feel like I could tolerate being a guy for the rest of my life, and this freaked me out! I actually WANT to be MORE trans so bad now so that I can transition without so many doubts. And I feel like I will never be able to make up my mind to start transition before I hit the breaking point like a lot of people here…




Basically, I feel like I’m “not dysphoric enough” to transition, maybe it will get worse, but maybe it won’t and that I probably won’t need it anymore. Maybe I'm just a guy that wants to be feminine, but not quite ""enough"" to actually be transgender, just somewhere in the middle. I don’t want to waste any more time, but I’m also afraid that this might be just one of those decision that I’m gonna regret making later…

Deorwine,asktransgender,How do I handle people who have outted me without my permission? I am not stealth.,"Hello, all!  
  

I'm 22 and FTM. I've been on T since I was 20, I've had two surgeries. I do not keep my identity a secret, but at the same time, I don’t introduce myself as a transman. I am short and fat so I'm pretty soft-looking, but about 75% of the time, strangers address me with ""sir"" or ""he"" without any intervention from me. So that's cool. I don't tell people about my transition until they're my friend and I know how they'll react, though, just to be safe.  
I have a list of reasons why I don't like people outting me, for any reason:  
  

* It's not your story to tell.
* I don't care how accepting you THINK your friend(s) may  be, you don't know how accepting they are of trans people.
* You can't answer the questions they may or may not have about me. I don't want you making shit or guessing.
* This is a part of me that is deeply personal and you have no right to share it without my permission. 
* Even though I am confident and open with my identity around friends, it doesn't mean I want everyone to know.
* Who is that person going to tell, now? How many people are going to know? How long until someone in their extended circle who IS transphobic finds out?  
 
Recently, a friend at school outted me to a mutual acquaintance at the same school. I don't know this guy well enough to call him my friend; I know his name and that's about it. We've talked maybe 4 times. She outted me to him when he said ""I don't know how to talk to transpeople"". When she first told me she did this, I was far too tired to address the situation properly (lol finals). Last time I confronted someone about doing this, they cried. I'm not sure what to say to her, now.  
Am I wrong for not wanting to be outted without being stealth? I understand this is just going to happen constantly for the rest of my life (my mother loves to remind me!), but is there a tried-and-true way of telling people this isn't okay? Would it be best to tell people ""don't share this with anyone else"" as I'm coming out to them? How do you handle this situation?"
notarealaccount128,asktransgender,I'm trans (MtF) but I can't pass and I've been in the closet for years. Can't deal with this anymore.,"Edit, pre-comment: I want to respond to everyone but it will take some minutes I'm sorry if it takes me a long time to respond but I want to thank you all.. 

Hey. Long time listener, first time caller. Etc. I ramble I'm sorry I have language trouble like speech pressure and tangentality especially when talking about my stresses and you're lucking out if you can get complete sentences with words that make sense. Like I even removed about 8,000 characters from this post.

Also apologize in advance. I don't want to offend anyone and if I'm not allowed to be here I'll go. I using a throwaway account to post because my other account is closely connected with my IRL identity at work.

I'm MtF and I've been a girl as long as I can remember. I never really knew that transness what I was feeling was just a severe and utter distaste for my body and my masculinity except for that time period between like 15 to 18 when I was so determined to make myself 'man up' that I ended up giving myself serious and permanent injuries playing sports trying to pretend. I know in my heart I would have joined the military. I remember I wanted to, I thought boot camp would make me.. grab my testes to turn a phrase.

I thought I was just a self-hating gay guy who also liked girls sometimes too and it was just internalized homophobia or something. But my best friend is gay and has always been gay and about two years ago we sat down and talked about sexuality and I realized that other gay guys don't hate their maleness. That other gays didn't cry to their homophobic parents about being a girl at seven years old and other gays don't have panic attacks when they try to take a shower and other gays dont avoid looking at themselves in the mirror sometimes because it causes dissociation. So I looked for explanations and realized that.. I'm probably transgender.

So about six years ago I meet a girl who is now my wife and she is a cis woman, who is not attracted to women, but my wife made me feel if not male than at least comfortable being something somewhere in between. I thought she was like me because she was always very masculine and actually.. sort of hates femininity at least her own. And it made me feel better like she was some kind of cosmic balance in the universe and if she was ok being a masculine straight cis-woman I should be okay being a feminine pansexual cis-man.

I guess I was experiencing something like dysphoria but her blanket acceptance of all of my weird helped. but as time has gone on I have learned that the comfort I felt was merely temporary. And she knows about my weird kinks and is totally cool with me dressing in the house without judging me or thinking it's a sex thing because it isn't a sex thing and I love her so much for this. We got married four weeks ago finally and I fucking cried the whole wedding and for like 48 hours afterwards because it still didn't feel real to me.

I'm 6'5"" tall. I used to play football. I have a full beard (that I loathe... but it helps with social acceptance @ work and in public a lot...) There is no way I can pass. Everyone would see me and see a man no matter what I did and it makes me feel crazy because the body they put this brain in is so male that even srs won't make me how I should have been.. do they have a procedure to shrink your body by a foot too? I don't want to be a man anymore. I hate it so much.

But I work and have a professional job, I am an IT system administrator for a large company. I'm damned good at my job, well respected by our users and my team. I'm so fucking terrified that any kind of transition would result in a lot of bad shit at work. Maybe losing my job. I live in a state in the south that's well known for it's mistreatment of LGBTQs.

I'm also scared I'll lose my wife -- she is not attracted to women. I came out to her about two weeks before we got married. I told her, ""I never told you about this, because it was never a problem, but I'm transgender"" and she didn't react well but came around in a couple of days. Guess she needed to process it. And she told me everything is fine as long as I don't change too much on her. And I promised her I wouldn't change on her. But now I don't think I can keep that promise and I feel guilty and I feel like I manipulated her and that I am a liar. Six years and I hid this from her and then married her. Now she's stuck in a relationship with a woman and she's straight and cis. 

**I wish I could make my brain male**, not make my body female. Why can't I do this? I'm so fucking scared of changing but I know I'm losing my goddamn mind being in this place and in this body. Even the little things I used to do like wear my hair long with a pink scruncci doesn't make the dysphoria go away anymore. Since my wedding I've had lots of recurring intrusive thoughts about suicide (not the ""I'm going to end it"" thoughts I had in high school when I tried, but the ""being dead wouldn't be so bad"" kind of thoughts). I don't know what to do.

Help? Please.."
Dustman28,asktransgender,HRT in Oklahoma?,"First off, love all of you. Hugs all around.

I've got my Therapist finally and we're working well. I'm her first trans patient unfortunately, but she's being very supportive. (And my insurance pays for the visits in full.)

I'm tracking down a plan to transition and get onto HRT. As I can tell, Planned Parenthood offers an informed consent option with approval from a therapist. However, it all seems kind of vague on what specifics I need. I won't have a Primary Care Physician until March, and I want to feel like I'm moving forward more in that direction.

Oklahoma isn't the most transphobic state, but it's still deep red. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions with getting HRT in Oklahoma?"
IamAprilLee,asktransgender,I got reversed clocked again,"After 3 years of HRT, I present as female about 90% of the time now. About once a week I am in a situation where I butch it up and present as a boy. This usually involves meeting with either family, or old acquaintances who previously knew me as a male. I am out to all of these people, but they seem to deal better if I just try to look like a boy when I am with them. I often feel like I have sold out when I do that, but I give into it for the sake of keeping contact with them. 

I think I present as female pretty well these days, even though I am rather tall and have a pretty husky voice.  With that said, I have never thought I couldn’t pass as a boy if I wanted to appear as such. Even though my raw looks have changed dramatically over the last couple of years, I tend to think that even now I look more like an aging male glam rocker than a girl when I get up in the morning. Once, about a year ago when I was presenting as a guy, a man asked me if I was a girl becoming a guy. He mentioned he noticed that I had boobs. I decided thereafter to wear looser/ heavier tops to hide that, and I thought the issue was resolved. 

But last night it happened again, and it happened in the men’s restroom of a restaurant. I was seeing my sister and her husband for diner. My brother in law is a big transphob, and the only way I can get together with my sister is to butch it up. But something interesting happened when I went to the men’s restroom. I was combing my hair in front of the mirror, and this young man walks in. He sees me and kind of freaks out. He starts apologizing to me for walking in the lady’s room. I was wearing all boy clothes, and a fedora hat. I only had some bb cream on for makeup. The guy abruptly left. I went out the door a second later. I saw the same young man standing in the hallway looking at the restroom signs and looking rather confused. He apologized to me again.


I was thinking about the recent bathroom controversies that have made their way into the political arena. If this young man had been an old redneck who had concluded that I was trans rather than female, I might be dead now. Has anybody had a similar experience?

Edit: initially I was going to pick a western name, but I plan on becoming a Japanesr citizen and taking a Japanese name, so I thought ""why bother with a western name I don't even want when I can pick a Japanese name I do want"".

aquestioningperson,asktransgender,Unexpected 'passing' stories,"Hey everyone. I thought I'd share a little story from this weekend in order to try and break this 'passing' anxiety we all have at least a little. Contribute your own why not....


I am pre HRT, mtf 31. I stopped giving a shit and am now pretty much full time, which happened a lot faster than expected. I do not pass. At all. And that's even before I open my mouth. 


I was at a party this weekend, only makeup I was wearing was mascara, and as a have no female voice yet I wasn't even attempting one. I was speaking to this guy and it turned out we had already met somewhere six months ago. He didn't recognise me at all, and when I explained who I was he was confused and thought I was my own girlfriend. I told him that that was me, and I am presenting differently now... Confused silence. ""And you're.... Not a girl?"" Well, question of definitions.


So I guess I outed myself, but assumed I was a completely open book anyway. I guess the moral of the story is, most people really aren't paying as much attention as we think they are, or picking up on cues we expect them to. People are more likely to see a tall broad shouldered deep voiced girl than a trans woman (or short wide hipped trans man). At least some people. I was absolutely stunned and grin ear to ear whenever I remember it...."

lyaa55,asktransgender,I think this is internalized transmisogyny...?,"Hi,

I'm on hrt almost 3 months now.  Living pretty part time.  Pretty much everyone in my life knows i'm trans.  I've been making new queer/trans friends with whom i'm using a new name but otherwise still using my birthname.

I feel great but also confused.  My life has improved dramatically; after being totally dysfunctional in relationships and basically unable to enjoy sex for most of my life, I now have a girlfriend and an active sex life.  I feel closer to a number of my cis girlfriends and have a greater desire to be social generally.  I like the way I look and particularly the effects hormones are having on my face and hair.  I've been playing with how I dress, and wear almost entirely women's clothing now and feel much better getting dressed in the mornings.

Yet I'm still getting anxiety, and ridiculously enough, doubt.  I think a lot of this comes from, like, when I transgressed gender roles or wore women's clothing before, it was read as like goofy and mischievous and fun, whereas now I imagine people reading it just as tragic.  Like trans women are supposed to be so sad and hate their bodies so much.  And now that i'm feeling better about my body and feeling happier, I've started imagining other people seeing me as sadder and more tragic and to the point that there's a feedback effect.

I'll be imagining other people's sexism and trans misogyny:  women are submissive, trans women are sad and tragic and all want to be super feminine, women like pretty things and are less serious people etc.etc.  And for me, beginning to transition has made me feel far less submissive and far less sad and tragic and more productive and all these other positive things.  And I think it's just certain social contexts where I imagine people projecting these things onto me, and it causes me to recoil from the identity they're associating them with.

I've nominally (not seriously) questioned my decision to transition thinking I should be dying for a high femme presentation and I'm slotting myself into this tragic and submissive identity that doesn't actually resonate with me.  Of course, around other trans women I feel happy and natural and I don't get any of these thoughts.  Has anyone has similar experiences?  Anyone find good ways of dealing with them?

TL;DR:  What are strategies for coping with others' trans misogyny and internalized trans misogyny?  Can anyone share experiences dealing with lingering doubts that transitioning is right for them after they were already pretty deep into it?"

PossibleMTF1,asktransgender,What is chest dysphoria like?,I'm very confused about whether I experience chest dysphoria. If you have it can you explain what it's like?
eliza_silver,asktransgender,I'm not particularly sure what my purpose in life is,"So, here's my situation. Severely depressed, about a month and a half after breaking up with my then girlfriend, realizing that I'd prefer to be a woman, and dealing with a general bout of apathy and loathing. Couple that with the lack of motivation to exist, and well, I'm here. 

I don't consider myself someone worthy of befriending or loving, nor do I consider myself competent to be useful to anyone. I've found myself just constantly dragging people down with my melancholy and then when I realize that, I distance myself from them to not hurt them anymore. That makes my loneliness so much more painful, and it perpetuates the cycle of loathing and hatred towards myself. 

I don't really have any ambitions, no real goals to achieve. Desires, sure, but I seem to have gotten it into my head that I don't deserve to speak, or desire. I wake up each day regretting my existence, which amplifies further when I look at myself in the mirror. 

I'd prefer it if I could just end things. But I'm too cowardly to do it. Every time I'm out on the streets I hope that I slip or fall and get hit by a bus or something. Just...end it. I know I won't do anything voluntarily. But I wish I could. 

Life feels like a fucking joke. A stupid prison. I don't see a purpose to it other than to just suffer and while away time and resources till you die. 

I don't have anything to live for. I don't know how to make something or someone worth living for. I regret being alive. I don't know what to do.

I don't know how to structure this post to form a question, so please delete it if it doesn't fit the guidelines. I'd just appreciate some advice, or criticism, either works.

But I wanna know what I can expect down the line so my question is aimed towards MTFs with Cis female partners and/or their partner. And this might get a little TMI and nsfw. 

So my question to you girls is; Hows the Sex? I'm most likely going to keep my built in toy because my wife and I both enjoy PiV. From what I understand having erections while on HRT is like the one case where ""If you don't use it you lose it"" applies, and that the nature of my orgasms will change. But like how does PiV sex compare both before and after HRT? And not to be gross but we both enjoy that ... ""full-filling conclusion"". Is that no longer a thing?

IrreleventPerson,asktransgender,[Controversial] Is Trump himself a danger for american transgenders?,"Before things get out of hand, I want to precise a few things...

1. It's not a bait thread, it's an honest question. So please be respectful, I just want to understand the issue more clearly.

2. I'm not american, and thus I don't really know much about US politics, thus the question.

Now, for the actual question, I know your stance's on the President-Elect, but I'm wondering if you (American Transgenders) feel threatened by Trump himself, or his party?

What I mean is, the little that I googled about Trump and LGBT issues was cloudy at best, with stances such as:

""We need to protect our LGBT citizen.""
to
""LGBT rights is a state's issue and should be handled by individual states.""

But I haven't seen any directly anti-LGBT stances from him.

Meanwhile, I was informed on this subreddit about his party, his VP and his Health Minister in particular, who are both extremely conservative and anti-LGBT.

Thus is my question: Is Trump himself a danger to LGBT, or the party that he put in charge?

Thanks in advance."

Somegaygirlthrowaway,asktransgender,Loneliness is starting to make me almost question my sexuality,"So after yet another failed relationship, I've been feeling extremely lonely. For context, I'm a trans girl who's demisexual and I identify as a lesbian. Honestly I've just been wanting someone to give me love, someone to cuddle, kiss, do stuff with, and other nice things! Lately though, I've been having a lot of intrusive thoughts and fantasies about being with a guy. I don't really have any attraction towards any guys at all, and I couldn't ever imagine myself in a relationship with one. I'm really submission, I'm a bottom, and prefer to be the small spoon. Heck Id much prefer my partner to be taller then me. I like the thought of being held, being dominated, and being protected. But I don't have any attraction to the male body, and I haven't ever felt romantic feelings for a guy. Hell, when it comes to girls I prefer feminine looking, I love everything about the female body (obviously lmao).

Idk what this is, maybe it's because all my friends are in hetero relationships, maybe it's because it's been over a year since I've even hugged someone my age, maybe my brain Hates me (I already know that), or I have some weird slight attraction that I don't like and would rather not act on.

I really needed to get this out, it's been in my head for a while and I don't feel comfortable enough to talk to someone I know. I'm open to hearing any recommendations, advice, comments, or what not.

I guess my question is- what the heck is this?

Edit: to clear things up in case anyone doesn't fully understand; subs usually prefer Dom's and visa versa, in any type of romantic or sexual relationship. I'm very sub, bottom, and feminine. My ideal partner would be a feminine girl who is Dom, top, and at least a little taller then me, so I can be the smaller one (sub thing). I've probably had a slight crush on a number of men that I wouldn't want to act on in an amount I can count on one hand. I prefer everything about women and I don't feel like I wanna be with a guy in any way. I also have absolutely no attraction in the male body at all, and since it's the internet I've seen a lot (not on purpose mind you) and I can say that I never found any attractive. With women I have a very obvious and clear attraction towards them, and I'm very happy with being attracted to them.

Hope that clears that up :P I hope I didn't offend anyone or say anything rude :("

agent154,asktransgender,How do I deal with holding views that are considered bad or problematic by others in the trans community?,"Preface:
It would be too easy for me to blame my views (and my subsequent stubbornness wrt changing them) on some form of emotional or intellectual deficiency on my part, but I'm opting to come into this with the consideration that I'm in the wrong and need to change.

---

I find lately that I derive an overwhelming amount of anxiety from the thought of meeting and interacting with other trans people. I've decided only recently that I wish to cultivate new friendships with local queer people, yet I'm terrified to do so for reasons including (but not limited to) the following:

1. I strongly subscribe to the gender binary. I can't imagine myself ever feeling comfortable using pronouns other than masculine or feminine. I can reluctantly get behind 'they' and 'them', but certainly not any of the other new-age pronouns such as 'ze'. I'm afraid of being cast out because I just can't bring myself to use them. I'm afraid that summertime will insist that I respect their non binary pronoun, and I can't do it.

2. I don't agree with a lot of the mainstream feminist (or even mra) platforms. I hold a lot of views that are shared by YouTube personalities such as The Amazing Athiest (hell, just mentioning that I even follow him on YouTube makes me feel like an outcast). I refuse to espouse the crazy beliefs of trans feminists I read about (such as the mere notion that you're a bigot for having a sexual preference, or the ever increasing emphasis on 'safe spaces').

Anyhow. Its late, I'm typing on my tablet, and these are the only two things I can come up with on the spot... But needless to say, I feel like I'm incapable of making queer friends because I'm afraid that I'll come across as adversarial. It is this reason why I feel like I'll be forever alone and unable to get support from other people in my shoes."
zauraz,asktransgender,Once more.. the ranting continues. I can't get anywhere..?,"I have written here so many times now that it probably has gotten repetetive already. I am on my way towards the Swedish Gender investigation to 'determine if I am trans' something which might help as I am to scared to admit it to myself. But am I really too scared to admit it to myself?

Here I am sitting in my darkblue Bikini I brought this summer in secret when I was at my summer place. Something which I have hidden for I don't know how long. I still wear it even if it does not really fit my body that well and I don't look good to anyone in it.

I am not getting aroused by it anymore, but I am wearing because I think it will make me look more feminine or something. Or I like the aesthetic. I am currently out to my parents and they are supportive to an extent, wanting me to avoid doing anything drastically but accepting if I do.

I have been in this community for a while now and talked to other transpeople which in the beginning reinforced my idea and strenghtened the resolve that I was trans but now I can't really find strenght in that as I instead wonder what 'I' want. It feels like everything in my life up to this point and now even this act of 'expressing myself' has ended up in being other people's views.

I view HRT as just a means to an end, I am not excited for it and I am not desperate enough to get it so that I would end my life. But at the same time I do feel strong senses of hopelessness and futility when thinking about my future. Unless I do hormones now my bones will grow together and it will be impossible to make larger changes.

I am already ashamed of the fact that I am probably trans.

Depression and what I am afraid of is a form of porn/masturbation obsession have also lead me to a lot of doubts. I really don't know what to do anymore except wait for that specialized therapy. People keep telling me to experiment and sure I have done that a bit and could do it more but I really don't want to ""pretend"" to be female without the hormones. The body I have now is something constantly reminding me that I am not a girl and any form of dressing up has yet to make that disappear.

Hairy legs, broadness in general. This body is grotesque if it would attempt to be female. Yet I am unsure if I hate it, it does however bring feelings of hopelessness at times knowing that I won't be able to look like a girl.

Then all the taboos I have been creating growing up about being a girl. Female underwear is still weird for me and thinking about wearing it and talking about it as 'if I would be a girl' puts me off. In general I am afraid of the naked female body even though I would like the contures for looks...

I'm a bit scared of going out as female, what if I don't like it or something? I think it will cause even more doubt if I am trans, and when I have a lot of doubt I get scared.


I'm 17, I probably will be able to get hormones before my 18th birthday.


Do you think it's bad to do this, or is it fine?

AmazingSpiderLlama,asktransgender,2 weeks post-op: opening of vaginal canal is white?,"I had surgery with Dr. McGinn two weeks ago. My recovery so far seems pretty standard in terms of my ability to do things, but I've had a ton of anxiety watching my new vagina start the slow healing process. Some of that anxiety (sutures flaking, clit looking withered and crusty) has been alleviated by the follow-up appointments where the wonderful PA Brianna calmed me down and told me those changes were normal. But now I'm home, far away from their office, and I'm getting really freaked out by what's happening.

For the past three days, at least 50% of the vaginal canal opening (not the outer labia, but the inside part under the urethra where you're dilating) has turned white. I don't think it's discharge or leftover lube, because it's still there after I shower. It's also not flaking or breaking down, which I would understand. The walls are just white. Otherwise they look exactly like the wet skin I'm used to seeing. The other half still looks pink. I am worried the blood supply is not getting to that part of the vagina.

All that said, I sent pics to the clinic Sunday night, and the other PA, Kristal, said it was fine and to just keep dilating. But the picture I sent wasn't very clear, and her response was so curt I'm worried she didn't examine it very closely. I mean, it looks WEIRD. It seems like she should have said more.

She told me to send another pic on Wednesday, but it isn't getting any better, and I'm worried about lasting damage. Can anyone put my mind at ease? Has this happened to anyone here, and if so, did it get better? What's causing it?

Thanks for any help!"
DrStonebear,asktransgender,I'm ignorant. Please help enlighten me.,"Alright so right off the bat I want to admit that I am ignorant. I am not writing this as a critic, and I have not an ounce of malice in my heart. I want people to express and be themselves in whatever way they please. I am writing this because I want to be less ignorant. I have tried to do my research on gender identity and related topics, but it seems like the more I search, the more confused I become. I am biologically male and identify as such. But obviously that isn't the case for everyone. I am male but I in a lot of ways I don't fit into the societal construct that is ""masculinity"". But isn't that all masculinity is? an artificial construct? Why would someone change their gender identity if gender is an artificial construct anyway? Please do not interpret that as criticism. I only wish to unravel my own ignorance. 
Feel free to send me links to anything you think may help me grasp these concepts better. I look forward to hearing your thoughts. Much love."

blue_sword456,asktransgender,a bit* of a rant,"Ive only posted here a few times, so i think ill introduce myself. Im emerald, im 17, i game, im pre-everything, and im mtf. This is just a rant, because i feel like i need to get a lot of stuff out, and just cleanse my mind of all the crap in it. Im just going to type, and not worry about any misspells i make, so bear with my fast typing. most of it is just going to be me telling my story, although i dont know what else ill write.


Everything pretty much started a long time ago, more than half my life ago. The first time i ever admitted i wanted to be a girl was when i was with my best friend at the time, thomas. He asked me “when you were in heaven before you were born, what did you want to be, a boy or a girl?” and i answered “girl”. That was the first time i ever realized i wanted to be a girl. Of course, being 8 i didnt really think much of it. We just went back to playing around on his playground. Since then the question of ‘what would it be like to be a girl’ was more than just something you saked your friends when you had nothing else to talk about. It was something that i legitemately pondered about. It had weight to it for me. 


Come along eighth grade, the latter half of it was when my dad was daignosed with ALS. within the first week of 9th grade, he finally succumbed to his illness. I think something with his death ‘awoke’ the dysphoria in me, because that year, i realized that the subtle feelings i ahd about wondering what it would be like if i was girl werent just me wonderng what it would be like to be a girl. It was me wanting to be a girl. Now this wasnt just a wave that hit me all at once, it was more like a larger wave than the last that finally knocked me over. It was most likely in the middle of the noght sometime after my dad died. I was on my 3ds, lil 13 year old emerald, and i looked up ‘tansgender’ again, this time coming across a sort of ‘quiz’ to guage how strong my feelings of dysphoria were called the ‘COAGATI’ or something like that. Some of you may be familiar with it, but it rates you on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being ‘indentifies as man, no dysphoric feelings’ and 5 being ‘holy shit, stop reading this and go find a psychologist now’. Although a lot of people have told me they dont like it because you can make the results who you what you want.


Anyways, i answered how i actually felt, and got a ‘4’ which is average dysphoic feelings i think. That was the wave that finally knocked me over. That was what made me realize, after a while of serious questioning, that i was tansgender. Then, fast forward a little, the first person i ever told was my guidance counselor. I walked into her office, and i remeber telling her with a very straight face ‘i want a sex change’. And it just kinda went from there. Then came coming out to mom, which i dont think i had ever been that nervous in my entire life. And it was rightfully so, because she said ‘i think that these feeling are just from you wanting to be someone else.’ which kinda just mean ‘its just a phase.’


That was 9th grade, and im a senior now, so i dont think its just a phase. Now, its kinda become a part of my life i learned to live with. Ever since ive started growing leg hair, ive shaved it, when my family is all asleep, or im the only one in th ehouse, i corssdress and wear makeup around the house. Ive learned to deal with all of this. 


Of course, there are the crippling worries that i wont get the opprotunity to transition somehow, or the psychologist i find denies me, and i dont get to start hrt, or something goes wrong, and it doesnt end well for me. These worried plague me, and i hate worrying about these things, because then i worry that itll discourage me at somepoint if worry too much, andd then i worry that i worry too much, and i get anxiety, and its not fun. Thats my biggest gripe. I can deal with not being in the right body for the time being, its the future that pains me. Because he future is unknown, and the unknown terrifies me to no end. 


Anyways, thats it for my rant. Im kida in that ‘anxiety state’ now, so once i copy and paste this from google docs, im gonna go to ifunny and look at repptitive memes to calm me down. 

edit: figured that since im just dumping my thoughts here; if i donate my balls, would i still be able to get SRS, or do i have to keep those annoying things down there."
RembrandtsHat,asktransgender,Specific dysphoria and acting.,"I'm kinda sure some folks I know IRL know this is me, and I thought of a throwaway, but, well, fuck it tonight.  I'm not shitfaced, but I am pleasantly buzzed enough to not care.  If they do, they know enough about me and haven't said anything yet.  So, I love you guys?  This is definitely not something for the Book of Faces, so y'all get it, though.

Also, this is likely long winded.

So, a bit of qualifying for the uninitiated.  I'm a newly licensed teacher working hard to worm my way into a supportive district while I substitute teach (i.e., I babysit for $15 an hour), and as a transwoman I'm so hardcore into identifying male that I'm hiding boob growth with baggy flannel shirts every day.

So, for a good while I was one of those transwomen who didn't have any sort of specific dysphoria.  Then I began HRT, and that was amazing for a while, and then, well, I found out what dysphoria was.  I broke my glasses and spent a day agonizing over the fact that I'd have to buy male glasses and why couldn't they wait another year to break?  Meanwhile, the same day, I had my worst sub experience, and it was just a horrid day.  I mean, to get that fucking upset over glasses and want to write a horrid report back to what amounted to a first year teacher who left me nothing for his kids to do?  Not me, I thought!

Then, yesterday.  I landed an interview for a teacher's aid position (the district often hires teachers from the aid pool, so this is a foot in the door), and I think I did well, but afterwards I fell apart into dysphoric mess.  I figured it was the highly gendered process of going for a professional interview, but the next morning (this morning) I was way worse.

And the truth is that I'm a fucking actor.  Every day I go work I park my ass in front of 20 to 30 high schoolers I don't know, barely know, or have a serious nostalgia boner for because I did my student teaching in the spring (I honestly do love them all, I'm born to be a teacher).  I smile, I make stupid teacher jokes, I put on the ""aw, shucks"" aspect of being a licensed teacher stuck subbing, etc. I even hide my growing tits under heavy flannel shirts, and anyone who eyes how baggy there are I point out how I've lost 50 pounds (true, actually), and nothing fits.  I don't tell them I bought them big so I don't have to wear a sports bra to hide my boobs.

It's such a fucking act, and around the department colleagues I'm out too (awesome folks) I've made what I think are becoming close, trusting friendships.  Still, I feel pathetic and distant for wanting to value them.  I feel unreliable when dysphoria knocks me out and makes me want to cry.  I feel unreliable when I'm that sub who is there before anyone else and has to hunt the supportive department head to unlock any room door I'm subbing in.

These things I should value I feel incredibly insecure about, and it sucks.

I just feel like I'm putting on this elaborate act every day.  I wasn't even a theater kid in high school.  I was a skate punk.  I was listening to Against Me! in 2000, and that's over a decade before Laura came out.

Getting this job would allow me to stop being an actor sooner, but it'll still be a thing.  I could begin to talk to administration, but, well, if I don't I worry how I'll react.

Maybe I just deserve an Oscar, and a lot of us fucking do, eh?"
ifeelshittyaboutmyli,asktransgender,Is this guy right or... wrong?,"Curious on some opinions, found it off Quora here https://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-persons-with-XXY-syndrome-self-identify-as-female: 

I think people who are XXY are better suited to answer the question as to what sex they are than Gina Wilson is. We can find plenty of XY males who see themselves as females, live their lives as female, even transition to female, but they are biologically male.

We can't find so many XXY males who identify as female, or intersex, simply because they don't identify as anything but male, and I certainly identify as male. Like all other males on the planet I don't go round saying, day in day out, 'I identify as male' as it is self evident that I am male.

&gt;The more we find out about human genetics the less some people seem to want to know. I have read reports recently of an XXY phenotypic female who is SRY negative, that is her SRY gene on her Y chromosome does not function, who is also fertile.

&gt;https://www.karger.com/Article/P...

&gt;Another report of an XY phenotypic female who is SRY positive, that's right, her SRY gene is functioning but has no effect.

&gt;That I can find 1 report of an XY phenotypic female with an SRY positive gene, does that mean that we can now say all XY males cannot be considered really male anymore? Of course not!

&gt;If everybody, including Gina Wilson, walked around naked, there is no way we'd be able to tell if the vast majority were intersex just by looking. Certainly all the XXY males associated with Gina Wilson who identify as intersex, or female, have nothing about their physical characteristics to make such a claim. They are phenotypically male, whether they like it or not. I know this by their own public statements, and the fact that they were not diagnosed at birth! They were declared male like all other males with male genitalia, their chromosomes being unknown.

&gt;Sometimes XXY's are born with malformations of their genitalia, that's how we know they're XXY, they have genetic testing done to see what sex they were supposed to be, but had an interference in their development prenatally. The same things happen in XY and XX people too, and hopefully the right decision is made. Considering the known emotional disturbance and personality disorders that are associated with being XXY, I would say leaving such boys in an incomplete state would be seriously hazardous to their mental health and well being.

&gt;It seems to me the medical profession is doing nothing to assist this created confusion. Most medical reports link XXY to Klinefelter's syndrome as if they really were synonymous. They are not. Not all XXY males go on to develop the syndrome Dr Klinefelter described. Even XXY males with normally sized and functioning testes are erroneously described as having Klinefelter's syndrome, which is the symptoms of the disease Seminiferous Tubule Dysgenesis, brought about by atrophied testes. If your testes are normally sized and functioning ,and you're XXY, you can't have Klinefelter's syndrome. There are many different karyotypes that can lead to the development of Klinefelter's syndrome, including 46XY and 46XX!

I've also never understood the whole ""biologically male"" thing, when genetically male makes a lot more sense, even though the first few definitions of male don't even fit the context."

Valoute,asktransgender,Came out to mom yesterday: help (vent),"I came out to my mother yesterday as transgender (MTF). Her reaction was weird: she said she would love me no matter what, but she also insisted that I was probably going trough a phase or that I was influenced by the media. Of course, I told her I once felt that way about myself (in denial), but I now had a good idea of what I was. She said she understood. 

I went to sleep with mixed feelings: felt good about coming out, and not so good about her denial. Today, she questioned me a lot and brought up some more excuses for what I feel: she's convinced I am going trough a phase. She told me things like:

* ""I watch trans people on television, and they always knew they were trans from birth: you just found out so you can't be trans.""

* ""You move like a man, act like a man, you can't be transsexual you are not a woman I would know.""

* "" I have fantasies of sex with women, but they are just fantasies: I would never do that as I only want romance with men: your desire to be a woman must be a fantasy""

* "" its not like you're telling me you're gay, which I wouldn't mind the slightest: you're telling me you wan't to be a woman, that's weird""

* '' you're like your father, you're strong, you can't accept the fact that you like girly things so you rationalize it and find an excuse. You're a feminine guy not a woman.""

Before going to bed, she came into my room and started to play with my hair while I ""Gamed"" with pals. After a whiled I pulled away from her hands: she never did this before and it felt unconformable. she then leaned in close from behind and whispered into my ear "" I don't want to lose my little boy"". That hurt me so much, as if I was killing my male self to become who I really am :(

I don't know how to deal with this, this past month i've been really depressed and tonight i've given in to my crutch to deal (alcohol). I've also laid on the floor and cried so much: I can't go to sleep. I understand where my mom is coming from in a sense because I've always been the successful kid with no problems (I always hid them). Now i'm weak and I can't progress in anything, and I feel she doesn't like that. I want to transition and take a break from my professional progress (becoming a cop) as I don't feel someone transitioning would be welcome in that environment.

I feel my parents always looked to me to set the example even though I am the middle kid: I am not allowed failure, but my siblings are. I must always be good and fair, never cheat, be honest, and basically be that perfect kid to boast about.

Now, I honestly feel like giving up and repressing these feelings yet again. I've always repressed my feelings because my siblings had so many problems: I didn't want to add ""weight"" on my parents backs. I feel like I am being that drop that causes the bowl to overflow. I feel like I shouldn't burden the rest of the family with this secret. 

how do I handle this?? :(

P.s. I am searching for a therapist because my mom want's proof that I am trans, even though I know I am..

However, if I was presented the chance to be born again, all the same circumstances, with the only difference that I was born a cis girl, I would definitely do it.

After dropping hints to my mom for years about me being a girl, I finally flat out told her a few months ago. When I told her she reacted violently which made me very sad. Prior to this I had already been going to school as a girl since the start of the new school year (I'm very fortunate that I pass). When she found out about this, she threw away a good chunk of my girl clothes and my wig. Since then, I'd gotten more clothes and a new wig but in more hidden and secure places. My mom continues now to emphasize ""he"" and ""boy"" whenever I'm near. It makes me really uncomfortable. She also prohibits me going out in public as of recent (Last week and this week) because she ""fears"" that I will go in girlmode (I'm basically repunzel for my winter break :( ). In some instances, she's even taken away my keys. I really want her to accept me and I'm honestly so tired of getting into boymode for her. I love her to death, but I hate my boy mode. I'm too scared to tell any teacher/ administrator at school about this because I'm too scared of it creating more unnecessary drama. I get that its hard to see her son grow into a woman, but if she loves me shae has to accept it right? I want her to learn more about what it actually means to be transgender; she thinks that all trans/ genderqueer people with feminine expression are just sex workers (no offense to those that are). Again I love my mom but I really want her to accept me. 

What I've thought of is is just sending her an email with a heartfelt mesage about detailing that just because I hate being a boy doesn't mean I'm a completely different person. I also want to send links to articles regarding parents acceptance of their children, myths regarding transwomen, and transphobia in the black community . Do y'all think this will help?

IreneHolmes222,asktransgender,My desire to transition starts to fluctuate really often recently,"Like the title says, it’s driving me crazy… 


I used to look at other girls on the streets or TV and wishing that I could BE or BE LIKE them. But now, when I look at other girls, I still want to be like them, but I start to not want to transition anymore because I also want to BE WITH them, and it’s obviously a lot easier to get a girlfriend for a cis dude. Like yesterday I went to a shopping mall and see all these girls and by the end of the day, I didn’t want to be a girl anymore, I felt like I could settle with being a guy. 

I’ve always been attracted to girls and wanted a girlfriend, but this attraction hasn’t really ever suppressed my “trans feeling” before. I used to HATE my masculinity, but now I only DISLIKE it and feel I could settle with it in order to be with girls. But I have never been able to and still can’t imagine myself having sex as a guy. The thought of penetrating someone and orgasm as a guy disgusts me (I do masturbate, but always imagine myself as a female and really hate achieving orgasm by being the male role in sex), and this is pretty constant and have never gone away. It just doesn't feel ""right"". 


So now I still prefer a female body, I still shave my body hair, I still like my long hair. I still dislike my masculinity, being a guy still doesn't feel ""right"",  but I feel I could settle with it… 


I will also stopping wanting to be a girl when I’m with my family or people that I know, probably because I think it will be really awkward to see or talk to them after I transition. But not exactly like it goes away completely, it feels more like the fear of awkwardness suppresses my desire to be a girl. It also happens when I look in the mirror and notice my masculine features more over my feminine ones, probably because I feel discouraged and hopeless that I won’t be able to pass. But on the days that I notice my feminine features more over my masculine ones, I will have hopes again and start looking into transition….


This all started to happen pretty recently, I don’t know if it’s because I’ve started to face my transgenderism head on but still feeling scared (I’ve come out to all my family and they all took it pretty well), and starts to worry what if I’m not really trans? Or maybe because a lot of the pressure and secrecy have been released so the dysphoria is also eased. 

I've also realized recently that although I hate being a guy and want to be a girl, I don't really identify as a female....I like doing feminine things and wearing feminine clothes and all, but I have never looked at myself as female. But that's the topic for another post, I don't want to make this post any longer than it already is....sorry btw....

So does anyone have any similar experience? If not, have you ever doubted your decision and how did you deal with it? And has transitioning made this better? Thank you all :)

baphomeow,asktransgender,What's the point?,"If I can't pass? It's up to me to make sure I look perfect but I really can't. I lash out at other trans people because the dysphoria is just so much. I'm a trans women and I know that the SRS surgery I want will take years. Before that day, I'm stuck seeing myself as a fucking ugly man in a dress. I'm seriously considering quitting hrt.

yangxiu,asktransgender,"[nsfw] im confused, and it' causing problems...","so, it' been 2 month since i been on AA &amp; E. Over all i loves it, my skin are smoother, whiter, my butt seems bigger and my boobs are buding, but not everything is positive. 

im confused af... I have really never had any disphoria to speak off, other than knowing i want to live as a girl, dislike morning wood, ""jokingly"" wished to cut it off if it can lower myale sexual desires  to my friends a few yr back. since starting HRT i had a few panic attacks but i wasnt sure if those are disphoria or just me wishing it to be. u see, i am jealous of other trans women who have really defined disphoria, because it validates them. (sry! i know it hurts, but it really is validating! at least u dont have to wonder if u are real or fake ��)

im going to list some of the things i experienced below, have any of u girls ever experienced anything similar?

1. i dont have strong genital dysphoria. looking or touching it cause no distress. however I also know i want remove it i feel nothing for it, and is indifferent if it is attached or not. the way i see it is, if im going to live as a girl, having that thing  just will not work. there are sometimes i do feel annoyed especially if i see a bulge in the clothing i wear. just a question, is it normal to want to have srs just that i can feel more like a women even without dysphoria?

2. i dont mind wearing males clothing, since wearing female clothing magnify my male features, i tend to avoid them. 

3. is it normal to becoming ever so conscious about the boy parts? even if i am indifferent about it? i keep telling myself internally that i have to dislike it to justify the desirer to remove it.

4. wishing to be a girl is on and off for me.  if no one ask ""what do u wish for"", i wouldnt think of becoming a girl, becoming a girl was not a pressing issue for me, although i do wish to be one, i do like having soft skin, bigger butt, wearing pretty cloth etc. this bothers me a lot, since it makes me feel as if im a wantabe... 

5. does certain feeling fade away? for example, i remember i get really annoyed when i have morning wood. felt really grossed out when i masturbate. but those feelings fades overtime, now days i rarely feel any discomfert towards it. tho if i dont get morning wood, it' always a plus.

god, i feel really like a wantabe atm... i hate this, why cant my feeling be more stright forward? this is the worst!

any feed back would be great! thanks!"

throwaway95982000,asktransgender,I don't see the point in living if I can't be a girl,"I'm 16, and I'm starting to not see the point in anything anymore.


I was born male. I struggle to live with that already. All I can think about is my childhood, thinking how much better if I were a girl. I can transition, but I'll be a trans-woman, not a cis-woman. I won't  be able to get pregnant like a cis-woman, I won't be able to. I have to get therapy, HRT, SRS, FFS just so I can turn into a woman. Even then, I'll still have history of being male, and I think I might regret transitioning. 


I look into the mirror. I know it is me, but it just doesn't look quite right. I remember putting makeup on a few years ago (Before I knew what trans meant) and I loved seeing myself with foundation on. I haven't had the chance to since.


It's like, I'm living a life I don't want to live. Every time I think about female, I just seem to shake in anger. Sometimes I feel like smashing my phone, or just smashing my room up or something to release the anger.



I've only been like this for a few months. I found out about what transgender meant in August, I got really obsessed with transgender issues. Then I asked myself if I am trans, and I realized I might be. Here I am. Dypshoria is getting quite bad, I have suicidal thoughts, anger and depression because I was born male and not female.



I do think this might all be a phase and it will be over soon. I'll look back to this in a few months time and think how stupid I was for thinking all this. I can either do nothing about it, regret it, or do something about it and regret it. If I were born female I wouldn't have any of this.



I want to see a therapist, but I won't be able to for months, probably not until August/September time, due to NHS waiting times.

My dad picked up the last bit of mail (I do it every time in case something like this happens.) and found the letter (he didn't open it, he's waiting until I get home at 4pm). He quickly looked up the name of the clinic and called me right away, without even a proper hello, he said, ""We are gonna have to talk about something you won't want to talk about.""

My heart dropped, thinking it was something about school, and how I decided to apply for UC Berkley (he was really against me moving). But right after he said, ""You are no weirdo right?"" I knew what he meant, after that it was just a quick thing of him saying the clinic's name. If my heart could've dropped anymore, it would probably form a black home. 

Honestly, I wasn't ready or mentally repaired to hear that, and the way he said it with no emotion. I'm on the verge of tears. I don't want to go home. I don't want to hear his thoughts, or see his reactions. I wish I had friends to stay with for the night.

And I'm now well aware of how often prostitution is forced upon vulnerable girls by piece-of-shit motherfuckers. I'm a transgirl myself, and I've never used a prostitute, and have never been one. I'm in Baltimore and it seems to me the number of trans prostitutes (on Craigslist) and obviously on street corners, is way out of proportion to the number of transpeople I see in the area generally. What is actually going on here? Am I completely out of the loop? Am I experiencing some sort of bias or fallacy? Are these (mostly) fellow transwomen being forced into it, or are they selling their bodies by choice? If they are being forced into it what are we doing to save them? I'm also trying to wrap my head around how I am feeing like a sexual outcast, yet there's apparently enough demand for them.

Older_Wiser2,asktransgender,MtF: OMG! What's happening?????,"This has been an incredible week and I can't do anything right now but sit back, legs crossed very appropriately, and reflect back over the past week ....

- I went in to get my hair cut / styled and got my very first totally female cut - but then she said, ""we're sorry - but you can't come in here anymore ...."" This is a large salon and I have always had my hair cut in the ""men's salon"" side ... and she said no more - she said I'm now viewed 100% female and I no longer fit in the men's salon so they are moving me over to the main salon with the women ... WooHoo!

- I work out daily at the YMCA where I always use the ""Family Locker Room"" ... The Center director took me aside earlier this week which worried me a bit ... she said they've changed my profile to reflect my preferred name and, with my permission, they changed my gender marker to **Female**. I signed up at this YMCA over 10 years ago at a time when my transition was only a dream .... Now I'm no longer that person - and kudos to the Director for being proactive and taking the initiative to make the changes -- oh -- and I was told I could not use the men's locker room (I never have) as women are not allowed in there - she said to always use the women's locker room ...  WOW!

- my gender therapist today told me to stop thinking I can pass as a male if needed - she said whatever I *think* I look like I'm female now and to get used to it .... she said the ""male"" has been completely erased. 

- I went into a men's room earlier this week and got called out -- an older guy looked at me and pointed towards the door saying ""wrong"" .... 

- my flair says I'm ""ridiculously happy"" and right now that would be a clear understatement!!!!

It just felt hard all of a sudden, I'm happy for sure, but today I'm just straight up exhausted. I want to not be stiff or slow and have a full range of motion so I can cuddle in bed by myself.

But when I dress normally (feminine but still in the male-box) I feel mostly fine. The thought always comes back though. Am I just doing this to myself?

throwawayfororchiect,asktransgender,How to actually begin the process for orchiectomy,"Hi, so, please forgive me if this has been asked before, but a cursory search of the sub turned up a lot more people talking about their experience with the surgery than the time leading up to it, which is the part I'm having difficulty with.

So, for a bit of background, I live in Denver, I'm 21, and I've been on HRT for just a bit over 2 years. I have Colorado Medicaid, which pays for my HRT largely ($1 for each script) and I'm working very closely with a therapist and my doctor at the Women's Health clinic. Several months ago, I mentioned to my doctor that I was interested in getting an orchiectomy after finding tons of information about the procedure on the internet, and deciding that it was for me. She thought it was a great idea but she was very pressed for time during that meeting and I didn't have much time to ask her where to go from there. During our last meeting, I brought it up again, and again she agreed it was a good idea but had no suggestions on where to go from there. She mentioned I would likely need a letter from my therapist and that she'd be happy to provide another letter if I needed one, but was unable to recommend anyone to speak to or begin the process with.

I haven't been able to find a lot of information about pricing, insurance coverage, anything of the sort, as it's not exactly a common surgery. Plenty of information on testicular cancer patients and of course almost every insurance covers surgery for cancer patients, but I'm worried that as a trans person it might be seen as an 'elective' surgery and not be covered under my insurance. 

Basically I need to know what steps I need to take to actually lead up to the surgery, how much it will cost, if my insurance will cover it, if anyone in my state will even perform the surgery, etc. I really apologize if it seems like I'm repeating myself, I've just been looking into this for months to basically no avail and I'm a bit frustrated."

I had a pretty shite group of friends at Uni and I just feel like deleting them tbh. although maybe I should wait until stuff is sorted out with the house I was living in so I can just leave and get this shit over and done with.

I'm feeling really lost tbh. I have no idea where my life is heading. I am so so scared to socially transition. I've been on 2mg estrogen for three days now but I've been wanting this for over a year. The only people who really have made an effort to understand what I'm going through are my friends from home, only two of whom still live in the same conservative town I'm from.

I'm honestly feeling pretty suicidal tbh, like I know I can't keep living as a guy but living as a tall trans girl is really scary and I seem to have this bottomless pit of depression and low self esteem lmao.

dramwt,asktransgender,How do I make sense of myself? (NSFW),"I'm a 21 year old guy(?), for my entire life it has never occurred to me that I might be transgender mtf, but in recent months it's felt like a real possibility. I'm gonna run through my story and background and I'd really love it if anone could tell me if they can relate or understand where I'm at. 

I've never felt like the manliest guy, I typically feel a little inferior around other guys, especially built ones. I was fairly popular in school until puberty, then I started to feel weird and akward and withdrew into myself. I've read about other Trans people who were like this, but at the time I never felt like I was the wrong gender. What started me on the path to considering it was transgender porn. Initially I imagined I was the guy, but then I discovered it is much more fun to imagine being the girl. I really got into the idea of forced fem and being made to be a really feminine girl (but I always imagined I'd keep my penis if that's relevant...).

I found this place a few months ago and I've been addicted ever since. Some of the things I read here really ring true with me. Stuff about being terrirified about the future and feeling anxious all the time without knowing why. But a lot of stuff feels foreign to me, mostly to do with dysphoria, I have no issues with my male body. I also like looking at the transtimelines, I think it's really cool seeing people become more female over time. 

I think what attracts me most about being a girl is the clothes. I love girls clothes, I've only tried on some things in private but it feels really sexy. In fact one of the things that makes me think I'm trans the most is a time when I was clothes shopping and feeling a deep longing to try on the girls clothes. The feeling was so intense I had to leave the shop and sit outside for a bit to calm down.

I'm not sure I like the idea of being seeing as a girl in my day to day life, either by people I know or strangers. However I'm quite attracted to the idea of being someones gf, (mostly a guys gf, despite not finding men attractive weirdly). I suppose it could be possible that my internal shyness makes me nervous of being a girl in public. I get nervous wearing slightly unusal male clothes in public. 

I'm not sure this whole story is connecting very well. I feel like I'm connecting things which are unrelated, just writing this has made the idea of me being trans seem a bit silly. But I'd love to hear from people who are trans to find out if what I'm experiencing is common.

IrreleventPerson,asktransgender,[NSFW] I finally tried my Magic Wand,"Follow up to [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5i07e9/damn_you_rasktransgender/)

I received it yesterday, and today I had the place for myself for a few hours, and I was very curious about how awesome it was.

And I'm not disappointed.

That was probably the most satisfying orgasm of a lifetime for me, like, I'm never gonna masturbate with my hand(s) again. And unlike using my hands, I actually experiences something that wasnt just inside my crotch area, and it was AWESOME!

However, I have two concerns:

1. That thing vibrates FAST, I actually hurt my glans with it and had to resolve to applying it on the top of the shaft and on the skin, did I use it wrong?

2. I'm concerned about the alimentation cable, if I try to push it down toward the Magic Wand, it actually lowers about half a centimeter into it and usually that scares me a lot, is it normal? If the cable actually breaks, am I stuck with an unusable magic wand?

Thanks for convincing me to buy this wonder, btw &lt;3

suomynonA_,asktransgender,"I'm so freaking confused ahhhh, I don't know anymore maybe","So yeah, like title says, I just don't know anymore. I feel confused, messed up, depressed and I just don't know. Ever since I was 8-9 I wanted to be a girl. The thought just felt right. The most vivid memory was when I saw a shooting star, me being 9 and gullible, wished I wanted to be a girl, a thought that has stayed ever since then. Around the same time, maybe a bit earlier, I used to fantasize about this weird ""scientific experiment"" in which I happened to be the test subject, this experiment had the ""unfortunate"" effect of me being transformed into a girl. I fantasizes about this in the evening, in bed... puberty hasn't started yet but you get the idea. I told this to my parents once, I think it was due to the talk. They asked me if I felt like a girl. I didn't really knew what it all meant at the time, I wanted to be one but I didn't necessarily feel like one. I said no. A few months later I found myself home alone. There weren't any intruders but there was a closet and female clothing. One thing led to the other and I started wearing female clothing when nobody was home. First just for a few minutes and maybe for ""extra realism"" to my weird fantasies, though more recently for 30-60 minutes just wearing skinny jeans, dress or skirt with a cute shirt. Add a bra with socks and it's as close as I can get now... of course the experiment fantasy has been changed for the I already am a girl and I'm having sex. Which even in the experiment was often a theme.




In the last 2-4 years, don't know an exact date, I started thinking about transgenderism. I heard of it before and always felt I guess a bit awkward maybe even a bit scared (I think mostly due to me cross dressing afraid that people will find out.) but also intrigued. I never really has much time to think about it due to depression, some backstabbing friends and 2 burn outs. But a few years ago, it popped into my head. Did I want to be a girl. A question that's bothering me for some time now. But if giving that hypothetical scenario with the button, I think 95% of the time I would say yes, I do want to be a girl, I want to wear cute clothes, have boobs, vagina and long hair.  Even when I still was horribly depressed I thought to myself that life would be easier if I was girl. Maybe a little naive but at that time. I saw me being depressed and wanting it all to end, and the girl being relatively happy. I can't put that thought out of my mind, what if it's just me thinking my life would be easier. What if that where to be a unconscious thought which has me writing this as a direct consequence and when my life gets better and I'm not depressed anymore, knowing that these feelings of wanting to be a female were in fact related to a deeper unconscious thought. Though if I'm going to be rational about this how would I explain my thought before I got depressed? So stop making excuses...




While I do want to be a female, my life is just a lot better now. I've friends again, things are going to be better moving forward, I just don't want to loose my friends and the progress I've made once more. I've lost my first group of friends due to one backstabbing and ridiculing me in front of 600 people. I was split apart from my second group due to my school assigning a different lunch place for them all except me and eventually me switching schools for the second time. And the friends I've now, even though I almost know for a fact that they won't care, I'm afraid of loosing everything. There are jus to many thing that might go wrong. What if I will never pass (which yeah I suppose would make a difference to me), what if it isn't what I thought it would be and in the end just realize this isn't what I wanted. What if my school, family or friends, due to what ever weird circumstance, would accept it and I would, yet again be alone.


My grandma would have the most interesting reaction though, when I was telling her about lucid dreaming, she thought I was taking drugs. Imagine telling her you want to be a girl...


I don't know what to do, especially since the trans/dysphoria thought come in waves. Months of almost complete obsession and months of the thoughts being a bit dormant, still there just, and even then I would totally press the magical button, in fact can someone pass me one?




I don't know if I'm ready for HRT, if I'm ready to be looked down upon in the streets. Well when I actually go outside. I don't even know what to do, what I truly feel and if I can even get myself to tell someone about this. I don't have a psychologist I don't know what to do. If I really want to be a girl if I really want to go to all the trouble, if after all it wouldn't be better to just don't do it. To just live life, trying to solve my depression, focus on getting my high school diploma and go to uni. But then again the longer I wait, I'm afraid, the results will be worse. There is just so much confusion and ahhh I don't know.... yeah I just don't know what to do. How to do it. I'm just lost. I'm 17 years old and live in the Netherlands if that's any help. I don't even know the question I'm asking, just ahhhh I don't know things anymore. I'm sorry for this terribly long rant. Just yeah I don't know anymore."

So I'm pretty sure I'm trans. I'm not sure when I'll transition yet, but I've been in such a giddy state of mind today after coming out to my closest (and most supportive) friends. And I can't help but think about what name I'd like to go by once I do transition.

See, the thing is, I have a tricky, very unusual name, and it's one I've grown to love very much. My name is Beckett. My issue with my current name is that I feel like it's a bit masculine, if anything, and I'm having trouble coming up with something equally as unique but also feminine. The best I've thought of is Petra, but I'm not sure if that works.

GloryToHelm,asktransgender,Has anyone pre-SRS or POST-SRS been diagnosed with Pseudotumor Cerebri?,"I had SRS back on Nov 18th and the symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri (increased pressure in the brain with no apparent cause *hence Pseudo* which has led to intense nonstop headaches and pressured on my optic nerves which has caused distorted vision *with my glasses on I have 20/100 vision*) appeared on December 3rd and have persisted since. The biggest forms of pain relief have been spinal taps to drain excess spinal fluid *this has been done twice between December 9th and 14th* to help with the pain relief that not even Tramadol or Percocet can help with. I've been put on Diamax at 1Kmg twice a day as a diuretic to help with excess fluid. I've lost 25 pounds since Nov 18th in an effort to also help (weight loss is the #1 way to help combat this condition). I've seen a neurologists and two different ophthalmologists, I see a neuro-ophthalmologist Tuesday that was referred to me by my neurologist who has more advanced knowledge. I've been to every doctor and even flew back to my surgeon that did the SRS for a in person visit to see if they had any insight. I've pulled every single thing myself and my family can think of to get this under control. I'm hoping that perhaps Tuesday with that advanced doctor I might find a answer or be on the path to a better answer.

But I wanted to ask here if anyone ever encountered this during their time during transition, pre-SRS or post-SRS? I've searched online and played Dr. Google, but I'm not really comfortable doing that. Regardless, I have seen that hormone therapy has caused complications that have led to pseudutumor cerebri diagnosis, but even after cutting back on hormones and stopping all together (I have plans to revisit my doctor that prescribes my hormones, but she is booked till feb 2017... I am working with my provider of doctors and general practitioner to 'push that appointment up based on an emergent basis').

While I am under the care of four doctors right now, I find their lack of imagination to deliver results disappointing right now. It's been  14-15 days and my quality of life has fallen apart. I can't keep up with my dilation schedule and will probably have to look into, if possible, longer dilation schedules OR surgery to just increase the depth of my neo-vagina because I do not have the energy, willpower, or time as I manage my more emergent health crisis (like not going blind).

It's finally happening. In a very real 'I can finally transition and may be starting hormones in the next month or so' way. After eight years.

Annnd here I am for the first time having cold feet. Just complete wanting to back out and run. Suddenly even male pronouns don't feel right anymore. Transition feels like giving in instead of fighting for me for the first time. 

That's fucked up and it's terrifying to me. I've wanted this for so damn long. Why now? 

Suddenly I'm sitting here going 'yup, totes just some butch gender-non-conforming lady and fuck society and my family' 

I feel so betrayed. The thought of staying as I am is both weirdly revealing and terrifying and wrong but...not.
I don't know what to do. I've never wanted NOT to transition before.

CelestialKurse,asktransgender,"Transition Update: I'm not doing well, am I?","When I first started transitioning I had a lot of determination. Here I am, almost a year since I started HRT and I have no clue what I am doing anymore. I'm confused, and just have so much going on in life.

I find myself less and less pleased with my appearance. My weight has came back, went from 168 to 202. I no longer have the job that made it so easy for me to transition and I wasn't even fired. I just quit and I don't know why. It's like nothing I can do makes me happy.

I find myself doubting my actions. They say doubt is normal, but why is it always there? I feel deep in my heart and soul that this is who I am supposed to be, but still I doubt myself. So many whats and so many ifs. 

And now I'm on here writing because I find it easier to express how I feel here rather than telling the people who care about me. I feel like none of them understand.

I know I have strayed off my designated path. I had it all lined out for me. But it is not turning out the way I had planned. I can't blame anyone but myself and I know the only answer is to better myself but I'm so tired. I'm mentally drained. 

I still have very little breast growth. I know I'm only a year but it still bugs me. Had over 13 laser hair removal treatments, still facial hair. My voice training slipped after I quit my job, now my voice doesn't sound right.

Even then I don't get bothered too much by it. The furthest extent of my dysphoria typically is just hating facial/body hair, and although before I would've probably flipped at anyone who called me by my old name, now it hardly bothers me.  
While I'm sure being almost universally supported helps, I'm not sure if I should be really concerned about it, or if it's a good thing that being trans isn't really a big inconvenience to my typical day.

TL;DR: I hardly experience any dysphoria or any of those sorts of feelings. Is this a bad thing? (Also, if this was super messy or anything, it's my first post, so I apologize)"

Everyone's being great about it, and that combined with the comfort of having only recently graduated from 'I feel like I have gender dysphoria' to 'I'm transgender' has me feeling pretty great right about now.

However, whilst she was accepting and very clearly just wants me to be happy... My mum was also noticeably really worried about how I'm holding up with it all. I've very noticeably been down at times over the holidays with all the things that can happen then and set the dysphoria off. Plus, me being super nervous whilst coming out after and being awful at explaining it all probably didn't reassure her too much.

Being open and well received along with the prospect of starting HRT next year makes me crazy happy though, and I'm hoping her eventually seeing that will be enough to waylay her concern in the future. But I'm travelling back to uni in a few days, so as for the short term...  Is there anything that people would recommend me doing that might help make her a bit more comfortable with it in the meantime? Or any particularly good resources that might help educate her on it a little? (Seems like she's had very little exposure to trans concepts as a whole).

Yo, 31 MtF pre-everything, hopefully not too naive of a question, iam looking for an EU country / facility (with somewhat english speaking staff i guess) with a smooth Informed Consent access to HRT for a MtF individual who has no official history and wants to stay in full guy-mode during HRT until much later (until post FFS and decent HRT time etc).


what i ideally expect from the facility in such country is to just tell the HRT gatekeeper my story, have a nice consultation and then sign the consent, pay and schedule the HRT procedures. 


Im literally only interested in the smooth HRT access and its quality there, its the only purpose of moving there for now, so you dont need to consider any other factors if you have some country and facility recommendations, but it needs to be in the EU. i can pay everything on my own, so no need for insurance if that affects anything in the hrt process there. i also will not need to study or get a job there, i have my own solo online business and will stay in guy-mode when i need to go outside, so the people and general acceptance doesnt matter, i live online until my girl mode is ready.

BetaPop,asktransgender,Transitioning and growing up.,"Hey y'all.  I was just thinking about something and I thought I'd ask you all your opinion. 
 I transitioned in my early 20s. I was extremely immature for my age and had been pretty much a hermit my entire life before transitioning. I was a virgin. I had never had a relationship or even been to a nightclub or anything. Didn't have a career. I was just a musician in my basement. For me, along with the biological change of transitioning it was also very much about growing up in general. Knocking down the walls I had built for myself and learning to just be myself. That, along with actually being able to interact with people and feel things facilitated a maturity that I had not experienced at all before.

My question is this, for people who transitioned older than me, People who had a life before transitioning. Does my experience resonate with you at all? Did you feel like transitioning was sort of about growing up as well? Even though you had already been an adult for a long time? Thanks."

The Belgium FFS specialist Bart Van De Ven has launched a new initiative which is looking for Ambassadors.


The ""Foundation for the Promotion of Understanding of Transwomen"" will work towards a wider public understanding of issues faced by transgender women.
Especially in the work space or finding work environment. 

These Ambassadors should be prepared to share their experiences with possible employers, public bodies and other groups. 

The foundation will assist by providing a online resource centre for information about all kinds of trans-related issues.


Transgender people can request assistance from these Ambassadors in explaining the situation to their employer.  
Employers / groups can request the Ambassadors as a speaker or advisor when it comes to integrating transgender people into their workspace.

Funding for this foundation will be done through donors and Dr. Van de Ven pledges €20k funding to this foundation every year.


So I really like this initiative, because so many transpeople both coming out and looking for work have some sort of issue with their employer. Having support and a place to find information and advice, or someone that can come and talk about the subject on our behalf with former experience is really valuable.

I hope this takes off and can grow to protect and assist trans people all over the world. I too hope that they realize trans-men are y'know a thing that exist and not some mythical fairytale and include them too in this project.

jwoodward48r,asktransgender,"My dad's a TERF :( and I'm almost convinced, send help","***EDIT:*** I talked with my dad. More at the bottom.

(Through the computer that is, heh.)

I figured out that I was trans. It was rather obvious, really, but I kept denying it and forgetting about it and insisting that I was agender. I came out to my mom, and then later discussed things with her while quite distraught. Apparently my dad was also in the room, so I accidentally came out to him before I was ready.

I was a bit nervous, but it was fine at first. I mean, I came out to my family as biromantic (probably asexual) and it was fine. (He did talk to me about the dangers of putting too much meaning on my orientation, and advising that I not make my orientation a significant part of my identity; and also not to ignore attraction/fabricate attraction in order to line up with my identified orientation.)

He gave me some sociological and feminist books on sexuality and gender, like *Gender Trouble*. I read them. (Man, is that book *packed* with information. Such dense sentences!) I asked him some questions about terms and concepts, we were happily discussing the discursive and judicial construction of a ""subject before the law,"" and everything was good.

But then we started talking about transgender stuff, and he made the following points (he said them nicer, I just boiled them down):

* Transgender people hate themselves.

* They should learn to accept their body.

* Dysphoria is solely caused by society and gender roles. It does not exist beyond these roles, and to transition is to accept those roles.

* If you are trans, that means that you're supporting the existing societal norms that resulted in your dysphoria.

* To trans women, the penis/male body represents toxic masculinity.

* Trans people are obsessed with their appearance.

* Take, for instance, Caitlyn Jenner - she's spent *so much money* on attaining her concept of the ideal ultrafeminine body.

* Transgender is like transrace.

* Women and men are the same, right?

* Trump can't see that. He thinks that there's a crucial difference between women and men. Do you want to be like Trump?

* Since gender is socially constructed, and you shouldn't consider it to be too important, why do you think you're trans? Doesn't ""transgender"" imply that there is something more, something real, to gender?

* You know your cousin? They're genderfluid. That's better, because it defies gender roles.

* Just be you. You don't need to change yourself to be somebody else.

* Remember your other cousin, the trans one? She's conforming to gender roles too much.

* I am disturbed by people, cis *or* trans, conforming to gender roles. But to be trans *implies* that you are conforming to gender roles.

* Gender is ephemeral. Why would you do something permanent to your body when your gender might change later?

* If you don't know what it means to be a ""boy"" or a ""girl"", how do you know which one you are?

But, at least:

* He doesn't use bigoted language! Nope, he sounds all accepting-like as he denies my identity and feelings.

* He's not *disgusted* by trans people.

* He supports trans people... in public at least.

But I know if I transition, he'll be disapproving. I love him, I look up to him, even if I disagree with him right now, and I don't want to lose my relationship with him. I don't want him to think that I'm obsessed with gender or appearance. What should I do?

I figured I would ask someone to use female pronouns, just to see which pronouns ""fit"" best, but hell no, not now. Unless he changes his mind, I'm waiting until I move out. I wouldn't be able to deal with his disapproval, not while I still live with him. Shit, Dad, *whyyyyy?*

Additionally, I'm ""losing faith"" in this whole gender and transitioning thing. Do I really need to be able to look at my body without being disturbed, shocked, and confused? The body isn't *me*, yunno. If I just stop looking at myself, that's the body dysphoria *mostly* gone. Figure out a way to never get an erection again, and that's almost all the dysphoria gone.

No, that wouldn't be healthy, right? I feel both physical and social dysphoria. (I think.) I am a *girl* in roughly 75% of my dreams! And it's either ""meh"" or ""that's better""! (Last night's nightmare excluded.) I passed the Button Test (actually sparked by [this skip](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-113)), all the online quizzes check out (useless though they are), and I'm interested in slightly feminine clothing.

And yet I'm *not* interested in hyperfemininity! I've always disliked *any* hypergendered stuff. I didn't dislike hypermasculinity because I preferred hyperfemininity, I disliked hypermasculinity because it was too hyper! I don't want to put on tons of makeup, I'm not concerned about whether I get surgery or not. I *do* want HRT, but that's a. less permanent at first, and b. a medical treatment that reduces dysphoria. In a *good* way, not a denial way!

But he just doesn't get it. He thinks that being a trans girl makes me *so concerned and obsessed* with gender and appearance. How can I convince him otherwise?

Edit: I just want to clarify a few things:

* He appears genuinely concerned for my health and well-being.

* I mention the ""I don't want hyperfemininity"" thing as part of my consternation; I don't want that, but he thinks that I do, because I am trans.

***EDIT:*** I talked with my dad. The discussion went fine at first; I misinterpreted him somewhat, it seems. But then he started talking about dysphoria:

* Don't let yourself get caught by the medical discourse, he said.

* Dysphoria is not real. It is the pathologization of difference, just like how homosexuality was pathologized.

* Thinking that your body is wrong = pathologization."
helzinia,asktransgender,How to deal with genital dysphoria after choosing to get circumcised?,"Hello /r/asktransgender, long time lurker first time poster. I've seen a lot of posts on here from people who have been circumcised lamenting that their parents made them undergo the procedure because of the loss of material for SRS, but I haven't seen many from people who chose to get circumcised later in life.


At the start of this year, I decided I was unhappy with having phimosis (a tightness of the foreskin, basically) and decided rather stupidly to go for the nuclear option: circumcision. A number of months later I realise I'm transgender and I am miserable for having gone through with it. Truth be told, my phimosis caused me no real significant issues and the main motivation behind my circumcision was... an unhappiness with how my genitals looked. Yeah, whoops.


Anyway, I'm finding it rather hard to forgive myself when I think of how my eventual SRS will never go as well as it could have, and how I'll have to deal with this for the rest of my life. I also have this weird thought that even if I meet a guy/girl during my transition that is okay with me having a penis, they'll be more turned off by it because I'm circumcised.


I guess all I'm looking for here is some advice. Is anyone else here in the same boat as me? Can you give me any kind of reassurance so I don't go to bed hating myself for my own decisions any more?

pinkchips,asktransgender,"This morning I realized happiness comes from two important internal events: truly accepting yourself, and then making an active decision to be happy.","And you may have to repeat these actions again and again.  But sometimes you gotta fake it until you make it.  
  
I don't think the second one is possible until you have actualized the first.  You must discard the ego which tries to lie and tell you that you're important and have so much responsibility to others - you don't.  You are a small cell in a vast global organism now, and this global brain of connected humans can't use you if you are trapped in a prison of your own creation.  
  
As long as your choice about who you are doesn't directly and actively harm someone else (and being trans will never fall in this category) you can just accept yourself.  It's actually a pretty simple diagnosis when it comes down to it, despite how complicated we sometimes try to make it: if you have deeply wanted to be the opposite sex for a long period of time, and do not like being your birth sex most of the time, you are trans.  There's no need to be afraid, or wonder.... just internally accept yourself.  Try it on for size.  You are still valid and loved by the world, even if a few bigots won't.  You are what you are, and still an amazing and beautiful creature.  You don't have to transition the moment you accept yourself as trans, though perhaps that then could become an option.  And if you are trans, nothing made you this way.  This is simply who you have always been, and you are amazing for it.  
  
Even throughout transition, and into the years that follow you may need to repeat this mental act of acceptance.  Consider all the vast numbers of humans out there, in every shape, color, and size.  None of us individually are important, but together all of us are.  You are loved, and a valid human being, *and* happen to be transgender.  That's just how humans are born sometimes; Biology is necessarily messy.  
  
--------   
  
That brought me to my next realization, which admittedly has been influenced by a lot of what I've read on Reddit: actively deciding to be happy.  
  
Happiness really is an attitude that you decide to confront the world with.  It's not a lottery ticket that you finally win.  It's not a state of being you'll reach once you finally transition or if you had ""just been born cis"".  It's an active decision you have to make, and I know it can be incredibly hard sometimes.  It also can be hard to accept that's really all there is... happiness too often seems like some fleeting dream others have that we don't.  But I assure you, those people are just working their asses off to project happiness; it just so happens that some of what they are projecting is reflecting back onto them.  
  
There are wealthy and beautiful cis people out there who are absolutely miserable.  They are like that because they have made a decision to focus on the negative things around them (and inside them) and present that attitude to the world: a woe-is-me, ""I can't believe this happened to me"", my life is awful attitude.  This is despite having a life most others dream of.  And at the same time there is a poor family in some distant island right now that is genuinely happy.  They are grateful for the little bit of fish on their table, and the recent rain.  They are looking forward to an event they are planning.  They could also be wallowing in their misery, but they have made an active decision to be happy and bring each other up.  
  
As someone who is trans, we will have a lifetime of negative things to be sad about.  Most people honestly won't understand the depths of our struggles and pain.  Of almost any demographic in the world, we have the most valid reasons to be hurt and check out.  And some people do.... they manage to admit they are trans, and then spend their remaining years hating themselves anyway, and obsess over things they can't control, and decide to take the very real problems in their life and surround themselves with them like a blanket.  The problems might be very real, but it is our decision to focus on them and allow them to paralyze us that is the root cause of our misery.  

We only get this one life.  The better choice is make an active decision to be happy, even though it can be extraordinarily difficult sometimes.  We might be facing seeming impossible challenges, but we must focus on the good things we have (however small) and try to form specific and practical steps to improve our life further.  You want the you-of-tomorrow to wake up to a better life than you have now, right?  This is the continuum of our life: we are every day passing down a new reality to the 'us' of tomorrow.  In a single sentence: Happiness is deciding to be thankful for the decisions of the past you, accepting the circumstances of your birth, and forgiving the past you for all your mistakes - and then lifting others around you up while you take practical steps to make sure future-you has a better life tomorrow.  
  
And sure, there's a lot of giving in that sentence.  Because happiness is derived from giving.  Giving a positive attitude to the world, even when they don't deserve it.  Lifting others up and making them feel good and important about themselves even though you don't owe them anything.  And (this next bit is important) giving *yourself* love, acceptance, and a better life, even if you feel *you* don't deserve it.  
  
I love all of you so much.  I can understand how difficult some of you have it.  Many are living in bodies you are unsatisfied with and lives that seem determined to put you down.  You endure hatred and intolerance regularly.  Some of you desperately want to transition but can't.  Or maybe you are transitioning and feel like you'll never be good enough.  
  
Don't let those things drown you.  Accept and love yourself.  Know that you are looking out for you, and you are going to take positive steps each day to make your life better than it was before.  Encourage and lift up everyone you meet, even those horrible and awful people who seem to just want to make you miserable.  Those people are hurting too, in their own ways.  Just do your best to actively surround yourself with positive souls, and be that bright shining prince or princess to everyone you meet.  
  
The universe will inevitably take notice.  
  
You are valid.  You are loved.  Most importantly, *you* love you, and are going to take care of that boy or girl inside of you that is hurting so bad.  Everything about you is already internally perfect, and even if you can't see it yet, you are on a brilliant and magical path.  The you of the future is looking back on yourself now and remembering all your struggles, and hugging you with a promise that even though it's tough now, you won't believe the amazing good times that are on the way.

stardropTabletop,asktransgender,What do I do about the name and gender on my grad school application?,"Okay, so I'm currently applying to this one grad school program, and I'm not sure how I should fill out the parts of the application concerning name and gender. See, the thing is, I'm currently in the process of changing my name and gender marker, and I will likely be done with the bulk of this whole process by March (at the very latest). What's more, all of the professors who provided letters of recommendation all refer to me as Naomi and use she/her/hers when they refer to me.

However, at this moment, my name and gender marker are not legally changed, and I am stuck with my old name and a big ol' ""M"" on my official transcript because of that. Also, while there is a field for ""preferred name"" on the application that I'm filling out, there is no way to opt out of disclosing your gender, and the application requires you to pick between male and female. I'm assuming that this means I'll have to apply under my old name and as a male student, and both of those facts really hurt, even if I do get to provide a ""preferred name."" 

Is there any way around this? Would I get in trouble for using Naomi as my first/given name, selecting ""female"" as my gender and not disclosing my birth name? I don't know, the idea of me having to apply as a guy with a male name just so I can immediately undergo a bunch of legal red tape to change that with the school feels really, really ridiculous."
LisaLies,asktransgender,A message for people wondering why they didn't come out earlier.,"In order to come out, or even to consider questioning your gender, a set of criteria needs to be met. One of those criteria is your own wellbeing, one of those criteria used to also be whether or not you'd be able to pass. 

Within the last five years, the movement has grown a lot. We're no longer reliant on doctors to verify our identity, we have informed consent, and we are much happier coming out earlier in our transition, and ending our transition when we're comfortable, not when a doctor says it's done. 

I work with a number of trans women, and I've met women who transitioned as recently as 10 years ago tell me stories of having to choose between deep stealth or the closet. There was no other option, or if there was it was hell. 

You came out when you had to come out, when it was safe to come out. Coming out wasn't an option for you in the past."
Gracie_Lily,asktransgender,Advice on waiting?,"
(1st para is an intro) 
So basically I've at least understood that I'm trans and I want to transition. There are still issues such as my own transphobia and being scared etc etc, stuff I can figure out on my own for the most part. I'm 18yo which I'm hoping still means I'm growing so the hormones will have a good effect. I'm at school still for a few more months and planning to start hormones in last month of the school year (during exams) as I feel like that's earliest I can start without people noticing. My parents don't know but I'm planning on telling them soon. 

Sorry for all that but basically I just want advice. My dysphoria is crippling at the moment and I want to know the best way to feminise myself and help my disphoria in the mean time. I've been doing certain exercises to help build a feminine figure but I have no idea what foods I should be eating. I also want to shave but I'm worried I'll get covered in razor burn so if anyone knows and good tips that'd be great. Also if anyone knows ways to help feminise my voice in preparation. Finally, I was wondering about how to come out to my parents, I was thinking about a letter but I was just curious how other people have came out. 
Many thanks x "

Any opinion is welcome, but please, leave the therapy option out of the table for now.
Let's make long story short with some bullet points:

- 30 year-old male.
- Introvert and with low self-esteem. Maybe Asperger.
- Bullied in school for playing with girls instead football. Called gay.
- Very few friends, all with superficial friendship.
- Virgin. No experience with any kind of relationship.
- Asexual and heteroromantic. Atracted to women but not in a sexual sense.
- Never into any kind of porn. Very prudish.
- Grossed out with sexual relationships, even traditional masturbation.
- Frustrated with my lack of social skills and incapability of having a romantic relationship.
- History of obsession and arousal with girl tights since 5 years old. Along years, it expanded to other female clothing (skirts, leotards, shorts...). Mostly envy of how they look and feel.
- Wearing my sister's tights in secret when I was alone as teenager.
- Shame of erections and of feeling this way towards tights.
- Wishing getting rid of the bulge of the crotch for better body shape with tights. Envy of how comfy should be having nothing between legs.
- Puberty started with wet dreams about wearing tights and/or not having external genitals
- Masturbation habits started accidentally at age 18 while tucking with tights for the first time. Only masturbate this way since then.
- Persistent fixation over girls covered legs when they come across. ""Urges activator""
- Periods of buy and purge. 
- Envy of vulva and female insider orgasm. However, I have zero attraction to breasts.
- I think I never had the feeling of being or wishing to be a woman. Only envy of body sensations and clothes.
- Little female behavior. Only crossing legs and some gesticulation.
- Nerdy male hobbies and interests.

I think I don't leave anything unsaid. Sorry for any mistakes I had written, English is not my mother tongue. 

Thank you all in advance, you're a great community."
Zinoa71,asktransgender,Coming out at work pre hrt,"So I really need advice and I don't really have close trans friends I can ask this to.  I'm seriously considering coming out at work.  The thing is, I'm pre hrt, haven't had laser, and my voice needs work.  I want all of this stuff but I can't right now for various reasons.  Even though these things are things I want and things I'm going to do, I don't need then to be a woman.  But it still really bothers me not having done them before I tell people.  I guess what I'm worried about is passing, but I think the deeper part is that I don't feel like a woman yet, at least not all the time, even though I know I am one.  And that scares me when considering going FT at work.  But then again, I need to start living this to really feel it right?  So that's an argument for just doing it. I'm decent with make up, but it never hides all of the shadow.  I have somewhat of a wardrobe, enough to get through a work week. Does anyone have any advice for my situation or any experience with something similar?  I'm kinda freaking out since I've already told hr and some close coworkers.  The general consensus from them is that everyone will be supportive regardless."
TrueHOAS,asktransgender,Why do I have to have feelings?,"I am 16 and I started going outside as a girl just recently but my view on guys just changed so drastically, I mean they thought I was one of them and so we treated eachother like that but now they just are more distant, I treat them differently and they treat me differently. And I really don't know why and this maybe sounds weird but I really just ache for someone to cuddle with me and take care of me, I want to look good and impress the boys, plus I even think I have a crush on a guy that I know.


But then I realize I am trans and there will be quite a few problems with all that. My body will never attract any men except for some really rare guys that seek transgirls but they often just want that what they see in shemale porn. I have nothing that a guy would like, I mean I am really thin, taller than the average guys and have broad shoulders and have no real breasts, no hips, my thighs are really thin which give me a really wide thigh gap and I have a really tiny flat butt, not forgetting my thing down there. I don't expect hormones to change my height and lower body into something like [this](http://g01.a.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1aciiKFXXXXXGXXXXq6xXFXXXy/Free-shipping-24-X35-inch-Female-Star-Sexy-Girl-Poster-216-Beer-snow-ass-hips-sexy.jpg) so fuck me.

Basically, I was thinking of trying to do the former surgery for the time being and then trying to figure out whether it is actually worth it for me to do the latter surgery.

I've always had some desire to be female, and crossdressing, at one point I really wanted to try drag. But I never did.

m3dicore,asktransgender,A letter coming out to my parents,"Hello everybody,

This forum has been very helpful to me in the past few days. It has helped me determine  what I must do if I ever want to be a woman.

I decided to tell my parents in the form of a letter. The following is the rough draft of this letter. I was hoping you guys could offer suggestions for it:

Mom and Dad, 
The reason I write to you in this way is to tell you something very important that I struggle to put into words to this day. I want to give you private time to gestate this before we have a face-to-face conversation, preferably one at a time. It is a problem that has caused me a lot of anxiety and stress and kept me from being myself. I want you to read this whole thing because each detail is important in my transfer of this message. I will not withhold this from you any longer, I believe that I may be transgender. I say ‘believe’ because it is one of the most difficult questions I’ve ever had to ask myself. It is a question I still do not truly have an answer to. 

Earlier, in 2016, you had offered me a therapist to negotiate some issues I have been having with family, I would like to now make the same gesture to you. This way I may sort out and find my answers. I am afraid that introspection and research cannot get me any further.

I want you to read this as many times as needed and think about me and the way I am. I don’t want to make a huge deal out of this and turn it into some huge major issue. I want to get through this as quickly and painlessly as possible. I know this situation is uncomfortable. Believe me, this is hard for me to. I have had feelings like this for a long time and the past month or so I have been doing my research and trying to figure this out because I began questioning. I have searched the internet, talked with people online and looked at how I’ve felt and acted in the past as well as doing some recent introspection.

I don’t have all the answers and I would like to talk to a therapist before doing anything else, way my options and then decide. Please, do not worry for me. I want you to be okay with this. Who knows, it might not even be a thing.

But, I've been pretty solidified in me being a trans girl until very recently so I'm worried about talking with my endo about lowering my dose.

Do you think he could potentially take it as a red flag? I'm worried that he'll want me to talk to my therapist first but she's away until mid-February, at the earliest. I don't see my endo for another month or so, so I'll be able to consider my feelings until then. But, should I be prepared to have him take me off hormones? He seems very trans-friendly and I think supporting trans kids is a major reason he opened his clinic in our small city so I doubt he'd react negatively. 

Any advice would be appreciated! If there's anyone else whose struggled with maintaining a consistent identity or maybe even ""detransitioned"", I'd also appreciate advice from them. Thanks!!"

PanTran420,asktransgender,I just made my first appointment toward getting HRT! I have some questions regarding HRT and sperm banking as well.,"I should have my letter next week, and after I get back from my post-Christmas family time, I'll be starting the process of getting HRT! My appointment is January 16th. I'm pretty damn excited!

On to my sperm banking questions:

* How many samples do people typically store?
* Can I continue to store a few samples after starting HRT?
* How hard would it be to start HRT now, and go off and try to bank sperm later, prior to getting an orchie?
* Were I to wait until later, how long would I need to stop HRT to be able to produce a viable sample?


I'm still torn on sperm banking. I'd like to possibly have biological children someday, especially if I end up with a cis woman. However, I've been thinking I might not end up with a cis woman lately, so who knows. My biggest concern is the cost. I want to get started on HRT before the end of February if I can, and I'm afraid it will be tough to afford to bank enough sperm. I've thought about getting a credit card to pay for it, or asking my parents for a loan, but I don't know.

Shockingpink13,asktransgender,I Feel Out of Place at Trams Meetups,"When I am at trans meetups, I feel like I have no business being there.  These meetings consist of mostly older folks and they are all much farther along in the process than I am (pre homones).  It's just that when they are talking about things like name change (which is all they talked about today) and where to have surgeries and what doctors are best for surgery, I can't really contribute to the concerversation.  Really, all I can do is sit back while the older people talk most of the time.  This is the only supper group near me, and it makes me sad that I feel left out.  I feel like I have no one to talk to about my feelings except for the few friends who have stuck around and this website.

I would love to hear your thoughts

TheLovelyLorelei,asktransgender,"Getting through TSA without a ""sensitive area pat down"" (MtF)","So I fly a lot, and every time the body scanner shows an alarm and I am given a ""sensitive area patdown"" or a ""check for groin abnormality"" which I am deeply uncomfortable with.

Does anyone have experience with this? Is there anything I can do to not have to go through this every time? 

I hoped telling the tsa agent that I was trans would explain the issue but all that did is lead to her calling her supervisor to ask if I needed to be pat down by a man or woman, and a five minute discussion involving 4 agents about what to do when ""he's a girl"". 

Please tell me there is some way to avoid this! Thanks. "

Plus he and his side of the family is catholic, and my mom's said to me that they hate gays, so it's almost safe to say they feel the same about trans people also...    
    
My sister... I don't think she would understand the concept of transgenderism. She's only 11 (12 in about 2 weeks) so i don't think she's really heard much about trans people or anything trans-related, if any

My college is great and very trans friendly, I'm in my dream course and can meet my partner quite regularly. Money isn't really a worry for me nor is most things really, I have a very cushy life. Being trans, this is pretty much as good as it gets start wise. 
But I just have no motivation. I do no work in college, skipped many lectures and even missed an exam cause I couldn't face going in for it. No study and essays mounted up from months ago. Meeting up with friends is a genuine struggle for me. All I want to do it lie in bed and watch Netflix or YouTube. Im still in councilling for now but I have nothing to say. I'll just message my friends, say ""I'm sad and useless cause I do nothing"" and await sympathy. This is my life in a nutshell. I hate it. But I also can't seem to change it.

thatonegirl555,asktransgender,My bf is not sure if he's trans and I need guidance,"Apologies in advance for the novel below. 

My boyfriend told me he thinks he maybe trans. I finally flat out asked him because I had a feeling he might be. He gave me an opening and I took it. I'm pretty sure he was wanting me to ask. I can't imagine carrying that burden. 

His answer was, ""Maybe."" 

We had the conversation over a messaging app since we currently live in other countries and I imagine it was easier for him to talk about in that manner. 

I'll preface this that I've been a lifelong champion of the LGBTQ+ community. I fully understand gender and sex are two different things. 

But I feel like my heart has been shattered. I'm madly in love with him and I don't believe that will ever change. (I'm using male pronouns until he says he's sure this is what he wants) But, I'm not attracted to women. I wish I was in this case. But just like he can't change who he is, I can't change who I am. 

I told him I would support whatever he wanted to do. I told him I would be there every step of the way if this is what he ultimately decided to do. I also had to be honest, I don't think the sexual side of our relationship would continue. It would evolve into something else but that part would likely cease. 

He said he wouldn't do it if that was the case. I told him, ""You can't make that decision based on me. You'll just end up resenting me. If that's what you are then that's what you are...and if you're happier being a woman then that's what you need to be. I'll still love you. That will never change. But I also can't change what I'm attracted to.""

Now he says he only wants to have the top surgery and possibly facial surgery...but not the bottom. He's adamant he doesn't want the bottom surgery and claims that he's ""probably not trans"" because of that.

I've been trying to convince him to talk to a therapist to address this and also address self-medicating with alcohol. I keep hitting a brick wall. He wants to have the surgeries without talking to anybody. 

I guess I'm asking for guidance. He seems unsure and I want to be there for him on this journey. But, I have a feeling I'm going to end up breaking his heart because I don't think I can continue our relationship in a physical sense. I wish I could but I can't. Which breaks my heart as well. I do love him more than anything.

All my doctor had for this was sleep hygiene tips but since those didn't help all the past years I tried I don't know what I should be doing. I go to bed a little after midnight though sometimes I get up about 4 AM, maybe because sometimes I take my second spironolactone almost midnight, since I hear you should try to take them as close to 12 hours apart as possible. When I sleep it's about 5 AM until 11 AM and sometimes I stay in bed for another couple hours wishing I could sleep more, lately I give up trying to sleep about 6 AM. I do all the normal stuff people recommend except getting up after 20 minutes because I've never slept in less than an hour and a half so I think if I did that I would just not sleep for a week straight and don't want to risk that, and getting off the computer hours before bed because all I have are a bed and a computer, but it feels like if I sleep is just up to a dice roll."

The more I further my transition,the more I have to drink and take whatever to feel alright. My main problem being bottom dysphoria that I can absolutely not deal with.
I went from xanax and a cocktail to half a bottle of vodka a night. Night is an understatement since I start drinking at 5pm. I go to therapy for this but I always relapse eventually. I'm on 5th day of sobriety after a recent relapse right now and I just can not.

At first I thought it was because I regretted my transition but no I don't,it's just that I feel like I can't have a normal life,I feel trapped so I use this to escape.
I am sick of having to tell people,I am sick of not being able to have sex,I can't look at myself naked. So I drink,and yes even when I drink I still can't do those things but I have a good time listening to some music or whatnot,while not thinking about it.

bashfultransboi,asktransgender,Dr. Yurdin broke my heart.,"Dr. Yurdin broke my heart.

I moved back to my home state in August from Texas, where I had started HRT. My home state sucks on account of not having many doctors who prescribe crossgender hormone therapy. After moving back, I couldn't find anyone to prescribe me further hormone treatment, so I ended up just running out of testosterone and stopping. I did eventually find something: my options were limited with where I live, so I could only try a clinic 45 minutes away, or a doctors office 2 hours away.

The choice sounds obvious, but how would you feel if I told you the closer option meant waiting 5 months to actually see someone? The clinic is, I believe, the only LGBT-specialized clinic in my state, so we shouldn't be surprised. The wait will always be that long.

So in September, I find Dr. Yurdin through a facebook page dedicated to helping trans youth in my state. I took a leap and scheduled an appointment with him. Then I had a car wreck the day before and had to reschedule, for a month later. I lost my car and my license. Then I find someone to give me a ride, but they change their mind about taking me literally 2 days prior to my new appointment time.

Finally, I reschedule again for December 2nd. I have a ride to get there. We get caught behind a funeral procession on the highway just outside the city, and I just know we're going to be late. I call 15 minutes ahead to inform them, and they say that If I'm more than 10 minutes late, I will not be allowed to see the doctor and will have to reschedule.

Wait, what? No one told me this before.

I go on to state that I am from out of town and have taken off work to make the 2 hour trip to see him, and that that wouldn't really work out. Rescheduling would mean waiting probably another month to see him. The nurse on the phone says that they make no exceptions.

Well, guess what. I'm ten minutes late. I tried to plead my case to the nurses at the desk, I explained that he was the only doctor within my reach who could provide the care and prescribe the medicines I needed, that I couldn't simply reschedule and that I needed to see him.

One of the nurses tells me that the doctor's running late and he's decided to go home early after he sees the appointment scheduled for 30 minutes before mine. I say I wouldn't mind waiting, if that's what was necessary. She said no, he won't be seeing me. I tried again to explain just how important it was for me to see him, and she said, ""That sucks. Guess you'll just have to reschedule."" 

I was in their office for no more than 5 minutes before they all turned back to the computers and by default dismissed me. I went outside and ended up dissolving into a crybaby mess (which would not have happened if I could have been on my hormones). Then 4 strangers going in for their appointments end up trying to comfort me, all the while misgendering me and calling me a poor little girl. I know they meant well, but it just cemented my dysphoria and escalated my stress about not seeing the doctor.

I felt like I'd just gotten to Oz to see the wizard, and he decided i wasn't good enough for his time.

My friends who drove me tried to help me enjoy the rest of the day but I was miserable. It's only been a few days since then, but I'm still miserable. Devastated.

It makes me feel weak to say it, but heartbroken, too.

After that experience, I would kill to be able to see anyone else but him. But the soonest the LGBT clinic could get me in was April as of today, even with the added doctors now on staff.

The man and the nurses who ripped my heart out and crushed my spirit in less than 5 minutes are my only option to get myself on track again. I was able to reschedule with them, but I'm still so sad. If it happened once, why wouldn't they do it again? People die every day, who's to say there won't be another funeral procession this time? Two, even?

I know that everyone's got issues in their lives and not every doctor can see every patient and not everyone deserves to be the exception to the rules. But I've been trying for months to get even 30 seconds of this man's time and spent my little hard earned money to pay my friends to drive me 2 hours to see him.

Wouldn't that add up to allowing an exception just that one time? Compassion is humbling yourself in order to help others, even though it inconveniences you. I understand that Dr. Yurdin was behind on appointments and wanted to go home and eat lunch, but come on! He couldn't even have the compassion to wait another half hour to eat so the kid from out of town could get some fucking medical help?

How is lacking compassion allowed in medicine? How is that not considered malpractice?

Clearly I am still torn up over this, so maybe I'm overreacting. But if you're in Iowa and you're considering Dr. Yurdin, don't. Don't unless you have no other choice. They really just don't give a shit about our lives, they just want to eat their lunch and go home."

anonblarg,asktransgender,Did you ever accidentally let slip you were trans before you planned to come out?,"Hey!

I seem to have lots of topics I am interested in starting this week ^ ^

My question today is pretty simple: before you came out, did you ever accidentally let slip to someone that you were trans, or say something that heavily hinted it? 

For example, I keep having to catch myself lately from saying things aloud like ""I wish I had a butt like her"" and stuff like that when I am relaxed watching TV with my parents and not thinking. A consequence of having it on my mind all the time I guess...

I also get silly thoughts that I should just say I am trans with no build up or plan, but when my brain is working correctly I know that's a bad idea, so I really need to keep those thoughts in line xD

This is obviously a bit worrying and I need to get it in check, as I really don't want to spill the beans until I have a therapists backing to help convince them!

So basically, did you ever let the truth slip accidentally, or have you come close to saying something but caught yourself?

Also, as a bit of a random tack on question, do you think it would be possible to start electro before coming out without giving away I'm trans? I have never had much or great facial hair (pure white and slow growing), so I could maybe justify it as getting rid of an annoyance seeing as I will never grow a beard anyway? Probably a bad idea though xD

As always I would love to hear from you all and I hope you are all enjoying yourselves this holiday season!

P.S. Sorry if I only reply to any comments quite late, I only come here at night when I am gareenteed not to have someone walk in and ask what I am so intensely typing away at xD"
RedactedInDarkness,asktransgender,Parents pushed me back into the closet.,"About two years ago I came out to my (conservative, Catholic, Trump supporting, bible thumping) parents after I tried to OD on a mix of Advil and xanax, at school. Administration said they weren't gonna baker act me because it was my first attempt (which isn't true, I had attempted 3 times previously and baker acted once, also does it matter? Statistics show that after one attempt if you don't receive treatment chances are you'll attempt again) and I was taken home (I actually came out at home, not school btw) this was senior year of high school. So they took it, at the time pretty well and were fairly calm, but then after two or three days it was as if it never happened and I was forced into therapy. When asked whether there were any gender issues I was about to say yes but my mother chimed in no and moved the therapist away from the subject, I also wasn't allowed to see the therapist alone, only at home never in her office so that I could never be alone and confide in her. (Note this was also my first therapist) and even when I had asked to have private sessions my parents said they wouldn't pay for private sessions. I got a job and almost moved out a few months ago but I got fired because I'm bi (it's legal in my state, couldn't fight it, parents also don't know I'm bi or they do, but again they pretend I'm cishet) I haven't smiled in years and can't remember what happiness feels like and I can't take it anymore, I honestly feel like killing myself just to get out of this hell. I have no idea what to do anymore."

SecretOfficerNeko,asktransgender,How to talk to parents who don't acknowledge research as legitimate?,"This is a big problem I've been having, and one that stands to ruin my relationship with my parents.

When I cam out to my parents they refused to allow me to show them any research, because they said ""anything you show us will be biased in your favor. As a result I didn't show them anything, and my coming out went so horribly that I didn't talk to them for almost half a year thereafter.

For a few months now we're back to talking, and they still don't want to see any resources or research. They quote their's at me all the time. In fact, its their entire basis of opposition to my transitioning. They say that it'll cause me to commit suicide, and I'll regret transitioning (despite the fact transitioning was the only thing that kept me from killing myself before; I've told her this recently). 

She gets her research from ""true sources"" such as anti-lgbt religious fundamentalists, and seems completely unswayed by any suggestion of resources. I've recently sent her a bunch of compendiums with several studies countering her claims that regret is common, and that parental acceptance doesn't matter. I've yet to receive a response.

Have any of you had parents like this, and if so how were you able to get past this roadblock and maintain a relationship with them...because right now it feels like I'm being stabbed over and over.

Chaojidage,asktransgender,"""But you never showed any signs of masculinity or femininity during childhood!""","To all the transgender people who think that they're any less of who they are because they didn't show signs of being transgender at an early age, this message is for you.

It's something I struggled with for a long time because I didn't fit into the ""typical"" transgender narrative; I wasn't very feminine as a child (or at least not as feminine as I wanted to be to believe that I was worthy of being female).

If you're like that, then I have to tell you that it's not your fault that you could never be who you want to be when you were younger. You were expected to act a certain way, and you were scared not to conform. Or maybe you didn't have siblings of the gender you wanted to be. All those transgender females who wore dresses when they were young had to get the dresses from *someone*, right?

It's hard to be transgender in this world, and if you never even knew about the wonders of HRT or surgery, you're not at fault for not wanting to transition when you were young. If you even remotely thought about wanting to be a boy or a girl when you were young, you probably just found that thought weird and dismissed it.

All these reasons account for why you may have never thought you were transgender when you were a child. The fact that you're even able to let yourself question your gender is a strong-enough indicator that you are who you think you are. Most cisgender people would actually find it disgusting or ridiculous to even question their gender.

There's no such thing as being *not trans enough*, and this is a wakeup call to all those who have been questioning and need to move on past that stage to accept their true selves. I wish you a smooth transition!"

I talked about this on r/lgbt and was suggested that I come over here and ask a little over a week ago and only got around to writing on here now.

Right now, I'm 20, in college studying Computer Science and biologically male. When I was little, I never really thought much about gender and always thought it was kinda superficial. As I got older, I decided I felt more Genderfluid with a heavy female lean and very recently, I think I've realized that the only reason I think I said that I was Genderfluid was because I was afraid to admit to even myself that I think I'm actually transgender. I've only disclosed this to a few online friends and after a few terrified days, managed to tell my girlfriend that I think I'm trans. She already knew that I had identified as Genderfluid, but when I told her that I think I'm trans and had told her that why I thought so, by explaining that I think I was just lying to myself when I was saying I was just Genderfluid because I was scared, she actually agreed with me and said she wasn't too surprised, even saying. ""I think I already knew."" To which I responded; ""I though so, but I just wanted to actually say it to you."" Anyway, I've only told her and a few friends that I know on Steam. No one else knows, and I'm not sure if I'm ready to tell anyone else. I'm certain that I can't tell my family. I don't think I'd like to have any surgery because surgery scares me..Though, I do have a lot of bottom dysphoria..I think I'd like to wait for the procedure to evolve. I think I would like to start HRT when it'd be safe for me to do so, (Ie, When I'm not dependent on my family, I don't want to run the risk of being cast away.) but I don't really know how I would even do that when able..I also think I'd like to talk to my girlfriend about it, but I don't really know what to even talk about with it. I think she would still support me, I don't think it would bother her if I had surgery or HRT as long as I was happy. I know she was with a cis girl before she was with me. Anyway, right now I feel as though I might not even start it even if it were safe for me to do so because..I'm terrified, really. In private and public where people don't know me I want to be seen as a girl with breasts and a more feminine or at least androgynous face and voice, but where people do know me I'm too scared to really express myself. I don't really know what to do, and I'm not really sure what to ask so I thought I'd just type what's on my mind and hope that some soul would know what to say. Thank you for reading."

Clarine87,asktransgender,"Anti-Androgens are not ""blockers""; transgender vernacular question.","**Long title:** [Typical] **Anti-Androgens** [Such as Spironolactone or Cyproterone] **are not ""blockers""** [when prescribed with cross sex replacement estrogen/testosterone]**; transgender vernacular question.**

Hi, over the last month I've seen an increasing number of people asking ""did you get blockers with your HRT (Testosterone/Estrogen)?"" 

However, it has always been my understanding that the usage of the ~~jargon~~ colloquialism ""blockers"" refers exclusively to medications taken to prevent/stall/stop a person's natural puberty. Such as the GnRH groups.

Am I wrong? If not, how is it best to correct these people.

EDIT:
Switched jargon with colloquialism.

EDIT2:

To clarify, I don't think it matters when someone is speaking in the context of HRT, but I feel that an unclassified ""blockers"" defaults to mean puberty preventing medications and not those taken typically with E or T HRT."

AK-81,asktransgender,What Lesbian dating Has Been Like for a Transgender Woman (please share feedback),"Hi everyone.  I've been told I should try posting my story to this board and maybe I would get more responses.  I still don't have a fully solid answer.
.
I've also been told that the original thread was just too long.  You can see the original here: https://senseandwellness.wordpress.com/2016/11/13/what-lesbian-dating-has-been-like-for-a-transgender-woman/ (complete with pics and better formatting, so it's easy to read).
.
Here's the shorter version of the post copy-pasted.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.
My reason for posting this is to gather information and feedback, and learn what I can so I can improve the situations I’ve been facing, in regards to dating.  While support and understanding are nice, and it’s undeniable that explaining my experience will most likely also be therapeutic in a way, what I’m hoping for here is guidance.  Ultimately, right now, I am totally and completely at a loss, and it seems the more research I put into this issue, the more lost I get.  I’m not able to reconcile the vast differences between my experience and everyone else’s, and my effort to find answers seems to be worsening this discrepancy, rather than improving it.

.
As said in the title, I’m a male-to-female (MtF) transgender woman, and I’m also lesbian.  I’ve been living full time as a woman almost exactly 3 years to this day.  In that time, my life has been almost completely devoid of any intimacy, and it certainly isn’t for lack of trying.  Over the years, I’ve repeatedly tried, and failed, to get anything beyond a second date, much less a girlfriend or a steady partner.  I’ve certainly never gone as far as kissing.


**Shots at Online Dating**

.
At one time I had around 5 dating profiles, including OKCupid, Plenty of Fish, Craigslist ads, and a few others.  For OKCupid and Plenty of Fish in particular, in all, I probably sent out over a thousand messages, and only ever received a handful of replies.  I would need to send out 50 or 60 before I got even one response.  I tried dozens of profile rewrites, and watched instructional guides on how to write a profile, but nothing changed.  I did mange to get around 15 or so dates.  Of these, 6 of them – consecutively – failed to show up.

.
Moreover, I have lots of straight friends, guy friends, friends at work, and I’m the woman people often come to when they need advice.  That makes this puzzle all the more frustrating to solve, as I honestly can’t figure it out.

.
To deal with most dates not showing up, and the dates that do show up being so extremely withdrawn, I decided to stop trying that method, and went on meetups.com instead.  This allows you to find social meetups all around the city where you live.  That way, I know for certain that people are definitely going to show up, and there’s a better chance of meeting someone.  It just seems like a more efficient method.  But this hasn’t worked either.

.
At any given lesbian meetup, I’ll speak to someone for 2 minutes (often times less than a minute), and they seem to get scared off.  Admittedly I’ve only gotten feedback a few times, but from what I’ve been told, I’m somehow “overwhelming” and “intimidating”.  I put those in quotation marks because I can’t for the life of me see how I’m either of those things.  Here’s a little about myself and my background.


**About Myself**

.
I specialized in biomechanics for 10 years, nutrition science for 6 years, and spent several years in Malaysia teaching those subjects. I wrote a few books on those fields which were also used in teaching classes. I switched careers for a short time and became a marketing executive, as I mentioned, for a few different companies. I decided to come back to America about 5 years ago, and I landed in Portland. I now work as a mental health specialist for people with mental disabilities, and teach classes dealing with basic psychology.

.
I *love* studying philosophy on my free time! I’ve recently spent a lot of time with existentialism, and wrote a few simple introductory guides on the subject. Epistemology is another favorite of mine, including pessimistic induction. I also do a lot of other research on social issues. In 2015, I wrote a book on feminist theory.  I decided to upload it online for free, as I have no intention of selling it.  I just found the subject enlightening, and others can have a look if they want.

.
I like writing articles on modern day issues through the lens of questioning existence, facts, and knowledge. I simply love challenging ideas, having my ideas challenged, and learning new things. I also like learning new things in general, whether it’s academia from Cornell University’s website, or channels like Vsauce or Sci-Show. I sometimes write responses to such things, and I love having deep discussions.

.
However, I can’t say any of that, because every part of it, from what I’ve gathered, comes off as “intimidating”.  Nearly everything listed there seems to be an insta-kill for any conversation I’m having with a woman.  There are times when I can even see their facial expression and body language change as I talk – they start leaning back, arm are crossed, expression changes, and then they find someone else they want to go talk to just moments later.  I’ve even had women get up and leave the table mid-sentence.

.
But… what else can I say?  I don’t watch TV.  I stopped watching a long time ago because trash-TV became so popular.  I’ve never drank alcohol, never smoked, and never used… and I’ve found mentioning any of these things *also* nearly always elicits a negative response (like clean and sober is a bad thing).  I’ve learned one thing I absolutely should not ever mention are my fitness accomplishments.  I don’t include sugar in my diet, and eat mostly whole foods (spinach, kale, carrots, peas, etc).  Because of this, and because I train consistently, I can lift around 400 pounds, and can finish 100 one-armed pushups in under 4 minutes.  Sometimes my arms look too muscular and that’s a put-off as well, so I try to wear long sleeves to cover them up.

.
Sometimes I feel so frustrated; as if I have to now apologize for making good choices with my life.  The stereotypical trope here is that men put women down for being educated or accomplished, but I kid you not – I can leave my apartment right now, at this moment, and come back in 20 minutes with a guy on my arm.  Men love it when I talk smart to them.  Moreover, I can take off the makeup, comb my hair back, use male voice – and women will eat it up too.  It’s specifically lesbians that this always happens with.

**Maybe All Lesbians are Asexual?**

.
In fact, before I joined the sex positive group, I had actually come to the conclusion that most lesbians were asexual, and that being lesbian simply meant a general dislike of men, and perhaps only involved a preference for the company of other women.  I’ve been to dozens of lesbian meetups.  Looking at the way everyone generally conducts themselves at these things, if you did not know beforehand that this was a *lesbian* meetup, then there’s no way you could tell otherwise.  I’ve been to straight women’s meetups, and there’s honestly no difference between the two.  There’s absolutely no obvious signs of romantic affection or sexual attraction between other members, and certainly never anything like that towards me.  I can put on all my best makeup, dress in my best clothes, and rarely does anyone notice.  You do hear about how lesbian porn is made mostly for men, right?  So it began to seem rather plausible that maybe lesbians really are just non-sexual, and any other ideas about them were just thought up by men.  This started to change my views on gay marriage… why on earth are lesbians so anxious to get married, other than for some symbolic gesture, if there’s literally never anything intimate or affectionate that ever happens?  I even got into some debates on social media about this.  It’s extremely rare that I’ve ever seen two women holding hands, or kissing, or anything – certainly not at these meetups.  And if they’re constantly scared away by almost anything I say, then it seems difficult to imagine how intimacy would ever happen in the first place.

.
Honestly, how would that even happen?  And also… *when* does it happen?  It’s been years now, and I’ve only recently managed to get a conversation to last longer than a few minutes.  And that brings us to the incident that lead to this post.


**I Finally Give Up.  Please Just Explain This To Me.**

.
See, I really have been doing research, and drawing from dialectical behavioral therapy, I’ve been putting together potential models and conversational structures that might elicit a positive emotional response from the person I’m speaking to.

.
Then I attended this meetup called “Conscious Lesbian/Queer Dating &amp; Love Portland”.  It was hosted by two PhD researchers on the subject of lesbian dating.  Figured I might learn something.  Around 50 or so people attended.

.
The discussion that followed was hopelessly alien.

.
**Speakers:** So, how many of us here have seen a woman from across the room, our eyes met, and we went right over to them because we felt that attraction??

.
**Crowd:** Yea!!

.
**Athena:** Wait…. what?

.
**Speakers:** And as soon as you meet you feel so attracted to each other that you’re just attached at the hip!

.
**Crowd:** (someone in the back) Happens all the time!  (Everyone laughs)

.
**Athena:** No….. no, that… that never happens.  Like, ever.  At any of the places I’ve ever been.  Not once.

.
**Speakers:** And you want to move in with each other on the second date, right?

.
**Crowd:** Mmmm Hmmm!

.
**Athena:** That’s not how this works.   That’s not how any of this works.  None of you are making any sense.  Second date?  How do you even get a first date??  How do you even get them to look at you??

.
**Speakers:** The real problem with lesbian dating, is that you fall in love so fast, you have sex, and then you’re not ready to build a long term relationship.

.
**Athena:** WHAT PLANET ARE YOU PEOPLE FROM????


—————

.
People from the crowd shared their stories of meeting women and instantly moving in together.  After that…… I give up.  I’ve put in hundreds of hours of research and trying out different methods.  I am so utterly and completely lost.  This just doesn’t make sense anymore.

.
If you are a lesbian, and you are reading this, please, help.  Tell me how I can talk to you and not have you want to get up and leave.  I’ve been to so many lesbian meetups and I’ve never even seen other people hooking up, so I really a just utterly mystified.  I have to abandon the asexual lesbian hypothesis, especially after the meetup describe above, because I received so much direct contradictory evidence.  I can’t bridge the gap between that many women having so many stories that everyone in the room finds oh so familiar, and what my own experiences these last few years have been like.

.
Anyway please do feel free to leave comments below.  I’ve been single for 3 years now.  I really want to know how I can change that."
C0RN3L1U5,asktransgender,I am not sure if I am trans.,"When asked if I would willingly become female bodied if I could do it right now without dangerous side effects, the answer is usually yes. However, my current gender identity is currently mostly boy, part girl, and even if I changed my body my gender probably wouldn't change. In addition, hormone replacement therapy, from what I know, is dangerous and doesn't always bring satisfactory results, so I'm leery about it. Although I do wish to change my appearance naturally, with diet, exercise, makeup, and other stuff.

The thing that makes me most confused about my gender identity is the fact that sometimes I feel like I am *not* trans, and sometimes I feel I should ""get over it"". Right now, several minutes after I made this post, I am very comfortable being a very feminine man. An aunt of mine was pretty sure I was not transgender, and thought I saw other trans people and thought they were cool and wanted to be like them or something. Also my body dysphoria could be related to the fact that change (like what occured for me during puberty) in general makes me uncomfortable, which could be the case but I think if this was why I was uncomfortable I would have eventually got used to my new body, which... sorta happened, but then didn't?

It would be convenient if someone could do a scan of my brain while I am still alive and tell me what my gender should be according to its structure. But this may never happen, even after I'm dead.

Even if I'm not transgender, I'm probably not cisgender. If that is the case, then... what am I, besides gender-noncomforming?

My gender dysphoria might stem from the fact that I am not *attracted* to my own body. If this is the case, maybe I should rethink some things."

_Earthrise_,asktransgender,"Songs that are ""accidentally trans""?","I'm a big music person, and as I've gone through the process of questioning and eventual transition, I've realized there are songs that deeply resonate with my own experience of gender identity without really meaning to. It's an obvious choice, but take The Smiths' [How Soon Is Now?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5-isOhDXzg) for example:

&gt;You shut your mouth

&gt;How can you say

&gt;I go about things the wrong way?

&gt;I am human and I need to be loved

&gt;Just like everybody else does

-

&gt;When you say it's gonna happen ""now""

&gt;Well when exactly do you mean?

&gt;See I've already waited too long

&gt;And all my hope is gone

Granted, the lyrics are intentionally vague, but they still nail the sensation of coming out/transition to an uncanny degree. 

Another more recent example is the song [Sister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mIA1r2ZELU) by Angel Olsen:

&gt;Saw it in her eyes

&gt;Oh, it wasn't what she said

&gt;She came together like a dream

&gt;That I didn't know I had

&gt;From the sleeping life I lead

&gt;All the colors I have seen

&gt;I can't help but recognize

&gt;The brighter one in front of me

&gt;Oh, the truth I thought I learned

&gt;And then it finally came along

&gt;Turned around and then it's there

&gt;All the love I thought was gone

-

&gt;I want to know you

&gt;I want to show you

&gt;I want to be there

&gt;I want to see her

&gt;Piece us together

&gt;Know it's forever

&gt;Show me the future

&gt;Tell me you'll be there

&gt;I want to go where

&gt;Nobody knows me

&gt;I want to follow

&gt;My heart down that wild road

-

&gt;Everywhere I go

&gt;I can see your face

&gt;Alive and gone at once

&gt;Hey, that's the way I see this place

&gt;And though this blessing was a curse

&gt;Before I opened up my heart

&gt;You learn to take it as it comes

&gt;You fall together, fall apart

They clearly aren't meant to be, but I can't hear these lyrics as being about anything other than a trans woman, and to me they describe the feeling of dysphoria almost exactly.

Does anyone else have any other songs like this, that resonate with a trans perspective seemingly by accident?

I realize some of these examples may be more MTF-centric, as that's my own background, so if anyone has any examples that describe the FTM or nonbinary experience, please please share."
Sorry_for_the_mess,asktransgender,6 month HRT mark and not finding it easy to relearn sex..(nsfw),"I've been on hormones 6 months and things have been incredible. I pass fairly well, boy mode occasionally fails, and I get hit on while at work as a bartender. 

The one thing that is a little frustrating is the lack of sexual pleasure. I mean I can do a little solo run but it's not that good, I have explored sexuality with sleeping with men and it's enjoyable but could be better. I still like women too. It's just hard to get interested in sex right now. I am having trouble finding things that turn me on, and I've lost a really awesome partner because I wasn't getting into it like I used to. I can still get erections with a woman but it's hard to maintain. 

What's the best way to explore and find out what I like? I have no clue any more. I used to be really awesome in bed and now I feel I fall short. I doubt it's my dosage, as the function seems normal when it happens, I just find myself less interested in sex.  "
12dec2016,asktransgender,Why was I born male and not female?,"I was born male and not female and it is really annoying me.


I've never really been annoyed with this on the scale as I am today, but today I don't know. I feel like smashing stuff up because of it.


I just feel like starting HRT, forcing myself onto it. If I have to self medicate with, so be it (it is probably the only way I'd be able to get it). 


I was born male. I've grown up as a boy. I have a masculine voice, masculine personality, everything. I used to be fine with being male, but I'm not anymore. I don't feel male anymore, where as I used to feel like a guy. When I put my gender as male or my title as Mr it just doesn't feel right. Although it has only been within the past few months that I have started feeling this way.





If I were female, there would be no need to transition, no worries about what gender I was born as, HRT, reactions, everything. I'd have a feminine body, a feminine personality, everything. I'd never be in this mess.


Seeing other girls my age almost makes me pissed off that I am not like them. It's not like I want to be them, but I wish I could be like them. I wish I could wear the clothes they could. I wish I could look feminine like them. I wish I could act them. But I've been brought up male, so I haven't picked up any feminine personality traits.


I've had so many signs (mostly relating to crossdressing) since I was around 6 years old. 



I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I have a big assignment due in tomorrow. I have no motivation to do it. I can't be bothered to get up in the mornings, I'd rather sleep all day than be with others. I've always been a bit like this, but since realizing I might be trans it has gotten worse.



What's weird is that this dysphoria has only started around mid-october. It's just been 2 months ago and I am already getting angry, depressed, and I feel like I'm not going to be alive in 10 years time if this doesn't go away, which it doesn't from what I heard. I can't see this getting any better. Either that or this is just a passing phase and I'll be fine in a couple of months. 


Where I am I can't see a therapist. The only way I could do it is over e-mail or IM, but I can't speak, or see face-to-face. The only thing I can do is go on the internet and look things up.

pinkchips,asktransgender,"With every person you come out to, it gets a little easier.","I remember back when I thought the absolute worst thing possible would be for anyone in my life to find out about my.... femme tendencies.  I buried that shit so far in the closet, an emotional cyst the size of Narnia developed.  
  
The first person I ever 'came out to' was a therapist, which prompted the creation of this account. (https://www.reddit.com/r/transpositive/comments/5azh17/went_to_see_a_counselortherapist_today_was_one_of/?)  
  
When I told one of my trans friends here on Reddit she said something that struck me, ""Great, every person you come out to make it a little easier.""  At the time I sensed that was one of these statements that was true, but seemed impossible from my current perspective.  It is too: absolutely true.  
  
Perhaps some of you here are still closeted and obsessing over the hundreds of people in your life, and how you could ever 'face them' with the truth revealed that you are trans.  
  
I'll tell you: after you come out to a therapist, and then the first few distant pen pals (easy mode coming out), you begin to work up the courage to come out to people closer and closer to your day-to-day life.  There will be some negative reactions maybe, but more positive ones that you expect.  
  
A funny thing will begin to happen: your shame and fear at being transgender will begin to morph into something else... at first it feels like a no-fucks attitude.... and then by the time you have reached the point of being fully open with everyone in your life, it will become actual **pride**.  Perhaps (and usually) at some point in this process you realize the courage to pursue actual transition if you haven't started already.  
  
You don't have to be ashamed of who you are.  Admitting to yourself and others does not mean the death of all ego and pride forever.  It just means a shift from being proud of a character you dress up and pretend to be, to the real you underneath it all.  
  
Imagine being the real you.  And being proud of it.  It will definitely happen if you take the baby steps needed to get there.  And that's why with every person you come out to, it gets a little bit easier.  "
StjerneFroeken,asktransgender,I am pre everything and I struggle to feel feminine,"I am pre everything MTF and each time I go outside in girl-mode I somehow struggle to feel feminine.

My mum and my friends are saying that I already got an excellent figure for a girl and I sort of agree: I got a slender build and got some lovely long legs that makes all my cis girl friends jealous. But at the same time it is like I can't feel that. 

I really want to be a girl. I just can't :( 

How do you deal with it? And how do you trans masculine guys deal with when you struggle to feel masculine?"
SnipingBeaver,asktransgender,Fear and doubt,"I always had it drilled into my head as a child that all of my problems I made up for attention. Like  saying I was too sick to go to school was just a trick or that I wasn't getting bullied I was just victimizing myself for attention. And now that I'm trying to work through my feelings on my gender, I can never escape that feeling that I just want to be some kind of ""outcast"" to feel unique.

stygianZinogre_,asktransgender,Shopping for clothes for christmas turned out to be a really good experience,"This isn't really a question, hope that's okay, I just had some experiences that felt awesome and haven't really got anywhere else to share them.

My grandma invited me to a Christmas lunch thing with her, my aunt and uncle, and I think my aunt's family. It's at a semi-fancy restaurant, some place at a really old hotel- and I had zero clothes that my grandma deemed acceptable lol. So she took me shopping for some actually nice mens clothes. And it just... went really well. I found stuff that not only looks good, but I actually like, which is completely new to me, having so many memories of having to wear ""nice"" clothes meaning being forced into dresses or skirts or just generally female/feminine stuff, the idea that something can be nice *and* I'll still like it? Kind of incredible. It's a button up shirt that's considered sufficiently ""nice"" but looks like the kind of thing I'd probably gladly wear by choice, pants and a sweater.  I had to try some pants on, which I was dreading, since I normally avoid public restrooms like the plague and figured that a dressing room would be about the same deal. But it was a complete non-issue. No one gave me a second look.

And then she took me to get a haircut, and it turned out to be a really good haircut. I usually ask for the same thing, but sometimes it ends up better than other times- and this was a good one. Plus the person cutting my hair kept calling me ""buddy"". I know that probably means they were seeing me as maybe 10 years younger than I actually am. But it also seems to suggest to me that someone who was cutting my hair, had their face a foot or two away from my head and my face, saw me as male. 

So that whole experience just felt really fucking good and I'm really fucking happy right now.  *Obligatory questiondiscussion aaaah* any positive, affirming, awesome-feeling things that have happened to you?"

SophieCalle,asktransgender,LGBTQ+ Positive / Trans Friendly Gyms in Manhattan / Brooklyn,"Hi everyone!  This is kind of a weird situation.  Let me explain.

So, I'm transitioning, with HRT and getting laser, as usual  

Well, my breasts have gotten a mind of their own, so they're way ahead of the work I need to finish to remove the hair and shadow on my face, which is really necessary to make it possible for me to exercise as myself.  

As a result, I've only worked out in boy mode ever.  Now, I'm totally ok with that.  I'm patient.  But, the problem is me having noticeable breasts in the men's locker room.  

I've been circumventing it with towels and quickly getting to the stalls but I'm getting increasingly concerned about what can happen from it.

So, I thought a LGBTQ+ positive gym could be an answer to that.  

I'm fully aware that Planet Fitness is totally ok with trans members, but I don't want to be that one person making hundreds of cishet people incredibly uncomfortable, getting a thousand stares of death, while I'm in this inbetween phase.  

I feel like a LGBTQ+ gym would naturally be comfortable with this, since everyone would know what's up and there wouldn't be expected any issues.

So, are there any?  I've been searching and the results are vague, at best.  Thank you!"
jungletigress,asktransgender,Fellow wallflowers: how do you deal with being the subject so much attention after coming out?,"So I'll start by saying that my transition has been pretty amazing so far. I was able to tell my wife, my parents, family, and close friends while being accepted with open arms. In that regard, a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders and I feel so much more relaxed and comfortable with being me.

About three weeks ago, I came out on facebook, finally burying my past identity so that no shred of it lived on. It was an important milestone for me to come to terms with my identity and make sure that I wouldn't hide or back out. I typically like to hide my personal life and don't display it for everyone, so this has been an... adjustment, to say the least. Most everyone has been very supportive, which is great, and I'm glad. A lot more of my friends simply ignored it, which is just fine by me.

Now, I'm getting calls from conservative family members who are *mostly* supportive but still want to poke fun at me for transitioning and ask extremely personal questions about the process, as if they have a right to know. 

I'm now getting messages from old friends that I haven't talked to in years asking me about this and kind of putting me on the defensive with weird lines of questioning like ""why would you do this to yourself?"" sorts of questions. Often in the middle of the night after they've been drinking (I'm kind of sorry I missed them when they came in, you know?)

I feel like I now have to be an advocate for trans rights and champion a cause or something. I just want to be myself and live my life. 

So my question is this: fellow trans-ladies, trans-brothers, and trans-none-of-the-aboves (who probably have the best insight into this) how do you deal with being the focal point of a political platform when all you want to do is be yourself and have everyone treat you the same?

Hunger_Of_The_Pine_,asktransgender,Anyone able to help me understand what gender fluid and non-binary is?,"Hi, so I understand binary transgender. But I was wondering if there is possibly any scientific evidence of genderfluid or non-binary as there is for (binary) transgenderism?

As a ciswoman I also find it difficult to understand non-binary in general? I can sort of wrap my head around it, in the sense that perhaps the individual feels no strong leaning towards either. But what I can't wrap my head around is all the various labels within the non-binary umbrella, and all the various self chosen pronouns. I have no issue with using gender neutral pronouns such as ""they"" if someone so requested but I can't understand some of the ones that seem really foreign to me such as zen or bun.

Also, would anyone help me to understand genderfluidity? I find it very difficult to get my head around the idea that a person can feel a different identity on a regular basis that is constantly changing (excluding multiple personality disorder as I can understand their identity changes due to mental illness)? 

Lastly, do non-binary/genderfluid individuals suffer from gender dysmorphia? As this is the main backbone of [binary] transgenderism? If that particular individual does not, would it be more bordering on a gender expression than an identity? 

I'm sorry if this comes across as offensive in anyway! I don't intend it to. I'm just rather uneducated on the matter, and when I do try to educate myself (mainly through interactions with non-binary and/or genderfluid people) they're usually the tumblr sort that are offended by my asking and tell me to go educate myself and that it's not their job to teach me. But I am struggling to find information, especially information with scientific backing, in order to educate myself and understand the topic.

It just seems rather alien to me.

One thing I have not been able to find much information on is maintaining my muscle mass - I'm something of an amateur blacksmith/welder/a million other things, and having some muscle to cart heavy things around and swing hammers is more than a little useful.

How much strength training am I looking at (and how soon once I start HRT) to at least maintain some of my strength? "
pm_me_your_dresses,asktransgender,I think it finally clicked.,"So, the last few months have been a bit of a continual disaster for me. I've had a string of consecutive problems - failing a year at uni because of some depression I was going through in March, being told I had to re-take the year to keep on, some issues with feeling like I can't really connect with any of my flatmates, generally feeling unprepared for having gone full-time straight away, the NHS losing track of me for 3 months, my younger sister telling me I'll 'always be her brother', and then finally - and worst of all - being sent to ER by ambulance at 2 in the morning where I writhed in pain for 8 hours before they realised it was 3 simultaneous kidney stones and finally gave me painkillers.

These problems have been kind of relentless, and I was getting frightened that - to put it bluntly - 'this was it'. I'm coming up to 6 months on HRT tomorrow, and while I've been enjoying all the changes, it's been a tough time. Or at the very least, I haven't been happy. I get a lot of self-doubt in the best of times, and this hasn't made it easier to cope with the constant dysphoria. I hadn't even been completely comfortable with going outside or hanging out with people recently, which had left me feeling quite isolated. And then today happened.

It started *badly*. I've not been able to shave the past few days because of a laser hair removal thing, and facial hair has always been the main dysphoric thing for me, so I'd been trying to not think about it this morning. I took some painkillers, had some lunch, and tried not to think about the hairs on my face. Had a shower, and then - for the first time in a while - went through the trouble of putting some hair treatment in my hair, brushing it through, and then letting it dry properly. I didn't have anything prepared for dinner, so I put on some jeans, my hoodie, and my usual dysphoria-busting coat, and then my glasses (which I usually don't put on that often). As I left the flat, I saw myself in the mirror, and was kind of shocked.

I've hated mirrors for as long as I can remember. Today, I had no make-up on, no fancy girly clothes, and a full 4 days of facial hair growth, but I could see *myself*. Not just my body. In the mirror, there was my reflection, and - for the first time in my life - it was *me*.

And it just clicked. Why I was here, why I'm at this point in my life. Why I'd been fighting so hard. *Who* I was fighting for. And as weird as it seems to say this, up until this point, I'd always been doing this for 'her'. That girl I was in my dreams that would make me so sad when I had to wake up, and lose her. After all this time, all this pain to get here, I've been right here all along. And god, it makes me so glad to finally realise that on my own.

Tl;dr: Ever since I realised I was trans, I've been waiting for the day that I could finally become 'her'. After properly seeing the effects HRT have had over the past 6 months, I realised that I've been her this whole time."

ImActuallyADragon,asktransgender,Why does gender dysphoria have to be a thing?,"I'm so frustrated with myself lately. 6 months ago I got the letter from my therapist, but I couldn't bring myself to use it. I've only seen her twice since then, and I know it's still an option, it's just up to me to decide when.

I think I can deal with having to come out. I think I can deal with the weird stares. I think I can deal with all the doctor visits and the flood of physical changes that come with it.

What I can''t deal with is the fact that I can't love myself for who I am. I was given something so precious (i.e. life) and I can't bring myself to change myself so dramatically just because I don't like the way I look and the way I'm expected to act. 

I think a lot of it just has to do with me hating pills. I never take cold medicine, the only pain reliever I'll take is to reduce a fever, and it's taken me months of therapy and years of friends and family convincing me for me to try anti depressants (which have been helping tbh).

Has anyone else felt the same way? This is so frustrating and I just want a way to end it. /rant"
twasanotherthrowaway,asktransgender,I'm almost 7 months on hrt and haven't done anything.,"And it feels... weird. I love every change I notice, but dysphoria makes me feel either really bad or super happy. There are even times when I pass in my own eyes. That is, if I would have done my eyebrows.

There's no denying it, I look either like a ~14 years old boy, or a girl around age 18 - 21. Depends on lighting, but people would have to be really stupid to not be able to tell that I'm trans. Even when I got transferred to the mooring shift and I was assigned a new team, everyone was wondering what my gender was. I could actually pass, if it weren't for my deadname which I can't change yet.

And there's that, I'm afraid to do anything. Even stupid eyebrows, or buy makeup. My friend wanted to help me (even though she has no idea about makeup because she's non-binary) and buy some. But when we went to the shop, I got overwhelmed and scared so we had to go back.

Maybe you have an idea on how to overcome it?"

likeClockwork7,asktransgender,Advice for self-acceptance?,"I believe I've passed the point at which any cis person would think this over; I think being a girl appeals to me more than being the opposite sex would to any cis person; reasonably speaking, I am most likely transgender. I have very little reason to doubt, yet doubt I do.

I'm sure many people went through this phase of ""it's pretty unlikely that I'm not trans, but I can't accept with full confidence that I am.""

[deleted],asktransgender,Am I becoming mentally ill ?,"Hi everyone. I'm a 19 year old french trans girl (turning 20 in 3 weeks), started hormones 1 month and half ago, and I'm starting to be scared for my mental health... 

I'm an introvert by nature, really shy, and i crave alone time a lot. I don't like speaking with people at all... i always was like this. My mom and dad even thought that I was autist when I was younger. For me it was just me being myself, i had no problem with that. And I just always had friends as a child. But now it is scaring me.

Everything started in my early teens; I had to live with my two dangerous and violent criminal big brothers (the bigger took us in hostage with his knife, he is schizophrenic), I was highly bullied at school at 13-14 (tried to kill myself around this age) because I started to have no friends and I was always alone. Also because I was naturally feminine by nature and a bit submissive... I was scared of everyone and they took advantage of me basically. I had to deal with depression and high dysphoria, and my dad tried to abandon us... I was just in a really bad place. 

All of these were traumatic experiences and I feel like it affected me mentally. 
Now, I rarely leave the house, people in my class find me weird and cold so they leave me alone and when someone try to interact with me, I start panicking. 
Everyday, I just listen to music and stay in my dark bedroom, sometimes I read and I almost always daydream about my future life as a woman. It's all I do. My exams are in 2 weeks and I wanna cry because I really don't have the strength mentally to start studying... 

It's now 5 years that I'm lonely and i think that I'm losing my natural sense of basic human interactions (hope it makes sense) I just don't have the courage stop being lonely. I'm so scared of humans...
So how to deal with that ?

jonahponah,asktransgender,gay ftm terrified for the future and seeking honest advice.,"hello. I'm 17, pre-everything (but my first hormone appointment is in March), female to male, and gay. I love men! I love being gay, and i love being a man, and sometimes I'll get caught up for days and days on how great it'll be one day when I'm grown up and have a husband and a nice gay life.

but every time, I inevitably remember that right now, the world sees me as a girl, and I'm very afraid that it will still be like that after I start to physically transition, too. I'm very afraid cis men will not see me for who I am and I'm very afraid other trans men will only see me as trans, and nothing else, as has been my experience. I don't think of myself as trans, I just think of myself as a boy, and every time I remember that I'm a different kind of boy, it just hurts. I feel hopeless. I feel like I'm never going to be seen for who I am and I feel like I'm always going to feel like my transness is a big dirty secret. I feel like I will never have my big gay dream future with my husband and I feel like nobody will just see me as a man.

I don't know entirely what I'm asking. I think I just need it off my chest, but I also want to know if any trans folks further in their transition know the feeling. does it get better? am I always going to feel this way? is it possible to be in a relationship with someone, trans or cis, who just sees you as a ""real"" man/woman and not a fraud? will people around you, even if they know, see you that way? please feel free to be honest even if things sound bleak.

capitalH-E-L-P,asktransgender,What's your best passing moment?,"Mine happened two days before Thanksgiving. I was at the local grocery store with my mom, and she was buying a lot of stuff, and I saw her talking to the clerk and bagger. Since I was bored, I decided to to walk up and join in on the conversation. The bagger was talking about how they needed more people there, and then said, ""They were so desperate that they hired me! I'm a balding 32 year old man. They prefer to higher young good looking fellas like him."" and gestured to me. Both him and the clerk suggested I apply for a job there because I'd probably get it.

Basically, not only did I pass, but I was also called good looking. It was great. What about you guys and gals? "
KingofKnaves,asktransgender,Can I even move forward at this point?,"Apologies, this is kind of long. I'm at quite a loss.

I'm definitely transgender. Mtf. I've felt this way for as long as I can recall, etc, etc. Fast forward to my senior year of high school (American), and I was starting to come into myself. I was dressing femininely, being more open about my sexuality (bi), and genuinely making progress into being happy. The one catch is that I was alone. Like way alone. I had some friends, pretty close ones, but they didn't know this about me.

I met a girl, we fell in love, I came out as trans while we were dating but I quashed my feelings and told her it was a phase. We've been married for 5 years. We're still in love, she knows it wasn't just a phase. We have 2 kids together, and 3 from her previous marriage.

Whew, thats some opening. Anyway, I've been in the Navy for 3 years now, and I like it a lot. I've recently come into a deploying job and I'd love to start deploying because my job is hella cool. However, my dysphoria has, in the passed year, shot through the roof, making it difficult to function without being a total bitch. Cynicism, irritability, insomnia, depression, anxiety, these are all part of my personality. 

With the policy change, the DoD will cover my transition, but my CO, or commanding officer, would have overall authority over my transition, should it be approved by medical. He could determine that, at this time, I can begin transitioning, but I will not deploy. This can destroy my career. But so could keeping this to myself and having a fucking breakdown. Do I standby and deploy, essentially posing as a man(like I have been for the last 27 years) or do I come out, admit myself to the world and hope for the best? I want to stay in, I want to set an example for other trans people in the military. I want to excel in every way that I can. I just don't know what to do here.

At least they won't kick me out now.

Again, sorry for the length of this post. I'm sort of putting all of my eggs in one carton here. I'm also relatively new to posting on reddit, so if I've done anything wrong, I'm sorry for that too."
AlliePiper,asktransgender,Epilator advice?,"I got an epilator a year ago, and I really, really, realllllly want to like it. When I take the time to use it, the results are so much better than shaving it's just incredible. But there are some things about it that just make it impractical for me. I know a lot of people here use them, so maybe you can help me out.

Firstly, it takes around an hour just to do my lower legs, and even then, it misses a lot of hairs and I have to clean up the next day after it recharges. So question 1: How long does it take you to do your legs normally?

And the other thing is that after a week or so goes by and the hairs start coming back, they come back in batches because of the growth cycles. This means I still find myself doing hair removal crap every 2-3 days to keep up after the initial usage. So question 2: How do you deal with the ""maintenance"" phase of epilation?

And question 3: As I mentioned above, it seems to miss a lot. I keep it upright, at high speed, and move veeeery slowly (remember, it takes me an hour!), but it still just stubbornly refuses to pluck some of the hairs. Any ideas what I might be doing wrong?

I eventually end up doing it every few days and it takes roughly an hour, so I just end up going back to shaving as the epilator is just eating up too much time. Help?"

secretftmaccount,asktransgender,ftm fallen hopelessly for straight coworker,"made a throwaway for extra precautions. 
but yeah, as the title says i've fallen HARD for a straight coworker of mine
this crush on him is massive, started up about a month ago and only gets stronger. gotten to the point he's all i think about in my spare time, i have dreams about him. a mutual coworker of ours ended up confronting me the other night and asked if i had a crush on him and i ponied up. he said how obvious it was on my end but said crush is oblivious and that i wouldnt have the best luck pursuing this as he's straight... 
but crushboy is throwing me for a loop, sending me mixed signals. he's played footsy with me on more than one occasion, picked me up and carried me around, semi-joke-fake flirts with me, told me he doesn't like guys except for me, and has told our mutual coworker that i'm his favorite... 
but i've seen the girl he likes and who rejected him come into work, and i can't compare with her even if he would somehow reciprocate my feelings. i'm not as tall or skinny-- more importantly i'm not a woman. 
but with all the joke-flirting he's thrown at me, and the fact i've heard of various cases where a straight guy makes an exception for an ftm, i'm left here with my fingers crossed that he'd like me back...
i don't really know where to go from here, i considered having our mutual coworker wingman for me and try to suggest the idea or even just bring up how i feel for me. the only thing is i'd only want to go out with my crush if he continued to wholeheartedly view and treat me as a guy. "

I'm a MTF who's been on HRT for 3 months now, and I've been with my girlfreind for just over a year and a half. Unfortunately, our relationship has been strained recently due to difficulty with sex. The sexual part of our relationship has always been difficult for me, as I've never felt particularly comfortable doing the ""male"" side of intercourse. Now though, after three months of hormones it seems nearly impossible for me to get to a point where I'm even physically able to do it, as I just cant really get hard enough to do anything.  We're also both sexual novices, having never had sex with anyone either than each other, this leaves us in a difficult situation as we don't really know what to do now. We're planning on trying anal, with me as the recipient, but we dont really know what we need to get started? Do we need a strap on, lube, something else? Is there something that lets us both have pleasure at the same time? I would love any help or suggestions, I'm just really lost right now and feeling really shitty. Thanks for the help."
nyjetsfanatic12,asktransgender,Pot makes me feel like a girl,"okay, 18 year old male, idk how many of you know my story, but I'm not getting into that. so I smoke weed a bunch (not anymore) and I loved it. Specifically I loved working out with my buddies while high. I'd smoke/life every day for 7 straight months till I go away for college. Then one time I smoked and I had this crazy experience and it made me feel like a girl (felt like I had a vagina) I did not enjoy this to say the least. The next 2 times I smoked it got progressively more intense, the last time I smoke I didn't feel like a girl, I was a girl. I was terrified. I've never had an issue with my body. I actually love(d). I'm a little smaller than I used to be so I'm a little off on it rn. Especially when I smoked I loved how I looked. I've never had a problem with being a guy, at all. I've never hated my genitals, if anything I've always wanted a huge porn star ****. (sorry for the profanity). I've had multiple concussions from playing football, my physiatrist I'm seeing thinks that has something to do with the voices that told me I was a girl that preceded this body transformation (again, not getting to into that this time). I was wondering if this means I'm transgender, and if you can be transgender even if you don't want to be the opposite sex? I like being a guy, being a girl doesn't sound awful or anything but it's not really something I'd be willing to change myself for. I like the life I've built as a guy, I love lifting, playing football, hoping to coach it one day and all of this is making this challenging for me bcuz all I do is question and wonder. I'd really like to hear any experiences/advice you may have. My doc said I should ask around if it might help me gain a little piece of mind. I've also talked to a gender therapist, he said I'm the most certain he's ever been someone wasn't trans. But why else would I feel like a girl when I smoke? It's incredibly confusing. Thank you

HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,Serious: NSFW fears and question regarding srs/gcs (mtf),"Ive been on hormones for over a year, and have been identifying as mtf for almost the entire time since coming out. However, i fear losing the ability to ejaculate--well, really i just fear losing the feeling.  I cant make a decision on surgery because, while i have genital dysphoria or at the very least, genital discomfort, would enjoy life if i was bornas a cis woman, and have very little to no desire to penetrate with the parts i have--i guess in gay lingo im 100% bottom, yet the feeling of ejaculation is such a release that, for me personally, is something i fear losing.  Ive had a 'female' style orgasm through rubbing and nipple stimulation, and it was an amazing feeling (tho it took 40 minutes and i had to avoid 'jacking off' for the guarnteed release, altho this full body feeling was way better than the short ejaculation, though wholly different) But i still dont want to lose the feeling of ejaculation, but i hate my male parts!! Augh! --with srs, such as with suporn, would i lose that ability?  The feeling of spasms that comes with climax?  I cling to it as the last vestige of my maleness i guess.  I dont want the parts, but i dont want to lose the ability to habe that feeling.

apothanein_thelo,asktransgender,"Detransitioning after just 2 weeks on estrogen, upset and confused, need a little support.","Cut to the chase: I spent 2 weeks on a low dose of estrogen (1mg daily), during which time I grew breast buds between pea and marble sized. (Not exaggerating, and yes I know it's a lot for such a short time.) I quickly realized I wasn't comfortable and stopped.

It's been two weeks since then and my breast buds/nipples have not changed at all - they might have even grown a bit more, alarmingly. I can't find much information on whether initial buds will ever go away on their own.

I mean, I knew the risks when I signed on, so you could say it's my own fault. But I had to find out whether HRT was right for me, and this was the only way.

My doctor told me that this would be a slow, initially reversible process. Yet now it seems I'm going to have to carry around these two reminders of my honest mistake with me forever. I am unlikely to be able to afford the $3k+ top surgery needed to extract the breast buds.

My discomfort with myself isn't something that HRT will fix. I'm resigned to always feeling a bit ""off"" with my gender/body. I just hate that I did something so significant to my body, and I can't take it back."

They also referenced other studies where progesterone has neuroprotection properties. 

Of course in the study, all of the MTFs are grouped, so changes in progesterone levels of individuals are not reported. I was interested if anyone has had progesterone levels measured prior to HRT, with E and AA only, and after the addition of progesterone.

The reason I ask is because my dad already has a lot of stress on him dye to my two brothers and my uncle's son recently passed away a few months ago.  Both are always telling me how proud they are of me and I gave no reason to believe that either will disown me, but considering they both also lost their mother 8 years ago and sister 3 years ago, I'm afraid of what this will do to them, not out of shame but out if them genuinely concerned for my wellbeing.

- How often do you get injections?
- Do doctors allow you to self-inject or do you need to go in every time?
- Patches are fairly consistent in dosing so will injections have highs and lows?

transthrowaway38,asktransgender,Am I trans?,"Hi, I've lurked here for a while on a different account, and I recently came to the conclusion that I'm trans; however I've started having some doubts. I have a history of deluding myself into things, the most extreme example being that I once convinced myself I had multiple personalities. And I've been thinking that maybe I just *think* that I'm trans, and that I'm actually cis or non-binary. The crux of those thoughts is that I've never really had any dysphoria, I mean sure I don't like the facial and body hair but I wouldn't call that dysphoria. I do think that if I had had the ability to choose, I would've preferred to be born as a girl, and I do really like wearing makeup and skirts and such. I've also been having fears about the repercussions of transitioning, and potential regret. Sorry if that's incomprehensible, I'm not used to writing out concerns and such."
MarcusDeus,asktransgender,"Is this just a fetish, or am i trans?","When i was 12 or 13 i watched gay porn first time.I don't even remember if i liked it or not, but i remember that after a month or so, or even before i watched it again.I realized that i have something like a fetish, when i watched a porn.I liked to fantasize that i'm a woman with a men in the bed.It doesn't bothered me, but after two years or so, i wanted to know, what is this.After watching a porn, i seached some information about it on google, because i was scared that i can be a gay.But i found a term called ''autogynephilia''.At first i thought it was just a fetish, but after some time i was scared again, that i maybe transsexual.I am 17 right now, and i'm really scared that i can be transsexual, but i don't want to.

niku_j97,asktransgender,"Talked to Mom, went horribly","Talked to my mom today, she is very angry atm. I don't think she'll understand my pain.

I tried my best to explain everything. She says I'm being stubborn and I'll be back to normal once I start saying to myself that I'm a man. She is unwilling to acknowledge that I have gender dysphoria, that I have a mental problem and am creating this second identity. 

Whatever I say she has a counter answer to it. My mom believes in Hinduism a lot, she said she is certain I don't have gender dysphoria and I'm definitely not going to change sex and even if I do by being arrogant and stubborn I'll suffer my whole life. She was very clear that she doesn't want to know more about transgenders and GID and she will never give me permission to change my sex. 

Family honor is very important for them (Honor killings still happen in some parts of India) She said I can remain unmarried but I shouldn't change my sex and if I still want to I should leave the family. According to her I'm selfish and stubborn.

If any of you have been through similar situation please share your experiences.
How to turn them around? Or
How to prepare ourselves to leave them?

Update : Thanks everyone for your support and help. I came out to my parents about 2 years back when I was 18, they reacted in much more harsh manner and tbh i wasn't as prepared then. Now I don't think I want to convince her or anyone for who I am, Cis-people don't have to explain why should I. I'll keep my head down till i get independent.

MatchstickMonster,asktransgender,My fiancé told me he may be trans,"He got drunk yesterday and it all came out and he was crying because he thought he'd made a terrible mistake and that I would leave him. I assured him that he hasn't changed at all, he's still the person I fell in love with and I'm not going to leave. I told him that I couldn't promise him whether our relationship would work out because it'll be a big emotional journey for me also, but I explained that there are numerous situations where we could make this work.

Note: I'm using male pronouns because that's what he feels comfortable with right now. That may be because he has not really thought about his feelings much and it scares him. Last night he asked me to say a sentence about him with female pronouns and it made him very panicked. There's a long way to go in terms of acceptance. He is attracted to females, including me, which is good. I am bisexual but I prefer males. I've never been with a woman though, so I honestly don't know for certain. He's the only person I've ever been in a relationship with. We've been together for four years. 

Anyway, that's the background. What I don't understand is what it means to be transgender. For example, this is something I read:

""Some of these male-assigned people are, instinctively and naturally, more comfortable when people think of them as women. Living as a woman feels right — an unshaking feeling, bone-deep — whereas living as a man feels quite wrong, very uncomfortable, and often very painful. These people are women, they will always be women, and they should be addressed as such.

What does ""living as a woman"" mean. How is it different from being a feminine man? How does it differ from cross dressing? My fiance seems very reluctant to consider any change, but that may be because he's always held the idea out of mind because he felt it was shameful.

(I get the feeling she feels rushed due to fear about insurance.  We talked and I explained that, if insurance no longer covered it next year, we'd work something out, so...)  I can research the information, but, as a *slightly* overprotective mom, the things I worry about are not easily found.  (Mostly just info. on the procedure itself, which, quite frankly, I don't want to know!)  I hope it's okay to ask here...

1.  What are the actual risks?  Other than it being a major surgery, does it have a high morbidity rate?  Other risks that are discussed?  Are there ways to reduce the risks?

2.  What are the recovery times?  Online we saw months, but her doctor said only a week before she can get up?

3.  How much help will she need after physically?  I teach, so I really want her to do this at the beginning of the summer so I can help (and so she doesn't miss more classes than she needs to miss!)  

4.  Any mental issues to watch out for?  

I know each person is different and everyone recovers differently.  I just want to know how to best help her.  She's my only child and I am consumed with worry for her health, safety and happiness.  Any information is appreciated.  (To be clear - my beautiful baby boy is now my lovely 21 year-old daughter.  HRT for about 6 months now, living full time and much happier.)"

HALP. "
versitas187,asktransgender,"You know, I just don't get it. Why do people even hate us in the first place?","This is a rant. You can downvote away, but I just need to get this out. Many people are hating on transgender as if we are freak of nature or something. First of all, why do people claim they just understand transgenderism? I admit, only reason I plan to transition is because my brain can't accept masculine physical features on my head. This is not a cosmetic surgery. This is medical condition that must be treated. People think crossing between gender is taboo against nature. I mean, who are you even to judge what nature even is in the first place? I have a science degree. What we think nature to be and what nature really is are very different. Gender being sliding scale makes sense. Why would there be a ""switch"" making someone completely male or female in the first place? Brain development is very complicated process and we still do not understand many things. I don't demand people to understand what is going in our heads, but, at least, we can say is ""We don't know."" Really. We really don't what gender is. We don't know how brain works. We can have a sincere discussion on what gender is. However, people are arrogant enough to think they know everything. Think they know what nature is supposed to be like.

Secondly, why even focus so much on gender? I know people hate saying [Current Year], but we had so much scientific and social progress for two centuries. We know women aren't stupider than men. There are masculine women and there is feminine men. Nothing wrong with that. Why can't we just treat each other as a human being and judge me by my character? Only reason I call myself a female is because my brain associate myself with secondary physical characteristics of female sex. That's it. You can't even tell people who are male and female online until they claim to be. Why even give a shit about transitioning? My body is basically extra parts that supports me, or rather, my brain. I am still going to be me before and after HRT. My appearance would have changed, but I am still helpful, diligent kind of a guy. I don't except people to understand. In fact, before I realized I was trans, my friend came out as ftm. I still treated him decently and called him by what he wants to be called as. It's not that big of a work. Just call him by what he wants to be called as. It is not comprising your beliefs. It's just being polite. People are so stuck up with ideologies they have that they get angry because their viewpoints are challenged. Isn't that sad? Sure, I have my own ideologies, but I am separate from my opinions and I have much more respect towards myself than that.

Finally, we are non-issue. We are literally 0.3% of US population (Sorry, I don't know percentage for the world as a whole). You probably don't know we are trans until you get to know us better. I know, there are people who worry that they might not pass, but, frankly, people don't give too much attention to the world except themselves. People bash on us because that makes them feel good. Why not make effort on something that actually is a problem? Corruption in government? Climate Change? Increasing inequality? Decreasing privacy? No, people think we are big problem because they don't want to deal with actual problems. Grow up, world. I am doing my part by planning to go to grad school so I can make a better place. I volunteer to help people out. Bashing on us might make you feel good and make you feel like you are ""champion of culture"" or some bullshit, but you ain't getting anything done. Your feelings don't matter. Do concrete something for a change.

Sorry for the rant. Before I went to bed yesterday, I felt guilty about my transgender status. When I woke from my dream, I just realized how ridiculous this whole thing is. Just let people do what they want to make themselves happy. Unless it impacts you, you have no fucking business in criticizing or lecturing me about how nature is supposed to work to a god damn science major. Fucking pricks. "
MTFtransthrowaway123,asktransgender,DR Webberly question,So ive been using DR webberly and gender GP and im really close to getting hormones. Everytime ive sent an email to them ive gotten a reply within a few hours. But ive sent an email with my blood test results 3 days ago and haven't heard anything.

KelseyMorrisTG,asktransgender,Are there online Skype therapists?,"So I've been toying with the idea of speaking with a therapist, but don't have a vehicle to drive all over to see one.  I've never spoken with a therapist but have had recommendations to see one since that's the normal process of transitioning.  I'm not really sure what I would be asking them or looking to get out of it, I just hear that it helps.

I'm 26, MtF, 8 months HRT, full time for 5 months, and generally just live my life normally.  Do you all even think it's necessary that I see a therapist? Why do people typically go see them? Also if I do ended needing one, are there online therapists?"
formerly-me,asktransgender,Your gender in your dreams,"One of the things that makes me go ""hmmm"" in amongst all the other obvious signs of being trans is that I rarely dream of myself as a woman (I'm AMAB). Granted I've only been aware of my transness for ~5 months, but, considering the gender euphoria I've been getting in life from altering my body to be more feminine, I'd've guessed that my mind would want to give me more of that euphoria in my dreams. But nope! I've only dreamt of myself as a woman like a half dozen times.

Did it take time for you to start being the opposite of your assigned gender in your dreams? Did it start to happen a lot more after you started HRT and/or started presenting in public?"
Reon98,asktransgender,"I have all the time in the world, why does this feel so urgent to figure out?",I've been questioning for a really short time by comparison to others.

marmitamise,asktransgender,Does anyone have any idea how hormones /transition will effect ejaculatory anhedonia? (Semi NSFWish) (also egregiously long),"I am a MTF pretty much on the cusp of starting HRT, probably this January. As well as being trans I experience a phenomenon called ejaculatory anhedonia, where I am able to ejaculate and have normal sexual functioning, save that it is accompanied by a complete absence of sexual pleasure. 

This is often associated with depression (and indeed I am depressed) and particularly with SSRI medication. I have taken SSRIs in the past but I'm now taking Buproprion which has a slightly different mechanism. In any case, I have had anhedonia from the time my very first sexual experience (I guess round age 13 maybe) long before I started taking antidepressants---that is, I have never experienced any physical pleasure during sex/masturbation---and it remains unchanged today. 

Although all this is a bit first world problem-y, it does make me unhappy. There are forums devoted to this kind of thing, but I find myself in an odd sort of position. In an ideal world I'd like to be able to live as a post-transition woman able to have some kind of sex-life (even if it's all on my own). But I worry that my anhedonia will prevent that (setting aside all the other transition issues). I'd like to go about tackling it, but at the same time I'm not interested in having a fulfilling sex life as a man. 

I guess I'm asking (a) if anyone else has any thoughts about how this sort of thing might change through transition, with the effect of HRT and ideally SRS and (b) if y'all have any ideas who (i.e. which kind of medical person I should speak to about this). (I could speak to my therapist which would be easy, I also have a psychiatrist but I'm too embarrassed to speak to her, or I could speak to the gynecologist who's prescribing hormones, but it doesn't seem her area at all!) I'd really appreciate any responses. 

Hugs to all :)"

amon_erin,asktransgender,I'm not doing well mentally. Help?,"So I'm three months on HRT (4mg Estradiol/100mg Spiro a day), and mentally things are not better. Right now I'm dealing with a ton of stress from transitioning and work (doing the work of people 3 pay grades above me, voluntarily), and depression that seems to be worsening. I've been on 50mg of Zoloft for a couple months, but I went up to 100mg as of Sunday. Not doing well on it. I feel like I'm losing my mind, which I've read sometimes people feel like when changing doses on Zoloft.

I know many people feel better pretty quickly on HRT and it becomes clear to them that it was the right call. I'm at 3 months and still struggling. I get that this is a YMMV thing, but I'm still struggling with what my gender is. I identified as male for so long that this is really hard. 

I like the physical changes I've had. I like the way my body feels on HRT, my head just still feels kind of shitty. Which is probably a combination of spiro and changing the other medications I'm taking. Plus my brain ran on testosterone for so long it's going to take some time for it to figure out the new hormone in my system.

I can't get rid of negative thoughts or feelings. I can't get rid of constantly thinking of all the possible things this could be instead of being trans. Or of constantly thinking that I convinced myself I was trans. 

tl;dr version: Physically some things (basically breasts and skin) are getting better, but mentally things aren't.

And, if I'm going to be honest. It feels like the disconnect between what my mental image of myself is and what I actually see in the mirror is growing. I think I expect to see a female face. I see my square male torso and it doesn't match with the breasts or my legs/hips (which look awesome in skinny jeans btw). And my face is blah, especially the bald head. But even putting my wig on this morning didn't help. I just saw a naked boy wearing a wig with breasts this morning.

Maybe I'm making all this up. Maybe this is escapism. Maybe this is (insert some possibility that seems plausible, but likely isn't here). If I'm making everything up, why would I do that unless I'm crazy? No cis male would concoct a story that fits a trans narrative and start HRT unless they were either crazy or ??? would they?

I'm tired of asking for help and dumping my problems on other people. I really need to talk to my therapist because this is getting harder. And I can't get myself to stop taking my HRT meds. I try. And I try to think of being happy as a guy, but all that does is make me sad. But maybe that's something I've conditioned myself to feel.

How do I handle all of this stress and uncertainty? I can't stand it. I don't want to quit, but this is getting harder and I feel like I'm letting too many negative thoughts control my feelings. Sometimes I feel like I hate that I was born with a male body, and that I was probably also born with a male brain and I wish I hadn't been."
mmarkklar,asktransgender,How do the months I was on low dosages for HRT count toward my progress?,"I've been trying to judge my progress against the standard month ranges for results to happen (like that chart that gets linked here all the time) but I'm not sure how to count the months I was on low doseages.  My doctor had me at 1mg of estradiol and 100mg of spiro for 5 months (starting in March) before bumping me up to 2mg of estradiol and 200mg of spiro in July.  I feel like I've gotten more effects in the last few months, like my emotional state started changing in October.

Do I not count the first 5 months then when I try and judge my progress?"
tinyshain,asktransgender,How to cope with impatience?,"I'm an impatient person in general. For example, I'm a runner, but I'm injured now, and I haven't been able to run in almost a month, and every day I think about how much I wish I could run. Similarly, in regards to transition, every day I look in the mirror and wonder when I'll really see myself.

I was so impatient to get on T, and then I got on T. And it's been a little more than 3 months now, and while I have some good days, I'd say about 90% of the time I still feel dysphoric and like my body is wrong.

I know I shouldn't compare, but I see other guys on social media, and by months 3-4 they look different, and say how much better they're feeling. I don't feel like that. I speak, and I sound like a girl, just with a deep voice. I look in the mirror, and see the same girl I saw for years and years, only maybe a little more muscular. I'm still misgendered 85% of the time.

I know I need to give it time, but I also worry I'm going to be one of those people that testosterone doesn't work for. I want to skip ahead a year, and be past this weird, in-between genders phase, past eventual top surgery, and just move on with my life rather than waiting to feel better in my own skin.

Sorry for this whiny post. I have a lot of stuff going on in my life right now, and it's hard to focus on what I *should* be focusing on, when all of this other stuff is eating away at my thoughts.

How was everyone's week?"
Jayne-,asktransgender,Please help me get untrapped,"Sorry for the long post, hard to get it all down in one coherent thought...I've been a lurker of trans subs for a while now (about a year). I started seriously crossdressing just before that after finally giving in to the desires to do so I've had for many years (only ever used to try women's clothes on briefly and feel amazing and then quickly super ashamed...). It felt good, too good, I started dressing every chance I could, getting more clothes, it just felt so incredible, like I had awoken a part of me that had been starving my whole life. But I wanted more, I wanted my body to be more feminine, and I slowly started realising I wanted it to be a female body, and that I'd always been uncomfortable in my body, I just didn't know I had a choice to change things.

I started seeing a therapist and working on this and other things (social anxiety, zero confidence, struggles with depression etc.). I kept dressing and started changing my body (shaving, growing out my hair). 

Now that I've finally gone down this path and am exploring my gender issues I'm facing incredible doubts. I've always (since childhood) felt like this was a part of me that was wrong and bad and I had to ""overcome"" to be a good person, because somehow I had it in my head that people who don't conform are bad people (conservative parents). And I did ""overcome"" this for many years, I managed to get an advanced degree, a great career, lots of success in sports, and am in amazing shape. I even got married, and now we have our first child. 

The problem: I'm married to a woman who doesn't want to be with a (trans)woman, and we had our first child 3 months ago. On top of that, my family is transphobic, her family is extremely transphobic, and I would likely lose my job if I transitioned...so basically I would lose everything I have.

She of course noticed something was up pretty quick when I started changing my body (never dressed in female clothes around her of course), and I broke down telling her I might be trans which terrified her. She hates the idea of me as a woman, and won't let me dress when she's around, and said she will leave if I dress around her or our families/friends find out.

My real problem is: I don't know for sure if I actually am trans or if I've somehow tricked myself in to feeling like I want to be a woman because it makes me happy in the comfort of my own home. What scares me most is I actually feel desirable and attractive as a woman (even though I know that people would probably think I look disgusting...), I feel indifferent to unhappy about my male body but when I in female mode it just makes me feel so content and beautiful. I'm scared I'm just being superficial and deluded and perverted (like many, I've watched my share of sissy/feminization content)

Unfortunately taking any further steps to explore gender means divorce, and a huge public blowup that surrounds that, with everyone knowing it's my fault, and probably knowing why we broke up. I can't take the thought of taking these steps, being outed like that before I know it's what I need, and then regret it and realise I could have just kept these feelings enough in check throughout my life to stay married.

I love my wife and want to keep this family together for her and my child, but it hurts so unbelievably much knowing I can't share myself and what makes me feel so happy with the person I love most. This is absolutley tearing me up. I feel like a failure and a freak, and the person who was supposed to support me most is disgusted by me. I be been so ashamed of this for so long I'm not sure I'll ever feel different...

I've stopped seeing my therapist and am trying to hide from this becuade it's just painful, but these feelings won't let me. So here I am, posting on a forum where hopefully someone can relate or care or offer some kind of advice.

Please help me, what can I do to satisfy these feelings so they don't ruin everything I've worked for my entire life. Or what can I do to get rid of these doubts and have confidence in who I am, something I've never had. 

I just wish I could be normal, and that I didn't have these feelings. My whole life I ignored this (and many other) emotional issues because I was awful at dealing with them and saw feelings and emotions as weak and interfering with doing what was right, now my emotions are destroying me. I feel so trapped and helpless to do anything about it without profound negative consequences.

I've started thinking about ending things when I get hit with these intense waves of longing to be female and feeling so ashamed I can't overcome them for the better of my family. Sometimes these feelings last hours, sometimes days of awfulness. I don't want my gender to define me, but Im scared I may not have a choice for much longer. How can I possibly get out of this situation?"
krm_88,asktransgender,Handling Gender Dysphoria,"Good evening everyone,

I'm a long-time lurker here, so I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for posting all of the useful information here.

Some background info: about a year ago, I started on the path that eventually led me to the conclusion that I am MTF transgendered, and that I have likely been dealing with Gender Dysphoria for a substantial length of time through various means (most of which either do not work anymore, or are impractical due to time constraints).

The problem that I am now having (and most likely, the reason that I noticed it in the first place) is that what I assume to be Gender Dysphoria has been far outstripping my ability to deal with it. There are times when something basically ""sets it off"" (most commonly, certain social situations), and for varied lengths of time (I've seen it last anywhere from a day to two weeks), I feel completely and uncontrollably awful (mentally), regardless of what I do; I also feel as though I am going to cry/have some form of emotional outburst the entire time (which is extremely unusual for me, as I am normally not an emotional person in the least).

For better or worse, I am likely going to have to handle the brunt of this on my own for a few years; I have a therapist that is completely unfamiliar with gender-related issues, and due to being in the military (and in a very LGBT-unfriendly workplace), have a somewhat iffy prospect of being able to medically transition for a while. My questions are as follows:

1. Is what I described likely to be an offshoot of my Gender Dysphoria, or should I be approaching the issue from another angle?

2. (Under the assumption that it is Gender Dysphoria related) For folks who may have experienced similar (or are used to dealing with Gender Dysphoria in general), what methods have you used to cope with it/stop it from being quite so overwhelmingly bad?

Any insight that you folks have would be greatly appreciated!"

Like, I don't even think I am trans at the moment. I just think I'm just a confused cisgender person, who just wants to be a girl for a fetish, and how I will regret transitioning, and how I'm stupid thinking I'm trans and I am just a crossdresser who is being trans as an excuse.


I've had several signs of being trans over childhood, but I'm now just thinking that they where just coincidences and it is unrelated to me being trans. 


It just makes me really frustrated when I'm less dysphoric. You'd think it would be the other way round, but I just hate it so goddamn much. I'm just so worried about my future.

mackleman64,asktransgender,how do i do this?,"i feel like the best explanation of my situation would be a rant i had in a convo with a friend so i'll just give you that

&gt; i cant live as a boy becuase ill always be ”my parents lil girl” and be called ridiculous and/or bored and if i try anything like that in [my home country] and say im serious about it disowned will probably not be enough to describe what will happen to me there with the rest of my family, i dont doubt they would be violent

&gt; the only way for this to be possible were if i would run away and i cant put my parents thru that kind of pain bcus they obvs love me and want the best for me

&gt; i mean ive already disappointed them enough with being [omitted] or be a girl, really

&gt; i u´just dont know if i can live like this anymore i need to get out of this as soon as possible

&gt; [...]

&gt; i should be happy my situation isnt worse tho

&gt; at least im p sure my closest family wont be violent towards me if they ever realize im serious about ths

&gt; i hate this whenever i finally get to be happy my brain finds something else to completely destroy itself over

certain pieces of info have been omitted for the sake of my privacy and comfort.

explaining/expanding some things:

* i have heavy chest and social dysphoria. it's been on and off since i realized i was trans but lately it's gotten to the point where im literally nauseous and feeling like i'm choking because of it. it might have been present before in the form of hating being a girl and everything thats got to do with being one prior to me realizing it was dysphoria.

* i am on the brink of becoming a legal adult (almost 18). i am not allowed my own bank account or buying things over the internet without it going through my parents first, although they will give me money if i ask.

* i have tried coming out several times before. it has not worked, my parents essentially called me bored/ridiculous/unnatural, ignored it and acted as though i was still cis. i have not notified them because i fear being a bother/dont want them to get mad. the last time i tried to come out was a few weeks ago, and i was once told that i was just bored. i will not try to come out again.

* (note: my parents have never been violent when i have tried coming out to them.)

* i have tried binding before, previously using a belt, and now using a sports bra and lots of sports tape. both are difficult to breathe in, but it beats walking around hating myself.

* i am in contact with my country's psychiatry system due to being suicidal, however i am not out to them. they have given me their contact info incase it became acute, and it has been many times since then, but i dont want to be a nuisance and ruin the new year for my parents. i have tried being on a suicide hotline chat, but they never gave me their services. i can't call anyone else than my mom without almost getting a panic attack.

wow ok i feel like this is becoming a sob story sorry haha.

it is getting pretty bad for me though, i really need help with proceeding with this. i didn't think i'd live to see 18 and i honestly dont think i will if it keeps up like this.

please give me tips on what i can do.

thank you in advance.

notreallysubtle,asktransgender,Facial structure question,"I just want to start this with a disclaimer, if anyone who knows me in real life sees this, contact me asap.

I've been questioning myself for a very long time, but I haven't started anything yet. I'm almost positive that I'm female. Only out to one person.

With that being said, I'm really insecure about how I look, as you can probably imagine. I have seen a lot of before-after HRT pictures, and noticed that there is changes to the face. I don't buy into that gimmicky virtual FFS, so I thought I'd get a more organic opinion here.

What do you think of my facial structure? Do you think HRT will be a big effect on my face, or would it be very subtle? Do you think my face is ""Compatible"" in a general sense? Neanderthal? Don't worry about offense or anything.

Edit: Removed link, I'm happy with amount of opinions given.

Big thanks to all of you. A lot of posts here on this subreddit helped me through tough times. Thanks to that, I'm starting to feel energized."

There is this downside though : I don't always feel hormonally well. There are days that the HRT makes me feel like shit.

throwawayaccount5976,asktransgender,Mulling over suicide.,"I have been having this feeling that suicide is inevitable lately.  I can't stop feeling bad about it.  Not because I don't want to kill myself, but because of the people it might hurt or just thinking of people who would love to have my life.  

I'm in my early 20's, I make $140k a year in a career I love.  I've been on HRT for 4 years.  I just feel so shitty all the time though.  I'm out to everybody in my life, but I can't pass.  I've never had a ""male fail"" so nobody really ever thinks I'm a woman.  I guess I'm not doing much though. I have earrings and wear nail polish and have what I would consider an androgynous hair cut (I've seen women with the same haircut).  I am so stuck because I feel that unless I can wear a hoodie and jeans and be gendered correctly in a picture then none of this is worth it.  It'll just be this gross person playing a dress up game to everybody else and probably somewhat to myself honestly.  

Therapist just ""fired"" me as a client because it was claimed I wasn't making any progress with them.  Personally I thought they were the worst therapist I'd ever had, but I stuck with them because it was hard to find a new one that took my insurance.  After the ordeal of being told I should see someone else, I have just been thinking what would I get out of therapy.  What are goals that therapy will help me accomplish.  I feel so stuck.  The therapist probably won't help me change my thought patterns just like this one couldn't.  Being constantly told you don't move enough like a woman and your voice isn't good didn't help.  That wasn't what I was waiting on.  What actionable goals would therapy help with at this point.  It is frustrating to me because I feel like I'm not helping myself, but why should I bother it probably won't get too much better than living as a guy and being miserable.

I'm just so tired at this point.  I have 2 liters of formic acid and 2 liters of sulfuric acid in my closet and I'm thinking of driving somewhere remote and just gassing myself.    

I don't know why I'm posting this.  This isn't an urgent thing or something was probably gonna wait until after Christmas so I'm not doing at the time when everybody else is killing themselves.  Sigh.   "

Rhydge,asktransgender,Struggling with relationships,"Foreword: Insanely long post ahead. I've tried to format it so you can skip through and read only what you are interested in/have time for.

Let me quickly preface this with I spent a long time debating whether to put this on relationship advice or ask transgender, or even polyamory, but I think this deals with some details that are more suited/could be better understood here. I don't think she reddits often but with the holidays and my situation it's possible she visits this sub, so I'm posting on an alt ;-;
-----------------------------------------------------------------
**Background info**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I am 21 mtf been on HRT for around a year but I still present male. Half of this problem has to do with a relationship, and half has to do with problems I'm dealing with as being transgender. Help/advice with either part are greatly appreciated :)

I've been with my fiancee 20/cis/f for around several years now. She's been incredibly supportive of my transition and I am insanely thankful for, she has done so much for me. Which makes me feel even more guilty (you'll notice as we get further into this it just gets more and more complicated). I have discussed with my s/o that I often feel polyamorous. She and I even did a triad twice, with one going incredibly well, but when it ended she was pretty hurt (our third person kinda broke it off suddenly and in a pretty ehh way, story for another time though) so we've kinda been relaxing on the whole dating thing for now.

Fast forwards a few months and we move out quite a ways away from both of our families. I started work pretty much right away and my girlfriend is about to start school here.

**The Problem Starts**

And now I've met another girl. I've known I kinda had a crush on this other girl since I met her. We share a lot of interests, we've spent some decent amount of time together, but I haven't really pushed to get to know her more for a few reasons. One of them is that I feel if I try to talk to her more and get to know her really well I'll definitely want to date here (I mean... I kinda already do....) but I see her on an almost daily basis and it's getting more and more difficult to keep myself from talking to her a bunch. I can't stop thinking about her though, I have dreams about just working up the nerve to ask her for coffee all the time, but I always wake up guilty, because I wake up next to my girlfriend.... Or I guess more like my fiancee now...

**The situation gets a little complicated**

I am nervous to talk to my fiancee about it because I don't think she'd want to date another person right now, I also don't think she'd be okay with me dating another person on my own, or even if the third person would be interested in that style of relationship. I have been afraid to bring it up because my fiancee is slipping into a slight depression because of the time of year and stress of the move. Like I said though I can't stop thinking about this other girl, so it makes me want to talk about it, but I don't want to make her depression worse or make the holidays sour.

**It gets even more complicated**

More complicated you say? Well this girl I like.... she's also my boss.... I think that doesn't need too much explanation. She's not the ""head honcho"" so it's not as bad as it could be, and I'm getting promoted to her same position soon, I've been wanting to ask her out to coffee or something because we obviously wouldn't be able to talk about a relationship at work. But I always get nervous and guilty because I haven't talked to my s/o about it yet, and... well because of the next reason...

**The nail in the coffin**

Finally, since I'm transgender, I have this constant worry that no matter what route I take, I'll end up unloved. If I tell my fiancee about this other girl, she won't love me anymore. If I take a risk and talk to this other girl, she won't love me because I'm trans. I feel like I shouldn't say anything or talk about this problem to my fiancee because I owe her so much for being so kind and accepting of everything else, especially my transition, which I did not expect her to be okay with. She's even tried being poly with me, and I feel so guilty about having feelings for another person but I can't stop them. I'll probably talk to my fiancee about it soon, it seems like the best way to go about it but I feel like the best thing to do is just forget about this other girl and let it blow over, but I'd never be happy not talking about my feelings to her, or at least to my s/o. I still feel awful about myself, and worried about everything, my living situation, my relationship, my potential relationship.... It's driving my crazy.

Thanks to those of you who made it to the end and decided to give advice/comment on the situation!"
Jazz8680,asktransgender,"For the last time, do cis people really not have these thoughts?","I've been going over everything in my head over and over. Everything points to maybe being trans, but I still have no idea. Ive read it countless times, ""cis people don't generally question their gender"". Like I know that not EVERY cis person doesn't question their gender, but for the exceptions, do they ever act on it? Like I've been big time questioning my gender and for the past couple of days I've been trying makeup and a little bit of female clothing (AMAB). Would a cis person take it this far? Would they seriously consider questioning their gender? I read something once that said that cis people treat questioning their gender like questioning one's race. Like they would imagine themselves as a different gender at the same level of imagining they were born a different ethnicity. 

I'm sorry if the grammar is off or anything like that, I'm just typing fast and panicking a little. "
doingo999999990000,asktransgender,I think I may be transgender.,"Hi. I am a 25 y/o ""man"", and if I was writing this post three or four years ago, I don't think I would have put inverted commas around that noun.

Having these feelings is terrifying. All I can think about is having the right body, a female body. When I put on female clothing and angle myself just right in the mirror, so that I look a fraction of how I want to, it feels like happiness... Yet I turn a bit bit more and there are my muscles, my angular face, my broad shoulders. The immediate depression, the sense of impossibility, is overwhelming. 

I fantasize about a deep sort of contentment that comes with being who one is. 

I read everything about trans women and men and gender diversity that I can find. Julia Serano's book, Whipping Girl, helped me realise that it's possible to be trans in any way that you want. It helped me realise that my desire is to *be* a woman. To feel that sense of being. Being in place, being in body, in society, in family and friends as a woman. 

But for every resolution that I make--that I must be trans, or else why can't I stop thinking about it?--comes in equal parts a series of denials. It will go away. You can manage it in private. I am terrified of my conservative family... and even my friends. I just wish I could be alone and be who I am without fear.

I have only realised recently how much courage it takes to move forward, to accept. And I have such a huge amount of respect and admiration for every person in this community.  

I'm still not there yet. How do you even begin to tell people when you're not sure yourself? If you're not even sure that you want to accept your unsure-ness?

Thanks for reading,

mw18582,asktransgender,"So, I told my parents as part of therapy and getting green light for HRT. All my fears are gone. Anyone else with a similar narrative?","My brain has been agonizing over all possible pros and cons, the possible regrets, the endless searching for validation of this 'condition'. Am I real enough? Not gone insane? Not craving attention, searching for identity or existentially bored?

Ever since puberty my relationship with my father has been on troubled foot. I cannot talk about him without getting emotional to the point I will just start crying. Mind you, I am 33 by now and still seek his validation, even though I rarely ever see him. My therapist noted my circular and endless reasoning patterns always involved my dad at some point and required me to them / him before continuing. Needless to say, I was terrified and it has been the hardest thing to do in this whole process! 

So. I told them and ever since that day (a few days ago) and it was nothing like I imagined. Absolutely zero resistance. Just sincere interest and as far as questions would go, they were in line of, ""do you feel peace?"".
I can focus on my job again without constantly crawling the internet for more stories. I accept myself. Finally. Fully. No more noise.
So here my final question. Anyone familiar with this? Not seeking for validation anymore. But just curiosity this time. :) 

Thank you everyone here that has spoken to me, or unbeknownst helped me by me reading your stories, comments, struggles and victories &lt;3 

**Some additional clarification**: my therapist required me to out, *regardless* of outcome. I am assuming his line of reasoning is that it helps me in accepting myself *independent* of how I think my parent's would validate or invalidate me. Luckily they are totally supportive, but even if they hadn't, it was a necessary step to stop my own endless circular reasoning.

orangejuiceandchips,asktransgender,Finding time to practice makeup and feminine voice?,"I'm 21 MtF and finally have my letter for HRT, and will be starting in 1-2 weeks. I've always had the same group of gamer guy friends, and in the past we'd always be up until 2-4am.. as a night owl, that was normal to me. As a boy I could do this, because nobody really gave a shit how tired I was or what I looked like in the mornings (and neither did I).

Nowadays I do care what I look like. I want to stick to morning and nightly skincare routines. I want to remove the bags under my eyes. I want to learn makeup and practice my girl voice. Now that HRT is 1-2 weeks away, I'm realising that I need to get a move on with all of this stuff.

Here's the problem: I'm not out and won't come out until about 6 months into HRT. My friends usually stay up till 11pm now because of work, so I stay online with them till then. Afterwards I'm usually tired and unmotivated to practice makeup, but late at night is like the only time to do that without being caught... and if I stay up late, the next day I'm SO tired and sometimes start work at 9am, which sucks. If I don't go online with friends at night, I'm ""dogging"" them (male way of saying ""abandoning""). They get especially annoyed if I don't tell them why I'm not on.

For any MtF's: how did you find time to practice makeup and your voice? What time did you do makeup discretely (assuming you were in closet like me)? Where and when could you train your voice without someone hearing?

LoveIinus,asktransgender,Need advice for my facial hair removal!,"Hello everyone :) so... I've begun doing my facial hair removal back in early October so 2 months in and I'm basically hairless on my upper lip, great! However the hairs on my chin seem to come back with a vengeance. It stopped after like a month of treatment but after that I'm getting those thick dark hairs and I basically have to shave everyday again. I didn't need to shave at all during the first 5-7 weeks of treatment. So I read up about electrolysis, laser hair removal and hair growth cycles and I'm wondering if there's something that I've done wrong.

So the salon I've been to is one of the most recommended where I live. They do hair removal for Caucasians and Indians and transsexuals of that ethnicity - you know they typically have A LOT of hair. I'm Chinese and I am only able to grow facial hair on my upper lip and chin, nothing else.
So the treatment that they have recommended me is laser + electrolysis. Basically there's a special package price that includes electrolysis + laser for 1 session which is just twice the price of 1 electrolysis session. But what they actually do is using electrolysis to remove all of your facial hair then proceed with laser and you're done. I noticed something wrong - I thought the hairs need to be intact in order for the laser to work? Or am I missing something here?

So... I have done like 3 electrolysis sessions and 2 electrolysis + laser sessions. Very happy to see almost no hair on my upper lip but my CHIN. Oh god it looks as though nothing has changed. Still the same thick hair, shaving required everyday. I have stopped after 2 laser sessions because I found a deal at another salon (Groupon) for 4 sessions worth. I'm so confused and I need help from all the veterans here.

Is it okay to do electrolysis in between laser sessions?
Is it okay to pluck my facial hair after a laser session?
Was it due to the shaving that caused faster regrowth and thicker hair AGAIN?

What should I do??

Almost on 4 months HRT and need facial hair to go away..... :( "
dragonheart01,asktransgender,Shrink and parent questions,"So I no longer have a gender therapist and just would like to know how to help my normal therapist and psychiatrist help me. Currently, hormones are weighing a lot on my mind, but I can't get them due to age yet. My psychiatrist says that I probably won't get them until I am ""stable"", which I interpret as completely functioning and normal. I going to an endo soon to get puberty suppressants and am glad for that, but I don't think I will be able to reach the ""stable"" level my psychiatrists wants and am worried. Also, my mother is denying that she is denying that I am trans while denying I'm trans. She keeps coming up with stuff like ""It is so wrong that I getting you puberty suppressants"", ""I won't let you get estrogen until you are 18"", and worst of all ""It is an evolving process"" when I have explained I have thought a lot about this and have explained that to here. I have tried to deal with by agreeing on some aspects and being open, but that does seem to work. I have also tried to just yell at her and force into accepting, but that had the same result. I don't know what to do with, especially since she is delaying medical care as much as possible because of her attitude.

throwawaytransnessfu,asktransgender,How common is it to be treated like a lesser person by surgeons that do FFS?,"The two famous ones I have gone to are Spiegel and Deschamps-Braly. They both treated me like they're so much better than me and they can decide what my face should look like and I shouldn't say a word. It makes me want to just go to a regular well known plastic surgeon instead because these guys sound like they have an idea of what transgender men need to get done in an assembly line to get what they think is female enough for them. Which honestly kind of looks like someone hit you with a frying pan and your face is now flat. It kind of feels like crap to pay these people.

The only people that treated me nicely and with care so far in the consultations were the facial team. But they're so far away from the US and that kind of sucks because I would need airfare, hotel and all that stuff.

i know, my sexuality doesn’t have to connect with my gender but if i transition, what are the odds of me finding a girl i’m into who is also into transition me? i’ll be lonely. sometimes i’m confident that i want to be a girl, and then my heart will ache realizing that girl i just saw will likely never be into me if i transition. and now i’m back to square one, doubting myself all over again. my entire life is at stake and i’m running out of time, and i feel so tired.  i dont know how to find a therapist, i have no money. i'm underage. i've come out to one person, but because i'm so awkward around people i cant even talk to them. i don’t want to be sad.

Boob-a-saurus-Rex,asktransgender,What actually is the difference between men and women?,"Sure there are some social differences, but almost all of those are all made up by society to enforce certain roles. 

There are some biological differences like males being physically bigger and stronger, sex characteristics, and certain brain components are different sizes and function slightly differently, but if that is all there is, it seems like there's actually not really that much of a difference between men and women. 

It's like we are just human and we don't actually have a purpose other than to breed, and since we are so intelligent/self aware, we dont even have to do that either. 

So what exactly defines man and woman?

Just that we identify as a human on the masculine and feminine spectrum? But then there are masculine women. And feminine men. 

Anyways I don't know if this really makes sense but I just want to hear your opinions on this. :)

also, secondly, how long am i supposed to wait for the pill to dissolve and be absorbed under my tongue? im taking just 1 pill at a time, and it takes maybe 5 mins to completely dissolve, but i still keep evrything undr my tongue  for another 5 mins just in case?

idk, im starting to wish i had the patches instead"

jeffa_jaffa,asktransgender,I've just realised how angry I am. Should I be angry?,"Disclaimer,  I'm a cis male,  my wife is mtf

Yesterday i had a call from my wife,  asking if I could go and pick her up from work.  She'd been accidentally hit in the head by a large bottle of coke,  &amp; was knocked unconscious for a while.  When I vote there the paramedic was just leaving,  &amp; said that she was basically fine,  but that I could expect her to be a bit woozy for a while.  As I was driving her home,  she told me what had happened in detail.  It seems that the paramedic asked her if she was on any drugs or medication,  &amp; she said she as on HRT. She can't remember if she said it was because she is trans ,  or if he asked her why she was on HRT,  but somehow he found out she was trans.  He then started to ask all sorts of questions about surgery,  if she still had a penis etc.  I don't see how any of this is relevant to dealing with a head injury.  

I understand that they need to ask about medication &amp; drugs,  but surely they don't need to know if she's trans? I said to her that if it ever happens again she should just decline to answer,  or so that it's not relevant.  I'm grateful for the paramedics help, but am I justified in being angry that he kept asking questions about her trans-ness? Even if she volunteered the information,  he should have just said okay,  and then moved on.

Also, how do you guys deal with this sort of thing? 

Edit! Wife is fine,  in fact she was very pleased about being able to leave work early.  Also, thanks for your kind words and advice.  I'm going to let her decide if she wants to put in a complaint or not.  "

When do you have your dosage, before or after meals, morning or night? I think they said that it didn't matter when i have it but anyways.

JainaJediPrincess,asktransgender,Breast Soreness Wearing Off?,"I'm roughly 3.5 months into HRT, my nipples have been sore since 2 months in. Now it seems to be wearing off. I think I already have breast buds, there's something behind the nipple and close to my chest. It's sort of like a round disk shape about as big as a quarter.

But I am worried about the lack of soreness. Before I could barely have anything touch them, now I have to poke them or lay down on them. Even then, it's not as painful as it was. Is that to be expected?"
KFBlaziken,asktransgender,MTF: Questions about Penis Functionality after HRT,"Hey all :)
Just wanted to ask about people's experience with maintaining penile functionality while on Hormones. I've been looking around trying to find an answer but I haven't found anything particularly definitive. I've seen a lot of girls say that they still work fine down there, albeit with a female sex drive (which is to be expected :P), but I've also seen people saying that they can only become erect through chemical stimulants like Viagra or that they have completely lost all functionality for penetration. I've been worried that I was in a rather unique scenario, in that I actually like my penis and don't feel and dysphoria from it, but it's been comforting to find that being ""non-op"" is an actual thing. So if any of you girls out there are non-op and could give me some info as to what I can expect it would be very much appreciated, I understand this is a very ""your mileage at vary"" type situation, but currently this is one of the main reasons I'm still hesitant.
Thank you all so much! &lt;3"
scared2transition,asktransgender,I canceled my FFS and this is why,"I do not know where to start, all I know is that my dreams were crushed. I have been on HRT for 5 years now, with very little improvement. My biggest hope was to get FFS and be able to blend in without sticking like a sore thumb. Now, I know that you all are against passing and that you will consider me a traitor and that I will get a lot of blacklash... you might say we should be proud to be trans, but I have personally witnessed cases of my friends who are struggling because they do not pass... and they are afraid for their lives wherever they go and they get ridiculed and cannot find a gainful employment, due to their appearance. In an ideal world, we should be able to be respected no matter what we look, but this is a sad reality. 

So, I decided that my best bet was to get FFS in order to transition. I consulted with a couple of famous doctors in the US in the last few months and they all placed excessive emphasis on hairstyles to pass and how, even after FFS, I'll have to work hard with my hair. That was a red flag.  Sorry, but if I spend huge amounts of money on FFS, I do not want to hide my face with hair, especially because I am a beach girl and I love going to the pool. So, I want to have a passable face when I tie my hair up. In addition to that, I work in a bakery and we are required to wear sanitary caps with no hair showing, so, again, I cannot live the rest of my life worrying about hiding my face with hair. 

Apart from that, I asked one surgeon if he had unhappy patients and why they were unhappy and he said his only unhappy patients have BDD and psychological issues. Don't you think it is very disrespectful to say? 

Regardless, the last nail on the coffin was that I met two patients who had FFS and were very unhappy and I can see that they have real problems: the hairline slipped back raising the brows, the forehead has very unnatural contours and seems unnaturally flat. The skin sagged, despite their young age... I decided to cancel and I hope I did the right thing"

honaka_namnah,asktransgender,Does anyone have any experience with Monstrey/Houtmeyers in Belgium for SRS?,"Dr Houtmeyers trained with Dr Monstrey but has his own practice nowadays. A month ago I had a nice talk with Dr Houtmeyers and I'm currently considering having my surgery with him. I've heard from a few people who were quite happy with their results.

Some info I collected:

* If you live in Belgium the cost currently is €3500 for SRS and a supplement of €1500 if you want BA (same operation).
* You need to be at least 1 year on HRT and need a referral from endo *and* psy.
* They use the penile inversion method and use skin grafts from the stomach if they don't have enough material for depth.
* Genital hair removal is required.
* After ~6 weeks you can resume work and sports like swimming.
* Dr Monstrey is the surgeon with the gender clinic in Ghent and the waiting times are several years now.
* Waiting times with Dr Houtmeyers are (only) about 6 months.

I did read a few negative comments online about Dr Monstrey, saying the vagina doesn't have a natural look and lacks labia. I find that a bit hard to believe because Dr Houtmeyers explained to me which skin they use to create labia. I never saw any pictures of their work so I can't verify.

**Anyway, I was wondering if anyone had surgery with either of them or know anyone who did? If so, what are you experiences?**

edit/update: they can show you some pictures of previous results during a consultation. I was planning on making a new appointment in the coming months anyway so I'll ask then. At least they're confident enough to share what they're capable of."

astriarch,asktransgender,Parents are skeptical of Informed Consent. Studies/Articles to convince them otherwise?,"Whole text here is background; feel free to skip if you want.

I've spent a lot of time at college thinking this semester (probably about 600 hours) and I'm dead certain I am transgender and want to start hormones ASAP. But I came out to my dad earlier than was ideal, while I was very tired and with uncollected thoughts -- made it sound like I was still questioning.

I'm now out to both parents, with well-intentioned, if sometimes misguided, support. Mom is very loving and concerned for my mental health. Dad is more quiet on the topic, but it would be in character for him to be concerned that liberal therapists are trying to rush me. I recently expressed my intentions to start hormones, to a lukewarm response. Apparently they had done research and found standards which suggested months of diagnosis/therapy/coping mechanisms before starting anything medical.

My therapist is great, but the one psychiatrist meeting I conceded was hellish. There is informed consent around my area, and I provided them with the website and the fundamentals of why IC is the way to go. I'm not out to the rest of my large family, so we're headed out to lunch in two hours or so to discuss/debate. I have no intentions of wavering, and it is incredibly important that I convince them this is what's best for me.

Can anyone provide any material which could help me help them help me?"

Obviously, I don't suffer from genital dysphoria, so there's that.

Since I'm on cyproterone I only really have urges every few weeks, so it's safe to say those parts aren't used much.

But today something unusual happened, I was in the mood, did it, it felt particulary good (Both from holding up and I guess a bit of something else I can't put my finger on). So far so good.

Last year he met the son of one of his friends.  The son is not trans but regularly dresses as a woman, is gay, does drag shows, etc.  my dad would make fun of the son (not to his face) and say pretty bad things.

However he let him do his makeup for a Halloween show thingy and was completely fine around him.

Then my step brother came out as gay and my dad was pretty much forced to accept him (same thing for my step mother) now they say hurtful things behind his back.  They even said ""he better not bring home one of those **** that likes to dress like a woman"" 

How do I tell him when this is how he behaves?  I don't want to lose him because our relationship just started improving 2 years ago.  "

I've got only one IRL friend and she doesn't really want to talk to me/doesn't make the effort to. Last time I tried talking to her I felt like I scared her away by being too invasive with questions. I guess it boils down to me not knowing how to conversate through text very well either. The only real friend I have is my boyfriend. The problem is he's so stressed out from work every single day and has anger issues. So I'm sort of shit out of luck in that department. 

At this point, I just want to say fuck it and just run off somewhere. I'm not really that worried about what'll happen to me to be honest. I don't know where I'd go or where I'd sleep but being here is driving me crazy. The only thing I do every day is hop on Runescape and play that all day. I stay up till like 3am and then repeat the process the next day. The semester is over as well so I don't actually have anything I need to do now. 

I have little to no self-esteem nor care for my well being. Not sure what to do now, but pretty ready to just get up and go.

im emerald, im 17, im MtF, and pre-everything, although it could change soon.

theres the potential i could see a therapist, and then they could prescribe me to blockers at the least. but this is a very optimistic view on it. 

more realistically, my current therapist (not sprecialized in trans or LGBT issues) will refer me to a therapist that specializes in transgender issues, and then tells my mother that i need to start soon (but a few more months wont be so bad ;n;), and at least put me on blockers.

IF THIS DOES HAPPEN (and boy is it ever an 'if') what are the effects of being purely on blockers? i wanna know just in case, and because i should know anyways."
astral-weeks,asktransgender,Finally found a place to live - should I tell my new housemates I'm trans before moving in?,"FTM here, in the UK.

After six weeks of going to viewings, I've finally found a place to live. I've only met one out of the four other housemates, and she was obviously really liberal. I haven't told her I'm trans and I don't know if I want to send her a fb message before moving in to tell her. 

I'm pre-top surgery and don't wear a binder most days, and I work for an LGBT charity, so it will come out at some point that I'm trans. And I'm sharing a bathroom with the two other guys, so that toilet seat is going to be going up and down a lot.  At the moment they just think I'm a cis guy.

The big downside I see with coming out now is that it'll give them the whole two weeks before I move in to think of me as 'maybe a she'. From my experience this is the normal response when I'm not there to give a trans 101 after disclosing. The upside is that if there's any massive transphobes, I might find out now instead of once I've already signed the lease and moved in.

What do you reckon?"

the_forsaken_queen,asktransgender,I'm sceptical about my doctor's method of treatment.,"I'm an 18 year old MtF girl who's currently not on hormones. I finally got an appointment with a private doctor and we established that I'm definitely trans. We of course decided that feminization would be ideal for resolving all of my dysphoria and body image issues, or at least the vast majority of them, and she told me she'd give me testosterone blocker injections as soon as possible.

Now, I'm not exactly a confrontational type nor am I one to question a trained doctor's abilities, but she said something that I'm fairly sure contradicts what I read on this subreddit. She told me it'd be pointless to prescribe hormones before I've received injections (very, very expensive ones to boot that I'd rather avoid) that entirely stunt the development of testosterone.

Apparently, a combination of estradiol + spiro/cypro/finasteride (or any common anti-androgen) alone is insufficient for lowering the testosterone of someone at my age and would have little to no effects. She claimed that generally only works for older women.

It's my understanding that puberty blocking injections are generally only given to trans children whom need additional time to discover themselves before additional steps are taken. For everyone else a combination of estrogen and a standard anti-androgen in pill/patch/injection form is more than enough.

I'm also worried about the implications of having zero sex hormones running through my body for an extended period of time. I like sex and I'd rather not lose my libido permanently.

Is she wrong or am I misinformed?

Thanks.

mashedvote,asktransgender,What kind of laser is best against beards?,"I realised pretty recently that despite appearances I might actually be a girl.

There are quite a few clinics near me. The information and marketing on their websites is aimed at cis women and I'm wondering if there is anything I should consider when choosing which treatment or laser system to go with. Is there a particular kind that is best for male facial hair?

I am not sure if I am transgender. I have never felt like I can fit into right strait heteronormativ behavior but that was to the fact I tought I was gay. The thing is my entire life I behaved like straight dude, I was fiting in that role perfectly exept that my whole life I was pressuring my self to be straight. I had girlfriends and even tough it wasn't natural for me to get an erection I could, when I managed to calm my self, to sleep with them. But I have allways wanted go be with guy to be hugged and secure, and to be ""woman"" in same sex relationship. But now I don't know if I am a woman.  When I came out and started living as gay man I let myself behave like l always wanted to and in one moment I didn't feel like man, I felt womanly. The fact is I am not sure if this my internalised homophobia and my mind is resisting to accept the fact I am effeminate or that I am realy woman and my mind won't accept that.  I don't have gender dysphoria but I do feel like I grew up to be someone I am not and I don't know how to let old me and be real since I don't know who I am.

Aft_Ant32,asktransgender,[MTF] Does HRT affect the growth rate of head hair ?,"So i'm still pre-hrt and working on feminizing my looks, voice etc. but one thing i'm struggling with is how slow my hair grows. Ever since puberty the longest it would ever seem to go was just below the bottom of my ears, and wouldn't go much longer, and I usually had to get it cut short again not too long after that. Would hrt affect this or does it just change things like hairline etc. ?

P.S. Merry belated Christmas/hanukkah/Kwanza etc. to all you amazing people !!

Acefacemace,asktransgender,Resources for better understanding/empathising with the trans experience (from a cis point of view)?,"Hi- so just tonight I've been in a situation where I've caused hurt and offence to somebody (a trans person) just because I know very little about the trans experience, and I said something insensitive. I won't go into details but it's obvious that I need to try harder to be more empathetic and try harder to understand, well, what life is like for people who are trans. So I'm interested in blogs, articles, vlogs- whatever really. Thanks for reading this far if you did!"
anonblarg,asktransgender,Question about Body Hair on HRT,"Hey,

I know this must be a common topic, but I was just looking for some specific experience with body hair after starting hrt (mtf).

I know that facial and chest hair will not change at all and must be removed if not wanted, but how about the rest of the body?

Specifically:

What happens to the hair on your belly down to happy trail?

Does leg and arm hair change in any way?

How about underarm and pubic hair?

Finally, I have slightly curly hair, that naturally flows backwards and would likely grow into an afro before falling like normal hair. Are any major changes to be expected in head hair, or an I looking at a lot of hair straightening in my future?

I am lucky that I have practically white body and facial hair (even my eyebrows xD) so it's not a massive issue, but I am very curious about how it may change going forward. (Not looking forward to all the electrolyse I will need though T.T)

Thanks for any help you may provide, and Happy Holidays!"

Anyway, I was at work and somebody referred to me as ""her."" He was decently old and I dress pretty femininely with longish hair.  I haven't even started hrt just yet, but it felt pretty good.  I was depressed earlier today because of my high-pitched but definitely masculine voice, but after today I feel optimistic about the future.

MaddisonBeth,asktransgender,.... transitioning in prison thoughts?,So six months or so ago I came out at work. I work as a mental health professional and am working on my independent license. I work for a state prison in Indiana. A month ago I began HRT. Any thoughts on how to effectively deal with rumors? My Facebook profile has already been shown to offenders by staff and officers are primarily  not making comments to my face. The admin of the prison is supportive as is my mental health department. Best I have been able to find there haven't been many success stories for professionals transitioning in this environment. One of the main concerns I have is body searches. We are supposed to be searched by same gender officers but male officers are beginning to feel weird about it. And I don't want to end up labeled a sex offender if a new female officer pats me down with out knowing I'm not cis thanks for any thoughts or ideas

Larima,asktransgender,"I'm planning on getting an orchiectomy soon, but would like to know a few things.","As mentioned, I'm planning to get an orchi soon (mainly for monetary and liver reasons). I don't plan to get vaginoplasty or anything else after it, just the orchi. I'm looking forward to it.

There's just one thing: I don't want that damnable skin-flap around. It's irritating to shave, it gets in the way during sex, it's ugly, and it generally disgusts me. It simply must go.

However:

It it does go, will I be disposing of those nerve endings with it?

How much pushback from the surgeon can I expect when I say I want it to go?

Is there any reason to keep it beyond saving the skin for vaginoplasty?

I can't find any pictures of what things look like after healing if I get it removed, and would like to see what I'm buying.

I've seen cost reports vary wildly since it's not the most common procedure. That being said, I'm in the Baltimore/DC/New York area. What do the surgeons around there usually charge, if anyone knows?

violaceous_trogon,asktransgender,"Trans (ex) Boy Scouts, how do you deal with seeing people from your old Scout troop?","I know this is a rather niche question, but I figure there's at least one other trans scout here.

So I'm an Eagle Scout. I haven't been involved with the organization for over three years. But apparently one of the younger guys in my troop is going to my university, and honestly i'm kinda scared of running into him. 

I also occasionally get invited to Scouting ceremonies and events, and while I sometimes want to congratulate the boys who are there, I get the feeling it'd be really awkward for all parties if I showed up. While my troop began as a pretty chill, liberal, and accepting place (fun fact: I knew and was in the same troop as semi-famous LGBT activist Zach Wahls), I have no idea what the troop's zeitgeist is like now. 

Sometimes I just want to go simply to see the look on peoples' faces when I'd walk in with my sash, neckerchief, uniform and sizeable boobs.

And, as /u/lrurid pointed out, trans people who were in Girl Scouts probably would have similar feelings and experiences. So, fellow scouts of all genders, how do you navigate being an out Scout? (A ScOut, if you will :P)"

Emma4847,asktransgender,Questions about transitioning in the Netherlands,"Hi all,
MtF here seeking to enter the process of transitioning in the Netherlands. I'm hoping some of my fellow Dutch folks could help me out!

- What is the easist and quickest way to get an appointment with the VU gender clinic? Do I ask my GP for a referral? How do I do this, just make an appointment there and ask right away out of nowhere?

- What is covered by insurance? I'm mostly interested in HRT, FFS, trachea shaving, voice training and laser? Is any of this in the basic insurance? Are there any insurance companies that cater particularly to trans people and have some treatments in their packages? Can I find an overview somewhere of what trans-related stuff is covered by all insurance companies? I've been looking for this, but with little success.

- What are the laws regarding trans discrimination at the workplace? Is there any summarizing documentation regarding this?

- How common is gatekeeping? What can I do about it?

- Does it happen that the VU gender team refused people treatment for not being trans enough? How to prevent this?

- Is there anything else I should know that is specific for the situation in the Netherlands?

Thanks in advance for your help! I won't be able to read replies later today, but I will definitely read them amd reply later. PMs are also welcome."

Chaojidage,asktransgender,I finally talked to my dad about HRT!,"Here's a personal story, which I just wanted to share.

Background: I came out to both parents in April, and they were a bit shocked, though not totally unsupportive.

Anyway, my dad was driving me to school this morning, and I was thinking about how to mention HRT to him before the end of the year so I could possibly start antiandrogens soon—I'm not 100% ready for estrogen just yet.

Suddenly, he starts speaking and asks me if the psychologist that I occasionally see is helpful for my mental health. I told him that I enjoyed speaking with him, but that I nevertheless felt that his help was somewhat insufficient. My dad then said that I should just give it some time for me to experience the positive effects of therapy, and I replied that I could not get what I wanted from it. He then said something along the lines of ""You can't know yet that it isn't as helpful as you think it isn't,"" and I told him that I actually do know.

After stalling for a while and thinking to myself that I'll regret this moment if I don't do anything to help myself transition, I finally told him that I was looking for someone who would help me start antiandrogens. He asked me what antiandrogens were, and I had to explain for a few seconds before I got off the car at my school.

At the end of the day, I don't regret anything, and I wish that my dad will seriously consider letting me start blockers soon. I knew he might be a bit shocked, but considering that he stayed calm when I came out in April, I knew that he would still love me and support my transition sooner or later.

To all of you who need to come out or speak with your parents about transitioning, I must tell you that you *will* regret keeping your silence. Inaction will *always* be regretted, and even actions with undesirable consequences can help you learn from your experiences."
potatochocolate,asktransgender,Coming out to mum,"I'm 21 now and have struggled with gender issues since 15 but kept it entirely to myself. I was depressed at 17-18 due to a combination of exam stress, insomnia and gender issues, but didn't tell mum about the gender stuff at the time (I was in denial and repressing it). I dabbled with drugs during this time to cope with the depression and law school. This year after getting back from overseas, I finally pursued transition. Overseas one of the places we went to was Amsterdam, and obviously I tried weed. I have lots of friends who smoke weed, and I've smoked it regularly since returning home. Since pursuing transition, I've let hair slowly grow out, I've shaved all over, I've lost weight, and started HRT last week.

Basically, mum has thought for most of the year that ""something's up"" with me. She knows I smoke weed and probably thinks that's a problem, and assumes that's the reason I've lost weight and let hair grow, and I'm behaving less social, etc. The more I tell her I'm fine (which, in many ways, since accepting that I'm trans I have been fine), the more she thinks I'm hiding something that she has a right to know. Since starting HRT I've been wayy more tired than usual, some days even a bit depressed/lethargic. I felt totally out of my element on Christmas day with these changes occurring, and talking to family, knowing they'll think totally differently of me when I come out in 9-12 months time.

Mum is now demanding to talk to me. I intend to come out to her soon, but I'm not coming out while I'm tired, depressed and look like shit (nowhere near passing) because she thinks it's something else. Like I haven't come out to anyone in real life except my doctor and psych, and hate the idea of being perceived as a ""man in a dress"". My mum has a tendency to overreact and not understand things, she's overly protective (which has always annoyed me and makes me even less inclined to tell her anything at all, because her ""help"" is rarely helpful at all). How the hell do I get out of this situation, without giving in and spilling my deepest secrets because she can't keep to herself?"

FragrantKnife,asktransgender,Possibly having a strange reaction to my hormones? Any advice?,"Hiya! I'm mtf, and I think I may be having a weird reaction to Spiro recently. For background, I'm 23, and I've been on HRT for around 13 months.

These past few days have been weird. I got a lot of stomach pain at a party this weekend and later wound up vomiting, but at the time it seemed fair and easy to attribute that to drinking. But now I'm not so sure . . . yesterday I got really bad chest pain out of nowhere which felt like my sternum was being crushed. I induced vomiting to try and help this time, but the pain persisted until it eventually just wore off. Then it came back later, and I just waited it out again.

I also noticed my pee has been darker than usual recently (like the past three days) and that today I was super itchy all over my body. I poked around on the internet a bit and saw that these were all possible side effects of spiro, but I am hesitant to do more poking around because I know how easy it is to diagnose yourself with something awful and start panicking for no reason.

Those of you on Spiro (or on E) - has any of this ever happened to you? Did it go away? Did you have to deal with it? Should I tell my doctor? I feel like it's weird that it's happening now, after 13 months on HRT (I've been on the same dose of Spiro for close to 6 months now). Is that possible, or am I jumping too quickly to conclusions?"
Kolmyr,asktransgender,Help regarding finding therapists and/or monitoring?,"Hiya, I'm pretty much new to everything. The past year has been crazy, and I've made some choices that I'm really starting to question now, mainly regarding my choice to self medicate.
Shortly after deciding I wanted to start chemically shifting, I was extremely confused as to how I'd go about doing it. Who to call, who to talk with it about, who I COULD talk with it about, et cetera. What had me more scared was the price. 
I haven't had medical insurance in quite a while, and frankly I didn't know how pricey things would be. With all these questions, I went to one of my friends for help.
One of my girlfriends convinced me that if I wanted to, I should ""bite the bullet"" if I was too nervous to talk to my primary physician about it, and I purchased Progynova and Aldactone tablets online with her guidance.
She gave me pretty much her schedule when it came to when she started, 2mg Prog &amp; 100mg Aldactone twice a day. 
That was two months ago, and I just kind of went along with it until now. I still have a few months of these pills left, but recent other lack of medications is making me really stressed about all of this, which is probably for the best. I've gotten a lot of mixed signals regarding my self medication from the few times (2) I've asked about it online, and despite the money I really want to ook into monitoring or talking with a therapist? 

I don't know exactly what's needed or anything, and I'm really thankful for you spending the time to read this and hopefully give me some advice,,

scientificnonsense,asktransgender,What questions are productive when one is questioning?,"I keep looping around the same questions which seem to be getting nowhere

What little questions helped you answer the bigger Am I Trans Or A Weird Cis question?

**I think I just needed to write the following, its probably not useful to read... :o**

answers I have:

* AMAB
* 29
* I don't like or aspire to masculinity
* I feel jealous of transwomen pre/post transition pics
* I think I would like to have been a woman all along
* I hadn't even heard of transgender before a few years ago, except distantly vaguely being aware of rumours about Lana Wachowski
* I have (possibly false) memory of often saying to myself as a young teen: 'I'm not gay, I like girls' like some kind of mantra, now I realise that 'gay' was the only word I had for anything different at all.
* I briefly (and not particularly openly) identified as bi the last couple of years (single the entire time), I think I was becoming less comfortable with being Straight Man and bi is conveniently non-gendered. Though, as above, I don't particularly like masculinity and have only ever crushed on the most feminine of boys
* I have never felt comfortable filling out the gendered 'title' on forms, though I thought it was because I didn't like the unequalness implied by titles. I now have started to feel uncomfortable ticking the 'M' box, though I still tick it.
* I don't like facial/body hair, I don't like shaving, thus I often look like I just gave up shaving half way through...
* I remember very strongly the first time I heard that gender and sex weren't strictly synonymous, I grabbed so hard at the idea that masculinity and maleness weren't the same: Years later, the first time I heard (on a podcast) from a transwoman I got really angry - I felt (at the time) like she was saying she was not comfortable with her masculinity so she had to stop being male, but my whole understanding of gender rested on those just being accidentally related.
* I used to think I was disinterested in the whole idea of gender, but I've been looping on these thoughts too long for that to be true even a little bit.
* I wrote a bad nanowrimo novel as a 1st person young girl, though I was definitely feeling author-insert-y.
* I wore a dress once for a film project (It gave me the excuse). I really enjoyed it, but I don't feel permission any other time at all ever
* I feel jealous about women's clothing in general though
* I enjoy when I've been accidentally assumed to be a woman from behind (long hair seems to mess with people's assumptions)

Doubts I have:

* Are all questions of Identity the result of a recent complete loss of very sincere Faith? (probably, but that doesn't necessarily invalidate anything (and also I was starting to question things while I believed, and all the resources (I could find) on gender in christianity is just 'should women be allowed to lead churches' not 'wtf even is gender what was god thinking'))
* Are the rest of my questions of identity the result of not living in my home country and feeling home sick and foreign?
* Is my discomfort with how I appear just because I gained a lot of weight (add 50%) because depression?
Am I enby? or some other 'not playing your stupid binary game' identity?

oops I wrote a lot."

Kerr94,asktransgender,"People who've changed their names, did you pick a new middle name or do you just not have one?","So as part of my transition I'm planning on changing my name which will include getting rid of my middle name because I don't like it.

I don't think I have need for a middle name which I'd never use but would keep showing up in ID and stuff.

Psychobeans,asktransgender,"I have to actively try to feel like the opposite gender, despite feeling incredibly happy while doing so?","So I've had pretty bad depression for at least a decade.

It was the best I have felt in years. However, in the weeks since then, I have learned that if I don't focus on the feeling of being female, I slip out of it. I don't feel wrong as a guy, but if I could stay feeling like I'm a girl permanently, I would. But not because of a need to feel female, I would do it for that happiness that comes with it.

I guess I'm asking: if I'm transgender, why do I have to focus to feel like it? If I'm not, why does focusing on it make me feel happy? Is this enough to go to a therapist over?"

GiaFarrell74,asktransgender,Think my marriage of 7yrs to straight spouse maybe dieing a slow death.. anything I can do?,"Background:

I'm 42yo, MTF who's been on HRT since March.  I've been married to spouse for 7+ yrs, we have two kids aged 2.5yo and 8mths.  

So I came out to my partner in December of last year.  After a couple months of therapy working through my feelings I spoke to my spouse and let her know I wanted to transition.  She was heartbroken, but after a lot of soul-searching and discussions she realized she loved me no matter the gender, and couldn't imagine living with anyone else, and wanted to stay together and raise our kids.

Shes gotten involved in several support groups for spouses, has a therapist and we started going to a a couples therapist that has experience with trans/cis couples.  She's had opportunity to talk to many folks about this.  Including a number of ""straight wives"" who have managed to still be intimate with their transitioning spouses.  But unfortunately our sex and intimacy is basically gone.

She'll kiss and hug me, but that's about extent.  No cuddling, no touching or rubbing, and definitely nothing sexual.  She said she's just not into women's bodies, she's straight and is in to burly men..  She was willing to try sex once in past 3 months..  but we haven't since then.

I can't really do anything about any of it.  I can't change myself, so how could I ask her to change? I know some other wives managed to be a bit flexible, but it appears mine can't be.

It really hurts to not be desired anymore.. as we had a great sexual relationship overall before.  But the loss of intimacy itself is more painful.  She doesn't want to be physical much at all anymore.  And of course this is something estrogen has really made me want to feel.. that closeness, that warmth and human touch.. 

Some other trans folks I've spoken too that had wives/husbands with similar issues, many were able to work it out through counseling and working through internalized homo/trans phobia.. I'm honestly not very hopeful she'll be able to explore whether she might have those phobias or not though.  I brought up the subject of sex and intimacy to our group counselor last week, and will bring it up again this week, as it's pretty critical to the relationship in my mind.  I've heard of too many relationships dieing a slow death without it..

Any advice here?  I'm not sure where to go to talk about this..

Iceklimber,asktransgender,Should cis people care about you being transgender?,"Hola redditors,

In the past, transgender people suffered from discrimination due to faced criminal charges for their clothing, incarcerated in insane asylums, denied marriages, and lacked access to sex change operations.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_transgender_people_in_the_United_States#Prior_to_1800

And so, I figured the best treatment of transgender citizens would be becoming uninvolved in gender issues. However, the idea of people not caring about someone being transgender seems to do no less than invoking suicidal thoughts for this person.

   The above is a letter which I received in late-October, enclosed in an envelope with a birthday card and a check for fifty dollars. 

I, in an embarrassing fit of anger, tore it to pieces. I then spent about half an hour later that day piecing it back together on my cousin's linoleum floor.

I don't think I need to explain the level of patronizing religious bullshit present in my Grandmother's lovely letter.

The letter didn't surprise me. My step-father's parents have always been intolerant bigots, and religious fundamentalists. I *was* angry, however, that they would send me this on my birthday.

The mere thought of detransitioning makes me want to vomit, and this letter only made me want to aim it at them specifically. 

I'm happy as I am, and I'll admit that I'm far luckier than some. No one clocks me, no one mistreats me, people flirt with me... This is all in the US South, in case anyone was wondering. As far as anyone I meet is concerned, I'm female and they're none the wiser.

 My grandmother doesn't seem to realize that people like her are a problem. *They* are the reason transition, and *living while trans* is so hard, so often.

I won't tolerate their brand of bigotry, nor anyone else's, and none of you should either. We all have a right to live happily as ourselves, and be the men and women that we know we are.

Don't let *anyone* tell you otherwise."
safiyah_angel,asktransgender,Fuck touchy people i don't even recognize and keep touching me. (?),"Today morning i went to a shop with my mom. My coworker(cleaning woman) came in, said hello and did stroke(hope it's the correct term) my shoulder. I didn't even recognize who she was until now.

This was the third time someone stroke me and i had no idea who the fuck she was. I live in a small town(2000~ people live here), so they might know my parents or something.

So she came in, stroke me, and the conversation:
-Don't stroke me.
-Don't?
-No, i don't like it.
-Okay.

Translation isn't the best, but kinda that was it. Now i feel bad. People don't want to be rude, i just don't like when someone touch me.

Just wanted to write it out, a small thing that makes me feel bad, i'm weird. :/

crazymyass,asktransgender,Issues blocking my transition,"Hey guys so far been reading through  all the HRT threads and I can't help but feel jealous. 

I see a few roadblocks for transitioning and need your help. 

I believe I was molested when I was 5 or 6. Since then I began to act out the act but thinking I was a girl. I kept telling my parents I was a girl.  However,  I'm afraid that this will be a roadblock as there will be questions as to whether I'm actually transgendered or just traumatized. 

Second,  I'm not sure what exactly the steps I need to take.  I live in Vancouver, Bc but I haven't even seen a therapist and not sure how to go about finding and figuring out the costs. 

Third, I need a guideline of some sort.  A roadmap of what I need to do before transitioning such as exercising etc. 

Fourth,  work and family. I work in sales so it's unlikely they will want me to face customers. Also I'm not sure which bathroom I need to use.  As for my family,  they are already unwelcoming and keep emphasizing how masculine I am and shit that makes me want to do get high. 

2016 is up and I have to something. I'm turning 30 in a week and I just feel like i fucked myself, wishing there is still time to transition. U don't know what will happen but I feel like I can't continue living the way I am now, pretending to be a man but unable to take part in any of life's pleasures because of my various dysphoria I've had since I was a kid. 

I'm taking action and this post will be first starting point. I'm trying to save my life from the people and things that run my life. It's not worth living a life for someone else or something else. Sympathy won't do shit, I just don't want to continue to get wined and dined because I am forced to live and be someone I'm not. It's suffocating, and I've got no options other than once and for all,  figure out if I'm transgender and push on with the best cards given to me."

Basically, it's a sense of ""I'm never going to fit in anywhere"".  It's not so much about whether I could pass if I transition socially/medically, but more about feeling like I will always be separate from those around me - that while I might be accepted and affirmed as trans, that I will still be treated differently because I started my life in a different gender.

I normally don't get too hung up on labels and titles, but when I try to write about this feeling in my journal, I'm having a hard time because I haven't figured out what to call it yet.  I've tried ""social dysphoria"" and ""social anxiety"", but those aren't right.

For example, not conflating gender identity with gender expression.  (i.e., ""I always knew I was a boy because I wanted to play with G.I. Joe instead of Barbie.""  I'm shocked how many trans writers do this.)  Not focusing on binary identities to the exclusion of nonbinary or vice versa.

Anyone would call me lucky to be me, at least from the outside. I was born a male in a great enviroment in the stable society that is Sweden. My parents have given me everything, great upbringing, genetics and so on, yet i've been depressed for as long as I can remember. 

I feel like i've been as lucky as you can get, yet I hate myself and can't enjoy other people's company. It feels like i've been put in the perfect world but with a broken mind. 

Over the last month or so i've been thinking a lot about my gender identity. My stance on it changes a lot. One day all I want to do is wake up as the opposite gender, the other day I just feel lost. 

I've been uncomfortable with myself since I was a child but on paper I should be a happy person. Sounds like trans to me but I guess I'm just afraid that it won't be the answer and that i'll get even more lost and depressed. 

Doubt and feeling lost is the best description of how my situation. Does any of this make sense to you, do you think there is any hope for me?

I was assured I qualified for the exception to the rule.

I've been getting denial letters since July or August of this year. The HCA (the organization behind the ACA) is slow to move, and begins every request with a denial as standard until it can be bounced back by my provider with ""exception to the rule."" The HCA won't tell me WHY I don't qualify, only that among the fat stack of supplied documentation, it still wasn't good enough. 

So I supplied more documentation! Refined what I already had! I'm counting on this as my only financial salvation here. But I keep getting denied and denied. My provider tells me she doesn't understand why they're denying me. 

Having just received the latest denial, I don't know what to do from here. My provided documents were the most bullet proof they've ever been. I don't want to admit defeat, but I don't know what to do from here.

starfoxjokes,asktransgender,Kind of coming to terms... not sure where to begin. If at all.,"Some context. Im mid twenties. Male. 

I have no idea where to begin. I dont even think I have the capability of transitioning both emotionally or even physically (without extensive cosmetic surgery). 

I have been very unaware and oblivious for a long time about these thoughts, and I have never really felt like ""my life is awful and its because im in the wrong body."" Someone elsewhere on reddit made a post when someone said something along those lines and their post basically said you might be trans and should really give it some thought if thats how they felt (they liked the idea of being a woman but didnt live in agony because of it).

I am depressed. Bipolar actually. Treatment has been good for that. But never have I thought anything of my fascination of being a woman until now. I sat down today and thought back. All those characters I drew were usually female and adopted aspects of me or who i wanted to be personality wise; all my video game characters for years are all female, but not because I find them attractive (I do but its weird and different from just secual attraction) and honestly... the more I think about it, it fits. 

But I am alright with being a man. I mean, I'm not living in agony or look in a mirror and see myself with contempt. I have a good family too. They can be a bit biggoted sometimes but I dunno. I dont think i could really deal with the embarassment honestly. Or even the awkward months or years of transitioning if I ever did. 

Oh and then there is the preoccupation with a trans girl I know. Never really gave mych thought as to why we always talk about her transitioning. But yeah. Curiosity comes from somewhere. 

Basically; I dont know if  Im just fetishising this or if I am ""slightly trans"" or if I am still blocking some of this out and I really am 100% bonafide trans. Shit. I dont even know if im offending people here. LGBT isnt really a culture I have or even really want to identify with. (Sorry. D:) I feel like for me i just want to be me, not a gay rights activist or someone whos whole identity revolves around who i want to have sex with or what my birth gender is/was. 

But yeah. Im fucked. I could use some advice. Guidance. Maybe some helpful reading. 

Sorry if I offended anyone. I hope I didnt. I am not goid at writing my thoughts out correctly sometimes. "

&gt;Traveling Transgender

&gt;A lot of people travel for work, so that's no real big deal, but how many of them do it cross dressed?

&gt;The day started off with the parking shuttle bus driver calling me ""sir"", then quickly apologizing and saying ""ma'am"". I just kind of laughed and told him not to worry about it, that I get that quite a lot. What the hell, clearly I’m confused about my gender so why shouldn't he be? Funny thing, I actually felt pretty all day but kept getting called sir anyway. 

Pretty refers to a crossdressing term used to say... they're dressed as a woman. 

Sorry, another user here linked this blog for advice for flying when I searched it in the right-hand tab, I'm just disgusted. But this, this is what pisses me off the most:

&gt;The reality is, if you make any effort to hide your real name or gender from the airline or the TSA, I can 100% guarantee you that you will not be boarding an airplane and you may even end up spending some quality time speaking with law enforcement. 

Does that piss anyone else off? The name thing I get if it isn't changed, but the gender thing? Disgusting. You'll notice the rest of the post is filled, just filled with crossdresser shit and related lingo. Yet it all operates under the guise of being transgender. Phenomenal. Worst thing are all the comments on the blog that seem to echo what the author says, most within the same age range, but not all, which concerns me.

DeadliestTulip,asktransgender,I had a psychological breakthrough today.,"I found out today that I'm a nasal talker.  I talk thru my nose. I realized why I do this which is amazing to me. If I plug my nose I talk normally because I'm forced to. I didn't even know that was a thing. So when I talk thru my nose my voice is a little higher. I think I have subconsciously talked thru my nose because it sounds more feminine than thru my normal way. I think as my voice got deeper I tried to unknowingly make it higher pitch. 

I tried it and plugged my nose. I started talking thru my diaphragm instead and my voice was so much deeeper. It scared me. I wanted to cry. Well I still do cos this saddens me. I feel like this is a huge impossible mountain to climb.

I'm thinking if I can find something to plug my nose I can force myself to talk thru my diaphragm. Once I do that I would guess that lower the voice would be a little easier?

Does anyone have any advice for nose plugs, and advice on treating nasal talking?

Thank you!

AlbireoTai18,asktransgender,Creating a Transgender Character,"Hello everyone. So, I wanted to discuss something that has been on my mind for a while. From the people I have spoken to through here months ago, many people have said that, growing up, that something felt out of place and some people consulted a gender therapist or found out their answer on their own. Some even spoke about their life as a transgender woman or man, being married with kids, a small chronology of when they began to become the person they wanted to be. 

As a future author, I enjoy listening to the stories of other people and think about how their stories go. I had thought about making a character who is transgender and their struggles to live the life they want. And before I sit down to create said character, I would like to understand the transgender community more and make sure that my character is portraying the community fairly. So allow me to ask a few questions.

1) How did you gather up the courage to say to others that you are transgender? What was the reaction you received from friends and family?

2) How does the transitioning process go for MtF and vice versa? How long is the transitioning process and do you have to continuously take hormones to maintain your physique? (Could be a silly question, but one I'd like to ask.)

3) (This is a tough question to ask...)Have you or anyone you know... endured hate crimes or hateful comments directed at either of you? What happened and what was said? 

4) When it comes to a relationship, do you tell the person you want to date that you're transgender before the first date or after some times passes by?

5) When you decided to live on your own, did a landlord give you a hard time because you are transgender or throw you out because of who you are? (I have heard about how landlords throw out transgender people and I wanted to know if that happens alot.)

Sorry for the long post, I had alot to ask and alot to say in the beginning. I'm a firm supporter of the LGBT and I just wanna make sure that I understand more about the transgender community before I create a character who is transgender, hope that makes sense.

I really like myself personality wise and I do not like that my personality changed a bit on hormones.

- I feel a little more quesy at times, a little nauseus. I get tired doing yardwork and things like that.

accordioncat,asktransgender,HELP! Need facial hair removal options and advice- Planning a christmas gift for my sister,"Hi all! My sister-in-law is a trans woman who has not yet started any hormone therapy. I know that facial hair is a major trigger for her dysphoria, so I was considering buying a package of hair-removal treatment sessions for her for Christmas this year. 

I have read every electrolysis versus laser post I could find online and know the basic information on how they work, but I know there are lots of differing opinions on the subject. I am wondering if anyone has any insight on a plan that might work or provide some relief for my sister, given the fact that she has NOT yet started hormones. She is white and grows relatively fair facial hair--the darkest sections are a light to medium reddish-brown. 

Would either laser or electrolysis be in any way effective or helpful for a mtf woman who has not begun hormonal transition? I am not expecting a quick fix; I know that hair removal takes a lot of time and money. However, as this would be a free christmas gift and not a waste of her own money, I am thinking even a temporary reduction in hair or absence of hair would provide some relief for her...but I am a cis woman so please lend your perspectives! I have talked to her about this idea as a possibility and she said she would be excited if it worked out.

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to respond, and feel free to suggest other hair removal ideas if you think electrolysis or laser wouldn't be effective for her at this stage.  :)"
transmtfgirl,asktransgender,I had a BIG argument with my family tonight!,"I'm a 18 year old transgender woman and today I had a huge argument with my brother. It all started when I was talking about civil rights and things like that and naturally, transgender rights came up and I said ""its great because unisex bathrooms are becoming more common worldwide"" and I said its horrible because many of us trans people get turned away from bathrooms, beat up, etc and I used the example of this transgender woman I read about who had a penis but she got verbally abused by another woman. 

This is when he said ""Wait! This person has a penis! That's fucking disgusting! What the fuck are you sleeping with"". I then told him that I have obviously have a penis so I said ""by your logic I'm a man too then"" and he agreed. He said ""if I met a person who Identified as a woman and then I knew they had a penis I wouldn't go anywhere near them"". At this point I was literally holding back the tears!!

IT gotten worst and I reminded him that he identifies as a Liberal and that how can he be for progression and things like that if he isn't going to give people like me, my rights. He then disagreed and said that he didn't disagree with our rights but he did disagree with us not having the bottom surgery. I explained that not all of us want/need the bottom surgery and he was astonished.


He even said ""if a so called man has a vagina and a so called woman has a penis then how the hell do we know who is male and female? How does science define gender and who and and what a person is? A man has a penis and a woman has a vagina. People who only have the top surgery are truly mentally disturbed.""


He is an atheist and the reason I am pointing this out is because he often says things like because he is an atheist he and others who are atheists like him ""occupie the moral high ground"" and Christians like me don't. I said that he claims he is moral but if he thinks this then he clearly isn't. 

He said when I came out as a transgender woman at 16 years old that I ""need to be put in a straight jacket"" because I'm ""mentally ill"". And a few of my family member's are definitely more accepting but they sometimes look a bit off when they call me ""sister"" or ""daughter"". 

Sorry about this, I needed to vent. What do I do about this and my family?"
jmyle,asktransgender,How to deal with the 'I've accepted I'm trans but I can't do anything about it for a long time to come' stage?,"EDIT: Thank you all for the responses and support. It really means a lot, and I've read through them all. Have some upvotes. Stay strong folks, have a good holiday and 2017. 

**TL;DR - I know I'm trans. I want/need to transition but I can't/I need to wait at least a few years unless I'm willing to risk the high possibility of a) losing all ties with my family and b) losing their financial support (which I'm depending on right now for university). How do I deal with this waiting? It's doing a huge number on my wellbeing.**

Story time: 
I've been back and forth on being trans for a long time. Lots of denial. Lots of doubts. But I've gotten to the point where, 100% confident or not, I'm confident ~enough~ that I'm trans and transitioning is something I need to do. But the problem is I'm at that super painful stage where I'm self aware but because of many practical and social reasons, I'll be unable to transition or come out to a lot of people for an excruciatingly (or at least in my mind, a terribly) long time. 

I come from an incredibly traditional minded family. Some specific examples; getting a tattoo would incite a lot of moral rage because ""I shouldn't do anything to change how my body naturally is."" They never even let me take painkillers when I was younger because there's a lot of belief of leaving the body as """"natural as it can be."""" No matter what. Anything else is harmful, unless 100% necessary (aka I'm marginally dying of illness). Can't even imagine how they'll react to something like HRT, even if transitioning could very well finally turn my life around. Also, my parents did *not* take me trying to come out as bisexual to them well. They're still in denial about my sexuality. 

Anyhow. That gives a little taste. I'm over 18 but still incredibly connected with my parents and family members. My parents are paying for my tuition at the moment so I can't potentially screw that up by coming out to them. Can't go on HRT or surgery either without telling them because I can't imagine how to explain that to family when I visit. Plus, costs a significant amount of money. I'm just going to skip over talking about *all* the emotional stuff I have with my family which is also something huge at stake, just harder to explain. My mom at least has been incredibly loving and supportive of me for all my life, ignoring all the LGBT+ stuff. I was really close to her as a kid and as a teen. But me coming out as trans, I think it might ruin everything. Etc etc. I think you all get it? 

I desperately want to transition a lot of the time but I can't. I just see myself having to wait it out until I at least graduate university (that's four years) and after getting a well paying job enough to save up (that's possibly another year or two or more). Even then, coming out to them and explaining these things - at the risk of cutting ties with my family entirely - will be really difficult. 

It's killing me slowly to not be able to transition, to be fully self aware but unable to do anything. My only other option is to just take that leap of faith and go all or nothing, but it's a huge risk. Unfortunately everything is wearing down on my mental health enough that I might need to go all in despite all the things standing in my way.

hey_its_Espeon,asktransgender,"Is my feeling ""real""","I know the question of ""am I trans enough?"" is usually answered by ""if you are thinking about it, then most likely yes"".  

Because of this I was panicing a bit because I don't know if I'm trans.  

I don't really have any dysphoria aside from hating the disguisting amount of hair on my legs.  

I've fantasized about being a girl or wishing before going to bed to wake up the next day as a girl, but it didn't hit me as weird until around a year ago.  

I've for example never imagined myself having sex from the male position because it just doesn't feel right, but when I try to imagine it from the female perspective the feelings I get are much more intense.  

I'm a top caliber gamer (top 0.05% of players in the most played game, League of Legends), and when I wanted to play certain games I always imagined myself playing it and I would love it, but when I actually did it I usually ended up only playing it for a bit and then getting bored. Because of this I am really scared that the same thing is happening with the feeling of wanting to be a girl.  

I talked to my mom about this and she said I didn't really act how girls usually would (allthough I feel that that is changing like the way I sometimes walk up stairs looks really feminine) so she doesn't think it's real for the same reason as I do.  

I'm 17 (18 in january) and until like 14-15 years old I never felt anything like this. I do remember me thinking I liked girl after girl at elementary school, but now I am thinking that it was just because I wanted to be like them, and not be WITH them.  

I am really afraid to let my dad know because he was already weirded out by me wanted to buy bright pink shoes (who were, as a matter of fact, the only shoes I've ever wanted without my parents telling me I needed new shoes) and pink shirts/hoodies. Because I'm afraid to tell my dad about this it also kind of prevents me from going to a psychiatrist for this issue.  

I really need help about this issue from people who are familliar to this.  

Thank you so much for anyone willing to help me out a bit &lt;3"

ThisGirlIsLost,asktransgender,Has my HRT triggered a female hairloss pattern?,"I've been on MTF HRT for over 3 years. I started experiencing some hair loss on top of my head prior to this, but it was getting worse after I started.  
                                                                                In August 2015 I started 1.25 mg of finasteride per day. I went through a pretty severe shedding after that which would periodically slow down but it never seemed to stop.
In August 2016 I went to a dermatologist and was put on .5 mg of Dutasteride instead. The hair loss still seems to be happening. I seemed to have grown some hair in the back of my head, but it's getting thinner in the top/front area. All of this is on the center part. I haven't lost it in a male pattern up front, it's only along the center part, which looks like more of a female pattern loss.

My mom has some pretty bad loss in the same area and I'm wondering if some of this is genetics? For reference, my DHT levels are 2.9 pg/ml (nothing), estrogen 273 pg/ml and testosterone less than 20 ng/dl. I don't have any thyroid or other medical problems according to my bloodwork, which my endo checks every 3 months.

I do see some baby hairs growing, but not too many. Do I just need to be more patient? because right now this is freaking me out...a lot."

MagmusCivcraft,asktransgender,"It seems for some reason I want to be trans, not just a ""regular"" girl.","I don't really know why I would feel this way, but it seems to be quite a possibility. When asked about the button test, I am not sure I would press it for some reason. It seems my experiences are like no other transgender person I've seen on here. I can really see few other reasons why I've only ever shown any signs of being trans after I started questioning my gender. I think I want to be ""special"" or something, even though I'm already very different to most people of my age. And yet I really don't want to be a man. I really don't know what's going on. The idea of me being trans seems pretty unfeasable and yet I won't let go of it. This might just be because I know it's impossible to be a cis woman though, but nothing about me being trans makes much sense. It just seems a little unbelieviable to me. This wasn't always the case, though, for a while I was pretty sure I was trans. It almost seems that I think that someone can ""become"" transgender."
KrisEtKris,asktransgender,I am thinking of a trade.,"I am now really sick and tired of my parents telling me how to live my life anymore. And all these troubles will be put to an end if I only cut my hair short.

But I honestly think this isn't a too bad of idea to be quite honest because if I don't, I will always be alone for the next 9 months and in reality, there is just no way for me to get a decent job for being transgender. Nobody will hire me unless I look like my biological sex which is not my current status.

And I found a really great job that would let me have a great saving to prepare for my bottom surgery. I can literally earn $10,000 in 4 months meaning I just gotta pretend like a guy for 4 months.

However, if I lose my hair, I'd despise how I look and will make me depressed.. though I just gotta wait for 9 months..

I also wonder how fast my hair would grow going from very short hair to my current length of my hair. Would 9 months make it resemble to what I have now?

I am honestly leaning toward the choice of cutting my hair short.. I am not sure.. Have you guys experienced anything similar to this? I need some advice."

LTL89,asktransgender,Question about injections.,My endo usually prescribes me needles that are 1 1/2 inch in size and has me to the injection at my upper thigh.

I'll ask for Finasteride in next month, i'm taking Androcur for 5 months and Estradiol for 1, don't know if it's going to help. Already noticed like a cm wide line regrowth in my hairline(fine hair mostly, but getting stronger).

I've spoken to two of my girl friends about my feelings for him (they're both friends with him too, and have been for longer than I have), and they've both told me that while he'll most likely appreciate the fact that I have feelings for him, there is absolutely no way it'll lead to a relationship of any sort. 

The thing is, I've never actually had feelings this intense for a guy before. Or even a girl for that matter. I'm just so confused. I can't stop thinking about it. I'm even dreaming about it. But I can't build up the courage to even tell him how I feel because of my anxiety.

hohahuhi,asktransgender,Potential bad effects of Spiro only ?,"Hello,

So since think that it takes too much time to get prescribed hormones here and want to experiment, I just dived in and bought spironolactone as it is legal here to do so (and it's cheaper than 3 sessions at the therapist lol).
I've been checking the internet, searching a lot about it and found out that it's a diuretic that increases potassium levels and is used to lower blood pressure, treat acne etc.  
Problem is, I have a heart condition. Mitral valve prolapse, regurgitation and extrasystoles. Some doctors want to actually put me under blood pressure pills which I refused (ironic isn't it) but it was not Spiro. Others think that I'm still ok, my blood pressure is actually ok most of the time. So well, a bit of a mystery as to what can happen (I hope it doesn't worsen my extrasystoles:/). Any thoughts ?
Anyway, the problem is also that I want to experiment without throwing my current relationship away and erm... My gf is a big fan of bed sports. Not that I couldn't please her by other means than with my male parts but she would notice and I can't hide it. How long until I won't be able to get erections on those pills then ?
Should I try to make a doctor follow me ?
What can happen if I stop taking it suddenly ?  
I'm usually trying to be very careful with pills and I don't want to damage anything, just see how it feels with less T in my body.

[deleted],asktransgender,Scared I won't pass and other misc. things,"I didn't put this on the transpassing sub-reddit because that seems to be for people who are already transitioning. The plan is to finally get the ball rolling by scheduling an appointment tomorrow with my general care physician. 

In the meantime I'm hit with that awesome thing called doubt. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/J4vjGDM.jpg) and (bare chest warning?) [here](http://i.imgur.com/yaxiJQp.jpg) are a couple pictures I took tonight. 

Is there a reasonable chance with the fat/muscle redistribution the issue would sort itself out? Before anyone asks about my weight it has always been on the lower end because of a super high metabolism. Something else entirely I'm working on.

The other things I'm curious about is small things I could do to ease myself in without going crazy. I'm out to my mom, and don't want to risk coming out to my father because I'm moving out in a few months, so I don't see the point of rocking the boat when I'm still in their house.

Because my dad does the laundry I can't realistically go for what I see as usual suggestions like a cami, or feminine boxers. As of now I'm going with flannels, I already have a fair collection of those and plan to ask my mom to grab me a couple with a women's cut that hopefully aren't so loose. Beyond that I don't even know what I could do for something gender neutral.

It doesn't look like it in the picture, but my hair is grown out a fair bit, so I have options on a haircut. I dress more formally typically, so would something like a bob cut work? For reference I'm looking at [this](http://modern-hairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/straight-inverted-bob-for-men-2016.jpg) as a starting point. 

Any other ideas would be great.

Kaos99,asktransgender,"How to deal with a ""Don't ask don't tell"" mentality?","Okay, I really just need to get this off my chest. Last June I came out to my Father and Step mom after starting HRT and moving out. I wrote it out in an email because it was easier for me to outline everything and they responded in kind, It went fairly well I thought and they said that they ""Had no questions or comments for me"" (What?) Due to the fact that it was incredibly hard for me to do I just let it go and moved on. Over summer I continued to tell a few close friends and my Birth Mother and Step Father, Those two had a ton of questions and were overly supportive. Honestly I didn't know how to handle it. However my dad and step mom have continued to just pretend like nothing has happened. It really started to be apparent at thanksgiving. They did not talk to me about anything other than arbitrary things. Until my step mom pulled me aside and said she was worried about my mental health. She asked why I was so anxious and stressed. I tried to point out what I told her in June being, you know....stressful but she just blew me off and said ""No, I mean, what's the real issue? Why are you like this?"" I didn't really know what to say. Repeat almost the exact same line of questioning on christmas along with comments about my hair being too long and that a nose piercing looks like something I shouldnt have because ""It'll give people the wrong idea"". I again tried to tell my step mom that transitioning and the like has been a huge stressor for me and that if she was curious or actually wanted to help she's welcome to talk to me but she blew me off again. I just don't know what to do at this point. I feel completely invalidated by a whole part of my family. I just wish they'd ask me or tell me anything instead of this weird cold shoulder ignoring. They have also stopped inviting me to larger Family events and stopped really talking to me. I don't know what's going on."

Whenever I look at myself in the mirror, though, I feel disgusted. Half the time I do, I literally feel nauseous. I know I don't pass. People tell me I do, but they're just being nice. I'll need FFS to look like a cis female, let alone be attractive, and it just makes me so sad... 

But that's stupid. I hate feeling like this. I don't want FFS. I want to be able to own up to how I look, but it makes me so cripplingly shy when there's a voice inside me that wants to be assertive but can't. 

I live in an area that's really accepting of trans people. I've only been called out on being visibly trans like twice, and even then it wasn't (meant to be) negative. People generally just don't care. So I don't need to look like a cis female for my safety or even just to be accepted...

glitterlok,asktransgender,I'm designing a product and would like to include gender symbols. Looking for some advice!,"Hello!

I am designing a product that involves asking for gender identity at one point in the setup process. This question is very important to the product, and we're only asking it because it will make what we're doing significantly more meaningful.

In previous projects, I've used three text-based options -- male, female, other ^see ^note (which prompts an optional ""specify"" field) -- but this time I'm looking to do something more graphical / visual.

So my question is about gender symbols, and which symbol(s) might be most appropriate when placed with the binary Mars and Venus symbols.

Obviously, presenting [all the options](https://neuwritesd.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/1420041082350.png) would be wonderful, but unfortunately there just won't be enough space and it would create a difficult-to-manage user interface.

With regards to transgender people, I love the *look* of the [transgender symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/A_TransGender-Symbol_Plain3.svg/2000px-A_TransGender-Symbol_Plain3.svg.png). I also love the [other gender symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Gender-Symbol_Other_dark_transparent_Background.png), but I'm not well-versed enough to know if ""Other gender"" is considered an umbrella or a very separate thing.

Do either of those symbols resonate with you in a positive or negative way? Is there another symbol I'm missing that you would think ""that's me"" if you saw it presented in a user interface?

Any advice / thoughts would be so helpful! I'm also looking for other subs to post this question in, since I know there are people who do not consider themselves transgender who are also non-binary. Thank you!

*Note: I've never been a huge fan of the ""Other"" text label. I know there is sensitivity around the use of the word to describe non-binary gender identities. I've considered using ""Specify"" alone, but some people would rather not provide details, but would like to acknowledge that they are not male or female. So I go with ""Other"" at the moment...*

greymutt,asktransgender,"What are your feelings on the use of ""ladies and gentlemen"" in announcements?","Hello,

This news story popped up on r/london and I'd be interested in this community's thoughts:

[Sadiq Khan looks to scrap ‘ladies and gentlemen’ in favour of gender neutral announcements on London trains and buses](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/gender-neutral-announcement-sadiq-khan-tfl-london-ladies-and-gentlemen-announcements-a7463271.html)

TL;DR - A transwoman called London Underground's helpline and the operator commented that she ""didn't sound like a Miss"".  Apologies have been made and there's a policy review starting off the back of it.

One of the suggestions that has come out of this is to look at ""potentially removing “ladies and gentlemen” from announcements across London’s transport network.""

So I'd be interested to know if it does upset or bother you when you hear a ""ladies and gentlemen..."" announcement, and what the potential alternatives could be."
honaka_namnah,asktransgender,Question about breast development!,"Hi

I'm amab mtf, 30 and I'm on HRT for about 2 weeks (2mg progynova, 50mg cypro).

When I was about 11 years old I had mild breast development (small breast buds) which went away when I hit puberty (fuck you T) but I was wondering if this could impact my ability to grow breasts right now? I mean: because they started develop back then and went away again, am I screwed because my body only lets you grow breasts once?

I don't expect doctors to really have an answer because it's such a edge case but I was hoping maybe someone had a similar experience? Or maybe somebody has a similar experience with starting, stopping and then restarting HRT?

Thanks!

edit/update (after 6 weeks of HRT): boobs are growing!"

It's so frustrating to be around them enjoying my time at home being casually insulted all the time by them. The worst of which is my father who will in one breath insult me by using he and calling me my former pseudonym then backpedal any time I ask him not to. ""I don't want any conflict"".

God_Told_Me_To_Do_It,asktransgender,"""Bipolar"" thoughts about gender? (but not bigender/genderfluid)","*(I know, a bipolar disorder is something completely different and unrelated, just borrowing this word 'cause it seemed fitting)*  

For years, I've been switching between ""I want to transition"" and ""I don't want to transition"" periodically. (Up until a few months ago, it wasn't ""to transition"" though, it was just putting more effort in my ""feminine side""; it's still fairly recently I did come to the conclusion that I'm not, in fact, just a crossdresser.)  

The best way to describe my reasoning for these changes in attitude is probably to give an example:  
I finally started doing some things for my ""real"" self again; most importantly, starting to grow my hair out. It's now at that weird length where no matter what you do, it looks awkward.  
In a few days, I'm going to visit a (girl-) friend of mine and stay with her and her family for three days, and I actually have a pretty big crush on her. Long story short, I want to get rid of that hair, and present as a reasonably handsome male.  

Basically, I feel under constant pressure from no-one specifically to make up my mind between ""Fuck it, finally take steps towards transitioning!"" and ""Bullshit, be the best man you can be (and get the girl!)"".   
I'm still strongly questioning, so that doesn't make this any better: Somehow, I can only see those two absolutes, and they feel mutually exclusive. 

Did anyone else struggle with this? (Or is this perfectly common indeed??)  

Any advice? "
DGunner,asktransgender,Have you ever had a day like this?,"So I'm transitioning slowly but surely, and I have way more support than most of us probably do, and life is pretty good, but...

People stare. People give bad customer service. People are rude ""for no reason"". Worst of all, people mind their own business, which is fine, but they sit there and give me *that look* while they are doing it.

Full timers, you know the look. It's the look that says ""This person is beneath me. Intrinsically worse and of less value. There's **something wrong** with this person.""

Idk if it's because of that, or because I missed my blockers last night, or because I didn't get enough sleep because I'm anxious because this is so fucking hard and I don't want to do it anymore, or if I'm just experiencing general depression or something...

But I pretty much wish I could just die. 

I don't want to commit suicide, but I don't want to be alive to experience this anymore. I just feel so defeated right now. The future seems like a mere shadow of what I first hoped it would be when I found out I could transition. 

I feel like ever since I found out puberty was over for me which means my bones can never change, I've just been being beaten down more and more since then, and it never lets up.

I just really wish I could die now please.

swodishmotboll,asktransgender,Begrudgingly accepted by my friends and it's driving me crazy.,"My group of friends (Maybe ex-friends now) are a mixed bag of different identities. Some trans, binary or non-binary, some of them are just allies. Most of them AFAB. What I don't get is that I'm just treated so differently from the transmen in my group, being the only transwoman in there. Almost as if they've just begrudgingly accepted just to make them feel like that they're all-inclusive.

I don't mean any offense to any other transmen out there because this is clearly an issue coming from my group and possibly my group only. I can't help but to feel a hint of jealousy or even resentment with how I'm treated. The transmen in the group? They're much more readily accepted by the others as female even they are clearly men. We had a ladies' only event that we had and for some reason, the two of them were almost expected to come by default and I wasn't even considered until I asked. One of the transmen was clearly uncomfortable with the idea of it, but the other had no problems with it.

Isn't it inherently transphobic to just assume that transmen would even be comfortable with going to an event like that? 

Even when talking about feminist or women issues, I don't have a voice. I'm not even allowed to because I was born a a man and I wasn't able to understand the struggle of women. They told me, I wasn't born as a girl and I was never properly socialized as they did. They shared stories of their common bond of their experiences being a woman. I was only ever thought of being the one who caused all of their struggles and problems. Sometimes, even bringing up negative experiences that I've been through just elicits a ""Oh yeah, I guess maybe it could be bad for transwomen too."" from them, as if I wasn't even supposed to be involved in the conversation in the first place.

In their eyes, transmen are simultaneously both infinitely more of a woman and man than I could ever be. Everything about their current self being men is considered a positive. Everything about my past self as a man is considered a negative. I could try speaking up again, but I don't want to be called out for being a transphobe and misogynist again. A transman's issues with being a man is a woman's issue in their eyes, whatever I've been through doesn't count at all. Nope. All I have is this stupid fucking black mark placed on me because I was born male and that's literally what I am, always.

It sickens me that all they preach is how inclusive and open-minded they are but all they want is to peddle their own brand of transphobic feminism where neither transmen and transwomen are thought of being actual men or women.

I'm trying to leave the entire thing behind me and even I know that it's bullshit, I don't really see myself the same anymore."
Miscamthropic,asktransgender,"How do you handle ""casually"" transphobic media?","I don't mean things like blatantly transphobic news, I mean stuff that's more low key. I was just listening to a video gaming podcast called DL Gaming, which I have listened to for a few weeks. Ten minutes into the episode they mention a transgender woman who was in a recent gaming tournament. The first guy seems to make an effort to gender her correctly and explain that she's transgender, but then his cohosts proceed to call her ""he"" and make jokes at her expense.

I hate situations like this, because there's so much media (webcomics, youtube channels, subreddits, etc) that is 95% fine and totally enjoyable, but then there's that random casual transphobia that creeps in and you're left thinking ""wtf? I thought these guys were cool.""

I don't want to give up on everything I enjoy because some kind of transphobia exists in it. For example, pro gaming is unfortunately known for commonly exhibiting transphobia, but I really enjoy the pro gaming scene and I don't want to cut it entirely out of my life because of that 5% rotten element. On the other hand, I don't want to support anything that is transphobic, so I'm never really sure what to do.

So I'm MtF, haven't really started transition (I had one session with a psychiatrist), but with plans to go all the way. My dysphoria hasn't been too bad, mostly just distaste for my body/facial hair (no biggie, I'll shave 9 times a week to keep it all in check), a casual loathing of my deep man voice, and an absentminded preference that my balls weren't around. 

Queue today, where I didn't have time to shave my face this morning, and my whole manhood has been sitting wrong in my underwear all day (even through 2 readjustments). Then, just recently, I had to ship some bikini calendars (I work in warehousing). I could hardly look at the covers. Not because these calendars are sexist or exploitative or something, but because they made me hate my body in a way I never have. I'm a little heavy, but I wasn't jealous of their 110 lbs physique. I was so intensely jealous of the lack of bulk in their bikini bottoms. It feels like I'll never be anywhere close to their shoes. I've spent the last 40 minutes so lost in self loathing (not *me*, I like brain me just fine-ish; not just my genitals, my whole traitor fucking body), I could hardly focus on my work. I feel a bit better now.

If I need to bump up the dosage I have another appointment in 2.5 months. Is there any knowledge on which affects the hair more, estrogen or the blockers?"
tinyshain,asktransgender,"Issues coming out at work, any advice?","I came out to my managers at work, and it went really well - they were all very supportive and cool about it. 

However, when I talked to the head manager about how I want to come out to the rest of the people I work with, which is through an email, he said he wanted to take a look at it and let me know. Understandable. Today, I talked to him and he said, after talking with HR, he was unsure if an email would be the best way to tell everyone. He said emails are usually reserved for things relevant solely to the company and not personal matters..even though he does understand this is sort of an issue that involves both. 

Context: I work for a huge technology company in one of their retail stores. I have 5 managers and there are 80 other employees I work with and see regularly. 

I really just wanted to send an email just saying, basically: Hey guys, I'm taking hormones, that's why my voice is changing, please start using male pronouns for me, and if you have any questions, I'm open to them.

So I told my manager I'd think about it and do some more research, but I'm not sure what else to do. I don't want to do it in front of everyone in person, nor do I want to come out one-by-one. 

Do you guys have any advice for me in this situation?"

My Male name, the one I was given at birth, Jack, I've been fine being called ""Jack"" and His/Him pronouns perfectly fine for 17 years. I chosen I'd like to be called ""Jackie"" as it is feminine name for Jack.


But when I started to realize I might be trans a few months back, I was still fine with the name Jack and male pronouns.



But now, when anyone calls me Jack, it now feels... weird. Like, it just doesn't sound right anymore, but before it did. Being called Jackie feels nice, and kind of cute as well.


I do remember when I was about 5 I told my mum that I hated my name. I never knew why I hated it so much, but am I thinking was it because it was a male name and not a female name, I just didn't know at the time?



I've only really felt dysphoric since I started to realize I'm trans. Either I never noticed my dysphoric thoughts before, but I kind of feel like reading how others have felt on here and other subs has made me feel this way, I don't know.

Hello everyone!

I'm not overly sure how helpful this will be to everyone, it might be somewhat impenetrable, but I'll do my best. It'll also be long. Skip the sections that don't interest you. Also, if you find what I'm saying is just confusing you, ignore this post, I'm fully expecting it to tank, but hey, maybe there are some other physicists out there who might latch onto it and find it useful.

As a prelude, I'll just give the background of why I'm making this post. I've been voice training for about a year, and have been frustrated by the vaguely subjective descriptions of the process, both in guides and from vocal coaches. Subjective feed back, and recording myself where frustrating to say the least. Beyond the dysphoria  it made me face, how could I know I wasn't being my own worst critic. When my voice felt bad, how could I know it actually was bad? When I could hear things wrong, how could I work out what *was* wrong without trial and error.

Since I have a physics PhD, I decided to do some research into the actual physics of the process, and see if I could hack out some benchmarks for what to work towards. I learned some surprising things, not least of which that a raised larynx is less important than it would appear (actually more important is a tilted larynx, training yourself to raise it inherently tilts it, which is why it's taught that way). As you can imagine, sources are limited, but I hacked something together from 15 or so papers, I'll provide links to some of the more useful ones. In total, this represents the aggregation of about 6 months of work, picking the useful bits from papers on unrelated topics, because there's almost no research on transgender voice from the physics side of things.

This will be largely physics based, I do not know if anyone else will find this useful, but my progress leapt on enormously once I compiled all of this. So, where we go.

#How the voice operates

## Vocal mechanisms

As a note, this section is (almost) completely unimportant to the practical side of things, but it is interesting. Feel free to skip it. Or not. What do I know, I'm just some text on a screen.

Physiologically there are 4 distinct means of producing sound, labelled m0 through m3. m0 and m3 (vocal fry and whistle) are not useful and will be ignored. The two remaining mechanisms, m1 and m2, are what we use to produce almost all sound.

This mechanisms are **not** the same as the vocal registers people talk about when singing/speaking, the terminology for which developed long before we knew what was actually happening physiologically, and is therefore, completely confused and muddled, and changes depending on the background of the vocal coach.

m1 involves complete closure, and full vibration of the vocal chords. m2 involves only vibrations along the edges of the vocal chords. Closure (or rather the percentage of the time the vocal chords are in contact) is always less than m1, and it is further possible for the chords to be (very very nearly) completely disconnected, not making (much) contact, but simply vibrating as air flows through them. [this source as an example](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4f1d/b5ba82e2f44c62b4f36630b90c15cbd25366.pdf)

Connecting these two mechanisms to the vocal registers everyone talks about is not easy. What we can say for certain is that 'chest' voice is definitely m1, with a high degree of chord closure. 'Falsetto' is definitely m2, with a low (almost non existent) degree of chord closure. Falsetto can not be smoothly connected to chest voice, if you start in falsetto and try to slide down into chest voice there will be a yodelling squeak when you switch. However m2 **can** be connected to m1 (not on a physiological level, precise measurements will always reveal when someone is shifting from one to the other, however, in terms of the audio sound produced, it is possible to connect them, without any change in timbre or sound pressure) This leads to the elusive 'mix voice' which is the 'goal' of the voice training we want to do. Physiologically it's actually two mixed voices, denoted mx1 and mx2 [see here for example](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/29642287_Investigating_voix_mixte_A_scientific_challenge_towards_a_renewed_vocal_pedagogy) mx1 uses *exclusively* m1, but through training you learn to 'thin out' the vocal chords (reduce the chord closure, increase the amount of time they are open) and tune the resonances so that m1 *sounds* more like m2, despite still physiologically being m1. mx2 does the same with m2, you learn the specific coordination of muscles that increases the chord closure of m2. This is a *very* unnatural step for AMAB individuals generally. AFAB people tend to hop between m1 and m2 a lot more frequently, and train both while growing up because (at least in western cultures) women convey emphasis through pitch modulation, and so flit in and out of the vocal mechanisms (incidentally, this is what lead to much confusion that 'women don't have falsetto' for centuries - they do, it just sounds more like their chest voice). Men convey emphasis through volume modulations, and tend to almost never use m2. (As another aside, I'd be very interested to hear of the experience of people who grew up speaking languages that use a lot of pitch variation to communicate, Mandarin as an example – I have a feeling AMAB people might use m2 more as a natural part of speech, and hence have an easier time with vocal training, but obviously there's no data on this)

**This is why it is important to train falsetto** If you're AMAB, odds are you exclusively use m1. The muscles for m2 are weak, underdeveloped, and uncoordinated. In order for the ultimate goal of speaking almost exclusively in mx1, with occasional shifts into mx2, m2 needs be developed. Since falsetto represents the extreme of m2, practising it will develop the muscles and coordinations needed in both mx1 and mx2. Falsetto can't connect to chest, and you don't want to ever speak in falsetto, but realise that, if you want a smooth consistent sounding voice over your entire vocal range (which probably goes a lot higher than you realise with an untrained m2), if you want to shift from m1 to m2 without a change in sound, you need to develop these coordinations. Falsetto is your friend, not your enemy. Personally, I just sang a butt tonne of Taylor Swift *giggles*

It is worth noting that, for almost all AMAB individuals the 'break' in your voice where (assume you're untrained) you flip from chest voice to falsetto occurs somewhere from c4 (261hz) to g4(392hz) while the average AFAB person talks around a3(220hz). This makes it seem like m2 is simply not useful, but beyond the fact that in regular speech cis girls often jump up well beyond c4, the aim is to get m1 taking on a lot of the characteristics (resonance and otherwise) of m2, which is best achieved by simply practising m2. Personally I've found what works for me, what produces the most consistent sound, is to use mx1 up to d4, and use mx2 above that. I can consciously feel the change from one to the other, but the sound produced is the same. Note that well trained singers have a big range within which they can switch from mx1 to mx2 without there being any difference in timbre. This allows them to have a 'chestier' voice higher up, by staying in mx1 and keeping chord closure as high as possible, before switching to a high chord closure mx2, or to be lighter by using mx2 sooner. This is where the 'one complete voice' message comes from with singing teachers – a message which I find is simply confusing, it's not one voice, and when you're starting out, you feel a very harsh 'flip' into falsetto, but through training, you learn how to coordinate your muscles so you can 'flip' without any change in sound, and even choose where you flip to change the quality of your voice.

As such, learning to sing properly (make sure you're learning properly or it can be damaging) is *also* a hugely helpful thing.


## The muscles involved


This is a completely irrelevant section to the practical side of things, but it might connect to a lot of the terminology you've come across already. Skip it or not, depending on how you feel.

So as the grossest oversimplification possible (because muscle coordinations are always complex) there are two sets of muscles important in producing sound. The cricothyroid (CT) and thryroarytenoid(TA) muscles. These muscles work in opposition to each other (as all muscles tend to in the body) – the CT muscles 'stretch out' the vocal chords, by pulling them, making them thinner, increasing pitch, and decreasing the chord closure. The TA muscles squish the vocal chords together, thickening them, dropping the sound, and increasing chord closure. All vocal production is a balance of CT vs TA muscles.

People often talk about falsetto being 'CT dominant' and chest being 'TA dominant' – this is misleading, all vocalisations use both, with the precise combination determining pitch and chord closure, greatly influencing the quality of the sound produced. 'Chest voice' actually uses *more* CT action than falsetto, but it also uses much much TA action, leading to a higher TA/CT ratio [see this for example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856144)

Learning to do anything with your voice is about learning the precise coordinations of TA and CT muscles, and then modifying the vocal tract so the produced sound is highly resonant. This is why (and how) people talk about 'thinning out' the chest voice and 'reinforcing' the falsetto, to produce a smooth consistent timbre. Untrained AMAB people tend to 'flip' into falsetto with almost completely relaxed TA muscles, which produces the light airy sound. What you want to train is adding in TA muscles, which increases chord closure, but keeping a similar TA/CT ratio. This is mx2, and it is hard, but fortunately, everyone can learn to do it. Conversely, mx1 is using your 'chest' (m1) voice, but reducing TA activity to decrease chord closure. Do this correctly and you will still 'flip' to falsetto, but the point at which you do so will have similar engagement of TA and CT muscles, and the timbres will be similar. There's no way to learn how to do this directly unfortunately, but learning how to sing will teach you these skills inherently.

## Vocal Formants

This is the most important aspect of the physics involved, this is entirely how we convey meaning when speaking, but the notion of a vocal formant is tricky, especially for non-physicists/people with no experience with Fourier series. Understanding this, and how it functions in male vs female vocals, is what gave me objective, measurement based benchmarks to work towards.

When we produce sound, we produce sound waves at a staggering number of frequencies, the lowest frequency (often called h0) is what determines the pitch of the voice, but there are a huge number of 'overtones' – multiples of this frequency, that we also produce. If we are producing a sound at 120hz (lowish tone for a male voice) then we are also producing sounds at 240hz, 360hz, 480hz etc – all the way up to and beyond 3000 to 5000 (roughly)hz.

A formant is a small band of frequencies, that, by using the various resonating chambers in our throat, mouth, and head (we don't actually ever send air into the chest, so the chest doesn't contribute to resonance at all, it just so happens that male voices produce vibratory sensations in the chest – which is why the name 'chest voice' is utterly misleading) get amplified to much higher volumes. If you're looking at the frequency spectrum of your voice on a specrometer, the formants will present as notably pronounced 'spikes' in intensities (or sound pressure) of the frequencies in a region centered on the formant.

We have many of these formants, that are centred on many different frequencies – we have one roughly every 1000hz. Crucially, by modifying the positions of the larynx, the tongue, the jaw, the soft palette, the lips, and many many other things we alter the positions of these formants. We amplify different frequencies to different levels. Every single sound we produce comes through this action, and requires the coordinations of all these different muscles, this is how we distinguish sounds, this is why an 'o' sounds different to an 'a.' Importantly the entirety of the difference between male and female voices, is in the **location and relative intensities** of these formants. For speaking, everything is conveyed by the first second formants. For singing, the third formant becomes important (so if you're wanting to train a singing voice, consider looking into this)

As an example, consider the long 'e' vowel, as in 'heed.' Male speakers have a first formant (F1) at roughly (on average) 270hz, and second formant (F2) at roughly 2200hz. Female speakers have F1 at roughly 310hz, and F2 at roughly 2750hz.

**The sound of the vowel is entirely determined by the positions/difference between F1 and F2, and the difference between male and female voices is almost entirely determined by the frequencies at which they occur**

Hacking the voice for me, then, was obsessively researching the average frequencies of F1 and F2 for female voices, measuring my own voice, and screwing around with things like larynx position (turned out to be almost completely unimportant to my surprise) larynx tilt (very very important) position of the tongue and jaw (very very important), openness of the throat, how raised the soft palette is, and even how tilted my head is, how my shoulders are sitting (raising my shoulders REALLY screwed with the sound – a lesson that, unfortunately, if you want a good quality female voice, most of your body/shoulders/throat/larynx muscles need to be relaxed, which is frustrated since nerves tend to make you tense them, but seeing the feed through of how this actually affected the voice actually helped me relax everything). Many many other little muscle movements too.

The useful part, for me, was that instead of trial and error 'trying' different sounds, listening to myself (urg what a clusterfuck of dysphoria) and hearing that my voice was wrong, but having no idea what was wrong, I could instead sit screwing around with various muscles, and learn what tuned my formants towards feminine values. As a side note you will not be able to get the formants exactly to 'average' female values, your physiology is simply different, and complete control of formants is not possible. But you will be able to shift them into female ranges (this is how we develop feminine voices) This has allowed me to get the sound, and most of the phrasing (though I still need a lot of work on this) fairly decent. The phrasing is harder because, sadly, that involves things such as pitch variations, and percentages of time spend making each particular sound in a word. I just consciously try to speak slower and with more pitch variation.

It's further worth noting that the relative intensities of the formants, ie. How much they amplify the frequencies, is also important, but much less important than their position.

And as an even further aside, I'm obsessive enough to begin researching how the formants change with emotion, to see if I can improve on the phrasing (women have much greater variations in formant positions depending on the emotional tone of the voice) for example [this paper](http://www.eejournal.ktu.lt/index.php/elt/article/view/1739) which was actually for Czech men and women, so it doesn't translate perfectly into English, but it gave me good ideas for how formants are changing based on emotional content (spoiler alert, women tend to shift formants around a lot more to express different emotions)

# Hacking the voice

Ok so that covers the physics of it all, and shows what and why I'm trying to accomplish. Now for the how. Firstly, to note, all of the steps laid out in various guides online are pretty great, they teach exercises that develop control of all of the various muscles you will need. You need to be able to control your larynx, your tongue and your jaw, to direct the airflow into various resonating cavities, and control the shape of the cavities to get the sound you want. I like [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1ske7b/mtf_voice_training_regimen/)

Once you've developed the muscles, the rest is all just coordination, and this is usually taught with a 'listen to it until it sounds right' this is where I wanted measurable benchmarks to work towards. Looking at the formants is a combination of the 'resonance' and the 'phrasing' steps in guides – if you're resonance isn't right the formants will be misplaced and lack power. If your phrasing is out, the formants will be in the wrong place when making specific sounds – you need to learn to modify your vowels so that they 'sound' female (again, trained singers spend a lot of time learning how to modify vowels – learning to sing properly makes speaking properly so much easier)

As an aside, learning to sing will do *wonders* you will learn complete control of the muscles, and find that elusive 'mixed' voice. A good exercise to practice is to slide from the bottom of your vocal range, all the way to the top, through the break into falsetto. Eventually you can learn to 'iron out' the break (this is hard) so you don't notice it at all – this will give you a good base, but is not strictly necessary to have a female speaking voice.

If you feel you're still developing the muscles and coordinations, the rest of this post will be (even more) useless to you, focus on this bit first.

## Measuring the formants

This is the difficult part, it's somewhat subjective and can not be easily described, nor is there easily accessible software to do it for you (The stuff that does exist is aimed at academia, I've considered coding something, I'll think about it more). So here's a crude method that I did. You'll need a spectroscope app – not spectrogram (which essentially shows a changing spectroscope over time). I like 'Advanced Spectrum Analyser PRO' – free on the android store, since it labels the frequencies at which powerful, resonant peaks are occuring. I can't offer much advice on this front, but any method you have of extracting formants will do, I trusted my analysis of frequency spectra. This will show the 'power' or 'intensity' (usually in dB) of the sound being produced at each frequency. Modifying the settings to lower numbers (1024) of FFT samples might help identify it.

I don't know how easy or accurate this will be if you have no experience with signal analysis/fourier transforms. It's subjective interpretation, and susceptible to wilful misinterpretations (you want the formants to be in a certain place, so you're more willing to interpret the data that they are in that position as an inherent bias). I don't know what to do about this other than say, sorry if this is completely unhelpful for you. (If anyone can recommend an easy to use piece of software for it I would be appreciative, I didn't look too hard because I wasn't ever thinking of making this a guide, just tinkering with my own voice, and I'm happy interpreting my own frequency spectrums.).

What you're looking for, is something like [this](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Music/imgmus/fantvowred.gif) which shows quite nicely how formants can move around with different vowel sounds. You're not looking for the 'the two highest peaks,' as those will be really close to each other and correspond to the same formant (usually F1), but rather the 'band' of frequencies that are more intense than the rest. Remember formants occur as a 'band' of frequencies that get amplified by the specific structure of your vocal passage and mouth (see the diagrams of the mouth and throat shapes to get an idea of what's going on). You want to find (roughly) the centre of the first two bands, ignore F3 it's not helpful unless you're singing. (This is sometimes called the singers formant!) [Here](http://www.feilding.net/sfuad/musi3012-01/images/lectures/vocal_response_plots.gif) and [here](http://clas.mq.edu.au/speech/acoustics/speech_spectra/images/nat02_fft_lpc_05573_026msfftwin.gif) are schematic illustrations that're also useful.

Formants can be hard to identify, especially F1 – you may not be producing frequencies at the point that the formant is providing most power. But the formants are **independent** of the pitch you're speaking at, and specific to the particular sound you're making (this is how we identify vowels and consonants). A good method is to hold a particular sound, and sweep through a range of frequencies. The formants should jump out to you, and with a bit of trial and error you can find out where they're centred. Zooming in on the region of frequencies where the formant occurs can help.

## So we have the formants, now what?

Here again it gets subjective, formants will vary with language, accent, and emotion in addition to gender differences. A simple answer for how you want to change the formants is 'higher frequency than you have.' I will provide some general ballpark figures. [This](http://acoustics.org/pressroom/httpdocs/161st/Hancock.html), which studies trans women directly (the figure on this page was super helpful – it represents the 4 most extreme vowel sounds, if you can master those, you can master them all)... [and this](http://www.feilding.net/sfuad/musi3012-01/images/lectures/vocal_formant_freqs.jpg) (taken from [here](http://www.feilding.net/sfuad/musi3012-01/html/lectures/017_instruments_IV.htm) give you a rough idea for English, but there are variations. [The wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant) also provides some good (although not gendered) ideas of where we're at.

Personally, I sat down with a cis girl, and measured her formants for [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel#/media/File:Vowel_triangle,_intermediate_vowels.png) vowel chart. Then I measured my own, and tried to shift them up towards hers.

## Modifying formants

So there are lots of muscle combinations involved in changing the shape of your vocal tract and mouth, to produce different sounds. In general F1 is easier to shift towards female ranges  – it is largely determined by the length of the vocal tract. Raising your larynx will shift this. As a note, I actually realised I was raising my larynx too high – producing more childish sounds, than feminine ones. This is frustrating to deal with, because laryngeal tilt is an important factor in F2, but usually when you're first learning, you can only manage to tilt the larynx *by* raising it. Trained singers learn to tilt their larynx independently of raising it (not consciously, but by learning to change the sounds they learn to do it). Singing helped me, I don't have any advice outside of this (but hey, you may not need to learn to raise and tilt your larynx independently).

F2 is determined primarily by jaw, mouth and tongue positions (laryngeal controls the air flow that determines how powerful it is). As a general rule, you want to create as much space in your throat/mouth as you can – which involves and open jaw, a more open mouth, and a more open throat than you're typically used to speaking with (imagining a golf ball stuck in your throat while speaking helped me open mine – you can also practice it by smiling wide like a maniacal genius, and you should feel your throat opening up).

But here's the kicker – by looking at the formants I didn't have to do any trial and error based on sounds. I could just play around making a vowel sound and simply shift my tongue up and down, open and close my throat, raise lower my larynx, open my mouth, lower my jaw, shift my jaw forward. Any number of motions (producing wildly silly sounds in the process) and see how my formants were moving around when I did this. The specific arrangement that was 'best' (ie. Closest to female) for any given sound, I could thus hone in on, and then practice the hell out of it until it was comfortable. [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/d1ZUk) an example using my own voice on a long 'ee' vowel (as in 'keen') The first is my old voice, speaking comfortably. Just from the snapshot it can be hard to see where F1 is, but by sweeping my voice up and down in pitch, I could confirm it was at ~260hz. F2 is similarly around 1650-1700Hz. F3 is unimportant (unless we want to sing). When I shift to my female voice – raising the larynx, tilting it, pushing my jaw forward a bit, opening my mouth slightly more, opening my throat, and lifting my tongue further, we get the second picture. Pitch is raised to a good range for females (228Hz) F1 is now even harder to identify, but again by sweeping the pitch I find it around 320Hz. F2 is at 2k Hz. Comparing to [our chart](http://www.feilding.net/sfuad/musi3012-01/images/lectures/vocal_formant_freqs.jpg) for, say, 'beat.' We should have something around F1 = 270hz F2=2300hz for male and F1=300hz, F2 = 2800Hz.

Well my F1 is going well, my F2 kinda sucks. But that's ok! This is definitely the hardest vowel for me (which is why I chose it). British English seems to have a more closed 'ee' sound than American english, which would lower F2 (This is why I used a cis girl.... Her F2 was at 2500hz – so again I'm not great, but I'm definitely shifting towards female, and with the accuracy of F1, it actually sounds pretty good).

Note it can be hard to get enough power into your formants while speaking in a female voice – this is the 'resonance' aspect of voice training regimes you come across – you are used to having powerful 'male' 'chest' resonences reinforcing 'male' formants. You need to relearn how to direct the flow of to maximise the resonances of female formants (raising and tilting the larynx helps a lot – this is, explicitly, finding your head voice) So being able to study the intensity really helped me on this front – literally just try to control your larynx, moving it about, and open your throat, play around making different noises until you see a lot of power going in to F2 – this is the 'resonance' you want. Practice it.

All in all, don't stress too much if you can't shift your formants towards the values listed in the tables – it is hard. But eventually you should be able to get F1 pretty well, and F2 should at least be a lot higher than what you had previously. As long as you're tangibly seeing F1 and F2 increase in frequency, you're moving in the right direction.

I would also add in 'm' and 'n' sounds, since they're noticeably different between male and female voices – don't worry about the other consonants, if the vowels are right they’ll likely be fixing themselves.

Here's a short (rough) table of what I think is reasonable, starting with the most important ones. Again it matters more in the context of how male and female speakers sound in your area. **Do not worry if you can't get things close to values you see here, focus on finding where your formants are, and shifting them upwards** (pretty much as far as you can while still making the same vowel sound) You'll be limited by your physiology, but you'll seen find 'the best' your phsyiology can manage. And this is almost always enough

There's to much to simply list as a table, nor do I think it's helpful to practice everything individually. Rather, every time I hear something in my speech that doesn't sound right, instead of trying to trial and error fix it, I make a measurement of my voice, make a measurement of my friendly cis girl's voice, and try to shift mine to hers.

Nearly 5000 worlds later and I think I'm done. Time for this to die because it's probably not helpful unless you're very technically minded. Oh well, at least I have it written out for my own sake. Feel free to ask me to clarify anything, I'll do my best.

Edit: /u/kmirum pointed me to some very useful software [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) free to download. (Thank you for this). Open it up, in the main window select 'new' -&gt; Record mono sound. Start recording, speak your vowel of choice, press stop when you're done, name it if you want, and then press 'save to list and close.' You'll see your little sound clip appear in the main window. Press 'view and edit' and in the menu bar of the window it opens, select 'Formants' and 'Show Formants.' It'll plot red lines where the formants are. Clicking (carefully) on the first and second lines, and reading off the red value on the left of the graph will give you the frequency of your formants. It'll also show the frequency of the fundamental pitch in blue writing on the right hand side.

Note: There will likely be more error in the reported value of F1 - this is especially true for sounds that have low frequency F1 (the lower the frequency of a formant the harder it can be to identify exactly but some automated process) - do not stress too much about F1 if its not perfect., there are some limitations on this that the automated software might miss a bit. F2 should be very accurate... A downside of this is that it's harder to see how powerful your formants are, but hey, that's not too big a deal. Again I'll reemphasise - do not worry too much about the values listed in tables so much, there are going to be variations by language accent and voice. Rather, just use it to check when you're trying a 'female' voice, that your formants aren't in the same place as your old voice, and ideally that they're moving a bit towards the values of a cis girl you know. And as always, never strain yourself, this can cause damage."
LisaLies,asktransgender,A wakeup call that I need to start acting my gender. (content warning: rape/sexual assault/sexual harassment),"Hey all! 

I had a really terrifying experience last night. I'm staying at a hotel, and I had a few friends visit me in my room. When they all left, one guy stayed behind. I didn't know him, I didn't even know his name. 

I asked if he wanted to head out or have another beer. He said he'd love to have another drink and chat about activism. He's new to progressive politics and I'm seasoned. 

I won't go into the details, but it wasn't long before he was intoxicated, touching me inappropriately, and then he showed me his penis. 

I work in health care, so unfortunately I know as part of my trade how to deescalate a sexual assault. I handled it well and escorted him from my room before lying down and crying. I'm only functioning on 2.5 hours of sleep today. 

He tried to get me to let him back in my room, I said no, and this morning there was empty cans of the brand of beer he was drinking outside my door, evidence that he had been waiting outside my room. 

I shared my experience with a few feminists that I respect. I felt better, I'm not pursuing a formal complaint, and I'm not switching hotel rooms. 

It was a huge wakeup call. I can't let myself believe that I'm too ugly to be assaulted. It's not about looks, it's about power, his attraction to my power and wanting to take that away, and when trans women are involved it's also about a new sexual thrill. 

I can't have random men alone with me in a hotel room ""for a beer."" I'm a woman, and despite my. self perception, men will see me as a woman and treat me as a woman. Women don't invite random men into their hotel room for ""just a beer."" They learn that early in life. 

It's amazing how, in an hour, you can turn from a powerful and respected feminist and activist into a shivering and terrified girl clutching pepper spray. 

I thought about it this morning. About the statistics. He showed me a photo of his baby and his fiancée. I thought about how, if he had raped me, he may well have thought about his young family and been so filled with shame that he might have murdered me. That's the story that's commonly heard, and those are the statistics, and I'm a part of that statistic. Reading about it doesn't mean absorbing it. I hold a lot of privilege, but I am still part of those statistics and I have to recognize that. 

Be safe."
ash2810,asktransgender,Changing mind about wanting GRS?,Hi guys! Hope you are all well and had a good Christmas/holiday season. Before I started transition and up until recently I knew I definitely wanted to have GRS (I am mtf by the way). But now I've been on hormones roughly 4 months and changed my name and I'm feeling more content with myself I don't feel that I'm going to need it? My genitals never really gave me dysphoria I just felt I wanted surgery to feel 'complete' in the end. I was just wondering if anyone else had felt this way?
spacehanger,asktransgender,Drinking alcohol while taking testosterone?,Is this something you can do or do the two not mix?
imkillingmyselfnextm,asktransgender,Has anyone found a reliable way to switch off dysphoria without hurting themselves or transitioning?,I always end up getting dysphoria at the most inconvenient times and it makes me completely unable to focus on anything else. Is there any way that would make it go away at least for a little bit?
ftmthrowaway00100101,asktransgender,"Dysphoria and SSRIs (and [possible] OCD), what is your experience with them?","(Ah, I didn't mean for this to be so long. I apologise.)

I am currently prescribed Movox (Fluvoxamine) for depression but I haven't taken it (and am avoiding taking it) in months for multiple reasons but the main one is that it makes me feel rather apathetic towards my gender and I hate it. I recently read that Movox is used to treat OCD which I've been suspecting I might be for several months now or at least I have a very obsessive personality. That being said, I think about my gender a lot. At least a few times an hour. So for this urgent need to transition go away... I don't really know what to do with myself. Like have I been wrong all this time? 

I have seen a few posts on here about OCD and people having the question ""am I trans?"" out of nowhere come into their head and since then they've began to obsess over the thought with no real reason to think so. This isn't my case. I've had ""signs"" since age 9 and have been questioning for at least a decade. I have never been incredibly feminine but not outwardly ""you're like a boy in a girl's body"" type deal either. Just in the middle, leaning one way on the other on this or that. Age 11, I became obsessed with wanting straight hips to the point where I googled whether it's possible to break a person's hips and reshape and reset them. Then around age 14, I found out about transgender people and that top surgery was a thing. And it's just kinda worsened as I got older to the point now where (I think) I know what I want and that is to come out, go on hormones, and have top surgery. And I think about it like seriously 75-80% of the time in some way. But then I take those damn pills and I don't think about it much at all? It's incredibly invalidating.

Movox doesn't make me want to ""stay"" a girl but... makes it bearable? Maybe /that's/ it? I don't feel like a girl on it but I don't feel that ""transition or suicide"" feeling either. My sex drive is nonexistent on them too and I am naturally hypersexual. So maybe not thinking about sexual things all the time has something to do with it as well.

I want to take my medication again because I can't stand my personality off it but I don't really like myself on it either. It's cliche but combined with Seroquel, I feel like some sort of robot/zombie.

I'd love to hear what has been other people's experience with taking antidepressants (SSRI types preferably) and it's effects on your dysphoria/view of your physical sex and transitioning to the right one? Have any of you experienced similar effects?

I'm so used to this obsessive thought pattern—my mum says I'm definitely an ""intense"", ""passionate"" person""—that to think... normally? It's so foreign.... Does anyone have an explanation for this?"

I'm not always a good he happiest about my gender, but when I was younger it never seemed like a viable option. I repressed all of those feelings, thinking nothing about them would ever fulfilled. I often feel deep feelings of longing, looking at women, the female form. I frequently wish I could just become what I admire so deeply. I am now 24, and now it seems to me that these feelings could never be fulfilled, I'm so very masculine now. I don't think I'd ever look female. I think I am, but I'm just so unsure as to what I'd do about it. Sometimes it feels like I'm going crazy just thinking about it.

-Jen-,asktransgender,Suicide is hard. My failed sob story from last night.,"I want to preface this up front by saying am not an advocate for suicide nor do I want to romanticise it. I just want to tell a real story of what happened to me last night, and what went through my mind as a the silly transgender idiot that I am.

So last night around 10pm. I decided initially to take a walk to the beach. It’s about 2miles from my home town in Formby.

I took a small bottle of whisky that I sipped along the way, along with a sharp kitchen knife, and a bunch of sleeping pills and 4 methadone pills. I also took my bobble hat and headphones for some comfort. I had no concrete plan in my head despite the supplies. I just knew that dysphoria had taken my hand and ushered me outside, sleepwalking into freezing weather, and I wanted to see if I had the courage to be completely compliant with it.

A ton of thoughts began to whir, whilst passing all these cute houses twinkling with lights, seeing the yappy dogs and happy people on the inside as my hands became more numb. I nuzzled into my coat for warmth. Why wasn’t I happy? whats wrong with my brain? Can anyone help me? Will I ever be happy with myself, or even love myself enough to reciprocate love? Can someone please take this pain away. Can I go back time pls? Why am I ugly? Why me? Why me? Why me?

I took a detour to a nearby park instead of the beach, and sat down with my teeth chattering in the middle of an open field looking at the stars. I watched my breath climb in the air, and sat cross legged sobbing. I took huge gulps of whisky and took a few of the pills to try and warm and numb myself a bit more, and began to run the knife along my wrist, applying just enough pressure to nick the skin.

To prepare for this, I then googled “Is slitting your wrists painful” and realised how hard it actually is, since your body will do everything to survive it, lowering your heart rate so you lose less blood and clot easier. It can take an hour to pass out, its really, really painful, and even if you do pass out, theres no guarantee you will die. It turns out your body doesn’t want the same things you do. 

I have heard the saying that “Depression is living in a body that fights to survive, with a mind that wants to die” and its so true,..especially in my case. When you add Gender Dysphoria on top of that,..well that becomes a cruel joke.

So thinking that wouldn’t work, my thoughts turned to hanging after finding a tree swing with some plastic ties.  I was struggling to feel my hands at this point, I cut 6-7ft of the tie and found a low lying branch to wrap it around, and put the other end around my neck to make a knot. It was slippery though as it was a wet plasticky cable tie, so every-time I tried to drop myself into the knot on my knees, it would choke me and cut into my neck with its sharp edges,….but it then began to untie and slip.

So I googled nooses, to make sure it wouldn’t loosen. When I tested the next knot on my arm, I knew this time I wouldn’t get out of it at all. I would suffocate and die almost guaranteed.

So I put my head inside the knot, but at this point I was getting colder and honestly I was starting to get really scared. I started thinking about my ex girlfriend, who is getting married on Thursday, and how I would completely ruin her and her fiancés day. I started to think of promises I had made to certain people, giving the hormones more time (I’m 6 months) I thought about my mum and dad before Christmas absolutely devastated. I thought about being warm. I thought about that faceless person I could be with happy in the future, that I would never get to kiss or cuddle. I started to look at pictures of me and feel almost separated from myself…and then feel guilty that I would be ending their life. It was really bizarre.

So with my head inside, I decided to put my left hand inside the knot as I lowered myself. I thought that I could just still suffocate myself to death easily, but that my hand could stop me if I wanted to. I had heard stories of people jumping off high bridges, who had survived, but having regrets almost immediately after jumping. So as a comparison, I thought that If I was feeling ok mid hanging, I would then take my hand out and let it suffocate me.

I hung there on my knees and let the rope take my weight and started to gag for air. As the music began to muffle and quieten I completely panicked. The tighter and tighter it started to press into my neck. I used my right hand to relieve the pressure of the rope and sat there crying for a few more minutes before getting my breath back. I then picked my sorry self up and walked the 3 miles home. I got a shower and started to recollect on a bunch of stuff.

I guess I realised in more clarity that suicide is reaaalllly hard, and I’m not a brave person by any measure. Theres a lot of people that say its an easy and selfish way out. I couldn’t disagree more. Wanting to switch the lights off is easy,..but dying to cross that path is much more difficult. 

I realised last night also that, the closer you get to doing it, the more you realise that the mind is also geared to survive. It starts flushing you with thoughts that will trigger regret and doubt, anything to stop you and reconsider.

As for other takeaways I’m not so sure. I’m alive I guess? I definitely try and see the fortune I have in my life, and be grateful for my health, my job, my friends and family, but I’m terrible for seeing the bigger picture. When I’m at my lowest, my appetite for self destruction becomes almost like an addiction. I’m 6 months into hormones, and I don’t know how long I can wait for changes, and even then I don’t know what changes will occur.

So I'm marking this as a shitty juncture in my transition, and I’m sure there are many girls who have been in a similar situation as I was last night, and came through it. Some didn't. You aren’t alone, and if you ever need someone just to talk about it, I would like to give back. This community has helped me on so many ways I am so grateful. 

I just wanted to post this to show how real dysphoria gets, and the crazy, awful shit it will drive you to do. Prior to transition I could never understand the astronomically high suicide rates. Now that I’m transitioning, It makes perfect sense.

So for now I’m alive, and grateful, listening to shitty Christmas songs, drinking hot chocolate, and hoping that the days ahead get somewhat brighter.

Happy Christmas Everyone. Here’s to another day

bigmeetch565,asktransgender,Will laser hair removal on my face be permanent or leave me with less of a beard?,"I am currently following the instructions of my therapist to make small changes in my life before taking the plunge to hormones and am currently looking into facial laser hair removal. I do not have much body hair so I think I only need it on my face. 

But my question is if I decide to not end up transitioning will I end up with a beard later in life? I know laser is not permanent but will it grow back less thick or weirdly patchy? 

Thanks for any help."
secondaccount42,asktransgender,Sounds Like I'm Starting Antiandrogens Soon... Quick Question,"I plan on trying to lose weight before I get anywhere near starting the rest of HRT... how much is starting anti-androgens gonna mess with my ability to lose weight? I can't remember if I heard it was anti-androgens, or estrogen that actually effected weight loss..."
pinkchips,asktransgender,Whoa! I had trouble making my voice deep for the first time today! (4 months casual voice practice),"I practice voice for about half an hour a day in the car while driving, and have slowly learned through trial and error about Adam's Apple placement and building up the muscles to hold it up and back.  
  
It really felt absolutely impossible when I first started and now it's just an inconvenience - but I can definitely do it.  I feel like with time I can hold it even farther up and back.  
  
In the last month I've been working on *where* my voice emanates and resonates from.  I used to think I needed to move it up and forward, almost into my mouth, but yesterday I realized that I needed to actually just keep moving the 'resonance' ever higher, even into the sinus area.  
  
Anyway, after four months of practice my normal 'guy' speaking voice is a little higher naturally and when I actually put forth max effort I can get an *almost* passing female voice.  Songs which seemed difficult/impossible to sing on key just 6 months ago (like Sia's Cheap Thrills) can now be hit with 95% accuracy, but just takes some effort to do.  And finally some really 'this is utterly impossible' high notes, like those in Disney songs, are now occasionally obtainable.  
  
Anyway, in what was an amazing moment today, a friend confessed she had told her dad about me being trans.  I replied that when I met him I was gonna try to mess with him by being as macho as possible and having a super deep voice.  When I tried to make a joking deep voice though.... it didn't work.  Like, there was *something* in the way, as if I was hitting the bottom of a well.  My voice went down to a minimum and couldn't go any lower without severe resistance.  
  
I was surprised and delighted.  I've never felt that before.  I think it is my first undeniable sign of progress, and I've been mildly euphoric about it all day.  And if this is just with four months of casual practice, imagine what I'll be able to do with another year of serious practice?  Now that I'm on HRT, time en femme will be increasing, so hence more opportunities to practice voice.  
  
Just wanted to share.  Voice always seemed like such an impossible hurdle, and still seems like a long road ahead, but having seen definite results I now feel I can actually do this instead of being forever cursed with a low and non-passing set of pipes!  ��������  
  
Other people's stories and comments of voice success are welcome!"
maxrevive,asktransgender,What is the process for getting HRT like?,"What are the steps, how long does it take, etc? I live in California if that makes a difference.

"
secondaccount42,asktransgender,Why Do I Feel So Pressed for Time?,"I have no idea why, but this last week I've started to feel really impatient. I've been focusing so much effort into trying to finally push forward towards transitioning while I have the motivation to (hence my abundance of posts), and my head is spinning.  
I can't think about anything too much during the school day or I may stupidly blurt something out that I shouldn't, but now that I'm at home, I feel like I should be doing something, *anything* to take steps towards my goals. I know if I don't I'll likely lose all motivation to keep these goals in mind (this is why I can't lose weight lol [and yes I'm using transitioning as a motivator for that, too]), and I'll likely just sit through the mental screaming like always.  
I may be getting annoying with the frequency, but please understand that any moment spent asking questions, or doing anything to keep this goal at the forefront of my mind makes me feel like I'm being productive.  
If anyone knows of something to get me to stop asking questions while fueling my need to make progress, *please* let me know! This is driving my bonkers!"
capitalH-E-L-P,asktransgender,Pretty scared my upcoming therapist won't believe I'm trans... any advice?,"I'm about to make an appointment with a therapist with my mother. The therapist doesn't *specialize* in trans issues (no gender therapists in my area anyways) but lists that she does deal with trans people. Yet, I'm still scared she's not going to believe me. It took nearly 14 months to get my mom to believe me, and my mind is telling me that a medical professional will be more skeptical. Especially since I'm a teenager and was born female, I'm scared that instead of tackling the trans issue head-on and be taken seriously, she'll instead try to find the ""root"" of the problem and see what's *""really""* causing those feelings. 

I've had my negative feelings towards my female body be shrugged off by medical professionals in the past, which is why I'm so scared now. I know I shouldn't prejudge her and that she can potentially be a very good therapist, but I'm still a nervous wreck. I don't think reading those stories about therapists who tried and convince their trans patients that they weren't really trans hasn't helped me either."
HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,Did HRTs efects change after surgery (orchi/srs)?,Just curious.  Read someones experience that it became more effective/changed and ive been having trouble lowering my T levels and spiros side effects are so frustrating sometimes so yeah
pinkchips,asktransgender,"As a MtF, I wish I had gotten laser sooner and started finasteride sooner. I'm sure we all do. If you are questioning, and wanting to explore, I can't recommend these things enough.","Today its a little more than a week post my first full body laser session and *finally* all the super-stubble left behind has mostly fallen out.  When it went it left ridiculously smooth skin behind it.  
  
The emotional relief to rub your face and feel soft, stubble-free skin for the first time in your adult life... is indescribable.  To touch your leg and not feel a thousand little spikes, to actually feel girlish underneath your fingers... it honestly brought me to tears.  For the first time, the horrible manly body I have been a prisoner in my entire life has started to dissolve, and the sense of 'rightness' is overwhelming.  
  
And I wish I had started the fin years ago.  It might have allowed me to come to terms with myself much sooner.  It blocks DHT, and all I hear is how DHT doesn't do much for the body.... but that is nonsense.  DHT is one of the most masculinizing hormones there is.  You're not gonna convince me that we have a useless hormone running around in our body - it was a huge cause of dysphoria and discomfort for me.  Blocking it these past couple of months has been absolute joy.  Its hard to quantify the masculinizing effects of DHT, but I know they are there, and getting rid of them is a wonderful half-step on the road to transition.  
  
If you have been seriously questioning yourself for more than a year, and can somehow afford these things (finasteride is available as a 'hair loss' pill in forms Propecia and Proscar) then please don't hesitate any longer.

josephinek24,asktransgender,"GRS/SRS with Dr. Loren Schechter, Chicago","I’m a trans female in Chicago and began looking into GRS about two years ago. I started with the doctors typically named here, Bowers, McGinn, etc. My therapist pointed me instead to Dr. Schechter. I found few references online, but after researching on my own and meeting with him I decided to go with him. I wanted to share my experiences here so there would be a little more for future folks to go on. 

First the tl;dr: I am 6 1/2 weeks post-op (I will update this after my results have settled more) and while he’s not perfect, overall I highly, highly recommend Dr. Schechter.

I chose him based on local references - my therapist and doctor (who each send lots of people his way), a couple friends of friends, my electrolysist. Everyone I talked to raved about him. I was warned that his office staff could be difficult and that his bedside manner could be a bit abrasive (‘nothing awful, he’s just a surgeon’), but told that he had loads of experience and skill, that his follow-up was exceptional, and that his patients tended to be very satisfied with their results. He also took insurance.

Here’s the bad part: his office staff were terrible. Like 0/10. I’m level-headed, articulate, and adept at navigating medical systems. Even with that the lead-up to getting a surgery date felt like fighting a war. I baked them cookies, I cried on the phone, I called daily, I leveraged my insurance company, I visited in person multiple times with my infant son, I tried everything. My timeline was tight because I only had a six-month window of being insured. They never followed through on a single promise, and when I gave them my paperwork for the insurance company they sat on it for a month (one of my precious six) before I learned they'd never sent it in. I only made it within my window because when it looked terrifyingly like they were going to let me fall through, my therapist reached out to Dr. Schechter directly to complain and suddenly the gears started turning. I don’t want to sugar coat this - it was bad. If it hadn’t been for my therapist being a major reference for him and really going to bat for me, I truly think they would have kept putting me off until my six months passed and I went away. So be wary, especially of Toynoia.

But I got my surgery date. November 3. And when I got handed from the office staff to Dr. Schechter himself and the folks at Weiss Hospital, you guys - EVERYTHING changed.

First of all, the surgery was nine hours long. My electrolysist had sat in on one of these surgeries, and also one of McGinn’s, and she said she was blown away by how much more meticulous and careful Schechter was (McGinn’s are typically half this length). And I had two partners with me (I'm poly), and they were both welcomed equally and treated respectfully from the start.

And oh my goddess this hospital. It’s a neighborhood hospital, not a conglomerate, but it was clearly managed well and it felt modern and clean. And it was clear that Schechter’s gender program is the absolute PRIDE of this building. His patients are given the best rooms - top floor overlooking Lake Michigan, and I had the corner room that also had windows overlooking the skyline (as one nurse said, 'we figure trans people's lives are hard enough'). The nursing staff all seemed to want to work with his patients. The nursing supervisor checked in with us nightly and commiserated with us on election night. Even the maintenance person who came to fix our a/c raved about Dr. Schechter and how much the hospital loved his program. I had a large room and they left a second bed so a partner could spend the night, and the two of them swapped off for the full nine days. The nurses got to know them by name. Several of the nurses also gave us the impression that while Schechter isn’t widely known in this subreddit, he’s very highly respected in the plastic surgery community for his work on this procedure, he apparently gives lectures and training sessions that people fly in from all over the world to take.

I saw Dr. Schechter every morning and some afternoons for the eight further days I stayed. Every time he took the time to listen to us and answer our questions. We also had a nurse practitioner, Pat, who was very knowledgeable and who gave us her cell phone number (we just sent her a Christmas card we loved her so much). Between the two of them and our rotating nurses, I felt more cared for than I could have imagined. Schechter did most things himself, removed my packing and catheter, taught me dilating, etc. I guess I could see why some people might not love his bedside manner, he wasn’t cuddly, but he smiled and joked with us and I felt genuinely cared for. As far as I’m concerned that’s what I needed from my surgeon. 10/10 A+.

I had two minor complications on my second day after surgery, which were some bleeding that needed to be cauterized and a gas buildup in my intestines (the pain meds had shut my system down so the gas couldn’t escape). It was Schechter’s day off but he arrived within 30 minutes of the problems being discovered and spent three hours working through both issues, ensuring they were resolved completely before he left. My parents showed up about half an hour before he finished, and he saw the looks on our faces as my wife ran out to head them off and hold them in the waiting room. And he made a point of stopping by the waiting room as he left to introduce himself to them and compliment both me and my partners to them. A really nice, gracious touch.

After discharge I had one more complication, which was my fault. I screwed up dilating and accidentally knocked a couple of stitches out of a skin graft. We called Pat and ended up talking to her and Schechter at like 10:00 at night, and they arranged for us to come in the next day. They didn’t know from just pictures whether I might need to go back into surgery (ugh), so gave me pre-surgical instructions. But here’s the thing: Pat arranged a room for us in the pre-surgery area of the hospital completely off the books. That way they could clean me up, check me out, and then formally admit me if I needed to go into the OR. Luckily I didn’t, so we didn't have to deal with insurance or anything. Truthfully I’d been grateful for the chance to see them again and be told everything was okay, and gave Pat a big hug on the way out. :)

I’m now 6 1/2 weeks out and feeling really really good. There’s still plenty of healing to be done and swelling to go down, but I’m honestly feeling better than I expected to be. I went off pain meds early several weeks ago, I’m now able to lift my 35-pound one-year-old pretty easily, and my vagina is starting to look like a vagina. It’s very, very clear that my nerve endings are intact, I’m actually nervous I’ll have more sensation than I want down there (I’m pretty sensitive and I’m nervous I’ll never be able to take direct contact to my clit, which honestly is a great problem to have), and I’m getting used to all the nerves’ new locations. Again, I’ll update this later, but right now I’m thrilled.

Something about Schechter that could either be bad or good, depending on who you are: he puts a lot of trust in his patients to know their own bodies and make the right decisions for themselves. He let me decide exactly when to discharge from the hospital, he has me set my own dilating schedule, as I’ve healed he’s let me decide when I’m okay to lift weight and exercise and drive and everything else without his having to clear it. It’s nice in some ways, but also a little jarring - it’s easy to worry I’m doing something wrong! And he doesn’t always think to give all the information I need if I don’t ask for it. When I went for my first follow-up appointment I brought a list of questions, and I’m grateful I did because he volunteered very little before I started asking. Once I did ask he patiently and carefully answered everything. I’ve never needed to email him a question, but he encouraged me to do that too if it felt necessary. My first follow up was three weeks after surgery, and my next is six weeks after that.

Schechter requires less dilating than some surgeons, and also a faster healing schedule than some. I wondered why, but my electrolysist thought it might be because of how meticulous he is both in surgery and in the first week of healing - “there’s no way his patients don’t heal faster and with less nerve damage because he’s so careful.” Whatever the reason, I've found his schedule accurate. I’m already down to dilating just twice a day with my biggest dilator (1 3/8”), I passed his six-week mark for being cleared to lift weight and exercise and everything feeling like it was about right, and I’m definitely starting to get some pleasure sensations already. The only things I still officially can’t do are penetrative sex (that’s at eight weeks) and immersing in a bathtub/swimming pool (he’s addressing that at my nine-week appointment). 

This isn’t as brief as I intended but I hope it’s a useful overview. Feel free to reach out to me privately as well as in the comments, I’m not a regular redditor but I’ll do my best to check in and answer as I know this will probably pop up in searches from time to time.

Ember718,asktransgender,Digit Ratios,"God above, I know this is petty, and obsessive and meaningless- but I cant get it out of my head, so here it goes...

I have been looking up digit ratios recently, and, what with the growing concensus that being transgender is caused by in-utero hormonal fluctuations, I am somewhat freaked out. My ring finger is at least 4cm longer than my index on both sides, which seems to indicate normal testosterone levels. And whenever I even think about that, disphoria and ocd come down in a landslide of depression. 

The thing is, I am actually rather feminine in apearence normally (hell, save for my shoulders, I look exactly like my Mom when she was this age) but that could easily be coincidence, and in the end such is genetics, not hormones (I have an identical twin brother who is not transgender in the slightest... so... yeah.)

To just add to the fun: I am turning 18 later this year and I am on the brink of panic over the prospect of starting HRT. I am afraid it wont help; or my body will reject it; or something like that. I feel like a woman. But I am just scared my body doesnt.-- if that makes sense.

Sorry, I know that I have just been rambling. I will stop now. I just had to get that out. Also, my apologies for any grammatical slights, I am typing this on my phone with maybe an hour of sleep.

Thank you and have a good night."

maybejennifer,asktransgender,I'm not sure of my gender identity but I'm sure some things which may help me find an answer. Anybody help?,"So... 24/AMAB is fact #1.

#2 I don't look to cis-men for inspiration for appearance or style. I'm usually very envious of really pretty cis/trans girls. 

#3 I'm aroused by the idea of being a girl. Which I've read is an effect of being MTF transgender, not a cause of it. I'm also exclusively attracted to non-male genders. Mostly cis-females. 

#4 I'm toning my body to look feminine. I don't want to surgically change it but would be open to HRT.

#5 I just can't settle with being seen as a cis-male or simply a man. I'm okay with being seen as non-binary but it seems to fall short with what I actually feel. 

#6 Everything seems to point to being MTF but I'm doubting it. Passing it off as a fetish or something which is probably a consequence of denial and/or socialization as a male.

Ugh. I know there's a truth here that i'm avoiding. Society is set up in a way that being AMAB and cis-male for me would seem the most prosperous and safe outcome. Which is cowardly and true. Just not right for me."
Jazz8680,asktransgender,Anyone know any neutral feminine perfumes?,"So I've been questing for about two weeks now, and something that really helps me is using women's deodorant. Something about having a more feminine smell really eases my mind. It just feels more natural. 

That being said, I'm doing this all in secret. I cant really go anywhere to test any, or buy any in a store. So I'm going to go out on a limb and ask what you guys like that I could buy on amazon. Preferably cheaper the better (in case I don't like it I don't have to feel guilty for throwing it out). 

Any thoughts?"
pinkchips,asktransgender,Working on having an appropriately gendered internal monologue? I tried this today and it gave me instant and massive relief.,"(I am MtF, so reverse the genders mentioned here if you are FTM)  
  
I realized today that my internal monologue is half-monotone and half-my actual voice that I have gotten used to over the years.  So it is definitely masculine.  
  
For fun today, I imagined a professional and smooth woman's voice and internally made it my own.  Then I forced myself to think in this voice.  
  
All at once, I felt a huge wave of relief wash over me.  It was affirming and calming in way I haven't experienced before.  
  
For those pre-transition, have you tried this experiment?  For those post-transition, did you find your inner voice naturally changed with time?  Perhaps for some of you, your inner monologue has always been appropriately gendered?  "
jade087,asktransgender,I'm a genderqueer person getting SRS with Dr Chettawut in less than three weeks. EEK!! AMA &lt;3,"As the title says, I'm seeing Dr Chettawut for surgery on the 27th of December. I am nervous and terrified and excited and anxious and tired. I would not be here without the support of /r/asktransgender, /r/transgenderau and /r/genderqueer and many of you &lt;3

A bit about me:

I identify as genderqueer non-binary feminine, 31 yo, and have been on estrogen for 3.5 years. I have a bit of anxiety and depression, which transition helped me to identify separately, but my anxiety has helped me learn about ALL the things that could go wrong. Thanks, brain. So, I'm nervous as hell.

I live in New Zealand, we have ZERO surgeons (private or public) thus the trip to Thailand. So far I've spent about $19k NZD (about $14k USD). Last remaining big cost is accommodation. I could have done it all a bit cheaper.

My key reasons for getting surgery now are:

1. I have the funds and a great work place and a great home and recovery space and support network
2. I have a supportive partner who wants to come help me recover &lt;3
3. I want to be able to reduce how many HRT medications I'm taking - currently Lucrin, oestradiol valerate and micronised progesterone
4. I want sex to stop being such a mental fight with myself (it sometimes ends in tears)
5. Testosterone does NOT agree with me; estrogen most definitely does
6. Who knows, this might help with my long-term anxiety/depression
7. And it might help push my feminisation a bit over this plateau.

I can tolerate the bits I have now... but I would not be sad if they suddenly disappeared. And rather than getting just an orchi, I'd rather have something to enjoy. I'm not looking forward to the pain and recovery (and the dilation omg), and if I look 12-24 months into the future I think I will be happy with this decision :)

Ask me anything; happy to share. (This is a secondary account :p)"
NuclearNecrosis,asktransgender,Coming Out Help,"So I have been ruminating about my gender identity and all of the feelings that come with it. I have been seriously thinking about it for over a year now. I felt pretty confident with my thoughts and feelings. I am not completely certain about everything, but I'm not planning on rushing into anything anyway. 

To get to my point though. I recently came out to my parents and things really didn't go well. My dad said that everyone dislikes how they look and that's normal, but most people don't go out and get surgeries/take hormones to change how they look. They just have to come to terms with it. I mean I see where he is coming from and all. At the time I was too nervous to have the verbiage to even remotely explain anything to him, so the conversation lead nowhere. 

Ever since I came out to my parents we haven't spoken about it and I know that if I even try that it will just be a repeat of the first conversation. I feel like I am trapped in limbo and have no reasonable course of action. "
Princess_Catherine,asktransgender,At wit's end,"Trigger, I guess, if you don't like thinking about reality, don't read.

Hello. I haven't posted on here for a while because I don't necessarily feel comfortable in the trans community, and frankly I'd rather not be a part of it. I would rather live life separate from being trans. I don't think that is wrong, and I don't judge anyone for wanting to be in the community. That said, I don't know where else to turn right now, and I'd like to hear some people's opinions and experiences.

Long story short, I came out when I was 16 (2.5 years ago). Bad response, lots of yelling and arguments. Now I'm constantly depressed, high amounts of shame, self-hate. A big focus my mom made sure to tell me was that transgender people are freaks, in the sense that I was born XY, I've lived/wasted 18 years of my life as a boy, I have masculine tendencies (in her eyes, but I still agree somewhat), etc. etc.

Now I believe that there is no way I will ever truly be a girl due to my voice, facial features, genitalia, internal (chromosomes and whatever else). Sure, I can work my ass off to try and achieve mediocre results, but it'll never be cis-level of normal. It'll always be slightly off, or even completely off.

I really want to kill myself. No point in living an existence as a freak, or lesser than a real girl. That's my opinion. It's like the saying, ""Shoot for the moon, even if you fail you'll be amongst the stars."" I don't want to be almost a girl, or physically passing as a girl. I want to be a girl, but that's impossible. So I'd like to give up finally, as I'm always too scared/tired/whatever to kill myself.

I've looked at this from every angle, and nothing can convince that I'm anything other than a freak. I don't even say all of this out of depression, just my thoughts. I just wonder if I'm missing some point that can make everything better, although I know that actually doesn't exist. This is a last ditch, so share what you know, I'd like to hear it.

TL;DR: Would like to kill myself because I'll never actually be a girl, no point in living if I'll just me a mishap of a person."

What can I do?
I heard about bicalutamide that can help to mantain the libido.
I also think that spiro is not a safe medicine. Why is it the standard?

Let me know what you think about it"
Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,Do you feel now that you are a totally different person than you were prior to transitioning?,"In 2 weeks, it will have been 18 months since I started taking HRT.  There have been some superficial changes.  [Strangers went from calling me sir to calling me miss](http://imgur.com/a/z8LRB).  I have a whole new set of identification now (with the exception of my birth certificate), reflecting my corrected name and gender.

There have been some slight mental changes.  I started actually liking how I look when I look in the mirror, where before I transitioned, I looked in the mirror and said ""Well, it is what it is"" and sighed.  I became somewhat calmer and more outgoing, and my anxiety has been reduced somewhat.  Before, I didn't like the idea of getting SRS, and now I think it would probably be pretty nice, but I'd better think about it for a couple years to be sure.  My libido has dropped, probably by half or so, and orgasms are now less enjoyable because they're significantly less intense, so there's significantly less reward at the end.

But I'm still the same person.  People say that I look totally unrecognizable now; old neighbors who I knew prior to transitioning ask me if I'm my aunt (because they know I didn't have a sister), and ask me how [my old boyname] is doing, and if I've heard from him, which baffles me.  I want to wave at them and say ""That's me! I'm right here! Look! Same brain, see?"".  The things that happened to me during the first 32 years of my life happened to *me*, they didn't happen to another person.  I have spreadsheets on my computer that I started working on 2 years ago or more, and they weren't created by a different person.  I still think about pretty much the same things, in pretty much the same ways, and my core identity is probably 95% the same.  I look at old pictures of myself, and I say ""yep, that's me, when I looked more mannish and hairy and fatter than I do now"", rather than saying that that's an entirely different person.

I've heard of other people thinking otherwise; they now consider themselves to be entirely different people, and don't recognize themselves from pre-transition.  I think it must be the case that they had much more gender dysphoria than I did, and so the only way that they were able to cope with this was to construct a false identity in which they were a typical (or even extreme) version of the gender they were assigned at birth.  If they were AMAB, maybe they constructed a very masculine false identity in order to cope.  I kinda just went from being a vaguely masculine nerd to being a vaguely feminine nerd, so maybe for me, there was less of a change in my core identity.  I don't know.  How was your experience in this regard?"

starshipsolar16,asktransgender,Is it possible to have a feminine athletic body while being trans?,"MtF. Basically, i've neglected my body for most of my life so i ended up very skinny, and ever since the start of my transition i decided that i wanted to take care of my body, eat healthly and exercise in some way.
I want to have a more athletic body but in a lean/toned way, not in a bulky way. Ever since starting HRT i've lost a lot of strenght and stamina, i didn't have much before but now i can barely walk a few blocks without leg pain. 

My shoulders are a bit wide but not too much, and my hands are somewhat masculine too. That combined with my very skinny arms make these things appear so much more and that bothers me. I want to even things out i guess.

So i wanted to know from other's experience if it's possible to develop a more athletic body while keeping away from a masculine figure. It's honestly one of my big goals so i'm willing to put the effort to get there if it's possible. If it is, where do i start? I know that cardio is a good overall thing but what else should be done?

blue_sword456,asktransgender,A ton of questions about MtF transition,"okay, so ill just kinda organize these by the category of questions.

also, ill intro myself again: im emerald, im 17, im a senior in high school, and im pre-everything

**Passing and Clothes**

 * 1) which method of hair removal is generally considered the best? mostly for facial hair. 

 * 2) whats the easiest way to tuck comfortably?

 * 3) ive got mild acne, will hormones help with that, or should it go away on its own after a while?

 * 4) do i need to worry about shoe size as far as passing goes? 

**surgeries and all that**

 * 5) can i donate both of my testicles for organ donation? or will they only allow one? if they do, would being classified as transgender let me donate both? 

 * 6) is my only option an orchiectomy to remove my testicles?

 * 7) is voice surgery worth it?

 * 8)  if i do get my testicles removed, how would that affect my bottom surgery?

 * 9)  when will i know to get FFS while im on hormones?

**Hormones and stuff**

 * 10) as a 17 year old, should i start on hormones now? 

 * 11) should i wait until puberty is officially over for me?

 * 12) if i do start on hormones, it would most likely only be blockers, and i know that i can only be on those for so long before the lack  of sex hormones starts to negatively affect me, how long is this?

 * 13) if i do start on full hormones, blockers and estrogen (or whatever its going to be called), how would it affect my still-pubescent body? will it just be normal, or will it be different?

 * 14) if i dont get hormones, and im only on blockers, what foods can i eat that will provide an estrogen substitute?

**other questions i have**

 * 15) ill be starting college soon, and most likely will be transitioning during then, do i need to tell anyone in the faculty that i plan to either start, or transition during college?

 * /s) if i eat the hearts of my enemies, will i gain their courage? 

if anymore questions pop into my head, ill put them down in the post.

All that energy that I am waisting, staring at those beautiful women, reflecting back to me the fact that my body decided to be born a fluke. Loathing on the soundwave produced by my vocal chords when I try to speak. Passing in front of the mirror, and realizing that my reflection is hard to stand.

I want to be beautiful. I want to stare at my girlfriend's eyes and see that ""Finally. She's alive."". I want to be able to buy that pretty dress for summer and maybe throw a bikini and enjoy the beach for the week-end. I want to be able to cry for a movie. Not that I never did, but it requires a cultural piece of genius to make me flinch. I want to be tiny, and vulnerable. And yet be able to shine as myself and enjoy the time I have on this planet. ""She's so cute when she smiles"". Thanks for recently updating my software and making me want to be a mother, knowing that I never truly will. I'm starting to suspect that this is all a big joke, and you will soon wake me up as the blonde girl I dreamt I was when I was eight. Instead of being this little guy that spent 24 years trying to figure out why life is so weird, and why people don't seem to care. I want to bloom, I want to live, I want so much.

and yet it doesn't stop there. Because as you know, sometimes i'm fine. Right? Sometimes I'm going for a run, Dre and Snoop in my ears, and you feel like ""let's release the mighty testosterone"". Gotta surprise the muscle right? That way it never adapts.

I love you, but fuck you.

anonymouswriter508,asktransgender,Tips/Advice on Writing a Trans Character,"Hello! I'm currently writing a fictional story with a plot surrounding multiple superheroes and the different adventures they go on together trying to save the world. I'd like to make the book as diverse as possible since I have noticed quality representation in the superhero world to be extraordinarily lacking, and so I'd like to take some of the characters that I've already created and make them trans in order to allow people within that community to see themselves within these heroes.

However, due to the nature of the story, the characters being trans does not really affect the plot one way or another, so I'm wondering if you could help me out with revealing that they are trans so that the representation is noted but in a way that doesn't make it seem like the narrator is stereotyping or that the story is offensive. 

I'd really like to make this as positive as an experience as possible for both the trans characters and potential trans readers, so if any of you could provide me with some feedback, that would be great! Also, if any of you are open to me bouncing a few other questions I have about accurate representation off of you, let me know, as all the advice I can get about correctly handling this would be greatly appreciated!!"

She leaves her shadows on this reality,

shifting fractal form of beauty

reality fraying at her edges

eyes speaking of cosmic secrets

Beauty made elemental

Sloughing off the language of flesh

of human features

breaking off into geometric ideals

into realms beyond reckoning

beyond mortal knowledge 

into the shadowy realms

of wonder and mystery and intrigue

Tracing her ineffable essence

leaving her scent on reality’s pages

leaving shadows of herself in the corners of your vision

in a direction that cannot be pointed to

woven through time and space

weft to warp

from cleopatra to helen

you were all these

a thousand cycles of death and rebirth in your eyes

fiction suit for a thousand enigmas

Unanswerable riddles

that cannot be spoken of in words

but only the higher language of soul and mind

The answer is there, in her eyes,

but you can never look deep enough to truly know it

Only feel it with your soul and substance"
RsDenieru,asktransgender,Unsure about my gender identity. Looking for advice.,"WARNING: This post is fairly long, so here’s a premature TL;DR:
I’ve been questioning whether or not I’m transgender lately.
I don’t have any major childhood experiences or, apparent, gender dysphoria, though I am not entirely sure what this includes. I’m hoping you can help me come to a conclusion on whether or not this is a thing.

Hello Reddit and subscribers of /r/asktransgender! 

I’m a 20 year old AMAB.
Roughly a month ago, I read a book about a transgender girl and her teenage life (fiction). Once finished, I thought back on the events of the book and felt, what quite literally felt like, a mental “click”, and realized that I might be transgendered. 

A few days later, I talked to one of my friends about my realization. I had been quite depressed over my realization, and had a minor mental breakdown in front of them, once I told them. 
At the time of “coming out” (with the possible thought of being transgender) to my friend, I was about 90% sure that I was transgender, but these past few weeks, having had some time to think, I’m not that sure anymore. 
I’ve spent a lot of time since “the click” watching documentaries and reading about other people’s experience of their realization, and while I know that no two stories are alike, I don’t feel like I fit the form. This has caused med some confusion, and I am hoping that some of you might be able to help me clarify some things:

- What is the actual definition of gender dysphoria?
To some people it seems like an actual dissatisfaction with their reproductive parts, while for some it’s not dissatisfaction, but more of a desire for the opposite gender characteristics. 
- Is it possible that it is just a phase?
It’s only “recently” (the past 3-4 years or so), that I’ve started exhibiting more female traits, in terms of my social life and acting in general, which makes me doubt whether or not this is a permanent thing. 
That being said, I do like exhibiting feminine traits, and it feels right to me. 
I generally feel more comfortable around females than males, and not just due to romantic attraction, but because I feel like I relate more to the female than the male mentality. 

The reason I’m asking here instead of speaking to a gender therapist, is, that as far as I can tell, there’s only one in my country (DK). It’s a really far ride to go there, and not really economically feasible at the moment. 

Doubt is a huge part of my life right now, because while I don’t feel like I fit the form, “the click” was still a very powerful experience, that I won’t be forgetting anytime soon, and it just felt “right”. 
I guess what I’m really trying to say, is that I really would like some outside input on my situation, from someone who have been in the same, or a similar situation to mine, or heck, just if you know anything about this whole transgender hullabaloo. I don’t want to make any rash decisions.

Are these transgendered traits, or maybe something different?

Summersisle,asktransgender,[mtf] Facial Hair Removal pre-hrt,"I am pre-hrt but will be starting very soon (mid January hopefully waiting on Endo) I figured I would have to wait to start Facial Hair Removal until after I started HRT. Doing some reading online shows that I may be wrong and should be starting Facial Hair Removal (Laser, Electrolysis) ASAP. Has anyone had Hair Removal after HRT? How was it? Should I postpone starting HRT until I can start Hair Removal?"
Scared_human,asktransgender,"Frankly, I'm pissed off. Of all my possible outcomes, I had to be transgender. I feel cheated of a happy existence. Anyone feel this way?","I was born male. Male everything. I lived a testosterone-blasted existence. Until some quantum quirk inserted a thought that would fuck up my whole life, whatever would remain of it. Something planted a small thought- innocent, really- ""You want to be a girl. You want to be more than a blank face. You want to become amazing. A woman."" Cue adrenaline rush. Cue dysphoria that never existed before. Cue the siren's call. I started to remember my childhood. Signs and pointers. I told myself I was making it up. Then, I told myself I was ignoring my feelings. And then, I told myself I was just depressed. 

The next day, I felt a constant internal screaming. It would come and go, but always stronger than before. I couldn't ignore it. It excited me and made me scared. Reddit told me I could be trans. I'm trans? I thought I was  normal... 

Weeks of this went by. I couldn't think of anything but ""am I trans?"" 

Cue acceptance. I'm definitely transgender. Oh, fuck. Fuckfuckfuckity fuck. My life is screwed. I cant live as a male. I have to be seen as a freak and I won't ever even accept myself. 

I am a girl. In a boy suit. Fuck this noise. Why me?

Questioning2345,asktransgender,Sperm/egg banking?,"Does anyone know anything about how to sperm bank? I'm thinking about making an HRT appointment soon, and I have no idea if I'll want biological kids in the future so this seems like a good idea. As far as I can tell there's only one sperm bank in my city but it's super expensive (around $500 to deposit and then $300/year). I've heard there are online options too, though. Does anyone know about those?"
PanTran420,asktransgender,A couple of waxing and hair removal questions...,"I had my first wax appointment last week on my back and shoulders and I'm already getting some regrowth. Understandably, I'm kinda disappointed. I mean, the rash had hardly faded before I started getting a bit of regrowth, kinda defeats the purpose of having a smooth, hairless back if it's covered in red splotches.

So questions:

* How long does a wax session last for you generally speaking?
* Is there anything I can do to help it last longer either prior to waxing or after waxing?
* Does it get more effective after the first time through?
* I'm going to be getting an epilator at some point, how easy are they to use on your back? I can shave my back with my electric razor, but it takes me a long time and is a PITA. Is using an epilator a similar motion, i.e. will I have similar difficulties with an epilator as I have with my electric razor?

I really hope HRT knocks out the hair on my back. Everywhere else I can manage, the back is just such a pain."

TrueHOAS,asktransgender,Can't start my real life,"I am 16 years old, live in Germany and I have to do a real life experience for a year in order ro get hormones. I probably won't be able to start this at christmas as planned. My voice is nothing near passable right now and my speech therapist said that it would take 4-5 more months until my voice is ok. I really feel bad not just because I probably get the hormones even later but I can't live as a girl. It really destroys me on the inside right now, I don't know what to do. Nobody cares about this, I told this my parents and my gender therapist and they don't give a shit. My grades are pretty bad but everyone seems to ignore my problems."
[deleted],asktransgender,I really like this girl but things in the bedroom are complicated,"I started dating a girl a few months ago who after a few dates told me she was transgender. She's very attractive and we were really hitting it off, so it wasn't an issue for me at all and things are going well. 

She is pre-op and will be having srs in a little over a year. She experiences dysphoria and said she doesn't feel comfortable getting fully undressed, which means our sex life is solely me receiving oral. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy it but I find it very frustrating. Not only do I miss having sex with the person I'm with, but a big part of my enjoyment of sex has always been giving pleasure too. 

I've been reading this sub to inform how best to approach any issues related to her transition, and I asked what she was into etc.. She started blushing and said she was embarrassed but she told me that she loves anal and has had it in previous relationships but that because she now knows she's going to have srs, she doesn't feel comfortable with me seeing her fully undressed. I think this is heightened because all her previous partners identified as bisexual. The thing is, I don't care. I see her as the woman she is and find her gorgeous and would love to sleep with her.

I don't know anybody to speak to who might have had a similar experience, so I thought I'd post here. Have any of you had relationships where being fully undressed is off the cards and if so, how did you have a fulfilling sex life and did it impact the relationship? And do you have any advice for me?

Thank you in advance, and I hope this isn't an inappropriate post.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who responded. Some of the answers have definitely helped me understand things from her perspective a little better, and some of them have useful practical ideas for how we could have a fuller sex life without her being uncomfortable.

As a side note, I'd just like to say that the posters on this sub are amazing. As somebody who'd never spent much time thinking about trans issues, reading posts on /r/asktransgender has really helped me in how I approach things with the girl I'm seeing. Also, I can see how difficult transitioning can be for some people and the amount of mutual support on this sub is heartening to see. Thanks!"
BrownSwitch,asktransgender,I accept that I am a girl but is it worth it to transition?,"I now have come to accept that I am, in my mind at least, a girl.

I do believe I would be more myself, more confident and better suited as a girl.

Although I feel like it would be hard to transition. 

My Fiancée wants to support me, she is Bisexual so our relationship (as she puts it) can continue. 

She also says I would make a good girl in her opinion.

The issue for me is that I would like to be who I feel I am.

But do I really want to transition to become such? 

It's really difficult trying to decide whether or not it is worth it.

I am anxious about talking about it to anyone, it will be very difficult coming out to people if I decide to and therefore it becomes a question of whether it is worth it.

It will be stressful and embarrassing to me, I worry I won't pass or that I may have an awkward in-between stage where I don't really look like either gender or that I may look like a feminine boy. 

Do you guys believe it is worth it to transition? 

Don't get me wrong, I would feel more comfortable and I do believe I would more than likely be more confident which could be good as my anxiety stops me from being myself a lot.

I get quite depressed over the fact I am not who I feel I am quite often and possess a desire to commit suicide due to this issue. 
But I have got through my teenage years ignoring this issue although I am not sure how long I can continue. 

Any advice on how I should proceed or any experiences you have with transitioning, I'd love to know. :) 

Details about myself is that I am 19, I have always had gender dysphoria for as long as I remember but it has become stronger in recent years. 

More details is that if I was to transition I would have genital surgery eventually.

TLDR: I want to be a girl, I don't know if I should transition though due to anxiety, stress and embarrassment.

Thank you for reading, have a nice day!

Hello, I've been on MtF HRT since 2011 and, due to certain political climate fears, I opted to join a wave of people hiding via detransitioning, ie stopping hormones and other masculinizing things. I've had an orchiectomy already so my body produces only as much T as natal females. Over the last few weeks, approximately 4 weeks after I stopped, I've essentially been in eternal menopause. Hot flashes, weakness, dizziness, etc. Mostly hot flashes. For hours and hours of of the day. I've been suffering this same thing since it started and it seems like it's just getting worse over time. I can't sleep, I have to hide in my room because I need to keep doing between a blanket and nothing...

Is there relief? Will my menopause symptoms stop in a few weeks or will it take months or years? Should I go back on HRT? Will taking finasteride relieve any symptoms? (I haven't taken any in over a year, I just took one tonight from a recent trial re- prescription, originally to assist head hair growth) Will estrogen-only birth control save me while I acquire a new E prescription?

TBH being in menopause-land is more likely to expose me as trans in public I think, and I should probably go back on HRT, but I'm scared. I'm transitioning genderqueer and dress mostly punk so pretty androgynous but I still face lots of gender based threats. IDK what to do. 

Help?"

spottybutterfly,asktransgender,Ex boyfriend transgendered,"My ex boyfriend from 2 years ago told me yesterday he has gender dysphoria and wants to start living as a woman, he is telling everyone where we work as he, ""can't walk in to work one day out the blue with long hair and be like, hi I'm a girl now"".

I just listened and asked if he was having a operation. I don't really feel like it's Amy of my business. But I do thing looking back I should have asked some important questions like is he changing his name (it's a very male name) and if he now wants to be referred to as she (well once he's told everyone in work).

On a more personal point of view I feel like our relationship was a lie.  Not once did he mention any of this.  Yesterday he said there was questions when he was born regarding gender (he never told me this when we were dating).

I feel like you don't just wake up one day and think, I'm a girl now. And he asked me to marry him when we were together, I just don't get how you can lie that much to someone you love.

He asked me before we were ""official"" if there was anything he should know meaning anything that could affect the relationship and I told him how I'm bisexual (trusting him not to blab around work as I hadn't told anyone at work then, now I'm half in half out). To me even if he couldn't tell me then, by the time we were in love (and what I thought was very comfortable with each Other) I feel he should have mentioned something, even if it was just the issued regarding his birth."

ray2rey,asktransgender,"MTF, may be starting HRT soon, but a few thoughts and feelings are making me unable to commit fully","First post, and it’s really long because I’ve been stalking this subreddit for a long time before making an account. I may be starting HRT soon, but I have some feelings that are so conflicting that I want to see if others have gone through the same thought process.

I may be transgender woman, but I’m not sure. I was assigned male at birth. I live in the US. I’ve been somewhat subconscious seeing that trans-ness in myself maybe three years ago when I started to crossdress when sleeping or in private and didn’t really know why. I don’t think I’m simply a crossdresser because of how I feel about my body, though I certainly love women’s clothing. In late 2014, I started to consider the concept of being transgender and by early 2015, I started to talk about it with therapists/friends. I’ve been really stuck since then, going back and forth between exploring it and trying to let it go.

Anyhow, somehow I found myself letting my therapist make a hormone evaluation appointment this Friday. It freaks me out because it feels like the first concrete step toward actually transitioning, but I’m still so torn, and it kind of boils down to some of these things I can’t negotiate with this decision:

--Dating--

I feel like my lack of success in dating is so tied somehow to how I feel about gender. It feels like the reason why I’m even thinking about being a transgender woman is because I’m frustrated with my dating (zero long term relationships) and sex life (I’m a virgin) as a 26 year old cisgender man. It feels especially like this because of how I feel when I interact with women whom I may have a shot at romantically. If I get a text from a crush, I instantly revert to man mode and feel like it’s totally weird that I even thought I was trans.

I know my gender identity has nothing to do with whom I’m attracted to, but when I am interacting with a romantic prospect (a woman), I want to be a cisgender man. But it can be really confusing because sometimes I will see my behavior change when there is an attractive woman near me, but after I’m out of sight, I start to feel really jealous of them instead of wanting to attract them.

On some level, it’s like I have failed in 26 years to be with a woman or sleep with a woman that I just would rather be a woman now. That way I can have 24/7 access to a woman’s body. It would also justify why I’m such a loser in the dating/sex world because of course the reason why I’m a virgin is because I’m trans, duh, not because I’m a total loser. But I realize that is a valid point too. Perhaps the reason why I have failed in the dating/sex world is because I’m transgender and I’m uncomfortable with male gender norms and uncomfortable with my body, etc. It’s just a very confusing thing.

So here’s the thing. I feel like if I started HRT, I would feel SO silly and foolish if all of a sudden, a romantic prospect expressed interest in me. I feel like I’d drop everything and try everything I could to make that work out. If I was in a good relationship with a woman, I feel like I probably wouldn’t question my gender.

--Family--

While my family is very supportive of me and I have no doubt they will support me through this, I just can’t imagine being anything other than a son and a brother. I feel like I’m ruining the family dynamics, it’s less about what they would do to me and more about what I would do to them. As far as extended family goes, I’d probably lose those connections because I’m not very close with them.

But my future family is more important, in a way. Even though I’ve had zero success in relationships, I still have hope that I will eventually find the right woman and marry her and have biological children. It would make me really proud to further the family line and to provide my parents with grandkids. While my family puts no pressure on me in terms of having a traditional family, I have put that pressure on myself, and it’s especially hard to avoid as I am the only male child of my family (it’s just a cultural pressure of my Asian heritage).

It pains me so much that one of the first things HRT does is decrease my reproductive function. Yes, I know I can bank sperm and there are alternative methods, but it just doesn’t feel good to me. My family is just so important to me, and I find it silly that I’m even considering ruining that just so I can have the body of a woman for sexual gratification.

--Sex--

It feels like my primary motivations for transitioning is due to sex. I know I am totally romanticizing what it means to be a woman, but it just feels like my reasons for wanting to transition is not valid. I’m a virgin, but I just imagine having sex as a woman to be so much more pleasurable. Maybe I’m too influenced by Hollywood/porn, but I just feel that I want to take the role of a woman in sex and am turned on by having a woman’s body/being penetrated/etc.

I’m aware that if I transition, it doesn’t mean that I’m just going to be having sex all the time. In fact, I doubt that I will be having much sex at all because I have never had sex as a cisgender person and that struggle with be that much harder if I’m trans. Yet I feel like even in a non-sexual context, I can connect wanting to be a woman to sex. I’m a runner, and in the context of running, I would absolutely love to be a woman because of the way women move when they run, cute running clothes, and ponytails. Or even if I’m cooking or getting groceries, I would rather be a woman, but even that has some sexual energy around it. It seems to be all the superficial reasons for why I’d want to transition.

It’s nothing to do with gender, but I have some really strong feelings about being sexually submissive, which also makes me feel bad about wanting to be a woman. Sometimes, it feels like if I want to be a woman and I want to be sexually submissive, then that is very misogynistic of me. I will say that if I HAD to be a man, I’d probably still prefer to be sexually submissive, and if I HAD to be dominant, I’d probably still prefer to be a woman. It’s just that I really want that sweet spot of being a sexually submissive woman.

The other thing is that I get triggered the most by women I find attractive. Especially pretty white woman (also dealing with a ton of internalized racism). If I was really transgender, I’d probably want to be any woman, but it seems the strongest when I see attractive women that I will never be.

--Costs &amp; barriers--

I think I’m in a rather good position to transition, but there is obviously a ton of worry in terms of costs (financial, social, emotional, etc.) to consider. First, I have a full-time job as well as a side gig. The job gives me an average salary and some benefits, and starting next year, I’ll be an 11-month employee, which could give me some time to make a big change during that month off. I have a lot of worries about being able to do my job while transitioning as my job requires a lot of interaction with people and requires me to be a credible speaker. I’m more worried about my side gig—the long term goal is to eventually slip into a full-time role with that company. However, this position really requires me to be an effective speaker, and I feel very pessimistic about my ability to do that while I am transitioning. It also requires a ton of travel, so it would be very difficult to manage that while transitioning.

I’m terrified about my finances, though it’s possible that my parents may be able to help out somewhat. I’m terrified about health insurance and all the costs associated with transition. I’m terrified of my ability to be a social being. I know that my closest friends will support me no matter what, but I’ve always been so sensitive to how strangers treat me. I just hate the fact that I’d no longer be seen as an individual. I’d just be that Asian trans girl.

The last thing I should be concerned about is my running performance, but admittedly, it’s a big concern. I’ve been trying to and have come very close to running a sub 3 hour marathon, and I know hormones will wreck my chances. I’m so close to doing it, but I just get sad when I think about my dip in performance in this time next year for my next sub-3 attempt. However, it also pains me to think about this time next year and not having made any progress in resolving this. I also imagine international travel is much more complicated with transition.

I can’t even get a handle on my current life as is. I have no idea how I’m going to manage all of the appointments for all the procedures and all the legal changes. It’s just too overwhelming.

--Gut feeling--

I don’t connect with the thought of “I’ve always been a girl/woman” or “I’m a woman inside.” What it feels like is I’m a cisgender man. I’m just a cisgender man who is frustrated with his life and likes to sabotage his own life when things get hard. When dating gets hard, then I drift into having fantasies as a woman. But I guess if someone said that I had the choice to be born as a cisgender man or a cisgender woman, I’d likely choose cisgender woman. It sometimes feels less like dysphoria with my male body but rather a stronger euphoria with having a female body instead.

I’m afraid that I could transition for the wrong reasons and destroy my life, yet still to address what’s really wrong with me.

Anyway, I have a hormone evaluation appointment with my therapist on Friday, and I feel like I allowed myself to make this decision when I don’t even know if I’m transgender. I just hate the idea of ruining my life if I’m wrong about this, yet I’m thinking about this pretty much all day, every day. I just don’t know what to do. I'd appreciate any insight on any of this."
Notarealperson_,asktransgender,How to handle these doubts?,"Every day I have these doubts in the back of my head like ""You're just obsessed"" and ""you're just telling yourself you're trans"" and ""you don't actually feel dysphoria"" and ""you're just a creep and a pervert"" and ""this is wrong and unnatural"" and ""you'll never be a real girl"" and ""You could never transition"". Things like that. And I know that I do feel dysphoria and that I would be happier as a girl. I know that right now. But sometimes thoughts like that really get to me and I don't know what to think. There are times where I'm ready to try new things and I'm excited to do things and close friends using different pronouns makes me happy but then there are other times where I just wish I never thought about being trans and that I don't want to go through with anything and people calling me anything else just makes me depressed. And I don't know how to handle this or be more sure of myself all the time. It's driving me nuts. I'm sorry if I sound stupid or something. I feel embarrassed for having to post this. Thanks anyway."
Ajatarr,asktransgender,"Can't live without transitioning, not allowed to transition.","So i had my first appointment today. It went about as i expected up until the point where the doctor told me that i wont be allowed to transition til i have sorted out my BDD and social anxiety. He think its related to my gender and how i dont feel right in my own skin, so i dont know why he would postpone any real transition. 

This is basically a death sentance for me. I have struggled with that for over 3 years now with little to no progress. Which basically mean it could take over 3 years to BEGIN transitioning. Maybe even more. 

Now i wont have another meeting in like 5 months. I can't handle this. I can't live like this anymore. It was easier when i could cling on to the hope that i would be able to transition in about a year. But now im not sure if i ever will be able to.

Conflicted123456,asktransgender,Bodyswitching Showerthought,"I thought a lighthearted question/discussion around here would be nice given how tense and serious things normally are around here.


Anyway, i'm sure most of us around here have thought/dreamed about the whole bodyswitching thing as a simple solution to everything.


Given the whole chest voice/head voice thing between males and females, AMAB and AFAB were to switch bodies, how would talking work?  Would the AMAB default to using a chest voice in the female body, using muscles that were previously rarely used resulting in a lot of strain and probably not being able to talk much in general?  Same goes for AFAB using more of a head voice in a female body.


As a result, even with a body switch, would months or even years of voice training be required to ""pass"" anyway?


As a bonus little extra thought, what about accents?  Perhaps more of an issue here in the UK but given that there are so many different accents in the country, no two people have exactly the same one, its often a bit of sliding scale of how strong an accent is but pronunciation can also vary a lot.  As a result, you would probably end up sounding incredibly weird to anyone who knew the previous body inhabitant.

Vipassana1,asktransgender,Reminder: The top of r/askreddit right now is some toxic nonsense,"This comes up occasionally, and then a thread like this is created.  I really needed to type this one out because today's thread is so bad I just unsubscribed from that subreddit.

For those of you that have seen the ""What's sex like with a post-op trans person"" thread:  It's bullshit, and I hope you won't let it color your perspective of yourself.

Trans women:  You are not a man.  
Trans men:  You are not a woman.

You don't owe it to anyone to disclose your past until you feel comfortable.  You do not need to own someone else's discomfort with your past.  If you have sex with someone, they're having sex with the person you are RIGHT NOW.  There are discussions to be had about disclosure and safety, for sure.   But their discussions are toxic, uninformed bullshit.

For women that are interested in SRS, there are many, many threads from actual trans girls that tell you what it's like.  Most of the trans girls I've spoken with, read about say that there's no difference for them between theirs and a cis girl's. I'm going to take their word for it over some dude that may have had sex with a trans girl once.  Don't let talk of dry vaginas and surgical scars scare you away from something you want.  It's anecdotal and everyone's unique.

There are comments with 200, 400, more upvotes about how men are not straight if they have sex with a trans girl.  It's more bullshit from people that don't understand, and don't want to understand, what they're talking about.  If they can't get past your chromosomal makeup, that's on them.  It's your body, your mind, your choice.  They're having sex with the person in front of them, and your past is for you alone until you choose to share it.  You don't owe anybody anything.  

Reddit's always had this uninformed/ignorant/arrogant streak and it seems to have gotten much larger in the last year.  I won't stand to be invalidated, and you shouldn't either.  Remember that you deserve better than that."

throwaway91743,asktransgender,"How to figure myself out, and broach the subject of my questioning to my girlfriend?","I'm 32yo AMAB, and I've been seriously questioning my gender identity for the past six months.

This might be a bit incoherent and disorganized as this is the first time I've actually tried writing down all the things I've been thinking.

For my whole life I've been socially awkward, and just having a feeling of ""not belonging"", that now I've realized might be a form of dysphoria.

Other things I know realize are dysphoric, are that I hate my low masculine voice, I've never liked how my face looks, I hate my very high hairline and widow's peaks, big (and a bit crooked) nose, pointy chin and of course beard, which is very coarse and I'm unable to shave without leaving a shadow, so I just let it grow and not look any mirrors. The only thing I kinda like about my face, is my eye color (grayish green).

Otherwise my body is somewhat feminine, as I have a nice round ass and my hips are a bit wider than my waist, but I have kinda wide shoulders and big hands and feet, and of course flat chest.

I've have never thought or fantasized having a more masculine body, but instead I've wondered what it would be like to have a female body since early teens, and lately more detailed fantasies of having breasts and a vagina, but sexually I'm feeling very conflicted, as I really would like to know what it would feel to have sex as a woman, but I also do like having sex as a man, and I'm also into all sorts of kinkier stuff (bondage, etc.).

I have very dull wardrobe, and I'm feeling somewhat envious of women having more options for clothing. I've tried crossdressing a few times at home, using my girlfriends skirts and shirts, and I really liked how I looked from neck down, but was hit with severe anxiety as soon as I saw my face.

Two years ago I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety after I had a few panic attacks in very stressful situations. I went to a cognitive psychotherapist for a year, and made progress related to the anxiety, but during the time I had not yet realized my gender identity issue, so we never talked about that, although we tried to find possible causes for my feeling of not belonging.

I have a 38yo girlfriend, we've been together a bit over two years, and lived together a bit under two. She identifies as gender queer, has had her breast size reduced significantly, and usually wears mens clothing. I'm quite sure she would be okay about me being transgender, as she has a few transgender friends and has been supportive to them.

She also has probably ADHD (currently being diagnosed), and is not the easiest person to have a real deep conversation, as she constantly interrupts, and is very easily offended, even from constructive criticism (childhood trauma because of her mother, she is seeing a therapist for that), and because of that I've been quite reserved around her, because I don't want to make her feel bad. I'm also always been very bad at expressing my feelings verbally due to my anxiety, so I'm at a complete loss how I could bring the whole thing up and have a meaningful conversation with her, and figure things out together."

pradlee,asktransgender,Should I change gender marker on health insurance?,"**tl;dr: Should I tell my health insurance company that I changed my legal gender? I'm afraid I'll be denied coverage for sex-specific care.**

I recently changed my legal gender (to M at both the national and state levels), and am in the process of updating my health insurance. But I am not sure if I should tell the company (BlueCross BlueShield) about the gender change.

I see two options here:

- I could tell the insurance company about the gender marker change. Then I would be ""M"" in their database, which would be ideal. It would match my Social Security info and my photo ID. However, when I go for ""women's health"" care (hysterectomy, preventative breast cancer care) in the future, they will probably deny coverage for the claim. Legally, insurance companies aren't allowed to deny coverage based on legal gender, but that doesn't mean that they'll make it easy. The appeals process is a huge hassle I would rather avoid. But it might allow my T prescription to be covered by insurance (maybe billable as ""endocrine disorder""). I'm afraid that if I report the gender change and don't like how the insurance company is dealing with it, I won't be able to switch my account back to ""F"" because I am legally M (i.e. have no legal proof that I am F).
- I could *not* tell the insurance company about the gender change. Then I would be ""F"" in their database. Whenever I went to the doctor, I would just tell the doctor that I was F. This doesn't match my SS info or ID, but doctors don't check that stuff. This might make it easier to get coverage for a hysterectomy or preventative breast cancer care. It might make it harder to get T covered by insurance (I am currently paying out of pocket for trans-related health care; it's explicitly not covered by my plan).

So what should I do? Can a good doctor help with getting coverage, e.g. by billing care as unisex somehow? Is it even legal to not report a legal gender change?"

 I was finally able to get back on perrigo estradiol valerate about two weeks ago, and i had my first shot (.5ml of 40mg/ml) on the 20th. I felt like it actually worked for a lot longer than the EV I got from compounding pharmacies here, but I vaguely remembered feeling like it was gone by the 10th day when I was on it years ago and read stuff about EV only being in your system for 7-8 days, and i felt pretty crash-y i guess, so I thought I should try giving myself the next shot on day 10 to be safe.

I gave myself the injection, no problems other than this pulsing muscle twitch when I put the needle in, but.....I looked in the mirror today and a bunch of my hair fell out. I've thinned very noticeably on the top of my head and at the temples, and I can only barely hide it by pinning it a certain way. On top of that, my hair feels a little oily and so does my skin, I had two pimples, and I woke up to this feeling like I had morning....y'know. 

I'm really scared that this is going to make it more and more impossible for me to pass, and I can't go to my doctor for help, because after I told her about leaving an abusive marriage she acts like literally every hormone issue i've had for the last 6-7 months has been because ""oh gosh you've had a really hard time, maybe it's just anxiety?"" Like, I'm basically self-medding at this point.

The only other time anything like this happened was when I was on 2mg sublingual estrace (again, basically just self-medding) and my doc upped my dosage to 6mg. (I found out months after 2mg estrace was working for me that she wrote the scrip for 6mg and the pharmacy just misinterpreted it, so I asked 'hey *should* i be on 6mg, and she was just like fuck it whatever sure.)

So, I guess I'd really appreciate if anyone could answer.....

What could have caused this? Is this a sign of a testosterone spike or something else? I'm on 400mg spiro, but....
 
Will my hair regrow, or am I screwed?

Is there anything I can do? Should I lower my injection dosage (i'm about 20lbs lighter than when I was on EV years ago) or switch to weekly shots or something, or will that just make things worse somehow?"
mtf_or_not,asktransgender,I don't know if the signs of being trans was actually a sign or coincidences?,"I keep getting like flashbacks of my childhood, all with signs of me being trans. I don't know if they are just coincidences or if they where genuine signs or not.


Here is a few memories I have:

* I love crossdressing and putting on female outfits and makeup since I was 12 (this was more of a fetish though)
* I used to swap clothes with my cousin when I was younger (2 years younger) when I was 8/9/10
* Looking through childhood photos, I often did 'feminine' looks and act all girly
* I remember my older sister teaching my cousin to put on makeup, and I wanted to try it on too
* My sister used to dress me up like a girl, I pretended like I hated it but I secretly loved it
* I used to get jealous that girls could wear the female uniform to school (around 12/13)
* I tried doing my hair up all feminine when I was 14
* When I was 7/8 and playing at a park, and I sucked at climbing. A girl that was similar age to me said ""You should be able to climb that, your a boy""
* A teacher once said I am a ""nice boy"" when I was 6/7. Dunno why I just have memories of this.
* Daydreaming about swapping bodies with an attractive girl at school (not sure if this is related to me being trans or a fetish)
* Used to like having female friends, and preferred female friendships (my first friend when I was 3 was female)
* I wanted to wear a skirt to school (13/14) and used to get jealous because of it. I'm not sure if this is related to being MTF or a fetish.
* When I was 6 I was an angel for a Christmas nativity play. I was told to by the teacher. I actually loved wearing the angel wings, but I knew it isn't what a boy should be so I acted like I hated it.



Here is a few memories that I have, but the seem to be quite unrelated with being transgender. But it seems like it might be possible signs: (all these are before I realized I might be trans):

* I've always hated wearing button shirts, for as long as I can remember
* I like fairly plain clothes, and often unisex clothes. Pretty much all the clothes I wear are gender neutral.
* When I was 5/6, I remember telling my mum I hated my name. I don't know why I hated it, there was something about it.
* That ""share a coke with..."" thing a few years back, I used to prefer ones with female names (my name was never on them)
* I've always hated getting my haircut (I don't know if this was because I was trans, social anxiety, or both)
* I've often noticed what outfits women wear, the style, etc.



I don't know if these were me growing up or genuinely a sign of being transgender when I was younger. I never used to act feminine, as I knew that is not what was expected of me. I was fine with the puberty changes growing up, I loved it when my voice was getting deeper, as it was like I was becoming more manly. Now I dislike my deep voice.

MopMoppington,asktransgender,When did people start to say you looked like your target gender?,"Hello lovelies! I'm 25 MTF and five weeks into my HRT and I've honestly never felt better!

I'm exceedingly excited for the day that my face flips over to looking more female than male. I'm already starting to see something subtle happening when I look in the mirror and it makes me giggle with glee every time!

How long was it before the people in your life started saying you don't look like your birth sex any more and you  look like your target gender?"
Dcfan7738,asktransgender,How did you deal with being accidentally being outed?,"My brother came over to my house this evening to use my internet?  He found a couple of my pictures of me dressed up and saw my search history about transitioning.  I thought I was getting ready to come out but was waiting for the right opportunity and he wasn't the one I was going to say anything to first.

He didn't take it badly and said he wouldn't tell anyone.  On one hand I feel uncomfortable but on the other I feel relieved somewhat.

This has gotten me thinking, I wonder if my dad already has an idea and just hasn't said anything.  A couple of months ago, my dad got a new android phone just like mine.  I helped him get it setup and by mistake synced it to my account and he asked me the next day to fix it again because my account was on there and he said I need to take it off in case there was something I don't want him to see.  But there has been no change in how he acted towards me and if he knows anything he hasn't acted like it.

I guess the experience with my brother has gotten me a little paranoid.  I know I should have been more careful but hopefully this is a good thing in the end.  

Is it normal to feel numb after such an experience?  Throughout the day I was feeling dysphoric but now I don't feel anything."
biggestcup,asktransgender,How did you come out at work? How did it go?,"I'm out everywhere except at my job and I need to change that soon. 

I work in a retail setting with a company that scores well with the HRC, so the stakes aren't too high, I'm just not sure how to go about it. Or maybe I'm waffling, who knows. I came out to my lead manager and she was about as accepting as you can be. I thought about telling some other coworkers, but it's not a topic that fits into retail work easily. I present pretty andro at work already so I'm just considering shrugging and strapping on a bra and eyeliner and not saying anything unless people ask. It almost feels kind of rude or something to not let more people know up front though. That's silly, but it's how it feels anyway.

So how did you end up coming out at your work? How did it go? Would you do anything differently?

Thanks!"
ThrowawyaskTG1,asktransgender,"Does this sound like it's my stress and anxiety disorder causing me to doubt whether i am a transgender woman or not, or do I sound like I am actually a transgender woman?","As you probably got from the title, I am AMAB, I have a stress and anxiety disorder and I am doubting whether or not I am actually a transgender woman or not. I don't know why, but the doubts always seem to revolve around the same themes. The themes being regret, finding out I was never transgender in the first place and somehow tricked or deluded myself into thinking I was, etc.

The themes are thoughts like, ""what if I regret transitioning"", ""what if I find out after medically and surgically transitioning i find out i necer was or have been transgender"", things like that.

See, it doesn't help that I am okay with living as a male. It doesn't cause me stress or anxiety to live, be perceived, etc as a gay cisgender man. Granted, I'm not a particular fan of facial hair, but many gay cisgender men aren't, right? I mean, if God let me choose at birth what gender I would be, I would of chosen to be a girl as I just prefer it. The way that girls grow up, dress, etc would just be something i want.

I don't think the bullying I unfortunately had to endure from the very start to the very end of school would of occurred if I was AFAB because, the only reason I got bullied at school was because of my appearance, my mannerisms, etc, because they were all so feminine. I got bullied for being gay (i never came out at school, but it was apparently obvious i was gay, which it was) and for being so feminine. For example, even in men's clothes I would get perceived as a woman!

Now onto hormones. If you want to get technical, I could literally start hormones tomorrow if I wanted to (I've been given a HRT letter) but I just can't do it because of all of this. Because I'm so confused. Like, what am i? A woman? A man? I must of created hundreds (no, literally) of Reddit accounts asking questions on hear about whether I am transgender or not. You see, I think I also have OCD. For example, I thought I liked women. And I don't want to like women. It got me upset. How do I know that these transgender thoughts aren't just due to my diagnosed stress and anxiety disorder and my more then likely OCD disorder?

I don't know why but when people say online at /r/AskTransgender say to me that ""cisgender people don't think like you say you do, they don't do what you do (live as a woman, use female pronoun's, etc)"", this doesn't even convince me. I've seen when other people are told this they have there moment where they realise they are transgender or something. I don't get that. Sometimes I get relief for a few minutes, hours or days (it varies) but that's it. Why can't i accept this?

I was once terrified that if I had to come out as not being transgender and resume living as a male permanently again, that some members of my family would not react very well, but now I'm not scared about that AT ALL anymore.

I will say one thing though, as a woman (when I am passable) I am more confident, etc. If i found out I was transgender, i think after the surgery and everything like that i would probably be the most confident woman on the street. I never felt that as a guy, probably because i could never even express my femininity. What do you think?

I've heard people say that cisgender men wouldn't say they would like to of been assigned female at birth if God gave them the choice too, but I'm sure there some men would. Maybe if its literally handful. That makes me doubt too.

It's horrible doubting this. I was a little bit hesitant to putting this in the post but I'll do it. I've been living as a woman and when there has been times I have had to go back to presenting as a male, I felt fine. See, it's things like this that make me doubt. But then, my body goals are Kim Kardashian. I don't have ANY desire to really have any muscle or anything (but then again, many men don't). See the confusion?

Please try and be objective. Please give your brutally honest opinion."

Women don't whistle.

I mean I'm sure they do, but not as frequently as men. And it seems most of them don't do it for fun, where as men will start whistling for no reason. 

Another fun thing is if you whistle a song in public there is a good chance a man will also start whistling!

PunchThem,asktransgender,Doc doesn't want to give me HRT anymore. Advice?,"My GP didn't want to help me start HRT because he wasn't knowledgeable enough on it (which is fine, fair enough) so my friend recommended me his doc who did help him get hormones. I saw the doc last week, he took my blood to check my levels, he seemed alright at the idea of giving me T. Told me to call him on Tuesday to see if my results came in.

So I called him yesterday, and suddenly he's hesitating. He says he doesn't know if he wants to give me T anymore because doesn't know me like he knew the guy who recommended him to me. Says it's suspicious that my own GP didn't want to give me T.

Now that wouldn't have surprised me if he didn't say that *after* seeing me. I feel like he stopped taking me seriously because of how I look and that's something I'm stressing so much over already.

Also I already gave him the therapist letter saying it's OK for me to start hormones so I don't know what more he wants?

I'm supposed to see him later today to ""talk about it"". Do you have advice on what I should say to him? I feel so anxious.



Note: it's better to ask GPs for hrt here because if you look for endocrinologists you'll end up with an official Gender Team which is not a good idea."
arkwald,asktransgender,Taking the first steps into that upside down world..,"So I have been in therapy for a long time.... trying to deal with my underlying trans-identity. I have decided that I should at least try HRT if for no other reason then to find out if it would be beneficial and not the harbinger of destroying my life I always feared it would be. I called up a local informed consent clinic and have an appointment set up, but to do that they want to get some general information about you in their system. That by itself was no big deal... the part that kinda got me though was when the receptionist asked for me preferred name. Which kinda struck me as odd for a second because, I told him my name before... then it hit me what he was really asking for. Then came the question if I identify as transgender or genderqueer... and finally what pronouns I preferred. At the end of the call I felt a little anxious. These are questions that I have struggled with for so long and we just went through them like they were any other type of demographic data. I think that is why i felt anxious... that this thing I have dealt with and treated like a oddity to be kept bottled up, making an appointment is really the first true step in making it real. In pushing through the mirror I have looked at myself at. I guess what I am wondering is if anyone else ever felt that uncertain?"
Jazz8680,asktransgender,Will these trans thoughts go away? (AMAB),"I don't know if I'm ready to accept that I might be trans. These thoughts have been consuming me for about a week now, ever since I kind of had a realization at like 3:00am a few nights ago when I, like, started remembering all of these things when I was little. Like wishing and ""praying"" that I would wake up as a girl, and what-not. I was wondering if these thoughts could just be temporary and what the repercussions would be if I stuff them away and (try to) not think about them.

Zellist,asktransgender,Will progesterone mess up my hair regrowth?,"I'm contemplating asking for progesterone. My boobs haven't grown much at all in months 3-8 and I'm stuck somewhere around 34AA. 

The reason I'm thinking about sticking with spiro is I've had hair regrowth (without finesteride). I don't want to lose the ability to get back more hair, will progesterone effect that?

Doses and levels if they matter: 

spiro - 100 mg/day and ~12 pg/ml T

Jazz8680,asktransgender,Is this a feasible plan?,"So I've been thinking and I really want to try HRT. I go to grad school next fall, hopefully out of state (I'm trying to get into a really good music school). I'll finally have my drivers license (I'm 22 for fucks sake, lol), and I'll finally be living on my own in a different state. 

So my plan is this: go to an informed consent clinic and start HRT and see how I like it. I've always wanted to have the body of a girl so I think this would help me a lot. 

My main fear is hiding the changes. I know that it must be extremely hard to hide changed from parents/people you live with, but if I plan to get a single apartment how hard would it be to continue boy mode at school? I'd probably wear more fancy boy clothes (especially if I get a TA position) that would probably consist of dress shirts and slacks. I could probably layer up to hide the shape of a sports bra once breast development starts. I know that it's a YMMV kind of thing, but how feasible is it to hide breasts with a sports bra under semi-baggy male dress shirts? Or rather, what type of shirt best hides breast growth with a sports bra? "
Aigne13,asktransgender,Low Dosage HRT Long-term Effects,"Hi, Asktransgender! Can starting with a low dose of HRT for a few years negatively impact medical transition further down the road? Specifically, as MtF, could I end up with smaller breasts because I didn't try and hit female hormone levels much earlier in the HRT process?

Background: Longtime lurker, here. I've posted a few times but generally I just read what others post. I searched the subreddit for similar threads but didn't find the answers I was looking for. Anyway, I'm hoping to get on HRT soon-ish, but I won't be in a good location to socially transition for another 3 years or so. I'd like to get on HRT to enjoy the beneficial psychological effects, and to stabilize my dysphoria to a manageable level, but put off a lot of the more noticeable physical changes and social transition stuff until I can move to a more LGBT-friendly city. Does this sound like a plausible idea? I know YMMV is always the case when it comes to HRT effects, but from what I've read it seems like low dose HRT makes the physical effects appear much more slowly (and thus easier to hide for longer). Thanks in advance for the help!"
diplomacynpa,asktransgender,"People who began transition many years ago (5-10 years), how are things?","I'm not sure about /r/FtM, but certainly in /r/MtF it seems like the far majority of people are either pre-transition, only a few months in, or somewhere in the six months to a year range.

Do you feel like your transition is complete? If not, what are you still working on? If so, at what point did you feel like you were done transitioning?

1)i have full control over bladder, so no leakage but after peeing find that i still have a lot of pee in the tube. Has anyone else had this happen, if so how did u find a way to prevent it or did u just have to basically just have to force the remaining fluid out manually?
2)i may need to talk to my dr about this, but my penis has random areas that are hyper sensitive all over the shaft, has this happened to anyone else?

I'm really having a hard time dealing with the waiting. I got my hopes up, I thought maybe this would be the end of this stupid fucking process to getting HRT, and I thought I would finally be able to start becoming more comfortable in my body soon.

But I was lied to, and I have to wait yet another while for estrogen. Sure the time probably will go by fairly quickly, but I am finding it impossible to function without it.

Having my hopes of starting it within a few weeks destroyed was the last thing that pushed me beyond my breaking point for the waiting. I just can't handle it anymore, it's too much, and I don't know what to do anymore. 

Not being on estrogen is killing me, not literally, but I mean, I've gotten my hopes up 10 goddamn times, 10 times I thought HRT was just around the corner, and it turns out it wasn't.

I originally thought I was just gay, as my dad had asked straight up If I was or not, I said probably, he had no issue, then I thought I was BI again my dad had no issue, February 2016, I tried to come out as a girl to my mum and well, got laughed at, in my face, she said to go and talk to one of my youth workers and I did, my mum still didn't believe me, I tried to tell my dad a few days later and....He socially isolated me for about a month. My dad had shoved it into my mind that this was what happens to people like me/us. So I kept it quiet until someone showed me a LGBT club I lived not far from, so I started going there, at least one day a week where I can be me, Mei, but one day a week...It really isn't a nice feeling rest of the time. I kept in the closet out side of this once a week club where I was accepted, one evening I decided I was gonna try again to explain to my dad that this is who I want to be. It went south quickly, and an argument started, he said that if I ever became a girl I would lose all my aspirations for computers, I called bull shit but he went on saying that I'll never have any money and I'll be left forever lonely. That scared me, I'm already a reclusive person due to my inability to socialise easily (not sure why to be honest) but permernent loneliness scares the living shit out of me, so once again I went back in the closet, in august time I tried once more, I showed up to him in a dress and tried to explain, all I got was a smirk and him saying ""you make an ugly girl, don't expect me to be around you when you where that"", I almost cried there and then, a few days later he comes to me when I'm making my breakfast and makes a threat towards me ""If I ever catch you on hormones I will smack the shit out of you for being stupid"" once again this scared me...This is about up to date, I've boxed my self up in my room most days, my mental state is unstable to say the least and my college work is suffering to...And any attempts to do anything are blocked by my dad...I only got to see my GP once...That was in may...every other time it's 20 questions and if he even thinks I'm lying, he grounds me and restricts my access to everything for ""being an idiot"", I am at my wit's end...To the point most of my friends are worried...Even my partner has noticed my change in emotion.

OnlyMyCatKnows4Sure,asktransgender,DAE find that they fall back into old gender roles and other unhealthy behaviors around people who knew you for ages before you came out?,"I've been noticing this over the last few months as I visit more people who've known me for years before I came out (we’re a far flung group geographically. So these are usually meetings for the first time since I came out. Or at least since I started presenting). Everybody knows about me and has been wonderfully supportive. But when I'm around them I start to revert back to being deadname in behavior and (ugh!) general mental state. And it's worth noting that these are some of my biggest supporters. People who've never given me even the slightest reason to feel like I couldn't just be Robyn around them. I should also add that I don't have a problem just being me around the general public. Or around those who may have known me for years but that I was never super close to. Only those people who were a big part of my life as deadname. 

On many levels I totally get why this might happen. But on a base emotional level it's very frustrating and badly messes with my confidence for days afterwords. It's already happened in a pretty big way twice in the past few months. And in a couple of days I’m going to be seeing another 5 people who I have 15+ year long relationships with who are coming into town. I really want to be excited about seeing them. But must admit that I’m starting to stress about how it might go for the reasons mentioned above. 

So my question is, does anything like this happen to anyone else?

Shir0kur0,asktransgender,Support me…or…not?,"It's Christmas and all and trust me, I'm grateful for what I got. Some jackets…and…jackets…

Though I guess I got jealous of some posts saying other got their new name and presents that were either feminine or masculine. 

…everything was male…and I was planning on being full time next year and was hoping for at least one small present to help me feel better. Perfume, jewelry…maybe even a normal t shirt. 

So I feel like my parents don't support me and don't want to think about me as a female at this point. "
veganprius,asktransgender,What can I do? It's only getting worse,"This might be long, and unformatted, and strong at times, I'm not feeling so well (fuck no I'm not) and I'm on my phone, so apologies. The semester's over and I'm home with my parents and two brothers. None are accepting of my being trans, yet claim to be supportive. I have to live with these people the next month and also pretend to be cis at all the holiday celebrations. It's tearing me apart, though. Since I came out as binary trans (couldn't stand my nonbinary identity being called a mental illness all the time, so I didn't mention that that's still part of my gender currently) a bit over half a year ago, my dysphoria worsened significantly. I was out as agender years before and complain of not wanting my feminine characteristics for those years (since puberty started around 13, I'm 18 now). I never said I wanted to be a boy, though, and was the girliest ""girl"" throughout highschool, wearing only dresses, jewelry, painting my long nails, and not cutting my hair. I realise this shouldn't negate my identity or keep me from getting medical treatment, but my family sure doesn't. As a psychiatrist, my mother believes only the people that claim to be the opposite sex from young childhood could possibly be trans and have dysphoria, saying my hatred of my body is another unrelated problem that needs to be treated with intensive therapy and medication. She's managed to convince the rest of my family of this, too, saying the internet and these subreddit/forums have tainted me and told me to be trans. Lol fuck no I hate this! God it's hell! I'm here suffocating, feel like I should burst into tears, but can't and it's so dry and imprisoning! Anyways, college started and the dysphoria's only getting worse. I used to be suicidal only during shark week, even tried to die by bleeding out from cutting my breasts. Hilarious fail, I'm not dying that way anyways. At least my fellow students believed me and called me by my name and used my pronouns. Not here, no, not in this fucking prison. Support doesn't mean fucking forced misgendering and deadnaming and ""correction"" when someone uses male gender accord (Romanian household) or my name. Any correct gendering has stopped by now. I'm tired of being told that I'll get fat and ugly on hormones (dealt with an eating disorder, my mother is using this) and that I'll never be able to erase any of my feminine features, that I'm stuck woman no matter what I do. Fucking end yourselves, fuckers! I know you're part of me and not sentient, but no, you're FOREIGN. I can't wait to cut you off in glee and get the parts I want! I'll spit on your lifeless bodies and be happy if I get to that point! Why won't it come soon enough? I'm suicidal throughout the day, every day in this toxic environment and the worst part is they all believe they're saving me from a life of difficulty of being trans! Maybe they are if I end it! I'm not calling any of those mandated reporter lifelines, and the Trans Lifeline is understaffed. I'm not going to the hospital again! God, that was as bad as now! You can assume I'm safe since if I do it, I want to be absolutely sure, and I have no access to firearms, no buildings tall enough in this neighborhood, don't want to try being run over by a car, have no rope long enough or where to hang it, no cyanide, other poisons that could damage me permanently, the knife's too slow and messy. I'm sure   I'm not in immediate danger , but I feel horrible."
asleepamongwolves,asktransgender,"Was trying to figure out how to tell my mum I'm trans, when she told me she has cancer.","I don't even know where to begin. I apologise in advance for how disjointed this will probably be.

I went home last weekend to visit my mum, which is the first time she's seen me since I began HRT mid-November. She does not know that I'm transgender (FTM), nor does anyone in my family. 

My mum and I had a very strained relationship growing up, after a long and abusive marriage to my father and subsequent divorce left her with severe mental health issues. I moved out at 21, and we were estranged for quite some time until we began rebuilding our relationship over the last few years.

I came out to her as a lesbian towards the end of 2015, and her reaction has been mixed. She's been welcoming of my long term partner, but does not talk about me being gay outside of the immediate family, which is just us and my two brothers. To be honest, I think she believes it's just a phase or that I'm experimenting.

My older brother (31, married to a woman) identifies as pansexual and genderfluid. He is very femme, with enough heels, lingerie and makeup to sink a small boat. 

She has been open in not understanding my brother's sexuality or gender expression, and although he came out to her over 10 years ago, it's still not something she's ever really accepted or felt is 'normal'. She's said many times now that she doesn't know what she did wrong to have raised two LGBT kids, and somehow thinks it's her fault. Those comments are always hurtful, but I try not to take them to heart as her mental health has stunted her thinking and insight, and emotional capacity.

Coming back to the weekend, my mum picked me up from the station, and almost immediately commented on my increased muscle mass and that my hair looked very short (my hair is actually longer than it's been for a while, it probably just looks less like a pixie cut with my face squaring out). I brushed off the muscle comment and said that I had just been training hard for the last few months, which isn't untrue as I'm heavily involved in various sports.

On the drive home, I was trying to figure out the best way to tell her, or maybe drop some hints, when she told me that it's likely she has the same type of cancer that killed her father (bowel and colon). The blood test has come back positive, but we won't know what type of cancer it is or what stage it's in until early January when she has the colonoscopy.

I now don't know what to do. I've read so many coming out stories, and for the parents that come around and accept their kids as trans, it seems to take a year or two to process under normal circumstances. 

Firstly, I don't know if she has that much time. I also don't want to burden her with the grief of coming out as trans and making her feel like it's somehow her fault. She had been caring for my grandmother for over a year when she passed in August, and it's likely the stress of that has contributed to or exacerbated the cancer. I feel that coming out could make things worse for her, both mentally and physically. 

But I don't know how well I will be able to hide my transition. I'm on low dose hormones, but she commented on the changes after just one month. I have a consult for top surgery scheduled early next year, and feel awful for hiding such massive medical procedures and life events in my own life from her. I hate being called by my birth name and being addressed with feminine pronouns, and closeting myself every time I talk to her has become increasingly draining and detrimental to my own health and well being.

I know this is an insanely complex situation, but any advice would be greatly appreciated. For any parents out there, what would you want your kid to do?"
overexpressing,asktransgender,Anyone else enjoy the depiction of Hitler's theoretical cross-sex hormone experience on White Rabbit Project?,"White Rabbit Project Season 1 Episode 3 describes a plot that was considered by the British military during WWII to diminish Hitler's aggression by having a secret agent spike his food with Estrogen. 

A lot of it is comical, but the depiction of his presumed dysphoria after receiving estrogen was pretty good. It was probably for the best that the plan was scrapped because as they pointed out, and we all know, the timeline for success was ""unknowable"".

They stated that giving him Estrogen could have resulted in side effects like nausea and headaches. I've never heard anything like that, anyone know what that could have been based on?

surgerythrowaway33,asktransgender,I'm having SRS in a month. Would anyone be interested in a recovery timeline?,"Hi there everyone! I'm posting on a throwaway because I'm stealth on reddit.

Anyway, I'm going to have SRS (MtF) with Dr Chettawut in roughly a month. I was wondering if some people here would be interested in a comprehensive recovery timeline (i.e. before + as many pictures as I can be bothered taking throughout recovery). I've noticed that there aren't a lot of pictures immediately after surgery online, and I think it's good if people know what to expect.

So if you're interested, let me know! If there's interest I'll make updates on this account.

edit: Okay, cool! It seems like there's interest. I'll probably make another post here in around a month from this account and just edit on top of it as time goes on."
stardropTabletop,asktransgender,Uncomfortable experience in the men's room while in Japan: should I switch over to using the women's?,"So, I've been in Japan for like three days so far, and today I had to use a public bathroom for the first time. I'm still really scared of using the women's room, so I just kind of ducked into the men's and *wow* did I feel intimidated. As soon as I entered, these three guys started chuckling and stuff, and one of them (who was standing in front of me) was making dramatic expressions with his face, clutching his abdominal area like he was in pain. I felt like they were mocking me somehow, but I couldn't tell whether any of the stalls were free of people, so I just kind of stood there awkwardly while this happened.

Then, when someone came out of a stall, I thought the guy in front of me would go in it, but he just kept making the same weird faces and gesticulations until he gestured for me to take the stall. I did, and it turned out that it was a traditional Japanese toilet, the kind that you have to stand over and pee into. At this point, I *really* started to feel like they were messing with me, and I didn't know whether it was a ""haha let's see how the funny gaijin handles this toilet"" kind of thing or a ""haha why is this foreign girl in the men's bathroom, let's mess with her"" kind of thing. I did my thing as quick as I could and got out of there fast.

I guess I would normally just switch over to using the women's room after an experience like that, but like...I'm so afraid of people screaming at me for being a ""man in the ladies' room"" that I don't know if I can. Like, I present pretty gender neutral, and since I don't think people assume I'm a cis woman just from looking at me, I feel like trying to use the ladies' might prompt worse reactions (this is what I currently look like, for reference: http://imgur.com/nQAQZq2).

So...idk. Does this mean I should make the switch while I'm in Japan? I mean, in a perfect world, I'd say ""fuck it, I'm gonna use the bathroom congruent with my gender identity, no matter how other people might perceive me,"" but I also have a lot of anxiety about causing a scene :/

acreamymoose,asktransgender,What would you do?,"I saw this on Facebook, I though it was quite interesting. 

On the one hand, restarting my your life at 10 with your current knowledge (and hopefully still in 2016) means you could transition earlier and most likely grow up to be a very passable male/female.

On the other hand, you'd be a late transitioner but you'd have the money for the best surgery/doctors available.

truthndares,asktransgender,How can you reveal that you are trans to somebody you have been dating in a safe and positive way?,"So yeah, I have been turning down most date offers because I don't want to deal with this eventuality. But with this last guy it has become a real thing. Anyways the other night for our date he cooked me a vegetarian dinner (he remembered that fact about me from our first meeting, I mentioned it once) and things got pretty heated before I had to leave. I would love for things to progress and I wasn't expecting to be this into this guy because I haven't had surgery yet aside from the two I was given at birth and really don't feel like I can handle a relationship until I get surgery. 

Anyways I really am struggling between cutting and running, which is what I've done with almost all guys I've dated so far, and opening up about my past. I just don't know how to do that aside from over texts and that hasn't gone well. How can I broach this subject? He is such a flatterer and so nice, I couldn't imagine him being violent but I really haven't done this in person ever before. I just know that I am going to bawl my eyes out. Any suggestions?"
ZelkyZo,asktransgender,What is dysphoria to you?,"Soooo as is a regular occurrence in my life lately, particularly in the evenings, I go through periods of extreme depression where life as a whole hits me at once and I pretty much just curl up in a corner and start crying.

Well this evening, this started happening just before my mother and eldest sister came home from a church service.  My mother noticed this and confronted me about it, so I finally knew that I was going to have to explain to her what was going on with me.  She already knew I was trans and is fully supportive, but the full breadth of how it affects me was a big unknown to her.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to tell her directly, so I wrote it up in a text for her to read.

After writing it, it dawned on me that I haven't really done much reaching out around here.  I presume it's the constant sense of hopelessness that overtakes me whenever I feel desperate for help, knowing that the community here is no better of a place than I am and thus lack the answers I'm so desperate to find for myself.  If anything, I'll just get the same old tired answers I always get, thereby fueling my depression and self-loathing further.  The harsh truth is, there is no easy solution.  Nobody on this sub or anywhere else is going to have the magic answer to this curse.  There's no easy way out that's just waiting to be found on Reddit.  One thing we can do however, is take solace in the fact that we are not alone in this struggle, and even though it may only dull the pain or a brief moment, that small dose of relief can be just enough to keep us going for a little while longer.

For that reason, I would like to hear from the rest of you.  **What is dysphoria to you?  How does it affect your life?  What does it mean to you?**

I will post my own answer in the text I sent to my mom in a separate post so as to not clutter my OP or overwhelm all of you lol.  &lt;3

Perhaps this can be our Christmas gift to each other: a reminder that none of us are alone in this and that we're in this fight together.

Love you all, and happy holidays!  :D"
GraceTheDogeLover,asktransgender,I just came out: mixed feelings and somewhat of a rant.,"Hey everyone, I've been a lurker here for a while and I finally decided it was time for me to come out to someone and tell them how I feel. 

It feels amazing to get it out but at the same time I don't know what to do now. I want to transition as soon as possible because I feel like everyday I wait is another day that I'll be unhappy. I'm 99% sure this is what I want in life, I hate being male, I hate the way testosterone makes me feel: it feels like a toxin in my body, I hate my body, and everyday I hate myself more and more. I've always been envious of cis-women and I wish I could restart my life and choose to be born a woman instead of a man. In the past I never felt comfortable being the ""man"" in a relationship. It didn't feel right and I was always sad because I was forced to be the male even though it never felt right. I know that it's not a requirement for a man to take the dominant role in a relationship with a woman, but even if I was in a relationship where I took more of a submissive role I still don't think I would be comfortable as there's more to it than that. Those are my main reasons for thinking I am trans.

So the downside is that she wasn't 100% supportive. We were both raised in a conservative christian family so that's to be expected I guess. She said that she supports my decision but doesn't think that it's right. I guess this is pretty good, I plan on coming out to my mom later this week and maybe to a friend soon too.

I guess that the next step is to see a therapist, but I would really like to get on hrt before I go back to school in January. Would informed consent be quicker? I haven't been able to find anything about informed consent in Texas other than some old posts. I will be in the Dallas area if anyone knows of any good therapists who don't try to gate-keep, or if anyone knows if there's an informed consent clinic that will take me before I go back to school in January. I read somewhere that Texas universities will prescribe hrt but I haven't been able to find anything anywhere about that other than one post about like a year ago. I think i'm going to be in stealth mode for about a year because all of my friends are really conservative and I feel like I'll be harassed if I present before I can pass.

Thank you all for reading this. I know there's like dozens of posts like this a day and this is mainly a huge rant but it feels better writing a post of my own to vent and stuff. :)

Any comments, suggestions, advice or encouraging words are appreciated &lt;3"
throwawaymeganium,asktransgender,I think I might be trans...,"For about a month or so I've been thinking I might be trans. I've always fantasised about being a girl a little bit for as long as I remember, but never thought about actually doing anything about it. Unlike a lot of people, I do feel ok with my gender, and could probably live as a man for the rest of my life. However some days I feel like I really want to be a girl, some days I feel line, and some days I'm on the fence. Luckily, I know that my family would support, or at the very least tolerate my ""choice""(I know it's not a choice but I can't think of the right word), which is comforting.

I haven't really had a point yet, so I guess what I'm asking is, do you think I'm trans and has anyone else transitioned from a similar situation and how did it go?

I'm only 13 btw, so take that into consideration. Thanks."

What do I need to do to get started back on HRT through the VA? Just book a mental health appointment? Or my PCP? Any good stories/bad stories about the VA and trans issues?"
Teletrans_Fun,asktransgender,Self-worth declined after getting help.,"So this will be kind of long. It's more me venting about an experience than an actual question. 

Recently I went to my first therapy session to talk about the constant trans thoughts plaguing my mind. I'd been very eager to get that first contact with a professional since my dysphoria kicked into overdrive after reaching out and making the appointment. I thought making a move would give me a sense of control and validation. I was a naive fool.

The session went about as I expected. I felt awful and embarrassed the entire time. Serious imposter syndrome just sitting there talking about my feelings. But again, I expected this. As terrible as it felt I knew it had to be done to get ahead of everything.

What caught me off-guard was when about half way through she asked me about my preferred pronouns and name. I don't know why I wasn't expecting that, but I was  in complete shock. I just sat there in silence for what had to be minutes until she asked me if I didn't mind and I nodded. I gave her the gender neutral version of my name and she seemed disappointed. 

I felt like such a fraud walking in there looking and sounding like I did (male) and not even being able to call myself a woman out loud.
For the record, I had been comfortably thinking of myself as female for quite some time now, and since I live a relatively isolated life, I've never really had to think about it in a context outside of my own head. 

I guess it was just the shock of something that had been a fantasy for so long being hinted at out in the real world. And that makes perfect sense to me, but it hasn't stopped me from feeling like a worthless peice of shit ever since. I'm scared to go back and face her. Plus I'm afraid to go back to thinking of myself as a woman in my own private life. I don't feel like anything and I don't know what to do.

Is this a thing that happens? Has anyone experienced something similar? VALIDATE ME, CRETIN! D:&lt;"
unstableisocrazy,asktransgender,"1+ year into mtf HRT, almost no breast growth.","I looked at my most recent blood test, and my E levels are a little on the high side (442 pg/mol), and it turns out my endo isn't testing for testosterone levels. I asked her about that and she said that since I'm already on a quote unquote ""full"" dose of Spiro (200 mg/day) and I'm not showing signs of high testosterone, she doesn't need to test for it. She seemed very cavalier about it, but she's trans herself so it's not like she's just being ignorant.

It's just... I have no boobs. And it doesn't look like I'm going to be getting any, if how little my chest is sore is any indication. Oh, they get a little sensitive sometimes, I know what it feels like when they're growing, but it just seems like they're mostly done, you know?

 I'm seeing her next week, and I kind of want to push this issue (if she refuses I'm just going to get my T levels tested myself after the holidays), but have any other trans women experienced extremely limited breast growth with normal hormone levels?

Did it get better after a couple years if you did?

And are there are any subtle but telltale signs my T levels are high that I should be keeping an eye out for? I feel really disheartened that my chest still looks mostly like a man's, just with slightly puffy nipples."

KiwiWithAHat,asktransgender,Panty Sizing?,"Having worn medium panties for a while now, my only complaint is that my testicle very, very slightly is out (not droopy or anything, but the skin) and touches my leg, and it feels odd. Perhaps I should consider small? I'm pretty sure a small in a cheekster though might be very slightly too small because the uncovered part of my butt barely ""rises up""/has a small increase (to better explain, the panty edge very slightly pushes on it, but it's a very minimal effect). However, it still feels good and supports my junk in a small. Boyshorts seem to work in both small and medium, but I'm thinking small will support me better? I already have a lot of mediums though. I don't ""tuck"" either, I just put it on normally.


I'm not ever really transitioning or anything, probably just a closet crossdresser/gender dysphoric. I'm also taking Peuraria Mirifica to grow very, very small breasts, but that's it. I'm already looking into discussing all this with a professional though, just to be sure. I still have my junk though.

Danisel,asktransgender,Alguien se dio cuenta que era mujer a los 41?,"Hola. Perdon por escribir en español, pero es mi lengua de origen. Espero que alguien pueda contestarme.
Desde los 11 años comence a masturbarme con ropa de mujer, me gustaban las mujeres y mucho, pero no me imaginaba teniendo relaciones con ellas, era algo platonico.
Hasta los 39 no tuve novia formal, hasta ese momento seguía estimulandome con ropa o imaginando estar vestid@ como cualquier mujer que pase por la calle. Nunca ropa vulgar, siempre ropa elegante y bonita.
Mis amores eran platonicos, pero mi caracter hacia que ellas no se fijaran en mi. Yo solo imaginaba besarlas o estar junto a ellas.
Hace 4 años encontre novia formal. Al principio todo anduvo bien, aunque siempre me costó tener relaciones. Es como si no tuviera instinto de penetracion. Sin embargo ella me aceptó asi y hasta hoy estos juntos.
El problema es que luego de 1 año juntos sentí que sexualmente algo me faltaba, y volvi a estimularmeben secreto. Pero esta vez las ideas fueron siendo mas fuertes.
Sufrí ginefilia por varios meses, alucinaba con ser mujer, tener cuerpo de mujer, senos  vagina, etc. Luego esto disminuyó un poco pero vuelve siempre.
Actuo de forma masculina, pero en secreto quisiera sentir que no hay nada entre mis piernas y que mis senos rebotan al caminar. Este sentimiento va acompañado de mucho miedo, porque pienso que no voy a poder controlar esta situacion y quw terimaré tomando hormonas, operad@, y solo, sin familia ni amigos.
Realmente no creo sentirme 100% mujer, aunque se que soy distinto de otros hombres.
Pero al ponerme la ropa es como un switch que enciende la femeneidad. Alucino con tener cara femenina, poder maquillarme, vestirme linda, pintar mis uñas, usar aretes, etc.
Cuando reprimo mis sentientos siento algo de calma, pero a ves aparece esto otro y me arrastra a la idea de ser mujer.
Yo me opongo a cambiar, pero no se hasta cuando.
Quisiera saber que opinan, o si alguien ha pasado por algo parecido.
Gracias"
Lea91,asktransgender,Laser and electrolysis at the same time?,"Hey!
I've been full-time for over a month now, and the one thing that really bothers me is my facial hair. I still have some shadow even with foundation and concealer and it's horrible. Half of the month I feel great because laser nukes it, but the other half it starts growing back and it's driving me crazy, i get so self-conscious that I don't even want to leave the house.
I've already done 6 laser sessions and it's worked pretty well, I've lost most of my facial hair except a little on my chin and pretty much everything on my upper lip. It just doesn't seem to go away and it's very noticeable ( dark hair on very light skin). I was wondering how I could accelerate the process. I don't have much money now but I'm willing to just start electrolysis and I was wondering if i could do that while still doing laser? If so, how would I do that? Which would be the best time for electrolysis during the whole laser cycle?

Hope everyone had a good Christmas!"

Then overnight it's gone, and I'm fine with being male again. I suppose what I am is genderfluid, but it really doesn't feel like it. It feels like sometimes I'm a cis man, and sometimes I'm a trans woman. There's no ""fluidity"" there. There's a very large barrier that I happen to cross over. 

When I'm feeling male, I feel like I dodged a bullet by not beginning to transition into a woman. I would experience dysphoria just as strongly as I do when I'm currently feeling female. It seems like I'm damned to experience dysphoria no matter what I do. To stop feeling dysphoria when I'm feeling like a woman I would have to start HRT, get surgery, etc, which would leave me dysphoric when I'm feeling male.

Another issue is my sexuality. When I'm identifying as a woman it seems clear enough. I'm a lesbian. However, when I'm feeling male, I believe I am what's called a ""guydyke."" I'm a male who's a lesbian. I don't really understand it. It's like I can't enact my own desires. For me, it's not simply fetishisizing lesbians as a straight man like it's often called by critics. I do not feel romantically satisfied or sexually aroused by partaking in straight relationships. It like when I'm feeling male, I can only experience romance/sexual attraction vicariously through others. It's hard to explain.

Anyway, does anyone have any advice for how I should resolve these issues? It seems that my options are:

A) Remain male and continue to experience dysphoria about a third of the time and have no romantic relationships

or

B) Transition into a woman and feel dysphoria about two thirds of the time. Be able to be in relationships but experience the societal scorn in addition to everything else that comes with transitioning

hmmmthisisntgood,asktransgender,Anyone else frustrated with doctor refusing to raise estradiol levels?,"My most recent estradiol levels were 120pg/ml, and they've never really been above this.  I've been on HRT for eighteen months now and my endocrinologist thinks that 120pg/ml is a good level.  The problem is I've seen next to no results whatsoever!  Grrrr!

I'm trying to argue that raising my levels higher (about 200pg/ml) would be a good first step in trying to achieve some degree of feminization but he's reluctant to raise my estradiol dosage to over 6mg (which is what I'm on now).  He thinks that because I'm in a modest female range already, that I won't achieve any additional feminization by raising my dose.

Any thoughts on how to proceed?

I'm tempted to self-med an additional 2mg at this point in time.  Finding a new endo and going through the whole titration game again is a waste of time.

My testosterone is just about zero, so really not sure why the estradiol dose isn't giving me good estradiol levels.

Help?"
Amy_of_Dallas,asktransgender,Changing gender on social security and passport,"So, yesterday my doctor gave me the letters I'll need to have my gender marker changed on my federal documents. Now, I have a few questions:

* What is the process for changing my gender marker with social security? Everything I've found online talks about the letter I'll need, but it says nothing about the form I should use. If it does mention a form, it's in regards to name change, and I already changed my name two and a half years ago.

* Passport is going to be a pain. On the form to request a passport, it asks if you already have one. I used to have a passport when I was a minor (expired over a decade ago), but it's no longer where my mom thought it was in either her house or her safety deposit box, and I can't find it in my house either. The form asks for the number and the issuing date of the old passport, neither of which I know. And there's a form to report an old passport as lost, but that form asks for that information too. What do I do?

Thanks!"
SelfLoathing91,asktransgender,I keep getting in this argument.. Do I have the right to be upset?,"As of recently I keep getting in this argument with those who ""claim"" to support me. The reason this argument keeps popping up is because of my delusions caused by my body dysmorphic disorder as well as my dysphoria and immense depression. I've got people who seem to be able to read when I'm at my lowest like an open book and just rip on me. So what is this argument?

I don't have the right to be mad or place even some blame on my parents as to why things are the way they are.

So a little backstory..

I came out to my parents as gay when I was 12, later trans in 13 although I didn't know the terminology. Thinking things were going to change for me is what led to my father growing disgusted with me and demanding I be sent to a correction camp. Mom gave me an option to live with my oldest sister who claimed she'd get me help.. 

Well I misunderstood the ""help"" greatly, so did she. My sister tried to break me, assure me I was masculine and could never be a woman. Got enraged at me for using/tuning my female voice. Did everything to get me labeled as gay rather then trans.

A boyfriend I had who treated me as a woman, exactly how I wanted things to be... My sister didn't approve of him at all even though I was for the most part in love. He looked past she shaved all my hair off, wouldn't let me do anything for my appearance. One time he even offered to buy me a wig. Unfortunately he passed away in a car accident which devastated me, sister put her hand on my shoulder while I was crying after I found out and was declined access to his funeral (His mom was transphobic, we were dating in secret for the most part)

""Good, it's god's way of telling you you're wrong. You'll thank the lord one day.""

I snapped and every bit of pent up anger and aggression I had came out, I completely lost control of myself and blacked out. When I came to, well.. I was being restrained and apparently waiting to be escorted out, I was committed for insanity. I'd rather not talk about what happened in there but after awhile they deemed I was mentally okay and released me back to my parents... who apparently had custody of me again.

My parents claimed to have done some research and understood the gravity of what I was going through. At this point I was practically broken though, I just wanted to die because I knew I couldn't become a woman. My other sister started to subject me to mental abuse and pressure to become the ""man."" This led to my delusions getting worse and my suicide attempts started spiking..

After quite a few suicide attempts, my parents gave up on correcting me and pulled me aside to talk. We talked about gender therapy, psychologists and hormones. They said they'd do everything in their power to help me cause like my most recent suicide attempt at the time I screamed at my father basically that he accepts me as his daughter, or his son is dying right here and now. I had given up.

After that talk, I felt hope... My parents even paid for someone to do the name change form for us and it was sitting there within grasp, I felt like things were going to push forward. . .

I was never taken to court, we never got a court date, we never did anything. All the talks would come up again and again but it seemed they were saying it just to make it so I could function again if even for a bit. Eventually that effort we went to having a professional do everything for us was wasted, the papers and everything expired... The talks became meaningless and I just asked for a simple request of letting me present as their daughter - It was the only wish I wanted for my birthday and christmas, I was denied this request.

All the suicidal urges spiked and returned, I felt like they were mocking me at this point. One of my online friends got me on herbal hormones which I deluded myself into believing were as potent as the real things. (I won't deny they did help ""a bit."")

As my features softened up even slightly and my body was slightly more in tune with my mind I was able to function enough that I was presenting myself female with or without their help. Fast forward, it took me until I was about 20 to go full time, there was no part-time for me.

So when this argument comes up, I usually feel immense but short lived anger boil inside me when they claim they couldn't do anything. That it isn't their fault ""puberty had its way with me"" and that i should be thankful they ""support me."" Which yes, I am grateful they use my pronouns, name, etc and I do get treated as their daughter now but...

I'm so screwed up it isn't funny, if it weren't for my insurance I probably wouldn't be writing this because I'd be dead.

Why am I posting this? I don't know, I feel like I DO have the right to be very upset when this argument comes up. I keep getting told I don't by them and it just.. doesn't sit right with me.

So, more information on me.
My dysphoria? It's centered around my genitals but there's a catch. There was a time where my dysphoria wasn't as severe(Thanks sis!) but the moment I feel male, or anyone makes me feel male or inbetween I just.. cannot function. I will break down, quite literally. This has made it very tedious to get employment in the past when I had an easier time cause I was younger. It also led to me dropping out of school because my deadname is 100% masculine. Hell, I was named after my father's best friend who passed away before I was born!

My BDD? Also severe. The ""super manly"" features I've had brought up to me my whole life I see extremely exaggerated. (Giant Nose, Extremely broad shoulders, Manly definition, Very strong jaw, over all manly face despite having girlish hair, cheekbones and eyes.)

Because of this it's been very tough but I'm trying to becoming a functioning woman of society now, I'm probably at my best in the longest I've ever been.

I have no intent of going like ""Well people say I have the right to be upset!"" I just honestly want to know if I do have the right or not and keep it to myself. I'd rather this argument stop popping up because my past is better erased.

TL;DR : Scarring past, having name change paperwork ready to go when I was a teenager and parents claiming to be supportive yet zero effort was made on the false promises of getting therapy and name change issued. Argument pops up that I don't have the right to be upset at them every time this pops up.

As I'm MtF myself, I'm of course interested in those changes in particular, but FtMs should feel free to comment their experiences as well."
B00gieChild,asktransgender,"From a potential MTF, am I trans? What do you make of it?","So I'm gonna take a wild guess here and say that the ""Am I trans?"" posts are pretty fuckin' taboo on this subreddit. But, ehh, you already know the question, so let's just get right into it.

I first asked myself the question at around the age of 10, and a few years prior to that if we're counting when I wasn't even sure what ""trans"" meant. That being that, around age 6 I discovered that I was ambiguous enough looking that I could fool random people into thinking that I was a girl if I wore a slightly feminine winter scarf over part of my face. My dad ended up asking me ""why do you want people to think you're a girl?"", to which I sorta replied ""I dunno"" and then left it alone after that, for the most part. Around the 4th grade I found out that changing your sex was more than just some sci-fi shit that I saw in the episode of Star Trek TNG where Dr. Crusher falls in love with the worm in that guy's belly. You remember that shit? Anyway, I started looking up everything I could on the topic. Or, at least, as much as I could with a 4th grade vocabulary. A whole lot of ""boy turns into girl"", and similarly worded searches. 

Upon discovering the actual terminology, I ended up getting pretty well informed on the topic. In all the time since, I've had these intense periods of self-loathing, where I have a sort of mental breakdown and an inner-confrontation on if I'm transgender or not. They last anywhere from about 2 to 9 months, and upon one's conclusion, I no longer feel extreme jealousy towards my female contemporaries. Or, at least, it's more of a loud whisper now, rather than a piercing scream. I'm currently on the final act of one of these episodes, and figured I'd better put out whatever call for help I could before I'm muted by my own vague indifference and fear.

When it comes to my insecurities, I can't leave the house without shaving 100% of my body hair. And there's quite a bit to account for too, my dad could have been a porn actor in the 70's with how much hair he has. If I happen to miss any and someone draws attention to it, I'm on the edge of tears. I didn't shave one day that I had to watch my nephew, and when my brother hugged me after picking him up, he wouldn't shut the fuck up about how I could ""grow a sick beard, dude!"". That actually happened just a few months ago, and brought the onset of the current inner-feud. I'm also extremely troubled by my face, I look in the mirror and start thinking that puberty has ruined my face, that I've been ""poisoned by testosterone"", and I keep my legs as close together as I can, in the fear that allowing easier blood flow down there is going to lead to an increase in testosterone production or something.

Other than that, i don't really mind being a guy. I'm pretty guy-ish, personality-wise, and I'm happy, for the most part, with the selection of clothes and accessories available to me. You know that watch Keanu Reeves wears in Speed? I wear that same model. You folks seen The Nice Guys yet? That's my fuckin' wardrobe. I still definitely get envious of certain female clothing trends, though. Actually, a few weeks ago, my friend said that all the hats I wore made me look masculine (probably because they covered up my hair, which is longer than most girls' haircuts), so I stopped wearing them the next day.

My biggest fear though this whole thing is if I actually did get on estrogen, what would it do to who I am, mentally? I've seen a couple people transition and it completely changes the way the think, and the way they interact with others. I don't wanna become unrecognizable, and I don't want the world around me to change in my eyes either. The idea of such a thing shakes me to my core, to be honest.

Anyway, this post has gone on way too many tangents. I just wanna know what to do, who to talk to, where one would get therapeutic help in situations like these. Any help is appreciated, and if you managed to read this far, I applaud you."

edit : i should make this clear I'm not saying that I want a child to be born trans I mean it as they are already born and exhibit trans behaviors I would want to adopt them because if they *are* trans I can support them but if they stayed in a orphanage they would likely not be able to get HRT or even just Therapy."
Jazz8680,asktransgender,Am I making this all up?,"I know its impossible for anyone but myself to decide, but part of my denial seems to be focused on stuff like, ""You're just making this up.

Like... I have real memories from, like, middle school of me desperately wanting to wake up a girl (memories which I must have repressed because I hadn't thought about them since middle school). The common praying and wishing every night to wake up a girl. Plus various other things like seeking out movies where one person would turn into a girl. Plus crossdressing once or twice when I was little.

I cant seem to stop thinking that these thoughts are made up. But at the same time I still feel like I've wanted to be a woman for a long time (AMAB). 

Are these types of doubts common? Like I seriously cant shake the feeling that these are all feelings I'm making myself feel and if I can shake them off maybe they'll go away. "

AshWhoSmilesAtDeath,asktransgender,"On Spiro, Estradiol, and Fin. Does Free T still matter?","I got prescribed Fin just recently because my testosterone level was still much higher than it should be.

My doctor also didn't schedule me for another check up for 6 months, even though I'm only ~3 months in, which has me a little worried about these levels.

So as someone who never had any impetus to try and read up on endocrinology until very recently, I'm just trying to figure out if I understand how what I'm taking affects me. So even though the Spiro I'm taking isn't lowering the T level enough, it's at least blocking my ARs? So when you combine that with the blocked conversion to DHT, the copious excess Free T I have won't matter? Because it's being prevented from doing much of anything?"

mtf_or_not,asktransgender,I'm scared that my trans feelings are going to go away or that I am not trans?,"I'm 16, MTF, and I have literally no idea what is going on.



I feel like I might be trans. I don't really feel male at all. I don't want to grow up and be a middle aged man. The thought of it kind of grosses me out. 

I can imagine myself being a woman, it's a weird concept seeing myself as female but it feels a lot better. I have always loved womens clothes for as long as I can remember. If I could wear them in public and not look weird I would any day. I'd much rather wear female clothes than male clothes.



Ever since the thought of me being transgender has come to my head, some weird stuff has happened. Like, being called by my male name just feels weird. Even seeing it written down feels weird. Putting my title as ""Mr"" on anything feels strange. I now hate the thought of having short hair (I haven't cut my hair in 6 months). Being called by my female name feels a lot nicer and looks right when I see it written down. I don't know if this is chest dysphoria, but if I close my eyes, touch where my nipples if I always find myself missing, like there should be a lump there but there isn't. I do have man-boobs though and I don't know if it's just that or not. 





I'm scared these feelings are going to go away. Like, how trans I am feeling changes constantly. But when they go away slightly, I don't like it and try and make them come back. I worry that the transgender thoughts are going to go away and come back one day, and it will be difficult to pass as female then. I constantly feel like I'll regret my transition.



I get jealous of other trans people. A lot of of them have had really supportive families, able to get treatment, therapy, been able to transition, etc. I'm probably going to have to live as male weather I like it or not.


There is no way I could see a therapist. I don't have the money, The nearest one is 100 miles away, and I don't know how I would get there with parents that will not support this. I have to come here to get support, as it's only the place I can actually understand slightly what's going on.

m3dicore,asktransgender,Am I transgendered,"hello, everybody, IK that this is probably the most frequently asked question; but I have been working out this problem for a while now and I personally believe I have reached an impass and IDFK where to turn. I am a 17 year old living as a boy and I have been feeling like I want to be a girl more and more. Originally it was more of a kink, you know acting like a girl had been a fetish. But I have been feeling more and more like I want to be female in normal life. I haven't told anybody about this because I don't want to make the wrong decision and I am not ready. I constantly don't like the prospect of living as a man more and more. I have done my research into this issue and I can't get a straight answer. I also don't feel as though I can get help form a therapist without coming out because I don't know what to tell them as why. I am asking here because I want help form those who have transitioned into knowing what I am missing from my introspection that has been a difficult activity. I really need help as even writing this on a website has got me shaking and in a sweat."

babeunderseige,asktransgender,"I came out to my parents, now what??","I'm an 18 year old transgender (seeking MTF) and told my Mum about my feelings of wanting to be a girl.

She was really shocked at first and said she never had a clue. After I said I had felt this way for six or seven years -- that it wasn't a phase -- and that as a male I would likely brake out of a marriage and children, she understood and agreed coming out was the right thing for me to do.

I live in the southeast region of the UK where we have free healthcare (NHS). We know our local GP very well. He's a really warm, friendly guy.

glass_cameo,asktransgender,Trying to come to grips with thoughts/desires/feelings (mtf),"I don't even really know where to start with this.  I'm a 31-yo male, 6'2"", ~170 pounds, heterosexual.  There's the genetics.

I've been a mess for a lot of years.  From about 2011 to earlier this year I was an alcoholic, at least a mickey of hard liquor a day.  I lost everything - my apartment, three jobs, vehicle, girlfriend, all my possessions, and friendships.  I moved back in with my parents and here I am, on mental disability and unemployment insurance.  

That's just a quick background.

Now to get to why I actually created this account, I have been, I'd say for probably a year now, considering the possibility that I definitely feel like I'd prefer being a woman.  

I think about the fact that I've never really subscribed to the ""male"" way of being.  I was raised by my old-fashioned parents; my father a gruff farmer and a brutish man in his later years (and very intolerant of progressive ideas and practices).  My mother is a quiter, gentler person and I think that when I look back I took a lot more from her than anyone else.  My entire life I've never been one to even raise my voice or being a ""tough guy"" or ""one of the guys.""  Many guys in high school I grew up with went off to work the trades or do jobs typical of males.  I dunno, I'm trailing on here.

Maybe a year, or two years ago I started to look at women differently.  Instead of just seeing a woman and thinking, ""hey maybe I should ask her out,"" I started paying attention to them more personally.  I started noticing the way they talked, inflections in their voice, the way the dressed, the way they laughed, carried themselves; their opinions and convictions, and something started to happen, but I didn't know it yet.

As an avid video-game player, I look back now and realize that for the past ten years or so, I've always created female avatars.  Any game with a custom-creator in it, I've gone female.  I just love being able to take a girl character and play the game.  To be honest here, when it came to armor costumes, I've never felt like being that ""horny twelve-year-old"" and dressing them in skimpy attire (sometimes though it's fun to experiment!) but I'd always pick conventional clothing/armor because I started to realize that, hey, that's what I would wear.  And I started making decisions in games (RPGs mostly) in according with how the girl I was playing would act.  And that slowly started to be my main thought whenever I played a game: can I play a female?  Because I don't like playing male characters anymore.

I've got shoulder-length blonde hair, which I started growing almost two years ago, and when no one else is in the house I'll go into the bathroom and play with it and see how it looks.  I've considered buying scrunchies to keep it up in certain ways but then I think when my mother or father arrives home I'd have to let it fall down back to an acceptable, traditional look.

I'd love to try makeup (eyeshadow and eyeliner is something I've always wanted to try).

I think about shaving and having a nice smooth body.  I've tried to picture myself more feminine.

I don't know where else to go with this.  I'm scared and thinking is it a phase or is this something I'm serious about.  I have an appointment with a psychiatrist soon but I haven't even asked them if they specialize in these issues, or how I should approach things.  

I don't know.  I'm at a fucking loss.  Just thought I'd post here for the first time as it seems like you folks are good people.

I've browsed a dozen or so topics here, and so far it's help alleviate some of my anxiety.  If this is what dysphoria feels like then I guess I'm in the thick of it.

If anyone has any links to additional reading material too it'd be great.

Any and all words are welcome.  Thank you.

What I find hardest to deal with is when I'm friends with someone, and they tell me something like ""I'm OK with you, but my boyfriend finds trans people uncomfortable"". Then they rapidly fade from your life.

What I find hard to deal with is my wife saying - please make an effort to talk to my friend's husband, he is feeling a bit uncomfortable. 

When I see an old friend, and say hi, and they give you that weird look, and then you realize you're off their party list since you transitioned.

Like sure, I get that me transitioning can make people uncomfortable. Before I finally came out to myself, trans people made me uncomfortable too. My own trans status makes me uncomfortable. 

It's all so understandable. That's why I'm crying."

TheLovelyLorelei,asktransgender,Really vivid dreams from hrt (mtf)," I've always been the type of person who never dreams, or at least never remembers them. But since starting hrt (2.5months) I have been having absurdly vivid dreams every night. 

It has gotten to the point where I've written an essay that I just dreamt being assigned and have referenced conversations with friends that I later realized happened in my dreams. 

Is this something anyone else has experienced? It isn't really a problem,  but after never dreaming at all it's a weird change, and it's not something I've ever heard of as a side effect of estrogen or progesterone. "

I've been considering Matthew (Matt), Isaac (Zac), Tobias (Toby), Daniel (Danny), Bennet (Ben)."

HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,autogynephilia and worrying im not really trans,"just fyi: I made a post about my struggles with autogynephilia and worrying Im not trans but then i deleted it because the title felt too much like a lure, so i created a new one with the same (slightly edited for grammar and clarity) text and a more accurate title.  

i think what im about to write might be NSFL, i dont know but i truly dont want others to start thinking the way i do, its really depressing.  that said, if you're willing to face some views on autogynephilia--well i dont know how to word this without coming off in a way that i dont intend to; then carry on--but i want to give a sorry in advance for any painful thoughts i might unintentionally bring on you. 

that said, im writing because i am constantly trying to find reasons to explain why i might not be trans, and i wish i could stop.  why do i do this?  habit, i think. well, its not just habit.  not trying to toot my own horn, but i believe im smart enough to know that i should go with what makes me happy, but when autogynephilia feels like its all *my* transness is (like, in my case all my experience of being dysphoric and transgender is is just autoerotic transvestism + envy of female social roles...although i do get body dysphoria, but i dont consider that much probably because ive learned to be OK with male parts--not comfortable, just living with it, i think--but the dysphoria isn't enough to make me sure of myself, is what im saying) , i start looking for reasons i might not be trans (even though i want to be--see i feel i can't be a real girl if i get aroused by the thought of being feminine, and can't get past that thought most of the time--and even when i do get past that, i tend to fall back into it). 

i read things such as this (again, in my honest opinion, NSFL)  http://www.trans-health.com/2003/trans-people-are-we-nuts/ which is a light title and IMHO a good article, but it has some really heavy stuff in it.  specifically, the section on ""conditions [supposedly] mimicking GID"" trips me up and makes me worry Im not who i am, kinda. i mean, it both sounds silly to think i have the snow white syndrome, but at the same time it feels believable because envy and autogynephilia describe my current thoughts and feelings on being trans.  And although the fact that I worry makes me feel better about being trans.  Its so crazy, but the fact that i worry about not being trans means that i probably am trans, right?  Right, i think.  but the feeling of it being nothing but a fetish and envy lingers, perhaps because that feeling was rooted in me at such a young age by disparaging disgusting depictions of trans women in the media (drag queens and breast implants and botched face surgery, things that will scar a shy unsure kid like me for life).  so thinking that its just envy + autogynephilia kills me inside.  although the dysphoria exists, its not enough for me to feel comfortable transitioning (and im terrified of surgery, and have really binaric transphobic thoughts that i can't be a woman unless i have the proper parts--but i also wish i had the ""proper"" parts) 

i really dont want it to get to anyone else whose feeling similar to how i do, but i need to write this because i dont know what to do about this thought, how to get past it.    "

platypusoctopus25,asktransgender,A problem I faced when interviewing for a job,"A little background, I quit my software job I had for about two years over the summer when I started transitioning primarily because of depression and not wanting to have to come out to that particular company. I'm in my early 20s, MTF, living in Midwestern U.S. if that matters.

Presently, I'm applying for software engineering jobs again because I'm no longer depressed. I had my first on site interview after doing well on the engineering portion. I presented as male because I don't really pass yet. I told the recruiter I was transitioning and asked if I should say that, which she responded with, don't tell them personal things. I took her advice and told the interviewers ""personal reasons"" when they asked about the gap and felt that was too vague. Later they turned me down for not being a culture fit, and as someone with a feminine personality going for a male dominated field, I'm not sure how to interpret this. I'm now a little confused about how to go about my next interview with another company. Shouldn't I tell interviewers that I am transitioning so they at least know not to discriminate and so I can explain the gap better?

edit: grammar fixes
edit: thank you to everyone who has given their advice, it has helped me learn from this experience. :D"

Atgtw,asktransgender,Therapist can't make endo referral?,"In the past few months I've been thinking about starting hrt, and the therapist I had been seeing was supportive, and told me I would need to speak to an endocrinologist. After some searching I found someone recommended by several people on this sub who takes my insurance, but when I called, an automated message said that I would need a referral to make an appointment. When I asked my therapist about this, she said that's not something she could provide, and that it would need to come from my primary care physician. Unfortunately I don't have one at the moment, and it'll likely be sone time before I can get an appointment with one. What are my options? This seems like something she should be able to do.

ButterflyStomper123,asktransgender,I have a question about cis males going out in drag?,"So a while back I went to a party in drag. I went all out waxing, picking out my outfit, and having female friends helps me with makeup. I put so much effort into it that the people at the party (I didn't know anyone very well) all thought I was coming out as trans and were hyper supportive and very generous with compliments. It actually felt super good. I eventually got tired of explaining to everyone that I wasn't trans and just went along with it for the night and had a super good time.

This came up in conversation at my college and I pulled up the pictures of me in drag and showed everyone for a laugh. One person (cis female) got incredibly upset and told me that me dressing in drag as a goof was no different than a white man dressing in black face and that any transperson who saw me and knew I was doing it as a joke would be similarly offended. 

I was wanting to go out like that again, but if it is really that offensive I don't want to make an already marginalized group feel even worse. Is this actually the equivalent of going out in black face? Am I really being that offensive? "

Repairman13,asktransgender,Is it misogynistic to look at other women.,"So, for starters I am trans/nonbinary, assigned male at birth, non transition.

I know that misogyny and sexism have more to do with social power than with personal thoughts and feelings, and, seeing as how I present as male, I wonder if looking at other women is in any way misogynistic.
 What I mean is, when men stare at other women's body parts, breasts, legs, asses, etc, it is a way of objectifying and sexualizing them. 

When I find myself looking at women in that way, it is more along the lines of wishing I had those features, and picturing myself and how they might make me look. My question here is, is there a distinction between objectifying and sexualizing women in the way men often do, and my imagining how I might look with similar features. Or, is it simply another way of reducing women to their body parts.

I know of course that intentions do not factor in when it comes to upholding misogyny etc. And I feel as though when women admire each other, even in a non sexual way, but in terms of how good they might look, it is more from an empowerment perspective. But does the fact that I was assigned male at birth, and mass as male grant me a certain amount of social capital or power and completely change the context. Thank you in advance for those who respond."

timallender94,asktransgender,I don't care what gender I am. Whats up with that?,"Hi Beautiful People.
So, this isn't so much of a question, more of, like, I just need to talk to people who may 'get it'.
A little about me... My name is Tim, I'm 22, I was born Male and live my life as a Male and I'm also gay (which I realised when I was 10). 

Over the past year or so I've been thinking a lot about my gender, like I said I currently identify as male but I've never been masculine at all. I never played in the dirt, I used to wear my mums clothes and shoes, I had barbies as a kid and now as an adult half of my wardrobe I got from the 'Female' section of the store (Also I Rock a pair of heals). But I dont feel like I do this too look or feel female, its more I see something pretty and I wear it regardless of what gender has been assigned to it. 

After a year of thinking about my gender I've come to realise that I just don't care about what gender I am, well, maybe don't care is the wrong phrase, Its more like if I'm comfortable and happy to like as a male, but if I magically transformed into a woman over night, I feel like I would be fine with it and just carry on living life. 

Does any one else feel this way/know someone who does/have heard about it before?

LooseyLewd,asktransgender,"Any other circus tranimals out there, how has transition played out in your performance?","Hey y'all, so I have been a circus creature making my living gigging as a juggler, unicyclist, stilt walker, clown, mime for the better part of the last decade. I started my transition about six months ago, and it's been a very interesting experience for me to see not only my ""real"" self shift as I transition, but also the parallel shift in my stage persona. 

The first thing I did was immediately kill my old stage identity. It wasn't hard, because I kind of hated the person I was on stage, which isn't surprising since he was just an exaggeration of the false ""boy"" personality I'd created as a defense mechanism. 

I went pretty heavily into clowning, which was a really liberating experience. I use a very pretty and delicate clown face, with very cute and girly costumes, so right away I felt so comfortable and confident. Big surprise right? I finally found the strength to be my authentic self, and turns out that's actually a pretty nice feeling!

Several other performers who I really admire have mentioned that my stage presence, delivery and confidence have gone way up, and I'm definitely having better shows than ever before. 

This may be totally in my head, but I also feel like I have felt a shift in the way I approach my skills. I think HRT has really helped me to relax, so even though I might have lost a little muscle, I'm finding myself much more fluid in my juggling, and more comfortable than ever on the unicycle. I even managed to nail a really difficult trick that has eluded me for years (it's called a seal role, and involves rolling from a seated position onto your stomach and back to your butt all while balancing a juggling club on your nose).

I don't mean to make it sound like it's all been amazing.. I've had to stop taking a lot of work because I don't feel safe showing up alone to a strangers event, especially in the South... but anyway just wanted to share some of the positive things that I've experienced, and hoping to hear from some other performers."
dafeda,asktransgender,How much of passing depends on the clothes you wear and/or mannerisms?,"Bit of a tricky one. I actually don't like the term passing (I prefer read, since I'm not trying to fool anyone into thinking I am a woman since I'm one already), but that aside how much of passing is influenced by clothes and mannerisms?

I've tried being a hyper-fem woman when I've gone out and out, but it doesn't feel completely comfortable to me, largely because I feel constrained by expectations of ladylike behaviour or some such. I feel like that's a ridiculous standard to expect, as cis women have literally fought for hundreds of years to express themselves in a way they choose. We all know plenty of cis women who act pretty masculine in their mannerisms. I guess it's not wrong to feel like I don't want to change most of my mannerisms then, even if I'd pass better if I did? I'm by no means a macho grizzly bear, but I guess I'd like some clarification about what sorts of small, potentially easy to change mannerisms influence how someone's gender is perceived too.

In terms of clothes... I dunno, I feel like I'd be read as female if I tried to blend in with the clothes women my age wear. I've dabbled a bit in things like gothic lolita, but other than that the rest of my ordinary style choices tend to be things I have seen on cis women of a similar age, but only rarely. Stuff that's a bit on the eccentric/stylish end of the spectrum (I wear long skirts and occasional vintage dress for example). I'm not even entirely sure what I'm asking here, but I guess I'd like to be thought of as a slightly eccentric, well-dressed woman rather than just a crossdressing man. Is that even possible too?"
bashfultransboi,asktransgender,Anyone have experience with open letters? (read: anyone else want to punch the USA in the throat?),"Just a quick about me before I toot my horn: I’m Simon, I’m a transgender man, I’ll be 21 next month, and I live in Iowa in the United States.

The United States’ glory days are over and they have been for some years now. I’m sick of talking about it, but other countries watched our election from a distance, cringing  almost as much as I did at  each development.

I don’t want to live in my country anymore because I am not “Proud to Be an American”. I never have been. We live by morals scribbled on an old piece of paper by a bunch of old white dudes, making minor changes here and there to warp the meaning of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

I want to pursue my happiness, and the definition of my happiness is simple: I want people to refer to me as a man. I want to look more like how I see myself as a man. I want a good job where I don’t have to fight for the basic human right of respect of my own identity. I want to be so financially stable that taking myself to a check up at the doctor’s isn’t something special that I have to put money aside for, as if making sure I’m not dying faster than other humans is a form of spoiling myself, as if it’s a gift, a privilege and not a right.

I know that I am part of a “blessed” generation. Those older than me “weren’t so lucky” to have the technology, transportation, and education I have now. We’re young, immature, stupid, we don’t grasp reality, they are fearful of when “one of us” takes office. They never cease reminding us that we don’t deserve what we have. They’ve never stopped punishing us for what they have accomplished and we are benefiting from.

But you know what? I’m only 20 years old, and I am thousands upon thousands of dollars in debt. And maybe my parents were at my age but the economy was different then, and so was the job market. I don’t know the last time I had a clean bill of health. I went to college only to be washing dishes in the back of restaurant when I know that I’m talented and wish to be doing something more. I’m not going to spell out all of the reasons why just to have someone come along and tell me that it’s all my fault, that I deserve this, “welcome to the real world/adulthood”, they’ve had worse and they had to deal with it without shoes in the snow, uphill both ways.

I am so over everyone older than me trivializing what I and many others are going through, as if we deserve it. It has been a long road to self-acceptance in a world where I was raised to believe that to have a differing opinion was to be disrespectful. It has been painful, enduring the cycle of figuring myself out, allowing everyone to force me into thinking I’m insane, and then forcing myself to accept that I am right in this situation and it is perfectly correct for me to be.

I just got approved for Medicaid. I was so excited. For the past 10 years of my life, one of the few things I’ve wanted were braces for my teeth. I know they hurt. I’ve had them before but the dentist was shit and my mouth is even fuglier than when we started. I’ve wanted to see someone about my asthma, a condition I’ve been forced to learn through much error will kill me if I do not get help. I thought Iowa was just a tad more progressive on trans rights but come to discover that even now, in the present, Iowa still does not recognize transgender people as we ought to be or offer coverage for medical procedures because somehow it’s still only cosmetic or experimental.

I want to write an open letter to express my utter disdain when it comes to the healthcare I’m offered but I am afraid to make myself a target. I’m not blind like some. American society acts as if there aren’t groups of people looking to exterminate other groups of people, as if revolution doesn’t exist anymore or we don’t need it, or that the constitution is all we’ll ever need. As if the media isn’t complete and total bullshit, and whatever anyone says on the Internet is true.

Transgender people, to me, are living, breathing proof that change is necessary, it’s imperative.

I’m unhappy because I am being prevented from pursuing my happiness. I want to escape this place but I can’t afford it. 

Either other countries need to start a rehoming initiative to aid transgender people in leaving this fucking cesspool of a country, or someone needs to say something. Maybe that someone is me, but I’m scared.

Is it worth my while to try to write an open letter stating the issues with my healthcare, or should I go back to trying to figure out how to get myself out of this hell hole?

colesss,asktransgender,Thinking of purchasing a set of breasts for my partner...,"My partner is in transition and I was thinking of buying a set of different sized prosthetics breasts for them for Christmas. I have some concerns and questions regarding.


1) Is this too personal of an idea? Is this something that really needs to be done by my partner as they progress in their mental and physical transition? I know that they don't have a lot of money after treatment and etcetera.


2) If I do purchase a set, are there recommendations on where or what kinds? My partner currently has a pair that they were given and are not 100% happy with (too firm maybe or too big). I'd like to give them a variety to play with and see what fits them. I also don't have a ton of money so I can't buy super expensive ones.


3) They are currently wearing a sports bra to keep their current prosthetics breasts in place. The bra is pretty thick and doesn't really provide a lot of give. I was thinking about purchasing a lace bralette for them. Are there reasons this would not be a good idea? Is the firmness of a sports bra necessary to keep everything in place?

Bit of a rant, but I needed to rant about this. I see so many other women with tragically small eyebrows, and I'm like ""awww... but so long as you're happy, I guess"", because of my own personal taste.

The world needs more eyebrows.

...Ok, I'm in public and needed to empower myself a bit."
[deleted],asktransgender,Please explain gender identity,"Im really confused about this. I understand trans people have the desire to change their physical gender which i think is totally normal. I think much of the world would be interested to see if/how the other genders experience is and trans people just have a largr desire for that experience and want to change permanently. I get that they might long for the other genders body but i dont understand the concept of gender identity. Im a male myself but if i never saw i had a penis i would never know im male. 

Theres no inner telling in me of my gender, i like women but so do lesbians, so that wouldnt help me acertain my gnder. The only reason i can tell im male is because i have male genitalia which is an external sign. Yet i see many trans discussion about feeling lie a man or woman. I dont know how they feel 1 or the other. 

I have never lived as a woman so i  have no idea what it feels like. I just have my own single experience, that apparently is male and is completely different to a womans. I dont 'feel' male and there would be no way for me too, if i couldnt see my penis. Please explain to me because im really confused about this."
OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,I haven't made any real effort towards becoming more feminine. Part of me feels like I'm slacking off and being lazy. Thoughts?,"I've been seeing a therapist, and am about to have a discussion with both my Dad and therapist about Medical transition, and the possibility of being referred to as a girl and presenting as myself at home. 

That's all fine and jolly. But I have never done a single thing in my life to look or feel more feminine. I'm nearly 300 pounds, I let my facial hair grow out, and I've never shaved my body hair. I'm disgusting, and I hate my body, but I haven't done anything about it.

I could start openly shaving my body after talking with my Dad. I mean I don't care what kids at school think and I'm coming out to my friends. But what's the point if I'm not on HRT and it'll grow back?

I don't own a single piece of female clothing and have never dressed up. I've never wore makeup.  None of that stuff. 

I feel like these things dont matter until boymode starts to fail when I'm on HRT, but maybe as soon as I start on HRT I'll start caring about my appearance.

I know I won't become the woman I want to be and get a boyfriend over night, but right now I just don't feel it necessary. 

I know I need to loss weight and intend to, but aside from that,I don't really see the point in starting things yet when I'm not on HRT. is this a bad mentality?

I just dongs wanna be stuck a few months into HRT at a point where I'm too masculine to fix things."
QueerScaling,asktransgender,DAE have a letter they used to come out at work that I can barrow from?,"Hello all, 

I am trans (yeah!) and finally get to come out at work. I work for a pretty conservative bank in an undisclosed part of the NW. My boss knows I'm trans and so does Hr and they're cool with it but I still work with people who have little experience with LGBTQ people.

Basically I'm hoping to send a email or to my work group that tells them just enough to understand without getting to personal. I have also asked HR to send an email saying what's happening what's changing and what's ok and not ok to my work group.

Any advice or sample letters would be greatly appreciated especially if you have done this before!

-Stay lovely!"

PossibleMTF1,asktransgender,How to see a gender therapist under the guise of a regular therapist?,"My plan was to see a gender therapist by trying to sneak some money out of my account for a couple sessions at least. This is due to not being ready to talk about it w/ my parents and as a result I can't use their insurance. However I also have pretty bad social anxiety and they want to send me to a regular therapist to deal w/ it. I've been told by others to talk your parents into a therapist by telling them you have issues such as anxiety, etc but wouldn't that just get you into a general therapist? How do you do that and get into one that specializes in gender issues w/out them knowing?"
Nin_Nin_Nin,asktransgender,I don't know how or if to start,"Hello, I'm a 22 y/o man currently. I'm struggling to make this, to put things into words, but I wanted to try so here it goes. 

People say they know they were a man or women inside, but it's never something I considered until recently. Frankly, I've ignored it. I've never had a good grasp on my emotions, on what I want, or aspire for. Do I think I am feminine? Yes, without a doubt. Do I think I'm a woman? Mostly likely, yes. But, do I want to become that woman on the outside? I truly, truly don't know. Because of this, I've ignored it for a long time. Honestly, it feels impossible. I can imagine the woman I dream of being, but it doesn't feel realistic. I also have an idea of what else is important in my life going forward, and I struggle to find the common ground between transitioning and achieving those goals. 

And most of all, I find the whole thing terrifying. I am so, so afraid of putting myself out there. If I was confident in myself, maybe things wouldn't be so bad. But I'm not, I waffle on everything, and I get discouraged easily. I don't want to back down on this, though, and if I'm transitioning, I want to be in 100%. I really need some help getting my confidence, and I would like some advice on what I can do to start testing the waters. I've been growing out my hair, but I don't know what else I can do without raising any suspicions."
mtftransthroweaway,asktransgender,"""Do what makes you happy"" ~ Is this bad advice albeit with a good heart?","One of the things I often heard when I came out to friends and family was:

""That's great!  You need to do what makes you happy, and if this makes you happy, then I'm on board :)""

This response is heartfelt, sincere and appreciated.  However, I think the advice of ""do what makes you happy"" or ""do what feels good"" is a bit reductive when it comes to understanding what it means to be trans.

Exhibit A: If we all did what makes us happy / feels good, Heroine would be a great thing to do.

Obviously there's more to this trans thing than happiness or feelings.  Something more fundamental than feelings. 

What do you think 'this' is if it's not a feeling?"
ChartedB,asktransgender,Haircut,"Hey guys,
16 y/o FTM hereand getting my haircut sometime this week. Last time I had a haircut my parents didn't take it well at all. For the past few months, I've been wanting to cut my hair again since it was getting too long and my friends kept bringing it up. I've gotten so tired of my hair that I actually am deciding to cut it this week. The problem is I'm scared of what's gonna happen when I get back home and my parents see me with my haircut. I made a post about this before a couple of months ago and I did get advice.
But now I just wanna know what I'm gonna say/do once I get back home. I'm scared to get kicked out again &amp; i'm scared of what my parents are gonna say to me."
excesshollywoo,asktransgender,I don't think I will ever see my MTF friend as 100% woman because I knew her pre-transition. Is that okay?,"
Or should I end the friendship? I use the pronouns, I've corrected friends/family, we have a strong friendship otherwise, but I just don't think I will ever see her as a complete woman as she wants to be. I feel bad because I support her completely otherwise, but the memories I have before the transition are simply still there.

It's been 5 years now. I knew her previously to that for 4 years. I've known her more now as a woman. 

Maybe I'm over-thinking this? Thoughts? 

ETA: I am a cisgender male."
LisaXavier,asktransgender,A grab bag of questions: please see inside.,"OK, so...here's a quick bio/level set.  I'm 37 MTF, not on HRT (by choice), presenting female full time at work since August.  Only presenting male on the weekends when necessary &amp; in the evenings if I leave the house after getting home &amp; taking all my make up off.  Currently engaged, no kids, out to pretty much all family/friends.

Here come the questions...

1.) I haven't started LHR.  I do want to, but I am a bit scared of doing so.  Is it worth it not to have to fight the beard shadow everyday?

2.) I have considered/still considering HRT in the future.  However, I am afraid of the thought of being on it and getting stuck in the middle.  What I mean by this is the case of HRT doing what it's going to do &amp; the transition not being enough.  Have any of you been down this path, can you offer some in site or words of wisdom?

3.) I was recently on vacation at Disney, and I saw a LOT of people.  Something that dawned on me was the thought of being the old woman.  Not necessarily a thought that I enjoyed, and it made me question whether or not HRT would be worth having.  You know, the do I want to be that person in another 30 - 40 years?  Have any of you dealt with that?

4.) When is it proper/necessary to correct a co-worker who is using the wrong pronouns?  The co-worker is new to the company, &amp; only knows me as/has seen me presenting female, but I noticed them using he while chatting today.

5.) Does padding really matter?  I pad my hips to give me a more fem curve, &amp; I really like the shape it gives me.  However, I don't really like the hassle that comes with it, of having to readjust the padding after each trip to the restroom.  I am just afraid that if I don't use it I'll look more awkward than I feel I already do. :\

6.) My voice sucks, and I feel completely dumb trying to train it into a better one. :\  Halp! :)

That should be enough for now.  Thanks to anyone who reads/replies.

Snickledizzle,asktransgender,"Starting HRT (MtF) in early January, have a Cancun trip planned in late April. How much trouble will I be in?","Hey, so I will be having my first appointment with the doctor January 3rd. I don't know much about the dosages or medications he would prescribe but he is a doctor specific to this field and comes with good recommendations.

Also my wife and I, and two of our very close couple friends are going to Cancun in late April - early May. These are people we go boating with in the summer so they've seen me with my shirt off multiple times. My wife and one of the girls knows about me and my GD. The other 3 (including the two guys, one of which is my best guy friend and a super religious conservative pastor's son) have no idea.

So that will be, what, maybe about 4 months of HRT? What should I expect, and will they be able to notice (based on typical, average effects and I know everyone is different)? And is it possible that it could get to the point where me not wearing a shirt or a top would illegal? And to put their viewpoint on me in perspective, I'm the strong, athletic sporty one so even more of a shocker.

Trying to figure out if I could get away with it or not, or if should weigh not telling them and trying to hide it or telling them in advance, which in the worst case would jeopardize this already schedule and paid for vacation.

Thanks for the help!"
abbxrdy,asktransgender,[mtf] Just got setup for HRT and would like an opinion about my regimen.,"Had my second endo visit yesterday. Went over the labs and everything was perfect. Doc perscribed 25mg spironolactone and instructed to take two at one time every day, so 50mg spiro daily. Also proscribed estradiol valerate solution for injection, 20mg/mL. Instructed to inject 0.5mL every week. So that's 10mg estradiol valerate every week. 

New blood work was ordered, and instructed to have it done a week or two before the next follow up visit. Was told to have the blood drawn one day before an injection. Follow up interval is 3 months. 

Doc said estrogen target was to get it to ~200 pg/mL, testosterone &lt; 58 ng/dL. I inquired about 5α reductase inhibitors for hair loss issue. Doc didn't think I had any significant hairloss. Wife also says she can't tell. I think they both need new glasses. It's standard issue stage II MPB. http://imgur.com/a/KHFqk I do shed wimpy little piss ant hairs off my temples all the time. Doc said she thinks the estradiol and spiro should stop any hairloss in its tracks and that I should just watch it and see what happens. She didn't want to perscribe any finasteride right now, but would next visit if I want it. 

Should I ask for finasteride or dutasteride regardless? When should I inquire about progesterone, if at all? I wasn't comfrotable asking about that during my visit. Should I ask to add a DHT test to my lab order sheet? 

I got my spiro filled, and needles. Waiting for the estradiol to wind its way to me through the mail. Can't take anything yet as I have to bank first. That's next week. Depending on how that goes, I might have to do it twice. Might not get to start until next year. All this waiting isn't fun. It's taken me 6 months to get to this point. 

tl;dr
50mg spiro daily, inject 10mg estradiol valerate every week, can get finasteride next visit if I want it"

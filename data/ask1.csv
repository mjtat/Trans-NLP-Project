delightcocoa,asktransgender,Has anyone else felt this way about dysphoria and gender?,"Hi

Bit of a loaded question really since given the size of our community I'm sure someone else has.

I've really struggled trying to find a way to express how I felt about my own gender issues. I've had them for years and years now, but at the same time I've rarely showed outward evidence of femininity in my daily life. My parents are quite suspicious of my desire to transition because of this. Despite how I might look I'm not always the most feminine person but I know that if I chose to take pride in my appearance then I'd definitely wear feminine clothes.

I don't quite feel 100% female, or even 100% male for that matter; I'm either a bit of both or neither. But honestly I'd much rather be perceived as female in day to day life than male and guess I feel like my life could be better and more true to myself as a woman. Having breasts feels ""right"" somehow.

On the times I have worn more masculine clothes or grown out my facial (more for necessity than anything else--my face hates being regularly shaved!) I've just felt like my body isn't my own. Honestly it feels like I've had such a poor awareness of what I actually look, act or sound like for years. I tend to daydream and spend large amounts of time ""in my own head"", which might be one reason why I have problems with disorganization and lack mindfulness. One hypothesis I've thought up is that my brain has blocked recognition of myself to kind of spare me the truth. 

That sounds a bit too dramatic perhaps, but I think there's still truth in it. Now that I've made up my mind to transition fully this year I feel overwhelmed by the thousands of things that I need/may need to do and gender dysphoria has hit me *big* time (mostly in feeling massively jealous of cis women I work with). I've been down this road before to some extent, and every time I've made progress on trans issues it feels like this dysphoria comes screaming at me and has caused me endless problems in my work and personal life. So I *have* to get it sorted by transitioning.

Shockingpink13,asktransgender,Going Out of My Comfort Zone?,"Hi everyone, I have a question for you all today.  One thing that my therapist and I often talk about is coming out of my comfort zone.  I love trying new things, telling her about what I did, and posting about it on here.  I'm not on hormones yet, just to let you all know.

In the past I have bought dresses in public, and I have worn dresses in public.  But I'm not sure what else I can do.  The reason that I do things like this is because it's great for self-discovery, not to mention confidence.

Do the rest of you all have any suggestions on what I can do to go out of my comfort zone and explore my transness?

Thanks!"
MattyMe81,asktransgender,Transition 2017,"I just have a few questions. I am finally starting my transition this year. 

Questions
1: when I start estrogen will my a libido be completely crazy? I am on testosterone injections now and I'm going to stop them.

2. What all will the estrogen help me with as far as body. Hair, facial hair, etc.?

3. I am balding, so I will have to wear wigs. Will I look fake?

Anything else I might need to know, y'all let me know.

Thank Kassandra."
Jazz8680,asktransgender,How many of you are pursuing Doctorate degrees with the intent of becoming a college professor?,"This has been my career goal for a long time. I'm almost done with my undergrad. All of these trans feelings recently clicked and a bunch of memories unrepressed themselves. I was hoping there might be others here with similar career goals. I'm trying to fight off this weird feeling that if I am trans, I won't be able to find a teaching job or even finish my degree. 

These fears completely irrational, I know, but I'm still scared for some reason. "

whyyougottabesoDude,asktransgender,Is it possible to be trans even though I've truly liked my life this far?,"Reading a lot about gender dysphoria and online tests re: transgender identity. I realize that while I (AMAB) have recently begun intermittently fantasizing about being a woman, I don't have any negative feelings about my life prior to these fantasies. 

I actually really like my life, and would call myself a happy person, and find a lot of meaning and joy in the things I do and relationships I have. 

But for some reason I've recently been imagining what life would be like if I were a woman. See a dress, wonder how I'd look in it. Would want to look nice so I'd need a more feminine silhouette, and so then I wonder what my options are for that. I'm still not unhappy with my body at all but at the same time, the idea of exploring a feminine body is exciting. But I don't know why. I'm not sure if it is sexual I can't really tell. I generally like my penis quite a bit except when it's being difficult. But I'm sure I would want to be attractive as a woman, because I think I am attractive as a man.

Has anyone felt this way before realizing they were Trans? 

Is there something I can  read online to help myself understand these things? Is there another forum I should be looking at? 

Thank you very much for your patience.

Without make up i get a few looks ocassionaly anyway is my point...would someone who passes in San Francisco, Pass in somewhere more conservative?

Olivia_DAHLING,asktransgender,"My libido is increasing on estrogen! And so is my dysphoria. (A little NSFW, I guess)","I've been on HRT since July, and I've noticed an increase in my sexual thoughts.  I was never really all that sexual, I guess it was a combination of low testosterone and not feeling comfortable with myself.  I've never *hated* my penis, it was really the test of my body that I took issue with.

Now that I'm on estrogen, though, my sex drive is getting stronger little by little.  The only problem is that when I think about sex, my penis is nowhere to be found.  I'm quickly going from considering never getting SRS to wishing I could just go get it this afternoon.

I could try some anal stuff, but I've done it in the past and it never quite satisfied me.  I'm starting to get more frustrated by it with every day that passes.

I guess my question is: whyyyyyyyyy?"
Throwawayforeskin17,asktransgender,Circumcision and SRS,"Hi Reddit. 

Been thinking about my identity recently and thinking I might be trans. I was getting really excited about it and imagining what it would be like to have srs and have sex as woman, then I read something which kicked me in the stomach.

Basically last year I was circumcised due to a case of phimosis. I wasn't questioning my gender then so I didn't factor SRS into the equation. Now I'm scared that I might not be able to get SRS done or even enjoy having sex as a woman :(.

Ladies, do you know if there's still hope? Even if there is enough there for surgery, would I be able to get any enjoyment or stimulation and be able to orgasm?

wwhhyyhhiiddee,asktransgender,A few questioning questions,"I’ve really started questioning things as of late. In the past, I’ve pondered about how I’d feel being the opposite gender, but my conclusion was always “any desire I have to be the opposite gender is likely due to some misguided belief that it would magically solve all my problems.” But then recently, I was doing some random introspection and thought, “what if becoming the opposite gender doesn’t have to magically solve all my problems, but it just makes me happy? Isn’t that enough?” It was like I had been staring at an optical illusion incorrectly the whole time and suddenly I started seeing things from a different (and perhaps correct) angle, freaking out, etc. I’ve always had super low esteem and a negative body image, I’ve always disliked my face and body (not necessarily what’s between my legs though), and when I think of what I could do to achieve an appearance that makes me happy, I can’t think really think of anything with my current gender, just some unattainable attractive image of the opposite gender. These are pretty recent developments so I’m not making any rash decisions. And sure, combing through my life experiences and such, there have been some potential signs, but I know it’s possible I’m just looking for anything that could be used as possible evidence. Still, a few of random questions came to my head, and I was wondering if people could answer them.

1. I already see a therapist for depression. However hesitant, I know I will have to bring up my above concerns with them eventually, even if I’m not actually trans. Would I likely get switched to a therapist who deals specifically in gender issues? I’m fairly positive my depression isn’t solely due to gender identity stuff, and I quite like my current therapist, so I was just wondering.

2. People who have siblings of the same gender that they’re/they’ve transitioning/transitioned to: I know HRT is a process, but did you eventually find yourself looking similar to your siblings of that gender? The idea of possibly being trans is pretty scary, but tbh transitioning and looking like my siblings of the opposite sex is almost just as scary (in a bad way).

3. Is it possible to not think you were assigned/born the wrong gender at birth, but maybe that you’re just better suited to live life as the opposite gender?

Thanks. I lurk on here once in a while, and it always seems like this is a great and helpful community.

SelfLoving91,asktransgender,General cost of getting a name change in Ohio,"I'm trying to move forward with this, money's tight and still is for someone's dysphoria who gets in the way of working.

Unfortunately information is really vague and limited and I want to make sure I have the right amount for it.

$70 - Filing Fee
$84.00 - Court Fee
$21.50? (Birth Certificate Copy)

$32.60 (Newspaper Article for the specific newspaper, asked them)

So as of right now, I need around $208-209

This isn't factoring transportation services, I'm doing those costs separately. Probably will have to gather some money to hire uber drivers to take me to the court and other area for my birth certificate copy...

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone had any experience in Ohio and what the costs were for them to change their name without including the newspaper costs so I can figure out how much extra money I should take with me."
HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,How do i improve self worth and not 'settle for less',"TL;DR first to avoid thumb exercise scrolling :P --i have two reasons to believe i have horrid self worth.  

* 1, im very submissive socially, and it feels like i have a sort of dog-ish begging attitude when it comes to social relations, without trying. like the only way to get mens attention is to beg, as its how i came to see myself i think, probably from getting mentally beat down and shunned by men and from trying to be one and epicly failing (in the bedroom yes sure im submissive, tho im probably switch, but that's different)
* and 2, i feel dumb. like, unable to socialize and do things, and doubt myself and such.


I've realized i have a very disparaging view of myself, which probably started around kindergarten.   i tried so hard to fit in with the jocky guys during elementary school, but never did.  i came to see femininity as bad and taboo and submissive, as 'this is what you are if you're not man enough to be a man', but yet its what i naturally seem to like (though i doubt myself, doubt that my personal transness is any more than autogynephilic arousal--despite agreeing that ray blanchard's theories are bunk--hell they dont even account for bi- to pansexuality, which i think i might be in some form)

i really believe i related my femininity with mental retardation, and now i can't progress mentally and emotionally and socially.  maybe this sounds crazy, but hear me out, if you want to. since coming out, and going to see 4 different therapists, ive been unable to access my emotions, and been unable to follow things socially, when interacting with the therapist.  its like i somehow block my awareness to somehow protect myself from being myself, which is totally insane but i think its what i do so that i will keep being what my dad expected of me, what friends thought of me, what society demanded of me.  and the interesting thing is, 3 of 4 therapists have suggested i have aspergers.  now, maybe i do, that's entirely possible, but there are a few reasons i dont think i do.  

* for one, im not the same as i was before coming out.  ive changed mentally--a *lot*. took antidepressants, those fogged my brain, am on hormones--cant really feel how they affect me other than slightly more sensitivity on the rare occasions that i feel emotional reactions, and just had some terrible experiences with marajuana before coming out (which i have since stopped using) 
* for another, all my relatives that ive asked have said that i didn't seem to have aspergers. in fact, my cousin in-law (i forget the technical term for that) works with people diagnosed with aspergers, and she said that i dont have any of the traits. she believes its just social anxiety. 

so that, and seeing how other cis women are, have made me realize that i dont value my self worth at all, and i would like to change that. "
Lost1inmy1mind,asktransgender,I have a serious SRS question FTM,"I personally believe that for myself getting bottom surgery would only exacerbate my dysphoria.

AmeliaVoyax,asktransgender,I dont understand myself? [Discussion/advice help],"Alright so hello.

kiDsALbDgC9QmLFiIrrj,asktransgender,Has anyone been reading Brynn Tannehill's work?,"Because a lot of her articles, like [8 Reasons Why Democracy in America is Probably Done](http://www.brynntannehill.com/eight-reasons-why-democracy-in-america-is-probably-done/), [Drums in the Deep](http://www.brynntannehill.com/drums-in-the-deep/) and [Choose your own Dystopia](http://www.brynntannehill.com/choose-your-own-dystopia/) have really articulated how I e felt since the election.

Mainly, that we're completely screwed as a community, and that there's really nothing we can do to prevent what Tannehill has termed a ""cultural genocide"" of trans people.

blargulous,asktransgender,HRT experiment,"So... this just got real...
I've been on hrt for 2 weeks now as an experiment and I'm looking for some research to confirm my findings. Basically my anxiety and depression have been taken down about five notches each and I can feel normal emotions again, it's wonderful! As a downside my mood swings are now huge. I almost cried because someone gave me a compliment. Before I couldn't cry at all.

But, is there even any evidence to support this? Is it really as simple as: ""feel better? you're trans. feel worse? you're cis.""? Is it just a placebo? I'm not even sure it's working since I've experienced only minimal physical effects. I think my skin might be softer? Body hair is just as prominent, libido is unchanged (still zero), My non-boobs don't hurt.

More worryingly, shit just got real. I'm not strong. I don't think I can transition. I mean I can't really be a man either; I've skated by this far on luck, mostly.

Anyways, how do your experiences compare?

Also it'd be SUPER helpful if any cis-men who've taken hrt could chip in.

feelinqueer,asktransgender,What to realistically expect from HRT?,"**EDIT: This is for MtF. Sorry for confusion!**

I know that HRT is a YMMV type thing, but I wanted to ask a few more details than just the typically stated things like soft skin, breasts, fat redistribution, etc.

The more specific questions I'd to like to ask about:

1: Is there a change in vein definition? I have horribly pronounced veins, especially my hands which to say the least causes a good amount of dysphoria for me...

2: Muscle mass, does it start to decrease considerably just being on HRT? Or will it require dieting for it? My neck especially (which is quite thick... D':) is very bothersome to me (among so many other places but you get the point).

3: I know that fat will be redistributed to more of your legs, butt, and to your breasts, but how much does this really change you? My butt looks nothing like a cis-woman butt, even those who are lean and have a similar amount of mass as me, is this more to do with bone structure or fat distribution?

4: How much does your body hair change? This seems especially YMMV dependent but I have cis-girl friends that have no visible body hair besides lower legs, arm-pits, and pubic area, and these are butch girls who do no shaving or anything, is it common to get to this little amount of body hair once on HRT for a while even if I have visible dark hair on most of my body? (The amount of time I spend shaving is unreal). Will that all eventually become peach fuzz/generally unnoticeable like most cis-girls?

5: Does your voice and facial hair really not change at all? I understand the voice situation and how that works so I am mostly expecting that yeah no voice change but figured I would ask. With Facial hair however, I would think that there would be at least some difference... I have heard so many trans girls say that they notice no difference in facial hair? It doesn't even grow lighter or slower? I have to shave my face everyday to not have obvious dark patches and twice a day if I want to keep it like that for the day, and my face is sensitive so that is really hard on it. (and I don't even have that much facial hair) Is that something that won't change at all once on HRT not even slowed growth? I know I'll pretty much have to get Electrolysis eventually, but I just wanted some shared experiences on that...

I am also very curious on the different mental changes that come along with HRT which sound like one of the best parts, but I am sure that it is too YMMV dependent to get a good expectation on what I can expect for myself...

I am prepared to just hear that all of these are still just YMMV, but I would at least like to hear some of your own personal experiences with the questions provided. Thanks so much!! &lt;3"
SaturdaySartre,asktransgender,Forms that require parents middle names?,I was filling out my legal name change application and I had to ask my mom for my dad's middle name. Now she wants to know what I'm filling out - what can I tell her other than the truth? Are there any other forms that require parents names?
Valoute,asktransgender,Never assume how people will react.,"I just wanna share this life event so that others that may not have come out yet may find the courage to do so. You may want to check my post history for some context, but, essentially, when I first came out to my mom, it didn’t go so well: I thought she would be accepting, but it proved to be quite difficult for her: she gave me quite the hard time, but I kind of understand why she all did it.

As for my father I thought he would never accept me and that he would mock me for wanting to be myself: a woman. Thing is, my perception was completely wrong.

My father is only home half of the year (he travels abroad for his job) so when he came back he noticed something was different about me: I wasn’t as energetic as usual, I wasn’t motivated, I never smiled... I love to paint and made a painting of a pink woman in a blue cage shaped like the body of man. When he noticed the painting he started to question it and well, since i’m not a good liar I was just all like ‘’Oh that.. it’s nothing *insert really convincing face*’’. Two days later, he came down in my room with my mom and closed the door: that moment, I knew shit was about to go down.

He told me he had a good idea of what the painting represented: that I was a woman trapped in a man’s body. I said nothing and just stared at the wall wondering if my mom had outed me. Then, he said it: my mom had not said a thing. Following his noticing of the painting he questioned her if anything was going on and inferred through her reaction, and mine,  that something was indeed at large. That caught me off guard because the painting had been there over the holidays (while my father was away) and no one else had made a thing of it, yet, he had. 

I still said nothing (I couldn't look him in the eye, I felt ashamed) as he went on on how I must have been having a hard time dealing with all of this: constantly thinking about it and not sleeping. Then, he went on naming the fears I had: What my friend’s would think of me, how it would affect my career, what I would end up looking like and if I would be accepted by my family. He then said, ‘’you probably thought of going abroad to transition and then come back haven’t you?’’. I smirked when he said that: I felt like he was reading my mind. 

He went on by saying that he didn’t give a crap if I wanted to be a woman, and that all that mattered to him was that I was happy no matter the cost. He told me that he would always love me, and that he’d walk every step of the way with me if that is what I wanted. He said that I could transition at home or, if I preferred, that he would assist me in moving out and doing so in my own private space.

I still said nothing, completely caught off guard. Honestly, I still was afraid of admitting to my father that I wanted to be a woman, but he took my silence as me agreeing to everything he said, which I did. 

That’s when my mom chimed in: she told me that she would like me to see a therapist to answer any questions I had, and understand these feelings (even though I told her I knew what I felt and that I knew I was a woman). That’s when I spoke and told her just that: ‘’ I’ve told you many times, I have no doubts of what I feel, please stop doubting me’’. She replied what she always has by saying that maybe I was wrong. My father then told her that SHE was wrong in acting this way: that she needed to come to terms with what I was saying. I wasn’t looking for answers, I was searching for the path to get started in my transition. 

God, it felt so good to finally be understood.

My father then asked if it would be alright with me that he’d research for a therapist in my stead so that I could begin, and left with my mom. I just sat there in my chair still looking at the wall: that’s when a smile covered my face for the first time in weeks.

I learned that you should never assume how people will react, that you should give them the chance to do so: you never know!!

I wanted to joke back with a 'But... that's the point, right?' But too busy fighting back tears to manage it. 

Do people not get how crazy hurtful saying that is? Already worrying that you might lose what makes you you at your core along the way... And the only reason it seemed to happen with me is I'd been a little testy lately, what with starting to get transitioning going. Dealing with new emotions, and experiences, and life just generally being crazy anyways. All of which she was aware of.

Then, apparently fumbling over what to say to her when asked what was up, and telling her I didn't know how to word it any further right now. A problem that involves freaking out over your genitalia and other just unpleasant stuff is kinda hard to suddenly drop into casual conversation while out and about, even now for me.

Im in a shitty spot right now, and i cant afford a therapist to help me cope with all of the bullshit that goes on with my family while i transition. There is no light at the end of the tunnel here.

LoveIinus,asktransgender,Got bullied at an event today :(,"Today I'm supposed to volunteer for a sports event! We were supposed to be dressed in sports attire and I did, with no makeup. When I came in and sat down, I realised that a bunch of Malay girls (short hair and look like butch ladies) were pointing fingers at me and laughing at me. I caught on and gave them a stare. One of the girls looked at me and shouted ""what? Wanna fight?"" I ignored them, and I told this middle aged lady that ""those bunch of girls are bullying me"" please note that I've been helping them out for quite a number of events so I know them pretty well! She told me to just ignore those kids because kids like this are stereotypically known as delinquents or people who don't study and are drop outs, causing troubles everywhere in my country. But I got so riled up. I did nothing! 

I couldn't deal with it and got emotional, I cried, I screamed and I left. Soon after I dropped an email to the sports organization asking for these girls to be terminated and banned from joining future events. Bullying shouldn't be condoned! 

I feel pretty distraught. I'm at home now and I think I just wanna rest and get over it :( "
Patricia_W,asktransgender,Teeth and HRT,"Yes, again me, maybe I'm a hypochondriac, but a short time ago I read a text about how women's hormones give them worse teeth than men despite that women live healthier at average.

Since taking HRT (estradiolvalerate and cyproteronacetat) I feel that my teeth-gum has a bit lessened and I'm nervous cause all of this. My teeth were always really healthy but now I'm a bit worried. All posts I found in the search are about spiro but I don't take spiro so these posts don't help me."
zauraz,asktransgender,My Healthcare lied. Pain. Hopelessness,"Last Thursday I went to a regular meeting with my psychiatrist. I am going there to deal with my depression and the gender identity issues I have. I meant to have use it to help me deal with the depression whilst waiting for my referal for gender therapy to get resolved..

When searching for the referal I had to meet with two people. The psychiatrist I am currently having and a male doctor. To say the least that doctor was probably of the old guard and kept telling me how ""beautiful a boy"" I was and that I should find a relationship and have sex instead as me being a virgin apparently caused me to be insecure.  In essence he kept asking me why I was there and why I wanted to do things. I never knew how to reply to that and I still don't... He wanted me to stop being an introvert and that there was a ""happy boy"" beneath my cold exterior..

I have self-esteem issues to begin with and I am not sure in what I want except that gender therapy is the way forward. I think the insecurity showed here as he kept telling me this was irrevocable and that I should wait and think it over more but in the end told me they would send the referal.

When my therapist called in December about two - three months after initially meeting those two she told me they had sent my referal when I asked her. I agreed to meet with her for dealing with depression as a side thing and in general I felt that my existence got a bit more bearable as I would probably get it in march or something this year. Usually the waiting time is 6 months.

I was glad that I could maybe ""be a woman"" by 20 atleast.. Then I met her last thursday..... In the middle of our conversation she told me that they had not written it nor sent it yet and that the doctor I met had ASKED her to give me a time to meet.......

I did hold it back but I wanted to cry my eyes out there.. I got so fucking ANGRY at them and eh.. I kept on like nothing had happened and I have never liked being mad or scolding people so I just kept it locked in. I slowly noticed that I became more and more empty...

Walking from the meeting to the train station I passed a lake filled with ice. I had not really vented my frustrations in any way but the thought hit me of literally jumping into the lake hoping to die of the shock.... I lost my will to do anything... I know its ""just another 6 months of waiting"" but I had been living on the hope that I was getting closer to therapy those last months....

Getting home I was mad. I still held tears etc in but there was nothing left for me. My life essentially became meaningless... Probably I was stupid for putting so much onto that therapy.....

The therapist told me they would write the referal once the doctor came back which would earliest be next week... If I am sure that shitty doctor will probably stall it more because he has to ""protect my gender"" or some shit from faulty decisions.......

I made the maths friday night. 6 months more if sent next week putting my reply in june/july mid year... and then 1,5 years more wait for hormones...... I will be 21, maybe not so much more than 20 but I always felt shit for never being able to be a teenage girl and now I will be older than that.... and hormones will take years to fullfill the transition making me around 23 - 25 basically making any youth as a girl impossible....... I am losing my will to live in all honesty.... idk what to do anymore...

tl;dr My healthcare had lied about my referal for gender therapy delaying my transition for years (if I wanted it to begin with..)

rip2myyouthh,asktransgender,I cut my hair. Now what? (FTM),"So I finally cut my hair, to see if I'll feel comfortable. Since I'm not sure if I'm trans or not,experimenting is all I can do.

Hair grows and changes,I'll be able to style it better soon. Now,my question is how to make myself look more masculine? It's going to be hard since I'm only 13 and I'm turning 14 next Saturday,I look young. My eyebrows are shaped,which is another minus. I can't just go and buy men clothing or try men clothing..

IreneHolmes222,asktransgender,My rib cage... What can I do?,"So Im 5""8 tall, about 34 inches underbust, 35.4 inches bust (Pre hrt no boobs of course).

I used to think that my shoulders would be my biggest concern but recently I realize that my ribs will cause me more trouble... Maybe they are too big in size, maybe they are too outwards. And also because of this, I dont think my waist can get any much smaller, its already a little below my ribs so I guess Im just destined to be thick because of my rib cage....


So I wonder what your experience is with this? I know hrt wont make bones change, but maybe it can change the fat or muscles around the organs to some degrees? Ive seen people saying their rib measurement shrunk after HRT, but Im not really mascular so I dont know what to expect... And is there anything you can do other than corset training and surgery (im not considering doing these). Maybe yoga can help?


I think this might be the thing that can stop me from passing... Yes some women have big rib cages as well, but mine is honestly huge and bulky, and theres not much fat and muscles left around there ...  How can so many trans women have slim bone structures Im so jealous!"
PanTran420,asktransgender,"I got my HRT prescription today! I'm excited, but my mom seems less on board than she was before.","I just got back from my doctor's office with a prescription for HRT! This was my first appointment, so I didn't expect it to have the prescription in hand today, but apparently she was satisfied with everything on my end and works fast!

Unfortunately, it will be at least a few more weeks before I can actually start. I'm planning on banking sperm, and I want to get that accomplished first so I don't have to stop later. I figure I've waited this long to start, 2 or 3 weeks is not going to hurt anything.

I'm on cloud 9 right now, honestly. I had them call me my new name and update my pronouns, and I was nervous about it, but it felt right and even now kind of natural. 

I'm also still kinda nervous about starting. I'm not out at work or to anyone besides close friends and family, so I'm curious how long it will be before people start noticing changes. 

I'm also worried about how my mom has been reacting lately. My family is all very supportive, but as the time for HRT has drawn nearer, my mom has been constantly asking the, ""And you're sure this is what you want?"" question which really bugs me. There was also something in her voice that suggested she is still really worried about me transitioning. When I came out a year ago, both my parents were verbally very supportive. They have maintained that verbal support ever since, but I can't help but feeling like they are saying the right things, even though they might not necessarily feel the right things. I know they are worried about my future, they are both classic grade A worriers. 

In the end I know they love me, and that they would never do anything to intentionally hurt me, so I think it will just take time for them to come fully around to the idea. After all, they knew me as their son for 30 years before I came out. That's a lot of assumption to overcome.

All in all, a great day though! Now to research some online sperm banking options."
hibbleshibble,asktransgender,Taking a break from hormones for sperm production...,"I have a close friend who is currently setting the groundwork for a transition from male to female but is going to take a pause in order to freeze sperm for their loved one (for possible future children).

He's taking spirolactane and after his blood work he'll be stopping in order to create healthy sperm. Does anyone have any idea how long it might take someone to recover from those kind of hormones? Any advice?

pixilsaturn,asktransgender,Does anyone else let internet comments get to them WAY too much?,"I know people say to avoid the comments, but sometimes they sneak up. 

So I was recently watching Awesome Games Done Quick, a weeklong video game speedrunning marathon for charity. one of the commentators is a transwoman, she's really nice and I follow her on twitch now (even if im always working when she streams it seems). Another trans speedrunner developed strategies for a game, and we'll get to that now;

It's after the event but I'm checking out the raw stream footage on youtube to watch playthroughs I missed due to work or sleep or general adulting. one of them was for the Wind Waker, a zelda game. And one of the players made mention about one of the tricks used to make speedruns was named after a speedrunner who afterwards transitioned to female, and there was a bunch of other comments made... and I didn't think much of that because sometimes when people don't know about how to deal with our lingo, they say the wrong things, and I get that.

The comments on that youtube video though. holy shit. Hoooly shit. 

I hate when I read shit like the stuff they were saying, I won't even repeat any of it. I reported them for hate speech but who knows if anything will be done about it. Anyways...

...pre all of this I was the kind of person who needed the validation of peers. I had none on my own, and in a lot of ways I still don't. It might seem ridiculous given that I'm a full adult (just recently entering my third decade of being a fleshy human thing) but comments like the ones I saw get to me.

They get to me hard, they get under my skin, and I start to wonder if I'm not just what they're saying i am; a dude in a dress, deluded, ""retarded"" (I hate that word), surrounding myself in an echo chamber of others who want to be deluded.

Im 30 friggin' years old. been on hrt for a year and a half next month. And youtube comments from people who are likely 14 and spend way too much time on 4chan are making me question myself. Sigh. lol

manwoman1990,asktransgender,Gender Critical rad fem ideology makes almost no sense?,"Here is my understanding of the ""gender critical"" movement. Please correct my understanding if it is wrong.

They tend to claim that ""biology is central to female oppression"", and I mostly agree with that statement (prior to the administration of exogenous hormones, which isn't going to magically stop existing just because some angry radfems are complaining about ""men"" sittin' on tha toilet). 

I also agree that transition does not change biological (natural born) sex. I believe transition makes someone, for almost all purposes, FUNCTIONALLY a member of the opposite sex, but obviously not 100% biologically identical. 

This point is the only part I understand and agree with, which I realize that a lot of the members on this forum disagree with (based on a prior post I made when I was trying pretty hard to not give in to my desire to transition).

But I feel like the method of wishing for trans folk not to transition is doing the opposite of what they seem to be aiming for while perpetuating the fact that biological males are almost always larger/stronger than biological females. Oftentimes, as well, I see trans people (once transitioned ""enough"" and thus comfortable with themselves) more willing to go against gender norms of the gender they identify with (example...transmen wearing dresses, who would have never been caught dead in a dress prior to physically masculinizing to a point that they are still seen as male and can wear a dress without being misgendered anymore). 

Also, they ignore that the majority of people tend to exhibit behaviors/interests that align with their biological sex, thus showing that gender roles in some capacity have some sort of basis for existing. These roles are no longer QUITE as necessary as they may have been in the past but still hold value, I believe. I'd not be caught dead saying that if I weren't able to transition, but men are more physically capable of doing physical type work, which is fully necessary for keeping society moving. Also, I, as someone who has resisted transition but am finally coming to terms after seeing a gender therapist for a while, would like to be one of those guys doing manual labor. I'm strong ""for my sex"", but almost every institution with co-ed labor/physical exertion recognizes the huge discrepancies, lowering standards for women to get in the armed forces, for example (to ridiculously low expectations, I would absolutely say).

Anyway, getting sort of jumbled. TL;DR:

1. Rad fem/gender critical ideology wishes to ""dismantle"" gender roles while simultaneously recognizing biological inequalities and wishing for people to not change these, even though malleable biology may accomplish (to an extent) exactly what radical feminism seems to want.

2. I think aspects of gender roles have a very necessary purpose for society to function, and we need both EQUALLY in order to avoid societal collapse.

3. What do you all think? I don't have the greatest understanding of radfem, but I think the ideology fails to recognize that certain aspects of the very gender roles they wish to abolish have a very real, functional purpose for societal maintenance. "

I went to my second LHR appointment today. 1st was 5 weeks ago.

After the first, I had small results on my face and chest, and pretty good ones one my arms where a stronger laser  intensity was used. 

The technician increased the power this time. We did entire body. Didn't use very much more stronger intensity for face, but it was wayyy more painful than the 1st time. However, I have no redness or puffing, which is good for going back to work on Monday.

However now, although she said it's normal and there could be scabbing, I have these red spots all over my belly and arms, and actually a few small blisters on my hands.

My skin is very light, and my hair is dark, and I never ever go to tanning places or in the Sun, so she said I have the perfect skin for that.

Are these red spots all really going to disappear or has anyone had bad experience? It's really frightening!! Anything I should do to help? I don't want an entire body covered in red spots forever :_(

Thanks

Update:
After a week and a half, most of the scabs on my chest, belly, and arms have fallen off. I'm positive that there won't be much scarring left there. However, I'm not so sure for my legs. I've still got, intense, large scabs, especially on my lower legs. Thighs seem not so bad.

I've found a new LHR technician. Will keep you update on what happens.

bookofgrotesque,asktransgender,How do I distance myself from TERF ideaology?,"Im 17 or so and im a pre-everything trans male. I feel really guilty for existing.

I can't stop seeing myself in a negative light because I feel like I have TERF ideaology ingrained in me. I know its wrong and I don't believe it for other people at all, but I do for myself.

Warning for probably super transphobic language, I'm sorry...

I feel like life is pretty much pointless because I can never be a ""real boy"". I know that one day (with a lot of time, money, and suffering) I can pass, but it doesnt feel like enough for me. I dont want chest scars. I want a penis; i dont want to have to love someone with a plastic toy, it just seems kinda. dirty. The fact that every chromosome in my body is XX and will be till the end of time just. makes me wanna scratch my skin off. I cant distance myself from the idea that gender and sex are the same thing, and its making me miserable. 

my dysphoria is awful and i end almost every day with a full scale breakdown, self hate, self harm, crying myself to sleep, refusing to take my binder off, etc.

I feel like I'm betraying the trans community because of this, but i dont know what to do... 

i also feel like im fetishizing gay men, especially because before i was fully aware I was trans, I was one of those tweenage ""yaoi"" shippers, and my liking of gay content hasnt waned any. Whenever I read that kinda stuff I always imagine myself as one of the characters, even when i was younger. I guess this is a differrent kind of deal than what the rest of this post is about though so ill stop it with the fact that ive only ever imagined myself in relationships with other guys as a guy myself

I'm worried that even once I begin my transition (if i ever do...) I wont be happybecause TERF ideaology is so ingrained in me that ill never see myself as a real guy like i want 

if anyone has any advice... id be really appreciative. or anythjng to say at all really"

Throwaway8889909192,asktransgender,Pure-O or Trans? Questioning for the first time.,"M 28 here. I didn't know anything about Pure-O but after researching it makes total sense. I always thought it sounded like crap but researching it I really think I may have it. Lately my intrusive thought is: what if I'm trans? I look in the mirror and think I would be an attractive woman and I smile. I don't smile at my body. Ever. I feel sexy when I imagine myself as a woman, but it's hard for me to visualize. Is this just an intrusive thought? Am I actually trans and had no idea? I don't know anymore. It seems people with Pure-O on here thinking they are trans isn't uncommon. My girlfriend has been very supportive of me with my depression, bi polar and kinks but I think this may be too much for her. We are both very liberal but after all she is straight. I desperately want to shave my beard and try make up but she loves my beard and will know something is up. Should I be honest with her and tell her my feelings? I love her but I also financially can't lose her right now. If she left me I'd be forced to move back in with my parents and they wouldn't let me try and discover who I possibly am. I really don't know if this is real or just the Pure-O making me feel this way. Looking back I tried cross dressing and wearing women's clothes multiple times as a child and teen, even painting my face up to look like a girl. I even tried tucking many times in my teens but I think I'd want to keep my penis. Is that normal? I have so many questions. I like men's clothes, ambivalent is more the word, but I was always jealous of women and the fashion they can wear. Jealousy really is the word. I've always been jealous of women: their hair, clothes, makeup, but especially their sexuality. Also very jealous of lesbian sexuality. Maybe I'm a trans lesbian? Maybe I'm straight but super kinky? How does somebody know if they just like cross dressing or are actually transgender? When I think of myself as a girl I'm no longer a shy, depressed male, but a happy, sexual, confident and cute girl. Something about wanting to be a woman makes sense to me. Then for a few minutes I could care less about not just being a woman but thinking about gender at all. Maybe because I'm so focused on it. Any help is appreciated!"

felineprotector,asktransgender,Health Related Anxiety,"Hey everyone - 

I'm coming up on four months of HRT, just switched to injections a few weeks ago. I understand all forms of estrogen and testosterone therapy bear some risks, but everything is compounding at this time. During my initial 'high' after starting hormones I decided to upgrade all of my courses so I can go to a good university. I had a pretty limited timeline, but figured I could do it, and its been brutal, but I'm almost done, and will probably be able to go anywhere in Canada for my program. This has been super stressful all around. On top of that, I'm not out to my friends, and my plan to not tell anyone and go full time when I begin school likely wont work - things are changing too damn fast which brings a ton of issues forwards alarmingly fast. 

I have all of this stress constantly, and I feel it manifests itself in serious, relatively constant anxiety that I'm going to drop dead at any moment. Headaches, sore muscles, strained eyes from staring at a computer, etc all = im going to die without ever living the life I'm working so hard and am so close to having. 

What's worse is that it has become cyclical - stressed out about school and life turns into acute health anxiety which disables me from getting any school work done, which makes it all worse the next time. 

I know the risks are low, and I have copies of a vast number of tests which all state I'm in good health, I run an hour every day, quit drinking heavily and smoking pot, began cooking all my own meals all to try and relieve this, but it is becoming too much. I know significantly more about the human body and biology than most individuals, and I have a wicked memory that means i can remember nearly every symptoms I have ever read about for a great number of heal issues. But alas, I am not a doctor, and so I cannot differentiate between what I should or shouldn't worry about. I can't go the doctor each week for whatever is on my mind, so I'm stuck dealing with it and slowly breaking down.

Does anyone with a similar experience have any advice for how they dealt with it? I understand a comprehensive therapy programs will not be delivered by internet strangers, but the route which you may have taken to tackle these issues would be great. 

Sometimes I miss being dead on on the inside and my apathy for the future - I've got too much to lose now after realizing how amazing life can actually be, but I cannot sustain this."

It's meant to allow men to have a discreet way to deliver synthetic urine during a supervised drug test, activated by a switch and squeezing the ""head"". 

Now, alone, it's an awkward looking packer that only lets you pretend to pee. However, if someone were to find out how to integrate a catheter (with a one way valve so urine wouldn't flow back into the bladder) that fed into a pouch and then attach the apparatus to a harness that could hold the pouch high up between the thighs so you could flex/squeeze them together as you squeeze the head in order to get the flow going.

This way you could have a realistic packer that would function properly and until you got into bed, nobody would likely ever notice."

Immediately after I felt so light and happy. She said she will always love me no matter what, and help me find someone to talk to.

gendercheer,asktransgender,Unhelpful insurance,"After lurking for a million years and occasionally commenting on people's lovely posts...well, I finally have an actual question for asktransgender. 

I'm very lucky and have an insurance (Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois) that purportedly covers 100% of any transition-related surgery...but my medical group won't tell me which surgeons are in my network. I've been trying since October to get top and bottom surgery, and since I've been on hormones for over 10 years (I'm intersex, but not well documented enough that it matters *in this case of surgery*) I figured it would be...relatively easy? Not 'it will happen in a week' easy but 'it will happen in 6 months to 2 years' easy. So far it's looking like I was still too optimistic. 

When I call my insurance, they say to call my group for providers in my network. I called my group and they literally just asked me if I'd 'pursued therapy, because that is also effective for treating gender dysphoria'. My doctors at Howard Brown in Chicago are great but haven't been able to get answers from my insurance either. I have several letters and all for any kind of WPATH clearance. I've just had no luck finding providers based on what my insurance will (won't) tell me. The few times the *insurance navigation team* at Howard Brown have come through with referrals for me, 5/6 times they haven't even lead to a consult, because the doctors didn't perform the surgeries I want as the team got told by my insurance. One provider wasn't even sure why he was mentioned because he only does FFS, which to our knowledge isn't covered by ANY medical group.

Has anyone else gone through this and come out with referrals/consults/surgery? I remember once seeing that there was a service that helped trans people with the next step in their transiton, but I'm not sure if that included working with their insurance and medical group to get answers about providers. I also believe it might have been Mytranshealth which is very vague in my situation, since all it will tell me is that Howard Brown has trans friendly providers in my area (I know!). 

I'm at the end of my rope her, so if anyone here knows anything let me know. Feel free to pm if you don't want to share more private(?) details with the class. I'm just as likely to get answers here as I am from both my insurance and one of the best informed consent clinics in the US at this point. "
transworkthrowaway67,asktransgender,Coming out at work delayed-am I too emotional about this? (MTF),"I'm in such a depressed mood I don't know what to do with myself right now. I don't know if I'm over emotional or what but I was on the verge of presenting at work before things went array.

Today was the day all supervisors were notified of myself being transgender and what I thought would be then letting everyone else know before they see me again. However, apparently HR mistook my intentions and thought that the time off I requested to visit my parents was my final step before coming out at work. This visit isn't until the end of the month and I was told they would be ""more comfortable"" following what they understood the plan was.

After telling them it was fine I hung up the phone and just cried. I was so excited to finally be me 100% of the time now and not just outside of work living a double life. I'd already put away all my male work clothes in a bag to donate this week and I can't bring myself to unpack it for another month, I've waited so long and I thought this was finally it.

Is it too much of me to call tomorrow and ask to go ahead and begin presenting my next shift? I don't know how I am going to survive this month when I thought everything was finally going to change? Am I out of line to ask this because they are not comfortable yet? I don't know if I should or not and I'm afraid of being too demanding by asking so much from them."

Kristinedk86,asktransgender,Partial success new years eve,"Yesterday i had bought clothes and makeup with my wife for use this new years eve, and to start getting experience applying it.
While it was a bit flawed today, it was a lot more successful today in applying. (bit too much blush, bit of mistakes on the eyes, they are hard with the bad lighting here)

I put on a new years hat (while cowgirl hat with pinks dots), and to be honest i looked a lot more feminine than what i usually see in the mirror. A major success even though there was a bit of failure.

Also at midnight me and my wife went outside while i was in full makeup, clothes and heals and interacted with a few people, was a bit hard, and i think i got clocked to some extent, but I did it.
Still need to get used to wearing heals, shoulders are moving and its a bit clumsy.

All in all it's been a partial success, few failures but i feel great.

TakenAlreadyThrow,asktransgender,"Am I transgender? (MtF, teen) (semi-ramble?)","Throwaway account for privacy reasons. I know it's another typical post however I feel I need advice.

I've always felt less masculine than other boys. Not ""feminine"", per se, but I've never really wanted to play sports, or do those sorts of activities. I've been drawn to other things (stereotypically feminine things). I never felt uncomfortable in my body, but I didn't really feel comfortable either. I also didn't fit in that well with other boys, and I felt pushed away. Around age 11(?) I began to make attempts at becoming more ""masculine"" however I quickly discovered that wasn't something I wanted to do, nor did I like doing it. 

Around that same age I began to develop mild OCD and anxiety issues, which I still struggle with nowadays. Within a year or so I also got depression; I felt like other guys didn't like me or want to be around me. To me, there was something wrong with me (myself). It got to the point where I felt like I was so unliked that I didn't want to leave the house. I wanted to stay inside and be alone.

I didn't really feel like myself. I felt I was doing something wrong, that there was something wrong with me. And I did question a few times, ""Am I even a guy?"" and other questions like ""Why am I like this?"". At this point I hadn't heard of this community.

By chance, I discovered this community and I've been trying to find similar situations to mine. It was pure luck that I found this sub (although I previously - and still do - identified as Bi, I had never thought of myself as transgender). As I read other people's experiences,  I felt less alone. I genuinely felt like this was why I've always felt so different from other boys. I know this whole post probably sounds like a ramble but as I look back on previous experiences it makes perfect sense.

I felt like I wasn't wrong. I wasn't strange. There wasn't something wrong with me.

While I haven't ever identified as a female, I feel more... confident now? I don't feel so alone. I said it out loud to myself in the mirror and I suddenly felt more happy. I haven't really been in a good place recently and as I write this my hands are shaking. I haven't felt confident or happy with myself at all - but when I did say it, and hear it coming from my own mouth, it made me feel happy.

The past makes sense to me now. I thought that me not being ""masculine"" enough was an issue with me. But it's not an issue at all. I still don't feel happy in my own skin, however, and I'm asking for help on what to do next (coming out, HRT, etc. I still haven't come out as Bi to anyone, except my closest friend).


Sorry for the ramble, and thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for taking the time to read."

Do some of you all go through your new lives and not tell anyone your secret? I am from the deep south with incredibly conservative parents and I cannot imagine starting my transformation in this area. So basically have any of you all gotten to the point where you can have intimate relationships with people and they would be none the wiser of your transformation? Can I turn a new page and live a completely different life? Or is that breaking some Cardinal rule? Which if it is the please let me know.

katiecuon,asktransgender,Getting health insurance for the first time. Who should I go with?,"Hello /r/asktransgender!

I live in Kansas. I'm currently on my father's Tricare, but I dropped out of college in order to move out (my parents are abusive because I'm trans and won't let me transition but I'm secretly 4 months on hrt). I saved the money to move out and went househunting today but I got in a bad car accident. Which practically deprived me of all my savings.

Fortunately, I'm ok.

Tricare only lasts so long after being out of college, and I don't know if my insurance is still even valid. I need to find my own insurance before something fatal happens.

What's the best insurance for trans people?

Ideally, one that covers hormones &amp; maybe even ffs. Something that costs less than $150/mo

Airan541,asktransgender,This is what happened after my post about the post day pill,https://youtu.be/Y5m2jlJ7vTg
PrincessJasmine624,asktransgender,My Doctors appointment yesterday.,"I have been on pills for about 1.5.  My current dose 6mg estrodial and 100spiro.

I went it for a check up see how my estrogen levels are and also how low my test was.  He came in greeted me and told me i looked beautiful and the changes are looking great on me. I was flattered but I had questions for him. I wanted to switch from pills to injections. Reasons why i wanted to switch cause i felt i might see more results. My friends told me that is was way better for them. But I also understand that our body has to absorb the hormone so the changes can be made. He told me that he wanted me to stay on pills cause it is for safer for me. He was telling me about the risk for injections which quite scared me. ( the on site shot, risk of wasting the injection, the pain, and i might not see changes at all)

But in october before that increased  from 2mg- 4mg. but in december i went from 4mg-6mg.  He told me that is very quick and he wanted to try out the 6mg for a few months and then we can talk more about it. He told me i could be on the highest estrogen and get no changes or my changes could be slowed down cause it is too high. is that true?.

Then he started reading my levels that is when i started smiling. Estrogen levels are really high from the first time was 20-92-140-190-208- 236. 236 is high. He told im about as high as comes when women are menstruating. My test is 0. I am happy for that. Are my estrogen levels too high??

The changes i seen over the year
1) i have a hourglass body shape
2) my skin is soft
3) face is a lot more round
4) Breast growth
5) my shoe size went down 2 sizes im a 8 in womens now
6) my hair is thin
7) i have had an ass but my ass is alot bigger and more round and plump
8) my hair does not grow as quickly
9) voice my is higher. I have always had a high voice  or a female voice. but it sounds like im seducing people idk  how i feel.
10)I am a lot more bitcher and more in touch with life 
11) i crave pickles and salty foods alot more
12) taste buds
13) how I see life and how i think and act. 
14) physical changes are there. I pass quite well

But I am sad that i can't be on injections.  am i greedy for wanting more and more changes? Should i be thankful. 
I started transitioning at 22. Everywhere i go i get ma'am and smiles from men. But i feel like i want more. i do not want seem selfish. My downstairs does not even work thank god.

I ask if my health insurance will laser hair removal. He told me to ask my insurance. I have health net.

If i can get help or guidance that would be nice. I am sorry for ranting and jumping around. If you read this and reply thank you for your time.

I really hate my life because I start to think that every trans my age (16) has better conditions to turn out pretty, curvy and petitie. They are often as small as their sisters and are much smaller than most men, for me it is completely the opposite.

tomatoes-comatose,asktransgender,What made you realise you were transgender?,"For me, all of this really started when I was around 16 and got dumped. Before that, i was Cisgendered and hetero.

After that, i began to find myself to drawn to being Bi.

Around 2 years after that, i now come to question my gender identity.

Is there anything scientific I can read to see if I identify with anything? 

I've had chest fat for quite some time, and have been teased about it *a lot* for almost 4 years, since before I began to even realise or think I could be bisexual. Could this be it?

I remember being quite excited years before I even noticed what I looked like under my shirt around the age of 12-13, that there was a surgeon who had a world record for the largest number of male to female and female to male gender reassignment surgeries. I teased some of my friends with it, i joked how I'd get it done, and stuff like that.

I asked about what would happen to an MTF person's Y-chromosome after changing genders (I only recently found that transitioning is done through hormones prior to surgery) and stuff like that.

I think I found the concept quite engaging for quite some time, but then I don't want to end up messing around and taking a stupid risk, i do not know if I experience gender dysphoria as such, i read that article ""8 signs of gender dysphoria"" as well, but can't seem to identify with it too much. I mean, my parents were a lot more restrictive than most of my peers, so I guess I *would* feel different. Come to think of it, i'm comfortable with my genitals but then I have a lot of discomfort about body fat and often my appearance, and my mind's eye has this image of me as these variety of females i know of ""The girl that dumped me, or Julia Roberts, or something like that. 

I find I now remember fantasising about waking up with bodies exchanged with the girl, and living like that for a while. 

On the other hand my behaviour is masculine but I'm horrible at sports and find them uninteresting and also I remember this one incident where we were rocking climbing.

All my classmates did it, fat or tall or short, but I was the only one that didn't. All this also makes me question my masculinity.

However my tastes are masculine, i like video games or guns and tanks and things.

But I guess this will never happen, I am too tall, have no curves and I am too masculine especially my face is just bad. But my body isn't just masculine, it is really flawed too. I've seen other trans girls my age before transitioning and they almost all are much more feminine and petite even when they were a boy than I am. My genetics won't allow me to get to cis girl standards since there are just narrow hips in my family and height shrinkage isn't really a thing atleast it wouldn't be enough. My hairline is nothing near feminine and so are my shoulders which won't lose much width, I don't have any muscles so any shrinkage in width would be barely noticeable. I know I can't reach that goal but can't stop wanting it, even therapists can't stop me from wanting it. What should I do now? I just feel so incredibly bad in my own body."

I had a great catch up with my aunt over the holiday break and was helping her find some trans groups or groups that would be trans friendly in her area of Bennington, Vermont. She isn't the best with tech so I told her I ask around on Reddit. 

She is in her late 60s and started transitioning/came out about 10 years ago. She said she was primarily looking to get out and make friends trans or otherwise. Overall just groups that open to all and aren't closed minded to her being trans. She is very much into the outdoors/hiking/adventuring/survival type. Think old school national geographic. I think she also completed her master gardener license recently. She also said that she prefer groups that went out and did fun things rather than just going to a bar. I  imagine she also prefer a more mature group in terms of age. She is willing to travel an hour or maybe two as well.

She used to do the Green Mountain Club https://www.meetup.com/gmcbennington/ so I passed their phone number over to her. 

Anything else you know off the top of your head? Any resources that list trans, trans friendly, or just open minded groups around Vermont? I appreciate every bit of help.

I mean, I am not dissatisfied with the changes or anything, I am already getting some results and it's great, but I still want to appear more feminine in the long run like every other MtF trans person probably.

She has not done very much research on shopping for binders yet, and after a few hours of looking around online, I'm still confused on which ones would work well because there is so much difference of opinion.

If it is okay, can you give me some advice on where would be good places to start looking? I have a fairly roomy budget to buy her a few and shipping shouldn't be much of a concern. We'd like something that works for people with... fairly small chests? (I don't know her specific measurements although I plan on asking her when we purchase to make sure we get the proper size.) We would also like them to be comfortable and above all, safe. Thank you so much!"
Isthischestdysphoria,asktransgender,Does this sound like chest dysphoria MTF?,"Okay, let me just start off by saying, I'm not sure if I am a woman, but I want to hear some opinions on whether or not I sound like I may be a transgender woman who has chest dysphoria.

I don't know why but when I get out of the shower, I like to where the towel so it covers my top and bottom half, I feel better that way. I think i might of always done it (I'm not entirely sure though) aside from some occasions. I've narrowed it down to maybe a few things, it's either because I am a bit weighty and I just don't want people seeing my stomach and my nipples and everything jiggling, or it might be chest dysphoria that some transgender women experience.

I do remember one occasion, I was walking around the house shirtless and I was only in some underpants I think and then I went to answer the door and I wrapped a towel around my top and bottom half and I remember someone said to me ""what are you doing, your a man aren't you"". The only reason I was like this is because I was about to get into the shower.

So what does this sound like? Maybe MTF chest dysphoria? I'd love your opinions."

[deleted],asktransgender,'Original Birth Certificate',"So, legislation in some states is being proposed, that makes it illegal to use a restroom not corresponding to the sex on your original birth certificate. Realistically, if someone has their birth certificate changed, could this still effect them? How would someone even access an 'original birth certificate'? This all seems like ridiculous to me. 

Hopefully people hear about this, because it blows the narrative of 'its only to prevent a cis man from pretending to be trans'. What, are we supposed to believe a cis man went through the trouble to legally change their birth certificate, just to sneak into the women's restroom? People can't be stupid enough not to see through their bullshit, right?"
orienteering1,asktransgender,Does anyone else here get really turned on by the threads about orientation change?,"Hi all, I'm a trans girl (~2 years hrt) and am using a throwaway account because I'm slightly shy about admitting this, but I've been pretty active here for around 4 years. 

Anyways, I started visiting asktg a few months before I came out to myself as trans. A really major component of my decision to start transitioning was the threads about people experiencing changes in their sexual orientation while transitioning. I would search for these often and in depth. And I would always keep an eye out for new ones. I still do this, though with less of the fervor than before, probably because hrt has toned down my libido.

It wasn't exactly that I wanted to undergo a change in my orientation myself (though that might have been a bit of it too). Rather, I simply thought the descriptions of trans girls slowly recognizing their attractions to guys were just really hot. Especially when they would write about first catching themselves staring at a guy, or smelling one, or imagining kissing one. Their naiveté and first cautious steps toward a life of being into men really kept me coming back.

I'm so grateful for these threads. Without I'm not sure I would have figured my own gender stuff out as early as I did. I admit I used them as masturbation material (and still do), but I surely can be the only one, right? Who else appreciates these threads the way I do"

pinkchips,asktransgender,"I don't see being trans as a biological 'mistake', and certainly not a mental illness. I consider it an evolutionary advantage society hasn't adjusted to yet.","I have certainly never felt mentally handicapped or ill.  In fact, it has been quite the opposite.  In my youth my teachers told my parents that, 'His grades might not be as high because he's not just seeing the white and black - he is seeing all the grey around the question.""  
  
That statement has defined my life, and led to numerous academic and professional successes, despite a lifetime of dysphoria.  
  
I qualified for many scholarships through test scores, but left the annoying and rigid environment of college early to start work.  In my career I rose through the ranks quickly because I saw what needed to be done, apart from all the other bullshit, and I did it.  What befuddled others seemed so clear and simple to me.  When I decided I wanted to get wealthy, I initially hit a lot of stumbling blocks because the world of finance is filled with lots of ego and do's/dont's.  It took some years, but using this juicy 'ol transgendered brain I was able to see money and speculation in an abstract way that some others apparently couldn't.  Hence I became financially independent.  
  
Only recently have I allowed myself to face a lifetime of dysphoria and anguish about my gender.  I won't lie that this wasn't pleasant and it brought a lot of grief and pain to my life.  Being dysphoric and born to the wrong sex (according to how I feel) certainly doesn't seem like a blessing at first glance.  But it has allowed me to understand people and the abstract systems they draw between them in novel ways.  
  
I am successful and who I am, likely in no small part due to the transgender nature of my brain.  
  
I vehemently deny the idea that being transgender or even dysphoric is a 'mental illness'.  I'm not implying every transgender person is by causation mentally gifted, but I am confident that our brains are able to do things and see things that cis brains cannot.  It is sad that we have been made to feel that we are somehow degenerates or lessers to our cis equivalents.  
  
Be proud that you were born transgender.  You might not have wanted these gifts, but you got them.  Might as well embrace all the ways that your brain excels in ways others might not.  
  
You aren't just valid.  You are *exceptional.*  
  
-------  
  
*Edit, Because multiple people in the comments are saying that because being trans makes you less likely to have babies it can't be an evolutionary advantage.**  
  
Here is what you are missing.  We haven't been in an organism vs organism environment for millennia now.  The individual genetics of a single human don't really contribute that much to his/her/they success - not nearly as much as the society he/she/they lives in.  
  
Once writing became ubiquitous, the world became a clashing Petri dish of civilization vs civilization.  We humans became the cells of a much larger super organism, and it wasn't Grog vs Grog but Babylonians vs Assyrians and etc.  
  
The civilizations that evolved the fastest consumed and dominated those that didn't.  So it has been until present day.  
  
Trans people are very specialized and powerful cells in the civilizations that support them.  The prevalence of trans people in Silicon Valley should be somewhat of a hint of that.  **You don't have to directly sire offspring or have 400 babies to be a massive evolutionary boon.**  
  
The society that you're a part of benefits from how amazing you are, because we are interconnected in a larger system now.  "

nikanbudong,asktransgender,Some information about the biological causes of transgender. What are your opinions on it?,"First I would just like to make a disclaimer, I try to be completely neutral on this. I am not a member of any party. I do not have any specific agenda for this, it is just a topic I became interested in (not politically, but scientifically). I am not coming at it from any specific angle and I would like to know all the facts. If you disagree with something I would genuinely appreciate your opinion on it. You must have logic for your disagreement so if you could put it into words I will consider your opinion unbiasedly.  (sorry, I might have also phrased some things in a way that seem skeptical of transgender people)

Your genes act as instructions for your body to follow while developing. Hormones are sent out to carry out these instructions. Sometimes non genetic factors can get in the way of developing. (For example a person who has a partially grown leg was probably not caused by genetics, but an issue that prevented the body from fully completing the genetic instructions.) There can be a lot of natural variety in biology and nature and everything basically. When you are developing into either a male or female your body has to go through a set of steps to get to that point. The normal path of development for a male would be starting off with XY sex chromosomes, with a Y chromosome containing a typical male SRY gene. Testes would develop, releasing androgens (testosterone and other male hormones) would prevent the baby from becoming female and from there the primary sexual characteristics (genitals, amounts grey-white matter, and even dumb things like the length of your pointer and ring fingers) and the secondary sexual characteristics as well (what happens during puberty) would be primarily male. 

But, like anything, ANYTHING can go wrong ANYWHERE along that line and it actually far more common than you probably would think. Starting from the beginning, some people don’t have either XX or XY sex chromosomes, some people have XXXXY, XXXYY, XO, XXX, half of cells have an XY chromosome while the other has XX, sometimes someone has XY chromosomes with no SRY gene so it basically just functions as a XX sex chromosome, as well as many more possible combinations. Next someone can develop ovotestes, sometime for no apparent reason. Finally, some people have a hormonal imbalance that will prevent the primary sex characteristics from forming, which will affect the secondary sex characteristics as well. Basically, the hormones are what almost completely what makes you into a male or a female, beyond that, your chromosomes are just an extremely small microscopic thing inside the nucleus of your cells, you (yes you) might never know your actual sex chromosome pair without getting it tested and you’ll otherwise still just be completely the way you are. Sex hormone imbalance (or complete switch) can be caused by external environmental conditions, or biological conditions such as Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome where the body cannot respond to androgens in a person with XY chromosomes. In Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome the body could be masculinized completely ambiguously (yes that includes the genitals). In the cases of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia when there are mutations in the CYP21A2 gene which causes a 21-hydroxylase deficiency, there is a cortisol deficiency which causes a hyperplasia in androgen producing cells in the adrenal cortex of the adrenal glands. This causes an increase in the amount of androgens being produced, this will only simply increase the amount of androgens in an otherwise normal XY male, and in a XX-sex chromosomed individual it will create a sex hormone imbalance, sometimes even so far over on the spectrum that it will create a complete male. Another interesting condition in sex hormone imbalances is a 5-Alpha-Reductase Deficiency. In 5ARD it will prevent the body from responding to dihydrotestosterones, which is essential in the development of the external male genitalia. People born this way will be born looking completely female, but at puberty with the release of testosterone it develop more and look more male. 

Interestingly these people with 5ARD almost always “feel” male since a very young age. People with Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome ALWAYS “feel” female. People with Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome often times don’t really care which way they “feel”. Studies have been done on people with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia’s “gender identity” and the more extreme the symptoms, virilization, and the male hormone levels are, the more likely it is that that person will “feel” male. Interestingly, females with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, definitely seem to have a 30% chance at being a “lesbian”. A commonly cited example that gender identity is NOT a social construct is; in the 1960’s two regular twin boys were born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In an accident one of them was injured in a way that the parents were told “he could never be male”. John Money, a Psychologist from New Zealand, who worked at John Hopkins University already had a theory that gender binary behaviours were caused by how the child was brought up, and not by biology, which was the generally accepted Idea at the time. He used this situation as an experiment to prove to the world that his theory was in fact correct. The child was never told about the surgery that occurred at infancy but was relentlessly convinced that he was a boy, not a girl. John Moneys reports on the experiment suggested that it was a success, even though he was entirely aware of the way he felt. Eventually both twins committed suicide. Since then, with technological advancements, scientists were able to study the brain and how sexual dimorphism in behaviour is linked to neurology. Scientists now know that the Hypothalamic Uncinate Nucleus is an essential part in this, and is a primary sex characteristic. 

What about ""transgender” people? Could the transgenders' “gender identity” even possibly be related to the intersex people’s gender identity, or the thousands of regular males and females throughout history who have, for whatever reason, been brought up and the opposite gender? Scientists have been wondering about transgender people’s brains so many studies have been done on it. In one study, transgender peoples' hypothalamus were examined and all to date have matched up with the gender they believed themselves to be, whether or not they have taken hormones. An image of a transgender hypothalamic uncinate nucleus (bottom right): https://s28.postimg.org/vuy43dsd9/ygoygy.png Note that the reference male and the homosexual male are the same, this part of the brain seemingly has nothing to do with sexual orientation. Another study involved giving rats hormones during pregnancy. The rats who were given hormones in the first half had an ambiguous genitals but when their dimorphic behaviour was measured, it correctly matched their chromosome pair (the ""suggestion"" of their natural development). The rats who were given hormones during the second half of pregnancy had a reproductive system that matched their chromosome pair but their measured behaviour was ""unmatched"" and was that opposite of their sex chromosome pair. I guess you could say, some animals could be ""transgender"". In general, so far the most compelling, seemingly truthful, and unbiased scientific information definitely seems to point to “at the very least, the great majority of transgender people have neurological differences constant with their gender identity and it is seemingly a natal condition as well”.

What about the rare transgender people who have “untransitioned”? Well think about this, Can't people choose to be transgender, to be part of a group?  I have seen a one or two transgender people who absolutely clearly seem to just be “doing something fun” and look at it just like getting a tattoo. Is this a wrong thing to do? I couldn’t really tell you that. A large part of what is right or wrong is defined by society. For example, with plastic surgery, is this a wrong thing do if you grew up in a family and society that looked at cosmetic plastic surgery as perfectly normal and acceptable? In a world where gender has hardly any meaning would anyone changing genders even be questioned? I honestly have no opinion, but most likely anyone who wants to change genders would feel a little out of place because they are going against their biology. Another possible, but controversial example is autogynephilia, to the extreme point of when someone transitions genders full time. Although this topic is somewhat unstudied. I would be interested in knowing more in detail why sexual orientation in considered to be an essential part of this, and what that idea was originally is based off of. I don't believe this is a topic anyone should be obsessing over, and you should not try to keep it in your mind too much when meeting new people. Transgender people usually socially transition at a young age but some transition older. This doesnt necessarily say anything about a person's brain. Although someone’s Hypothalamus may remain slightly more on a binary side of masculinization since birth, some people may be able to “put up with it” longer due to a less extreme ""identification"" you could say. Gender itself does not seem to be a social construct, but it can have many socially constructed roles and stereotypes as a part of it. Our brains are not designed to think that we are a certain species, race, or object. These things are not really comparable to transgender people.

As for the bathroom debate, it seems very unlikely that transgender people themselves would harass or harm anyone else in their preferred bathroom. A more pressing argument is regular people may dress up as the opposite gender to try to pass as ""transgender"". Although, there have been none or few cases of this happening other than people trying to make a political point. An argument that can support allowing transgender people in their chosen bathroom is the majority of transgender people look quite average as their gender and have already been using their preferred bathroom, also a significant percentage of people who don't look ""normal"" as their gender may not even be considered ""transgender"". Many people have been raised consistently since birth as one gender, and have congruent genital appearance, and neurology, but had a hormonal imbalance during puberty due to an intersex condition but was unable to acquire (or did not want) any treatment for it. Meaning that for example, a person who appears as a female dressing as a male may been born almost completely biologically male and not be transgender. To completely ban all people who fit into the decided category of transgender may not be a very logical decision, many people who consider themselves transgender have had very complicated stories of intersex conditions and surgery as an infant. But to ban people who appear physically as the opposite gender (which is not always transgender) may be a possibility to think about for safety, but we should be carefully considered the positive and negative aspects of it, I personally don't agree with doing that. Either way, options like having multiple small bathrooms or gender neutral bathrooms can often times save money and space, and could be a possible goal for the future of bathrooms.

The gynecologist, an old woman, asked me about the psychiatric pills I'm taking. I should've known something was wrong when she said my medication was ""holding me back"" from having a good life and you can get over depression by being happy. No shit.

Nevermind that, I told her I didn't want to menstruate anymore. It made me feel awful, and since I will never have kids I didn't see the purpose.

""As a doctor, and especially as a woman, I don't agree with you. It's just not natural."" she said.

I didn't take that well, at all. I already have my parents to tell me being gay isn't natural either. ""But even if you don't agree, can I do it anyway?""

""Yes, but I wouldn't recommend it. It will harm your body because you stop a natural process, and you'll have to take hormones for the rest of your life. Is that better than to put up with this small problem once a month?""

I kid you not, we talked like 10 minutes. I was trying to convince her but she kept telling me she didn't agree with it.

""Look, I want to get a hysterectomy someday. I just want to stop the periods until that happens."" I said.

""Why do you hate your womanhood so much? You have to be comfortable with your own biology.""

""Well, the thing is that I'm transgender, that's why I'm not comfortable with it."" I didn't want to tell her I'm trans but oh well. I just didn't know what to do so that she would give me the option to stop my fucking periods.

""It doesn't matter. I have a lot of patients like that. Many girls are like you, but they're comfortable with their own sexuality. Your parents know you like girls?""

At that point I though *you don't know what transgender is, do you.* I basically pretended to agree with everything she said, had my junk checked and got out of there. I was really upset.

Then my mom thought it was a great idea to inform me, after I've already come out of there, that the gynecologist was a very religious woman that made trips to India to study ""natural remedies"" or some shit like that. Why didn't she tell me beforehand??

I just... wanted to stop shark week. That was all I wanted.

She basically says this: she compared me wanting to be a girl to me drinking or smoking underage. She said that she may not agree with it, or might not make that choice. But she will love me all the same. This is worrisome to me because I don't know if I want to be in an area while I'm transitioning where I don't have support and people agreeing with me. It seems like I would be much better off staying with a nice boy who tells me how beautiful I am everyday and gives me a much needed confidence boost. 

My mom also insists that I won't be me anymore once I transition, I have told her countless times I will not change. I will still be the same person and like the same stuff. She doesn't believe me, she thinks hormones will change my personality, which I don't. Is she right?

My dad will definitely not react well, he has called transgender people freaks and weirdos for as long as I can remember. I don't have a good relationship with him as it is either.

And although not related to being trans, this part from the game To The Moon (SPOILER WARNING) struck a strong chord with me because it could've been said by a trans person deep in the closet with no intention at the time to transition (although I suppose it also could be said by people in general who have to constantly put up a facade): ""Acting for me is the only way to be 'normal'.

Finding it really hard (heh) to face life,"There's an incandescent hurt in the pit of myself and I'm drowning in it.

I don't care about the scars, I don't care if I'm short, I don't care about my strong childbearing hips that could pop out triplets. 
What I do care about is that I can see no way to reconcile my rage at not having a penis. I'm aware there are two options; metoidioplasty or phalloplasty. The size of the metoidioplasty is a huge issue for me, I want to be able to penetrate my partner and I simply don't want a penis that small.
Phalloplasty is the other option and it seems that it may not necessarily give me sensation in the newly constructed penis, that it won't be strictly erotic and most sensation will still come from having my clit stimulated, and that it will take months - years to garner said sensation. 

I want to be able to breathe. I can't come to terms with the idea of not having a functional penis. Is everything I've said accurate? Is there any hope? How do I get past this? I can't see a way out and I'm dying. "

juniorPI,asktransgender,Do you think pussy hats are transphobic?,"I've heard a lot of people say that it equates being a woman with having a vagina, and I understand why that's transphobic, but I've mainly just heard cis ppl arguing about this and was looking for a different, more relevant perspective. Here are my thoughts/questions in list form: 

1: the word pussy typically refers to a vagina, but are there any trans women who use it anyways? 

2: obviously this is a reference to Donald Trump's comments about grabbing women by the pussy, so does the fact that it's a direct response to men feeling entitled to women's bodies (which is something all women can relate to, cis &amp; trans alike) make it better, or nah? 

3: would you wear a pussy hat? Does it feel alienating? Would you side eye somebody else wearing one? 

4: Question for trans women: do you feel comfortable using words like pussy and cunt? Trans men: do you? Do you think the power to reclaim that language comes from being a woman, having a vagina, or both? 

any other thoughts on the topic? 

(Here's the mission statement https://www.pussyhatproject.com/mission/ ) 

I've been thinking about this quite a bit recently and keep waffling back and forth.

JejuneJo,asktransgender,I only just started questioning my gender and I don't feel valid.,"Ok so I started questioning my gender about 3ish months ago, right after my freshmen year homecoming. As a kid, I didn't care who or what I played with, thought I did tend to have slightly more male friends and boys toys. I was never really thought about my gender up until I was about 10. That's when I started puberty and my body started to develop. At around 9, I gained a lot of weight. I was so uncomfortable with my body, but I just chalked it up to my weight, though I hadn't felt even an ounce of discomfort about it until almost a year later, despite me being bullied about it.

At 11, I started to lose weight. I wanted my breasts to disappear, I wanted to grow a lot taller, and I wanted my body to be straight, not curvy. I developed an eating disorder (that I have since overcome). During this time, I strictly wore oversized sweatshirts, boys basketball shorts, and sneakers. 

Over the next three years, I was always so self conscious and never comfortable. I had felt off since I was about 10, but it only intensified as I got older. I started dressing and acting more girly to try and fit in with my piers, but I knew that I was different. I would often sit in my room, crying, asking a god that I don't believe in why he had to make me a freak.

Fast forward to this year. I'm 15 and a freshman in highschool. The summer before starting school, I cut my hair shoulder length. I wanted to cut it shorter (and had for years, but didn't because I wanted to be a normal girl), but I was too scared to because I did this in my room with a pair of kids craft scissors. Anyways, about a week into October, I cut my hair even shorter into a boyish style. Not exactly a pixie cut, but boyish. Whenever I looked into the mirror after I did this, I saw myself as a boy. I was so confused, but I really loved how I looked.

In the months since, I have questioned my gender and have changed my style to match that of a male. I like myself so much better and I realized that that ""off"" feeling goes away the more I present as male. I realized that the hate I have felt for myself and my body is actually dysphoria. The only thing that I struggle with now is justifying my feelings. I feel like since I didn't actually start actively questioning my gender until late 2016 that I'm just making everything up. 

Some days, I feel like I am male, like I was always meant to be male. Other days, I wake up as yell at myself saying ""You're a girl! You've always been a girl and you always will be!"" The longer I've been questioning, the more I've been coming to terms with everything. 

Though I feel more comfortable in my own skin since I've started presenting as male, I feel like I'm not valid because I didn't start questioning until late 2016. I don't know how to get past this and I need help. I have nobody to talk to about this, so I'd appreciate anything that any of you have to say. "
ItsAlmostAlice,asktransgender,Help me please.,"I'm not doubting that I feel like I am a girl. I'm doubting if transition is right for me. I feel like I am actually a girl. I like the changes I see happening. But recently I've started doubting if I should transition. I'm so depressed. So depressed. And it's a thing in transgender communities that like if you're depressed it could mean that you're not really the gender you thought you were and transitioned too. And I'm scared that applies to me. I don't want to be a boy. I want to be, and feel like I am, a girl. But that thought isn't going away since I saw something about it. I feel like a girl. I want to be a girl. So my questions are do you think I'm a girl? Like honestly think that I'm a girl and not a feminine guy? And do you think that my depression is caused from having the ""wrong"" hormone for my true self in my body or is my depression separate from the estrogen?"
punstressed,asktransgender,Is it okay for a trans girl to wear a binder?,"When I start HRT, I'm going to want to hide it's effects, mostly going to be achieved by wearing baggy clothes, but certain things are difficult, particularly in the chest region (for places like school with locker rooms and such).

AmIATransWoman,asktransgender,I don't feel like I need HRT. So why start HRT?,"I am a possible transgender woman and I often feel like, I don't need HRT. Like, you know how someone who has depression goes on some anti anxiety medication and then they feel better? Well, I don't feel like that. I don't feel like that at all. I don't feel like I need HRT. So why start HRT?

It also doesn't help that I've been told things like ""until you need to transition, you don't need to transition""."
elliotnewname,asktransgender,Did anyone lie so they can use their desired name?,"I'm MTF, and my birth name is Elliot.


I've never liked the name Elliot (I remember saying that when I was 5) never quite knew why, but now I hate it because it's masculine (I wonder if that was why I hated it, I just didn't understand).


Anyway, I have been thinking about Ellie, like **Elli**ot and I've always liked that name, but now I'm having second thoughts.


I also like the name ""Lauren"" a lot more than Ellie. There is something about that name I just love. But I know 2 Lauren's, and it might make it awkward if I decide to use that name. I know them, but I don't speak to them, they are someone in my year at school.



I'm thinking of saying that was going to be my name if I were AFAB (it wasn't) but just so it isn't that awkward.

pinkchips,asktransgender,WTF was that? ���� Is this gonna become a thing?,"One month MtF HRT.  I have a lot going on in my life right now, and a lot of scary things on the horizon but nothing particularly traumatizing.  Just like, a general sense of worry.  
  
I just got home and felt a few tears coming.  No big deal right?  'It's just the estrogen doing its thing; let it out' I thought.  
  
Then I proceeded to sob uncontrollably for 20 minutes.  And now I'm ok.  All for no specific reason.  
  
I've never cried before without a specific thing I was upset or hurt over.  This was so fucking strange.  Do you think I should expect this to become a regular thing?  ��

MondayToFriday,asktransgender,Canned responses to teasing that children of a transitioning parent can use?,"I am a parent of two kids in elementary school. I intend to start transitioning soon. So, not only would they have a transgender parent, they would also be going from a family with apparently different-sex parents to apparently same-sex parents.

Inevitably, even if we do live in a liberal area, their friends will start asking questions, or maybe pick on them for being in a non-traditional family. (My younger child, in particular, takes offense easily at anything people say about him.) I'd like to prep them with specific phrases that they can use in response.

What responses, in your experience, have worked best for your kids?

I'm trying to find a good resource to show her, but I'm not sure what to use. I was going to go with the WPATH Standards of Care (she's a nurse), but a friend of mine said that it's full of outdated information. For example, she says that the risk of DVT is overstated there because they're using outdated data that doesn't take into account bioidentical hormones.

The only thing I do really get is angry (then hold it all in and stew for days or until I play a multiplayer game and explode lol). 

I'm guessing it's very YMMV but I'm curious how it's affected people on HRT, be you on T or E, as well as people's guesses on how they think it could effect me.

loki1717,asktransgender,Sperm production restarting?,"Hey everyone, I've been on HRT for almost 1 year &amp; 10 months, about 4mg estrogen gel/day, and a few months ago I moved down to 5mg Cyproterone Acetate per day.

I'm not a sexually active person, maybe having an orgasm once every 6-8 weeks. Well, I orgasmed a couple of times this week, even twice a couple of days (5 times in 3 days), and each time I orgasmed, a rather cloudy, thick, sticky fluid came out.

Now, a few months after starting HRT (starting at 20mg Cypro), I stopped ejaculating, and if I did it was clear, and not sticky.

So I'm wondering if there's sperm in my ejaculate now, given the rather low-dose AA. Has anyone else had this experience?

My GF and I are planning to have a baby (banked), but if we can do it ourselves that would be a lot easier, cheaper, and somehow more... sensual?

Anyways, we've got an appointment where I might be able to have them take a look at my ejaculate and let us know, but I'm antsy and would like to hear others' stories/experiences! :)"

My parents would tell me that a man takes initiative, a man should care for your mom and sister, and a man doesn't need to much privacy that a woman does. How can they get over the fact that I am trans? It's like they are in denial. What should I say or do? Thanks a bunch"

Super excited for my bottom surgery which is scheduled for the end of the year! (Yay)

w3irdthought,asktransgender,Did anyone else have this coping mechanism pre-transition?,"Throwaway, just in case. I realize this likely isn't a common experience, but I'm curious if anyone else's gone through the same thing.

Before transition, I'd always had a tendency to introject. This behavior's been present for as long as I can remember. It's always existed alongside the dysphoria I've had since early childhood. 

For those unfamiliar with what introjection is, it's a symptom of dissociation. When I'd introject, I'd take on attributes, even entire identities, of fictional characters. To cope with episodes of severe dysphoria, I'd internally ""become"" someone else... adopting the roles, personalities and mannerisms of characters. I'd get so consumed by the dissociation that my entire self-perception would change. I'd physically perceive myself as the character to the point that I wouldn't recognize myself in the mirror.  

It's been almost a year since starting HRT, and one of the most surprising things I've discovered is that I can no longer introject. My ability to dissociate is just... gone. I get stressed and my immediate urge is to retreat into one of my dozens of false constructed identities... and it doesn't work. It's like the ability to access that part of my consciousness completely disappeared. Transition has, for the first time, forced me to inhabit my actual body and my actual identity.

I'm sure this is what being normal feels like, and somehow it's the strangest thing I've ever felt."
LilyFlowerr,asktransgender,I'm bigender and I'm worried hormones will cause my breasts to grow bigger than I'd like...?,"I identified as a trans woman when I first started HRT but I've been feeling more like a boy lately. I want an andro appearance so I would hate to stop hormones but I'm worried that my breasts will get big enough that I can't hide them. I'm actually pretty happy where I am now but stopping hormones would reverse some changes and continuing with them may make me appear more feminine than I'd like.

Would taking a low dose help? Is there anything I can take or do that will cause hormones to be less potent, if that makes sense? Can I get breast reduction after I've been on hormones for awhile? I wouldn't be opposed to buying a binder but I'm not sure whether it's safe or not.

Thanks for any advice! I've been kind of freaking out about this since I'm afraid to mention that I'm not a binary girl around my endro and my therapist is still out of town for awhile."

Girlyyyy,asktransgender,Best Thailand FFS rhinoplasty?,"Hello all TG'ers

I hope I came to the right place. I'm a bit annoyed that many surgeons in the US fail to deliever an actual pleasant feminization rhinoplasty. I can only think of Iran to do such drastic results. A friend told me that her friend went to Thailand and had miracles done on her. I believe that as I believe Thailand is the capital for transgender cosmetic surgeries. 
I am seeking to find someone who is amazing with making a nose as feminine as possible and I've also considered maybe a jaw reconstruction/chin implant and ear procedure. 

Can anyone kindly give me their ideas of who they know of in Thailand that can be good? I would truly appreciate it. I've seen some of the FFS surgeons in the USA from their websites and Im not really impressed with their rhinoplasty work

Lately there's been a weird underlying feeling that I want to be female, and I think if someone asked me if I wanted to wake up as a female tomorrow for the rest of my life I'd say yes. That should be all the evidence I need but I still have trouble wrapping my head around it. I thought for a bit I just had a cross dressing fetish type thing but maybe I'm rationalizing it like that cause I'm scared of the reality. My biggest concern are that I feel that my life would become really complicated and difficult as a result of this...  I don't know if I could ever pass because I have a very manly face. And I almost feel like it's better to just be a man than to be a woman who will never truly feel like a woman.

oiwjers,asktransgender,It feels like my dysphoria is gaslighting me,"I hope that's the right word to use

I'm full time and have been transitioning for more almost 6 years now, but I still have self confidence issues, most of which revolve around being trans

The work I do (retail) involves being around the public and strangers a lot. One thing that's been happening a bit the past few months is random strangers just going ""oh you're so pretty!"" and my mind immediately thinks that they're just saying that because they clocked me and think I'm doing ""a good job"".

The latest example was today - a much older woman, I'm talking probably 60s - came up to me and got really close to me and said ""I just wanted to let you know I think you're a really pretty lady"" and not in a hitting-on-me sort of way. Again my mind immediately jumped to ""she just clocked me and is trying to make me feel good""

I honestly can't tell if the way my mind automatically responds is correct or not - I'm not used to seeing adult strangers telling someone how pretty they are out of the blue.. If they're actually just saying that because they genuinely think I'm pretty then it feels like I'm going crazy

feelinqueer,asktransgender,How to come out to my best friend/brother?,"Hello, all of you beautiful people! I have been lurking here for a good while now but it is my time to finally post something.

I'm 21 years old still living with my parents and younger brother (who is 20) I was able to finally (somehow) gather enough strength and courage to come out to my parents yesterday which was the hardest thing I have ever done and they were more supportive than I ever could have imagined! I felt very loved afterwards and like my body was going to run out of tears to shed. But anyways, my problem is I felt like after coming out to them the next few steps would be easier, but they aren't, not at all. My brother and I have a very unique relationship, we've been best friends our entire lives, we have experienced so many things together, we have spent more of our life together interacting/in the same presence than we have separate (if I had to guess) and I spent so much time and energy coming out to my parents because I knew that was the best way for me to get gender counseling/therapy to get my head sorted out to make sure I know this is what I want so I can start this thing! But now that I have come out to them I now have to face coming out to him, and I think it will be even harder than coming out to my parents... I gave my parents a 5 page long letter telling them, but with my brother I don't think a letter is the way to go, and I know him well enough that I have to be brief with him. I am going to have to tell him to his face, and I just don't know if I can do that... I have been balled up in my own forced masculine shell not allowing myself to show much emotion for so long now and my brother is used to that and I know if I start to cry (like I did perfusely when telling my parents) and generally being emotional about it I know it will freak him out because he doesn't like to see me in anguish... My dad keeps telling me that I need to stop worrying about protecting him and allow myself to worry about myself and my feelings over his right now since it is me who needs it right now not him, and that I should just tell him even if it does make him freeze up or panic a little... I know deep down he will support me too, but I can't help but feel that our relationship will forever drastically change after this and I don't know what I would do if I lost him over this, it would be like losing part of myself... I haven't talked to him at all about any of this, but he knows something is seriously up because I have been in total anxiety mode for a couple of weeks now as I was psyching myself up to tell my parents... How do I tell someone that close to me that I feel like I am and want more than anything to be a woman? How do I tell him something that I know he will not expect, something that won't only change my life forever but his as well because how close we are? I guess what I am asking is has anyone else been in such a position where they felt like they already did an impossible step during your transition but have to right afterwards do a possibly even bigger one? And how did you manage to pull through?

TL;DR: I felt like I did the impossible coming out to my parents but I feel like/I have to come out to my brother right afterwords who has been such a big part of my life that he might as well be my left arm? Has anyone experienced similar and if so how did you pull through it?

Thanks for any advice or support you can give me! This sub has been such a strong and nurturing backbone for me, I &lt;3 you all!"

Criteria for this post being very basic: Did starting on your respective hormones greatly affect, diminish, or just all around *change* your sex drive? Me personally still being on the fence about everything, I'd love to hear what'd be in store for me, whether positive or negative. 

I'm sorta afraid how I'd cope if I just suddenly had a sex drive that was just, like, dead. Although, I seem to have a sex drive similar to those vagina-mouth'd things from Blade 2: Relentless and hard to kill. Also, just watched Blade 2. Kinda sucks ass. Would not recommend. Unless you have a vagina-mouth fetish, I guess."
TheWalkingSadness,asktransgender,Anti-depressant made me weird... I need help :(,"Hey, I don't know how to start this.
I've been taking anti-depressants for 26 days. They changed nothing expect a few things.

I'm a million times more anxious and have a nervous breakdown everynight.

And.... My gender dysphoria is... gone!? WTH!

I mean I don't know. I feel like a zombie. I still don't know why but when I look in the mirror I don't care... at all.... but then, why do I feel so bad and cut myself everything? Why when my friend told me ""You should have been born a girl! you'd make a great girl"" (I'm completely closeted) it hurt me so bad that I was about to cry in front of her. and I still think about it everyday. every second. 

I just don't even know what I want or what's wrong. I just feel awful.

And I'm also afraid that maybe the whole transgender thing is about gender roles and clothes/crossdressing.

I'm afraid I'm crazy or I'm just.. I don't know. I just feel like I want to just drop dead into someone's shoulder and cry for a good decade. anyone can help me :( I have no friends to talk to and keeping these to myself Is slowly driving me mad.

My therapy session is in a few weeks. and I'm not sure If I can stay alive until then, I'm planning on coming out to him no matter how I feel because I'm going mad!

throwaway949124x,asktransgender,Does this make any sense?,"Hi there.

I am still not 100% sure of being transgender(mtf), but I do think so. One thing that I'm not sure of how to feel about is that while I do want to transition the idea of people knowing that I'm a woman is not something that I desire. I want to transition for myself, to be happy with myself. The reason behind it it's that most people I've known so far in my life don't have a positive opinion of transgender people-- just becaue they're transgender. I don't want to be despised and to be treated as a less human being just because I want to live my life as I want to. Neither I want to be bullied or even having worse things happening to me. Sure, if everyone in this world would be aware that females are equal to males and that being transgender is not a goddamn disease I'd be more than happy to socially transition, but it isn't the case. I guess I'm just terrible afraid of destructive criticism towards my true self and possible physical harms. 

Because of what I've said, the idea of transitioning comes with fear, I just don't know what to do about it. I see people coming out despite their fear. I see people coming out on the worst of the places and that makes me feel like less of a trans, invalidating my own gender. Is it normal to feel like this? What should I do about it?"
lecrazyunt,asktransgender,how often do you need to get blood work?,My doctor informed me that I would need get my blood checked again in 3 months from my initial visit.

throwawyaacc,asktransgender,Drinking while taking cold medicine on HRT,"Recently, I got a common cold. Sneezing, runny nose, headaches, what have you. I know not to take ibuprofen, so I opted to take an antihistamine instead. Now, if I am feeling better by the time my friends are hanging out later tonight I plan to drink.

I'm a bit of a lightweight and I drink only once every two or three weeks (I haven't had a drink since before Christmas). I doubt I'll drink more than the equivalent of 4-5 beers.

Would it be significantly worse for me to drink tonight while an antihistamine is also in my system? I'm MtF on 2mg estradiol, 100mg Spiro, and 5mg Finasteride. I'm in my early twenties if that is necessary.

This is also applicable to FtM, so if anyone wishes to ask or answer whether it'd be dangerous that'd be great. I love all my brothers, sisters, and nonbinary comrades.

Thanks for reading all that &lt;3."
GabiCap,asktransgender,ANOTHER Voice Training question... will this help? Is there hope? DEEP VOICE!,"Not saying this to brag, but I have the perfect radio voice. Right now I work behind the scenes in TV news (yes, everyone reads what I write) but would like to make the transition to on air for radio. I got that perfect, deep, Orson Welles radio voice... yet deeper than Welles.

But... enter the POSSIBILITY of me being trans (my therapist swears I'm in denial, I think I'm a good actor fooling her), and my dreams of being a radio or TV news star are zero.

But whatever, of the 3 things keeping me from ""trying out"" being trans, one is my voice. So let's work on it!

I'm terrified of a) my voice being too deep to not be passable and just sounding like Orson Welles in drag and b) having to always have a ""fake"" voice for the rest of my life.

But let's try it. Though I'm from a large city, I now live in a rural part of a rural state so I doubt the local university would have trans friendly speech people. So now I'm trying youtube.

I noticed this youtuber has a great voice and a pretty simple trick: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xu_vFkKq4g

Would these exercises work? What do I DO? If I can't change my voice, I don't see any use in trying or considering transitioning... if that's what I decide to do.

Any thoughts?
Thanks!"

emilycdcanada,asktransgender,Need FFS surgeon recommendations that do top work,"I'm looking to start doing some FFS consultations over the next month or so and am trying to decide who I want to consult with. It's *much* more important for me to have good quality work done vs save money. Most of the work I want to have done is around my jaw and chin area but will probably end up doing the brow ridge and perhaps the hairline and trachea as well. I'm looking for more dramatic changes rather than subtle changes.

So far these are the three on my list in order of preference:

1. Deschamp-Braly
2. Zukowski
3. Speigel

I'm feeling like Deschamp-Braly is going to give me the most dramatic results but I'm also not sure if he's overrated. I've heard a few mentions of Di Maggio, but I'm not sure if he's on the same level as the 3 listed above. Is there anyone else I should consider?

7janthrowaway,asktransgender,"Transgender, OCD or both?","Someone I talk to (on this sub) has been saying about OCD and being transgender.


I'm starting to think that it might be some form of OCD I am experiencing, as lots of other people I've read about that have OCD think they are transgender.


OK, some information about me (Sorry for the wall of text, I never intended on writing this much):

* I'm 16 (17 next week), AMAB.

* I only started experiencing dypsohira since around October. I haven't really had dysphoric thoughts in the past. The only thoughts I've had in the past is wanting to wear the girls school uniform since I was 12, however I am sure I once thought that when I was 8/9. I have always wondered what it would be like to be a girl, I am obsessed with the ""if you were a girl for a day"" question.

* I have has obsessions with womens clothing for a long time, probably around 12.  Like certain types of womens clothes I had obsessions with. When I was 12/13 it was tights/stockings, when I was 14 it was sexy lingerie, then 15/16 it was dresses (especially prom dresses and short ones). 

* I first crossdressed when I was 6, when my sister ""forced me"" to. I put forced to in quote marks, because I liked it secretly but I was a boy, I'm not supposed to so I never actually did anything. I used to want more and more, it started off with a dress, then I wanted to wear a dress and makeup, hairbands, and acting like a princess.

* I'm not sure if I can trust these dypshoric thoughts. Like, I remember taking a mental health test online a few years ago, and it said I had ADHD, and another one said I had Scizophrenia. I got really worried and started thinking I had it, but in reality I know now I don't have it.

* I've known that there was something up with me when I was 8/9. I could never figure out what it was, but I just knew there was something up with me. I'm wondering if it has been gender dysphoria the whole time.

* I look in a mirror, I used to see a super masculine man and I liked it and thought I was attractive to girls, and I liked being masculine so I was more attractive. But now, I look in the mirror and I see a guy. I put girls clothes on, and think ""ew, a man in a dress"" and then get angry that I can't wear them. When I look in the mirror, it just doesn't look right, but I never used to be like that.

* I keep purpousely triggering the dysphoria. Like, today I was at a shopping centre, and generally when I am out the dysphoria is very low. Every time I saw someone who is female, I'd just think ""You want to be like her, don't you"" and I didn't really care and I just get really annoyed when I'm not dysphoric, because it makes me think I'm not transgender.

* My dysphoria is only really there when I'm alone in my room, especially at night. Like at night I feel suicidal about being born male and not female, when I am at school I question why I think that, or my thoughts go subconscious and it's only there when I am alone. I just think ""I can live as male fine at the moment, why do I want to be female so much"". I get depressed if I have some proof that I am cis, because that means I am not trans. I always think my life would of been better if I was AFAB.

* I feel like just forcing myself on HRT. Just force myself to be female. The fact I might not be able to get it makes me really depressed.

* Maybe I am just extremely curious what it's like to be female? I don't feel male anymore, a few months ago I was fine. I wear unisex clothes virtually everyday, and sometimes I have to remind myself I am male.  Again, a few months ago I never had to.

* I became obsessed with transgender topics in the past 6 months. Around July, I used to read stories about transgender people, trans love stories, all sorts, realized I am pansexual, but now I am starting to think that maybe I am just overly obsessed with transgender things, I want to be transgender, you know?

I want to see a therapist but I am too anxious to see one. GICs in the UK have such long waiting lists anyway.  I feel like they will just laugh at me and say I'm just some stupid confused 17 year old, turn me away. I've read things like the null hypothecis and that was dysphoria. I feel like I'm trying to make myself relate to it, but in reality I'm not. I can't trust my thoughts because I don't know how much of it is true and what isn't.


Can someone point me in the right direction? Am I really trans and I am denying it to myself? Do I have something else and it's making me think I am trans? I don't know anymore."
HopefulAndrogyne624,asktransgender,Could I have body dysmorphia?,"I realized that I am trans (MtF) relatively recently. I'm definitely going to transition, but sometimes I am happy with the body that I have; not because I'm okay having a masculine body, but because it appears quite feminine. I'll look in the mirror and see full cheeks or look down and see wide hips (I don't have genital dysphoria so that part isn't an issue.) For a period of time during high school I was pretty convinced I had Klinefelter's Syndrome.

Can dysmorphia come and go like this? Have any other transgender people here experienced anything similar? Does anyone here have body dysphoria &amp; dysmorphia?

This is more of a matter of curiosity than anything, because if I do have body dysmorphia it is far from distressing, quite the opposite in fact."
flisan91,asktransgender,"Sad and transfeelings going away after looking at ""transpassing""","First I am excited when I visit that thread. But after watching a couple of pictures I'm becoming uncertain about my own journey. (I am Pre-everything, only on PM. I can start real HRT in 2 weeks).

However, I think I maybe get exhausted when I see too much pictures of trans people in their mid-journey. It's like ""Is it really worth it?"" ""Am I really like them?"" I think all the questions coming up when I see people who's not passing despite a long time on HRT.

I do not want to be mean... mean no offense. But is this a normal feeling to get? My desire of transition is of course coming back after a while but it's just when I watch to many pictures of others I feel that the desire slowly going away."
cyanmallet,asktransgender,The last month has been the best of my life,"Sorry, wall of text ahead. I don't even know what I am asking, I just feel like I need to share this. So last month I finally accepted that I am transgender and decided to go through with transitioning. I have no clue how I did not see it before, it has been so obvious my entire life. I even told my best friend over 3 years ago that I just wished I had been born a girl because that's how I have always felt, but nope, I was definitely not transgender. In the beginning of last year I felt really upset about not having breasts and never getting them because I was not transgender and therefore would never transition. I bought some bras, looked for ways to fill them and browsed for breast forms like crazy. I found it a bit strange that all the websites were for women who had a masectomy and for transgender people, because I wanted it so badly, but I was a cis male.

I am not sure what it was that just clicked last month and made me accept it and decide to transition, but ever since then I have been so happy. My depression and apathy have completely disappeared, I feel so energetic and want to do all the things I used to do, but didn't feel like I had the energy for. I got diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in the beginning of last year, and the doctor told me that it is very common to feel fatigued with that so I just thought that the lack of energy and will to do anything was because of the disease. Even more amazingly, after I made my decision practically all the symptoms of my colitis have disappeared, probably because the digestive system is so closely connected with your mental well being.

I started coming out to my friends just before Christmas. I told my first friend on the 21st and my god, I was so nervous. She was so incredibly sweet though and has been super supportive. Since then I have been working on telling more and more of my friends, and I even told my parents on my birthday this week! I had been really scared of how my dad would react, but he just told me that the most important thing is to be happy, and what you do to become happy is less important. I slept over at my parents house that night, and before going to bed my mom came to me with a necklace that has been passed down from mom to daugther for the last couple of generations and gave it to me. I am just so completely overwhelmed by the positivity of everyone.

On Tuesday I went to the doctor and told them that I would like to transition. She gave me a referral to the clinic that is responsible for treatment in my country and I am currently waiting for a time to go see them. My friend went with me to the doctor, and after the appointment she decided that it was time to go on a shopping trip. I bought my first collection of female clothes, and I have been wearing it in public and feeling super great about it this week. 

I don't know where I am going with all of this, I am just so incredibly happy to have started this journey, everything feels so right, it's absolutely amazing."
poingcritter,asktransgender,For questioning people who want to know how cis people react when they don't have the 'right' parts:,"I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/5mlf9t/my_dick_fell_asleep_and_i_had_a_brief_existential/) on /r/pointlessstories about a cis guy sitting on his junk long enough to accidentally put it to sleep.

kingcobra1967,asktransgender,Just an update &lt;3,"Update from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5ne4b3/really_anxious_about_transition/)

First off, I want to thank everyone who sent kind messages or left a reassuring comment. You all really are great! &lt;3

For those of you wondering about what this is about, please check the above link. ^_^

Now, onto what this post is really about: how the appointment went! It went really well, and everyone at Planned Parenthood (which has started offering HRT, at least at the location near myself) was so kind and caring. They really do care, and they're all really open minded individuals who just want those they help to be happy. I digress. *sheepishly rubs my head* I started by talking to a social worker about stuff like why now, what kinds of stuff have I been working on in the past, home situation, support network, etc. Then, I went and saw a really nice nurse practitioner, and she went over my medical history and any medicines I'm on. Lastly, there were some physical stuff they wanted to check like blood pressure, weight and height, and, as I hadn't had one before, an STI test. (So far, the only one I've gotten results from was the HIV test, and that came back negative!) After that, they told me to wait about 5 days before picking up my prescription for E and spironolactone! I just wanted to post a little fluff before things start getting hectic, and I also wanted to share it with you all! &lt;3 "

JustAThrow-ayAccount,asktransgender,"Stuck, not sure where to go from here.","Hi, everyone. First post, long-time lurker, throwaway account, I'm sure you'll understand. I'm an 18 (soon to be 19) -year old MtF. I've steadily realized more and more my true gender since puberty. I feel like my body is top-heavy, distorted, and malformed. Everything is wrong, and it has been getting steadily worse, what with hair and muscle mass and fat distribution and such. I hated my voice ever since I heard it played back to me at 14, and now try my damnedest to keep it higher. My parents found me out in the worst possible way about three years ago, and they basically threatened me with moving out with no monetary support if I followed through with it, saying it would give me more important things to worry about. As it was, they cut me off from the internet for three months, effectively severing my ties with my internet friends who they feared had influenced me. (By the way, they only looked at three months' worth of chat history. They don't even know that I brought it up to them first in every case.)

I think, more than anything, they just like having a son. Things keep changing for the worse, bodily-speaking, and I can't help but keep going back to the 'what if' of starting on things sooner, having the guts to bring it up properly to my parents, and how much happier I would be today. Now, instead, they're looking for voice coaches in our area so I can start using that absolutely disgusting-feeling bass tone. I'm grimacing just thinking about how the vibration feels in my throat. Hell, they didn't want me looking for clothes anywhere near the girls' section, nor even wear a flashy jangly silver bangle I've had for years (thanks to my claw machine skills). It's super-frustrating, especially considering how open-minded they appear to be regarding literally everything else.

So here I am. I'm lost, with no one to talk to but myself, afraid of what the future may hold, and still scared to re-tell them about it. I have occasional depression related to this situation, usually accompanied by crying fits that approach self-harm. I contemplated suicide at one point, although having helped a friend tough out similar suicidal thoughts once, I knew well enough not to follow through. I get cold sweats a lot, and I'm close to despair. All I know is that I can't try to tell them again, I can't move out and support myself, and I can't keep living in this slowly-crumbling nightmare of a body.

I'm sorry for such a massive downer of a post, but this is something I really need help with, and I believe you folks are the best to ask. What do you think would be a good path forward from here? Any type of information, ie. coping mechanisms, self-experience, etc. is appreciated. (Also, I hope this is easy enough to read/understand; I wrote this late last night on a mobile device. Ask questions if you need to. I'll answer almost anything.) Thanks, everyone. ^ ^

Sending my love ~&lt;3



UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the advice, and helping me to work things through. I did - barely - manage to talk to one of my parents about the voice coaching (and ended up in cold sweats in the process); it was apparently received pretty well, and now they're okay with however I want to sound, as long as I still take classes for vocal clarity and projection. That's a huge weight off my shoulders, so thank you again for providing support and giving me the confidence to at least make it to here so far. &lt;3"
HelloRainClouds,asktransgender,Confused,"Sometimes, the feelings of being transgend; wanting to be a girl, are stronger then other times, why?

I never liked being called 'son' to my knowledge, but I didn't have strong feelings of being transgender until a few years ago. I didn't go towards my Sister's stuff, probably wasn't into the colour Pink, that I know of.

Why did it start recently?
There were signs, and there were feelings of wanting to be girl before I started have strong feelings...
That is one of things that confused me, and that is what one of the things holding my parents back from accepting/believing I am trans. No one said they seen any signs, or maybe that is a bit willing to forget?

If I had to opportunity to be female, but and could never be male again, I would change in a heart beat."

With that's said, I guess I don't really know what I'm going for here, but I'd call this a last ditch effort for some help, because I'm getting to the point where I don't care anymore.

I constantly feel like there is a battle between two people inside of me: my feminine side and my masculine side. I am uncomfortable with both of them because I feel completely alien to ""being a man"" and ""being a woman."" I don't know what either means, but the more and more I experiment with each, the more and more I feel out of my element. 

This is where I lose the ability to really capture how both sides of my personality feel and the only way I can think to do it is with a list. So here goes:

My feminine side is largely focused around appearances (which I don't really like) and relationships. I want to feel pretty, I want to have smooth skin and longer hair, and I wish I was shorter. I wish I had more freedom in my clothing, and I would love to learn about makeup. I want to be loved and held and desired, and I want to be fucked and pleasured by a man. It hurts to say all of that because for some reason I feel like I'm disrespecting trans and cis women, but it also feels natural in some way.

My masculine side doesn't care for anything above. Honestly I don't know what it wants, because when I feel masculine, I feel like just another guy, aside from the constant nagging at the back of my head saying ""something is off."" This site of me feels easiest to fake, because I've had to act like a boy my whole life.

If you've read this whole thing, thank you for listening to me rant and stumble around. I would truly appreciate some help or feedback on ways to improve my situation, but I know what I'm saying/asking for might not make sense."

Futome,asktransgender,Trans and going to be homeless.,"Hi. I was wondering if anyone knows any trans-safe sub-reddits or websites one could go on to look for a housemate or something? I'm going homeless on the first day of April and I need to find a room to rent.

Also i'm from Northern Massachusetts.

Also i'm going to try to avoid shelters if I can. This isn't my first time being homeless while openly transgender. And I Was victimized."

feelingitnow13579,asktransgender,trans? Sexual fetish? need advise,"Hey there, so first off I have recently become active in the reddit world, and outside perspectives are great. Everybody has so much info to offer, the knowledge of everybody combined is amazing. That being said, I mean no harm and hope my confusion does not offend anybody. 

So I am young twenties and quite masculine, muscular build, facial hair, fish, outdoor stuff blah blah. Ive had gf's in the past and have enjoyed heterosexual relationships. For years I have always kinda cross dressed. Never hardcore, but something as simple as slipping on some sexy panties before I sleep. When I do this at first I have a sexual thrill, As I step my legs through I feel a rush and I am quite turned on... erect. After a few minutes I become flacid and usually tuck everything away. I will remain like this until I awake. Recently I have been exploring some sexual desires with other men. I have been with one guy quite a few times and we are confortable with each other. I do enjoy performing sex acts that generally females do. For example I enjoy giving head but would never like to recieve. I love being a bottom but could never bring myself to top.  As I do them I often begin to picture myself as a female. He is very open minded and we discussed my slight crossdressing habits. He is cool with it. So recently when I have gone to hang out with him, I tend to shave my entire body down to my knees, wear panties and head over. When I am shaved smooth and wearing feminine underwear I feel more fem and kinda act more fem. Needles to say I enjoy everything alot more. For example recently I sometimes put on lipgloss before giving head, it just makes everything feel right. 

What gets me is that I only like to do all of this when I am with him being sexual. I have zero desire to go about daily life, school, work, as a female. But when I am with him sexually I wish I were full female, hair, boobs, but, ect... Like I would enjoy being a passing female and have guys dance with me at a club and try to hook up, but if I were just going to see a movie with friends or do athletic type things I would be more comfortable being a guy. So this just confuses me... Any thoughts?

SecretOfficerNeko,asktransgender,MtF SRS options within the United States?,"Hihi everyone!

I'm writing this question because, while I haven't been able to confirm or deny it yet, my insurance may not cover my SRS if I go to Brassard in Quebec, because its not within the country. I'm hoping to schedule SRS for the end of this year, so I'm understandably excited, but of course there's a few hurdles to jump.

So what I'm asking for, if its possible, is a list of common American SRS surgeons, who can give me the results I'm looking for. Just in case things don't work out. Overall, I'm looking for a vagina that'll, to the greatest extent possible, will look, feel, and function like the real deal.

Thankies everyone! &lt;3"

toodledootdoot,asktransgender,Some tips for shaving that I've found makes my face incredibly smooth and isn't super painful after a few days.,"I only have one face to work with, so this probably isn't a universal thing, just something to maybe look into if you want a super smooth face and aren't already doing this.

1. The biggest thing that helps me avoid pain that ultimately comes from shaving every day for is to go super slow.  I went from taking two minutes shaving to taking probably seven or eight, but the extra time has been worth it.

2. I shave against the grain, but not initially.  I always shave my face along the grain and then go back over it in the opposite direction very lightly to completely get rid of them. You don't have to take care of every single hair on the first pass, I usually do several very light passes against the grain until I stop feeling hairs being cut.  I used to get ingrown hairs fairly often (once every two or three weeks) and shaving forwards then backwards seems to have helped with that.

3. Use moisturizer, acne cream, or just any kind of face wash right after you shave.

Anyway, that's all I have, I hope this helps at least someone :).  I would love to see any tips you have too."
Aexias,asktransgender,[UK] The question of questions **Wall Of Text**,"I love questions. I love having answers more. I hate not having the answer. And that in a nutshell is how I ended up here. I ask myself who I am, and to put it bluntly, I have no fucking idea.  At nearly 30, I would have hoped to have that one down. But alas...


Do I think I knew at any point? I doubt it, if I sit here any reflect. I just got on with life with what I had, not taking risks and not making any changes. See, that is something I'm terrible at - enacting change and/or taking risks. Throw something new at me and I adapt in the blink of an eye. However I will never be the one to make (major) things happen unless my hand is forced by reaching a point where to not act would be worse.

I could easily bog this post down, one which is already long enough, with a massive brain dump, but I'm trying here to keep it to what is pertinent to why I'm writing this. I've had the *'am I trans or is this something else'* question pop by for a visit a number of times since my teens. I never really experienced any dysphoria (as I would think of it) growing up. I would always say no and it would pass - I would get on with my life.


Fast forward to a couple of years back (mid-to-late twenties). I came out to a friend and then a few others as non-cis (or some sort of genderfluid varient). I had concluded that the 'trans' feeling was real in some way (quote Dumbledore: *""Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?""*). 


As time has gone on, letting the catch loose on the box in my mind holding onto the gender disquiet has lead to these thoughts developing. There has been a much louder discontent at not being AFAB, but no real change in terms of how I feel at being AMAB. 


The friends I mentioned above were a support network for me to explore how far I wanted to push my non-cis identity/presentation, but each and every single one is suffering considerably from their own issues now, so they cannot be a post to lean on, and thus I've had to rely on introspection.


I then finally had a chat with a trans friend/acquaintance to see if I could get some insight on what to do and what journeys I could take. She said many things, some relevant to me and others where we are quite different. But she definitely was kick in the behind to act sooner rather than later if that's what I want/need to do.


So, me being me and never taking action (~15 years of prior inaction on this) had still done nothing 3 months later. But then we get to the present day...


I needed to make a GP appointment about a separate issue. Ignore that it took having an ulterior motive, I feel that I should also raise the whole gender ID thing at same time as I cannot avoid the truth of it being a 'thing' any longer. However, I have no idea what to say or ask; I'm still yet to conclude that 'I am a woman' (if I ever will) nor could I say I would be committing to any sort of transition.


So, the appointment is on Tuesday. What do I do or what I am asking for? I know each person is difference, but some advice would be hugely welcome.

Noli420,asktransgender,Gym locker concerns,"So I stared going to my college gym. I am pre-everything with very obvious facial/body hair. In the nude, there is nothing physically that would point to me being a woman besides my painted nails. 

I have to go before class a couple times a week, necessitating a shower. So, since I marked M on my paperwork to match my legal name and other paperwork, I used the men's locker. No big deal first time, but second there were people in there with me. I stalled until no one was in the shower, then sprinted to a stall to get dressed so no one would see my bra. 

I would have felt more comfortable in the women's I think, but at the same time, I do need to think of others. That is just who I am. I am gaining a lot of confidence presenting feminine in public, but that is clothing. This isn't. Just as I have the right to feel comfortable, safe, and secure, don't those around me have the same right? I know the company line in this sub is ""you do you"" with an implied ""to hell with the rest"" but that just isn't who I am...

If any of you amazing ladies and gentlemen have any advise or suggestions of how to deal with this, I would love to hear from you!

Update: 

Met with manager of the wellness center on campus. She was awesome and very understanding. She showed me the women's locker room, it does have individual shower stalls instead of the communal crap men are forced to deal with and stressed that she wants me to feel comfortable. She was very happy I came in to meet with her rather than communicating via email. It was stressful, but at the same time good practice socializing as my preferred gender. Thanks everyone for the feedback and encouragement!"
ofStarStuff13,asktransgender,Can a doctor terminate their patient relationship during the first initial appointment for being transgender?,"I just got off the phone with my insurance's nurse hotline where it was confirmed that I have been lied to and have been treated unethically.

I successfully transitioned a little over 10 years ago and there has never been an issue when it comes to my healthcare. However, I went in to see a doctor, a pcp, as I have a nerve issue in my arm. She whizzed into the room, introduced herself and without missing a beat started to grill me on my hormones. ""Where did you get the hormones? Who gave them to you? When did you start taking them? hormones, Hormones, HORMONES!!!!"" After 15 minutes of this crap, I had to remind her that I was there because of my arm; I made NO mention of needing, wanting, or even a refill on the damn things. She wasn't interested in my arm. I made the mistake of mentioning depression and then she left the room for another 15 minutes to check on my mental health benefits, came back in and lied straight to my face and told me that my CURRENT therapist no longer takes my insurance and the closest person who accepted my insurance was 2 towns over. I called the next day to confirm and was told, ""Yes, we take your insurance."" Again, I directed her back to my arm where she told me the pain and numbness I was experiencing was ""all in my head"". I asked her if I should instead see an orthopedist or specialist regarding my arm when she once again lied straight to my face and told me that I needed to have dealt with the nerve pain for AT LEAST 6 months before even beginning to entertain seeing a specialist. (I was told on the nurse's hotline that this is a tactic used to try and get someone to look for another provider. Was also told that a specialist should be looked into only after ~4 weeks, NOT 6 months.) She then told me to go see a physical therapist, get a cortisone shot and to hope for the best right before telling me to find another doctor and to get out of her office. 

I will most definitely be reporting her to the medical board, insurance, and her local admin.

Can a doctor refuse to treat you only after the initial visit simply for being trans?

Honestly, I'm sitting here slack-jawed. I spent the first 7 years of my female life in Texas and only encountered 2 instances of discrimination. I have experienced more discrimination in the past 5 months that I've been in this little shitty town right outside Seattle, SEATTLE!!!, than I ever did in my 30 years in Texas. Regarding my arm, I have been to the ER, urgent care, sports medicine, and that shitty pcp dr and have been stonewalled at each one. I don't understand this. I thought this area was accepting... With the exception of the pcp, it has been the same scenario each time: ""Oh hi! I'm doctor so-in-so. Are you allergic to any meds? When was your last period?"" Oh, I'm sorry, I'm transgender. It is at this point their affect completely changes. No eye contact, the friendliness is dropped from their voice, and they are looking to get out of the room asap.

I did go once into Seattle proper to an overnight clinic where I was finally treated as a person; unfortunately, the nurse practitioner was not able to refer me out to a specialist for some reason. My transness did not come up once. I don't feel I should have to go a town over for fucking medical treatment but it looks like I might have to."

mtfvoicehelp,asktransgender,(Update) MtF voice help,"Hey everyone! u/imfinethough here, I created this account expressly for the purpose of the username. As an update to the thread I made here about a week ago, I've decided to open up my schedule to give voice lessons/help to trans women over skype. I've gotten a lot of questions over the years as to how I found my voice, and it's hard to describe something so in-depth and complex over PM, so that's why I've elected to help people one-on-one, and give them specific advice.    

I'm currently looking for a new job right now, but ideally, this is something I'd like to do full-time - I would really love to be a cheap resource for trans women who can't afford to spend $70-100 an hour for voice help. So I've decided to do a sort of...reverse sliding-scale, in regards to payment? I want to charge $20 an hour, but if you think I deserve more or you want to help me keep it a full time job, then by all means :D hopefully that sounds fair to everyone!     

I understand there are already voice guides out there, and I also just want to sort of...supplement them, I guess? Some people are capable of teaching themselves just from guides but it might help to have someone else give you direct feedback for where you're at and what you can work on.    

Also, I just want to be available as a resource in general. Let's say we're 45 min through the session and you've already gotten enough to work on for the next session, but you need help with something else like makeup or where to find informed consent clinics, or how to come out to your parents or whatever...it's all stuff I've done before so I don't mind helping you out with whatever else you might need :) I've given plenty of advice here over the years also hopefully people who've been here for a while can vouch that I'm a good resource haha.    

Feel free to comment here with any questions, or send me PMs! Also the email I've set up for this is mtfvoicehelp@gmail.com, you can reach me at either if you want to schedule a session. It would help to send your best days/times in the email so I can cross reference it with my openings and get back to you :)

AnarchyFox,asktransgender,Are my parents emotionally blackmailing me?,"Some backstory for clarity:
I'm a 21, soon to be 22 year old student in the UK. I'm in my final semester, and I've known I'm not happy with my gender for nearly 2 years. I've explored things such as crossdressing, presenting as female, even as far as looking into HRT via private means.

When I told my parents how I felt, I sent them an email and we had a long discussion over Christmas. The reaction has been pretty negative, they seem pretty uneducated in terms of anything 'truely' trans, saying things like 'We watched a program on TV, we know how it is' using derogatory terms you might find someone with a trans fetish using. I understand its hard for them, I truly have considered that, and do understand as much as I can, but now I wish I never told them, its just become a huge problem, even though i told them out of respect for them to know how I was feeling after so long.

They've made it perfectly clear they don't want me doing anything female, my dad especially, he makes snide comments about even tiny things like the length of my nails, not that I've exactly been manly either growing up but according to them 'I never showed any signs'. My mum says things like 'You don't have to take anything, its bad for you' and that 'It messes you up, people regret transitioning' I feel they are being very selfish with the whole situation, pretty much only explaining how it affects them and that I've not considered it, when they haven't even asked me anything like how I feel or really anything at all. They assume I'm just going to be selfish and that I don't care about their opinions, purposely upsetting them for the hell of it.

They refuse to listen to my reasoning that I've done TONS of reading watched TONS of videos and talked with medical and psychological professionals for therapy, and thought so damn hard about every little detail. They are very much in the mindset of 'sex = gender' and I fear they will not make the effort to educate themselves even if I provide the means to do so. My dysphoria is getting worse and worse, I hate aging as a male, and I hate even more the thought of living like this forever. I've wanted to do what I'm studying for my entire life, and I've pushed so hard to get where I am, I feel like my life will finally start when I graduate and I don't want my self hatred getting in the way of my life when I know deep down I'm happier as female. I don't know what to do anymore. I thought I'd get some sort of support form my parents being as they said 'we always will love you' and apparently it would be fine if I was gay, but not this. (Side note, I'm not gay, very much attracted in females thanks)

I'm mostly independent from my parents here at uni, they don't loan me money or anything, but when I graduate I won't have student accommodation for long and I will have to find a job, I visit them on the holidays. They refuse to acknowledge what I've told them, seemingly if not talking about it will make all the bad things go away. I'm not suddenly going to up and change immediately to full girl mode if I get HRT, I understand that process takes time, but BECAUSE it takes time, I want to start now, I've done my waiting and my parents are like the last obstacle.

I guess I'm just looking for advice, I know no one can give me a answer that will solve my problems, and I don't expect people to make my life choices for me but I feel my parents are stopping me from making this choice, because I'm being too considerate with their wishes...Did anyone else have these issue with their parents and how did you overcome them, if at all?

TLDR; I want HRT but my parents simply 'don't want me too because imagine how that will make us feel' I'm sick of waiting and don't want to get to a point in my life where my self hatred overtakes my passion for things I do and enjoy."

Scream26,asktransgender,Questions about MtF SRS,"Hi. My girlfriend is trans and she and I are trying to get as much information about transitioning as we can before jumping into HRT or anything similar. She definitely wants to have SRS down the line (I'm not sure if that's still the appropriate term or not), but we're not clear on the requirements and/or costs. So, to those who have undergone SRS, I have a few questions:

* Is the procedure covered by any US insurance plans if she secures a diagnosis from a mental health professional, or are we doomed to pay out of pocket? 

* If we *are* to pay out of pocket, how much can we expect to pay?

* What are some realistic expectations? Will she be placed on a waiting list for five years after securing the necessary documents? Is it difficult to find a surgeon willing to do the procedure? Will her PCP/mental health professional help her find a surgeon?

* Is it recommended to find a surgeon to perform an orchidectomy prior to SRS, or possibly HRT? (We've read that an orchidectomy would give her better results during HRT.)

If you guys could answer any of these questions, I would be super grateful! Thank you so much."

I see a lot of gender labels, and not that I do think think that's fine, but because there are so many, I'm left really confused.

So this is where i currently am... I'd like to present myself as female and look female. I dont find myself attracted to either genders at the moment in a sexuality manner, though I'd sometines wish to be with a female companion... other times I'd really just want to be embraced and be held tight, feeling safe... and then of course I still dream of being having sex with a guy... though at the same time I still feel like I'd never be able to be with a guy due to a lack of attraction on my part towards them and that i feel disgust about myself still looking like a guy and detesting that about myself..

zauraz,asktransgender,'This is not about your body!',"I talked with my mom today. We got into me being transgender and she finally asked if I wanted to be a girl. I ended up indirectly admitting that I am not so much for the social parts but I want a female body.

After questioning me if I wanted to change it all up etc putting me on the spot she entered another line of discussion that was related to something I had mentioned earlier. She told me that the consequences I should seek were those that did not kill me. I admitted there that I was probably hit a point if I did nothing where the pain I believe I am feeling will kill me.

She eventually told me that maybe I needed to find balance and myself, that I should put this aside and confirm who I am personality wise. Even suggesting that I travel to other countries etc to take a break from thinking about being trans. I sort of wanted to yell at her by then that 'I can't choose to not think about being trans but I did not. She followed by telling me that I should be true to my inner self and let go of my outer self. I told her that I would be the same but it was my body in where the problem lied and then she told me in a loud voice that ""this is not about your body!"" like the title and repeated the same thing as earlier.

Following this she asked if I hated my body which I admitted that I did and now she returnt to my surgery which she tried to use to explain me being trans. I had genitalia surgery that affected the appearance of them and she told me somehow that this had changed me and maybe that was why I hated my body. I tried reminding her that I had feelings like this before that during a hard time in my life. She did not truly buy that but my dad got home then and we had to quit. She told me in the end that they would 'accept' whatever choice I made.

Entering that conversation was during a all time high feeling emotionally although afraid to tell anyone in my gender but it left me an emotional wreck without any form of finality. I almost broke down when I got out of her site. I don't know why but exactly the same mood in that conversation has triggered a fight and irritation before and completly ruined my sense of security. I always start doubting feeling wrong and that I am a freak starting unnecessary problems.

My mother also specifically wanted me to talk to my psychiatrist about the genital surgery and get that 'fixed'.....

My parents want grandchildren and reminded me of this several times. They also keep telling me that they will accept me whatever I choose but that acceptance is based around me remaining male or risk of death. Not true acceptance. 

Both have at several times indirectly implied and pushed me towards 'remaining me'. 

I can't think of nor desire anything in the future really except being trans right now which also stresses the shit out of me...

I don't know anymore what to do and I am afraid of telling my parents that those conversations hurt...

Questioning250,asktransgender,Can a CIS person have literally almost word for word the same experience as a trans person?,"I've been going in circles w/ my questioning after about 5 months of doing so now. I'm making no progress lately so I was about to just stop questioning for awhile. Then after reading a trans women's experience on an old post, I realized mine has been almost word for word just like hers w/ very minor differences. I'll copy the comment below:


As I started having thoughts about sex and started actually having a libido, I found myself having sexual thoughts about being a girl. I'd imagine myself being physically female and everything and it was about the only fantasy that I really enjoyed. I would usually fantasize about having lesbian sex with someone.

I have a sort of fetish for transformation stuff as well which I honestly don't understand very well, but I think it comes from growing up with cartoons and other kids' shows that always had transformation elements in their stories. Animorphs, Street Sharks, stuff like that. When I was growing up I'd frequently fantasize about shapeshifting into various things. I found that gender swaps were the most interesting however, especially when it was a boy being turned into a girl. One that sticks out in particular is the episode of The Fairly Odd Parents where Timmy gets himself turned into a girl, which apparently aired when I was 11 years old. Most boys would find the idea of that happening to them pretty weird or awful, but I wanted that to happen to me more than anything.

When my sexuality kicked in and I started fantasizing about being a girl sexually, a certain part of my imagination sort of got wrapped up in it and I'd start fantasizing about not just being a girl, but being turned into one. I'd imagine myself growing breasts and losing my penis and getting a vagina in its place, my face changing and my skin softening, etc.

This was all before I knew anything about transition. This was before I knew anything about male and female hormones, and before I really understood the difference between male and female puberties.

I desperately wanted to grow breasts and a vagina, because I desperately wanted to go to school and live as a girl. I felt like a girl sexually and mentally, so much so that for a while I thought I could actually just sort of ""think"" it into happening, like if I wanted it strongly enough or prayed every night, I would just eventually start growing breasts and lose my penis. Obviously that never worked and after a while I just gave up on the idea of becoming a girl, and instead just looked at all of my behavior as a sexual fetish.

I eventually found myself google searching for websites that had stories and comics about boys/men being turned into girls/women, and that became the porn and erotica I looked at regularly for the next several years. I also remember going on YouTube and looking for various videos where a guy would be turned into a girl.

I did not always accept this behavior of mine however, and for a while I constantly tried to prevent myself from wanting to be a girl or having sexual fantasies where I was or became one. I tried thinking about having penis-in-vagina sex with a woman but it was just never appealing to me, and I got really frustrated that I wasn't normal.

theone23four,asktransgender,"Prescribed medroxyprogesterone (provera), but from research it is different than bioidentical progersterone?","Can anyone tell me what the differences in effects are? Also, I saw [this](http://www.collierdrug.com/progesterone-vs-medroxyprogesterone/) which seems to say bioidentical progesterone is better."
Digitallyendowed,asktransgender,So confused it sucks,"Am I just a cross dresser or am I transgender? 

I cross dress a lot, and it is very euphoric and sexual for me. I can only ever get off by imagining myself as a woman and acting stereotypically feminine sexually.

I used to think this was just a fetish but now I am not so sure and I feel it may be linked to something deeper.

For starters sometimes, (aka when I am not blocking it out (I think,)) I really wish I was born a girl. I get jealous of woman all the time, and whenever I see an average or attractive woman I just want to be her, and not just in a sexual way but just in general, wanting to be a woman.

And that's another thing I have been noticing for some time; when I cross dress it is no longer purely sexual; I get a sense of euphoria, energy, happiness, peace/relaxation, and it just sort of feels right. I find myself sometimes sleeping dressed up and it is always such a deep full filling sleep.

I have had these urges/desires since I was a kid, and have routinely repressed them and blocked them out by going what I call ""man mode,"" where I will immerse myself in masculinity as much as possible, to compensate.

 I'll lift heavy weights, go on the heavy boxing bag, beast mode any exercise, expose myself to cold temperatures with light clothing until I can't notice it any more, only ever wearing a t shirt even if it's frozen over outside, ignore pain, speak as deeply as I can, try to snuff out any feminine mannerisms, religiously avoid anything remotely feminine, blunt my emotions, the list just goes on and on...

 But while I am doing all of this man mode stuff I get constant intrusive thoughts (I have severe ocd) about being a girl. Relentlessly. I can't even be in the same room as a girly advert without it triggering me immensely and making me intensely stressed. We have a pink curtain in the dining room and if it touches me while I am in man mode I can just feel the cortisol surging.

So eventually I give into these intrusive thoughts and urges, usually around the time they tune into intrusive intoxicating dreams about being a woman. And it feels great. I dress up again, get very aroused, watch girly tv shows while dressed just feeling great and imagining myself as a woman, being jealous of all the woman in the shows etc.

Then of course I get all paranoid and guilty and go man mode again. Just a constant cycle.

I have made a couple posts about this and from what I have been reading it is looking good like I may well be transgender, but would soooo appreciate more opinions. Please feel free to check my 2 other posts about this topic for more insight!

It's just so hard to get it all out there, to explain the situation accurately and there are so many different opinions on here.

markershark,asktransgender,Is It Wrong to find Transgender Women Attractive? (NSFW),"Hello everyone, I'm a cis male and I've got a question about sexual preferences and pornography. I'm attracted to women with penises, and often look at porn depicting such women.  However I've seen people saying that this whole genre of porn is dehumanizing and fetishizing of trans women. This is something that I've been thinking about recently, and I'm worried I may be doing something morally wrong. 

I try to be kind to people, and I respect trans women as much as anyone else. I'm attracted to women with penises in the same way someone may be attracted to people with blonde hair or well-defined muscles; It's a trait I think makes someone sexy. But is this objectification? Is porn depicting transgender women harmful to the community? I'd like to ask you all your opinions on this matter. Also, I'm sorry if anything I've said has been harmful or inappropriate, I tried to find the best way to word everything."

I don't know why It is so hard, this is one of the main reasons I'm seeing a therapist anyway. I'm afraid to talk about it, maybe because I've literally never verbally talked about it, but, I don't know. I just feel like I'm lying to my therapist whenever its brought up, and I feel guilty. No matter how true my feelings are, I feel guilty when I talk about them. It has been *my* secret for so long, I just don't know how to express it to anyone else.

I don't really know what I'm asking here, but it's bothering me like no other. I just want to be able to express my feelings to the person who is there to help me. It probably has to do with my anxiety.

Last night they came to town to have dinner after my birthday and—needless to say—they knew something was different. They spent all night lecturing us and reminding us that after graduation (a few months from now) they'd feel totally fine cutting off any financial support. It was clear why they said this; they both noticed I think, the changes in my face, and when we hugged good by I know they noticed the little boobs that have formed.

My fiancée has always been close to her family and I like them too. But I'm worried about coming out, soon at the rate things are changing, and ruining her family life &amp; her relationships.

However, my feelings over the last year have changed immensely, and I realized that the similarity to my deadname was bothering me, so after some reluctance I changed my name to Naomi about three weeks ago (not legally but). Feels kind of embarrassing, but I think it is better this way. Was just wondering if anybody here has done this sort of thing, maybe even for similar reasons?

I researched tucking last night (researched again really, I'd been curious since before I accepted I'm trans), and gave all 3 methods I'd found a try. First, sit on toilet, tuck everything back, close legs, and slowly stand. No good. Next, pull the penis gently back between the legs, and the tesyes should tuck themselves. Nope. Finally, actually using my hands to try to guide the testes into the canal that's supposed to be there. Worst yet. Couldn't find the canal, or couldn't get the tastes is, and quickly got so frustrated / grossed out / nervous (my worst dysphoria ever) I had to stop after about a minute of trying. Then I got angry and frustrated because I so rarely get grossed out or frustrated to the point of rage quitting whatever I'm doing. Ruined my evening, and now is continuing to ruin my day.

-sonofa,asktransgender,i am a dissociative guy in a female body wondering how similar / different my personal experience is to non-dissociative trans people,"
hey 

I am a guy who lives in a female body.
I am part of an unintegrated personality (i/we have a complex dissociative disorder) so I don't really identify as trans as such but instead I think of myself as a cross-gender-alter.
Because of that particular situation I've always wondered if certain parts of my experience are shared by (some) trans people with an integrated personality (ie people not dealing with a complex dissociative disorder/not identifying as multiple/plural) so I wondered if any of you would indulge my curiosity?

1. So I am a guy. I've been a guy for as long as I've had a concept of gender but obviously my sex doesn't match. Do you also feel that you ARE and have always been your preferred gender, even though your sex doesn't match?

2. Personally I believe gender is for the most part a social construct - I don't think there is really any inherent difference between women and men other than their biology. I don't believe that that biology has a significant bearing on 
personality, likes, dislikes, wants etc. I am convinced we're all the same when we're kids but people who are viewed as girls are encouraged to be more aware of and nurture their ""feminine"" traits and are shamed (maybe in the home but definitely by societal norms) into repressing/being less aware of their traits perceived as ""masculine"" but to me all traits/behaviours thought of as ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" are in reality all just part of being human,  Whether we dare acknowledge the full gumot of them in our self or not.
 
so given the above opinion it's kind of mind bendy that I am a dude when my body's sex is clearly female.  
Is it really just about your sex for you (like for me - something sure is missing) or is actually about gender and if so what does gender mean to you? Do you perceive an inherent difference between guys and girls? 

3 
Obviously mirrors and bathrooms and all that is torturous but do you recognize yourself in your facial features? Does that look like a versison of yourself, just of the wrong sex?
I am asking because my internal self image is a far cry from my physical reality. For instance, I am convinced I have a different hair and eye colour to what my body really has. I expect myself to be a slightly different height and build (even though I understand my physical reality). Do you share similar feelings about your physical appearance?

I am sure there are about 3 million things I am forgetting right now.


EDIT: Thought of one of the millions. I am pretty closeted although I am out with a couple of people. Do you feel odd around people of what is per your internal experience the opposit gender? I am straight (seen from my viewpoint anyway). I think that plays a role in why I have this guilt over not disclosing that I experience myself as male.  I feel that women would react differently to me if they knew that's how I identify. Like, there would be less physical closeness etc. so eventhough I know I have a right to privacy that doesn't really compute and I feel like an interloper, like i am taking advantage just by existing. That's really stifling me making connections with people AT ALL. And I don't mean sexual, I mean AT ALL. Anyone struggle with similar guilt/shame?


Any responses will be much appreciated

Thanks

The only transgender people I've met were already fairly androgynous in the beginning, so presenting as one gender or the other isn't terribly difficult (though it takes some effort). I've been wondering for a while now what it'd be like for someone who wasn't so androgynous.

he_wears_panties,asktransgender,Do trans support groups help you? I went to my first trans support group and now I feel terrible.,"I went to my first trans support group a few days ago and I have to say I feel worse having gone to it.  Hearing the challenges and difficulties of people who are mid-transition was terrifying and heart breaking.  I've never been more afraid to take the next step than I am now.  

Finding a home after 5 months of being homeless because your landlord kicked you out for being trans or finding a part-time minimum wage job after you got fired for coming out as trans at your previous job are not things that should have to be celebrated.  These are basic and essential human rights.  I know there is still a lot of trans discrimination in the U.S. but I live in a very progressive city and had thought we were much further along in our society than we seem to be.  

I now wonder if being closeted trans is less painful than being out to the public.  Aside from living with crippling dysphoria I have a pretty good life––I have a master's degree, I am pursuing my dream career, I have a car and a safe place to live, etc.  Does coming out mean I will potentially be giving some of these things up?  I don't want a good day in my life to be one where I don't get harassed or where I find a home to live in after I'm homeless just for being trans.  

Does anyone else understand what I'm going through?  Can you offer any advice on how to cope with this feeling?

Just for the record I am MTF pre-everything and I presented male at the group.  I've only ever gone out in public once in girl mode.

All help is appreciated.  Thank you."
its_snorlax,asktransgender,So how do I even start HRT?,"Hi, first time posting here. So I've more or less considered myself to be trans (MtF) for about two years now. At one point I considered self medicating but I decided I didn't want to risk, uh, dying.

So, now I guess I want to do it the ""legit"" way, by going to a therapist/specialist and getting a diagnosis. But I just realized that I actually have no idea how I'm supposed to do that.

Where do I even start? Additionally, is there any way I can do this without my parents knowing? I'm 20, but I still live with them and am financially dependent on them. I don't have a job right now, but that may change soon.

How long might I expect it to take to get a diagnosis and prescription? Would being totally honest about how I feel about everything make it harder to get them? It's not like I never have doubts about this, but I've heard a lot of horror stories about how some therapists really just want you to fit totally neatly into the common ""i've always known for sure since i was born and i only ever like to do girl things"" narrative and I would also like some insight into how true that is. I would like to use this as an opportunity to talk about the things that bother me but not if it's just going to just hurt me in the long-run if I get denied treatment because I wasn't convincing enough to them or something.

Other MtF's say their mood swings consist of randomly crying or feeling depressed, and while I've experienced all of that as well, on top of that I'm frequently hangry (hungry and constantly on the verge of being immensely pissed off about something). My mum constantly tries to help me or give advice or suggest stuff (being supportive but not knowing when to stop), and even THIS pisses me off, like I just want her to leave me alone and stop treating me like a fragile tween.

Has anyone experienced this? Does it go away?"
AbruptlyBlue,asktransgender,Is there a consensus of the definition for Transgender?,"I've always assumed that the definition of transgender was essentially the one listed in the /r/asktransgender wiki

&gt; Transgender - adj. The state of one's gender identity not matching one's assigned sex.

However, I was doing a weekly reading for a University class and came across a much broader definition for transgender which included cross-dressers, drag queens, and a few others. The author cited a source for their definition but for the life of me I can't find where it is listed in the article. I also found that the American Psychological Association has a similar definition [listed.](http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx)

My question while simple likely won't result in a simple response but is there a consensus within the community of what the definition is, and if so, what is it?"
elsnow112,asktransgender,MtF Tucking Help (NFSW),"So, I've always had issues with tucking, typically she'll just creep out of whatever position I put her in regardless of what method I use (I was always a grower). However, I could get by as long as I adjusted every hour or so.

I've been on hormones for about 9 months, and I am one of the fortunate girls to have a good amount of hip growth. The problem I'm having is that my pelvis has widened so at this point my legs never touch when I'm walking. At this point it's hard to stay tucked for more than a few minutes, and it's really frustrating. Obviously this is amazing because I plan on getting SRS, but this is still 18 months out. Has anyone had this issue or have any strategies that work well? I already wear 2 pairs of panties that are athletic style, and tight pants. It's not a huge issue in the winter, but I have no idea what I'm gonna do once the weather gets warm."
PrincessLobster,asktransgender,Voice training makes my whole head tense and sore - normal?,"So I'm just starting voice training using the method where you swallow to pull your larynx up and then hold it there to build strength and control. I've gotten to the point where I can hold it there and breath through my mouth and nose at the same time, but holding it in place for more than a minute or two makes all the muscles in my head sore (especially in the back of my neck and head), and it kinda gives me a headache. Is this normal because all of those muscles need to get stronger, or am I doing something wrong?"
StormyGrey_IceQueen,asktransgender,Having second thoughts...,"I finally got an appointment at the IC clinic and my hair is long enough now that I'm starting to get gendered correctly even when I'm not trying too. 

But now that I have the appointment and everything is lined up, the burning desire to transition is gone. It's been replaced with a confusing mash of feelings including:

* ""Do I really want to live life as a girl? It's easier to live life as a guy, I can do it well, and I'm popular as a guy. I have no idea how to live life as a girl, dress correctly, or hold myself in a feminine manner.""

* I've never had a male libido. I've never had the want or desire to do anything with a girl. I'm now having a lot of flash desires (flash because they don't last long) towards hooking up with a girl. Which I don't understand because I like men, but I'm too scared to do anything with them. 

* ""I'm not going to make a good girl and successfully transition. I don't shave my legs regularly, my voice sucks, and whenever I tell people I'm trans they say they can't believe it because I act so masculine.""

I'm just super confused right now. I thought I had myself figured out, I was happy with the path I was on, and now I just don't know. A lot of my reservations are based out of fear but I'm not sure if I can overcome those. I can't help but wonder if I'm actually not transgender deep down and that I'm making a huge mistake by trying to transition and all I am is a crossdresser who isn't okay with the idea of a man dressing in woman's clothing so I'm trying to change my whole gender so that it's okay in my mind.

The flip side of that however is I can't imagine a future as a guy. I have no dreams, no aspirations, or any desire to really do anything in this life as a male. I honestly feel that I would be happier as a female, but the idea of being in the transition period halfway between male and female in societies eyes scares me beyond belief. tl;dr: I just want to be a girl and I don't want to have to go through the process of transitioning

**tl;dr: I got an HRT appointment and now I'm worried it's a mistake and I'm wrong about what actually makes me happy**"

I found out when I was around 13 years old. I didn't know about gender transitions or anything but I knew I wasn't straight. I also kept thinking how great it would be to be a girl. So about a year ago I met a transgender person. He told me about himself and I learned about changing your gender. I told him that I feel more like a girl yesterday and he said he knew, because of the way I am. But here starts my confusion. I told my mum and purposely didn't tell my dad, because I already know how he would react. I expected my mum to understand, but she didn't. She keeps saying I'm a guy and that she's sure about it. But now I am confused. What are your thoughts on this? Please let me know.

Update: So I told my dad and he says they won't make me a girl anyway. I nearly gave up but I know I'm a girl. I do feel terrible now and I don't know what to do now. But I'm not giving up on becoming who I really am."

JennyLadyBug,asktransgender,IF you DID bank...was it worth it? Or if you regret not banking...,"Sorry that this question isn't very inclusive.

My plan from the beginning has been to bank before HRT, now I basically have the greenlight for HRT from my therapist and endo but I can't get in to see a urologist about banking until late next month at the earliest. I'm really struggling with the decision. I know it's only a month or two of my life and I am still young. But my dysphoria is getting worse and worse and I'm afraid of being suicidal...

Another issue is money, the only way I can afford it is if I do it out of my tax refund since it is the one transition related thing my insurance won't cover.

I have read the threads from people who didn't bank saying they don't regret it in the least, but I definitely want to have children someday, and I am not against adoption, but as someone who loves history and genealogy I want to preserve my bloodline if I can. That's why the decision is so hard for me. I feel like if I don't bank I'm throwing away some degree of fulfillment I'll experience in the future.

I just kind of wanted to feel out if there was much support for this side of the issue in the community, since I've seen so many pro-not-banking posts..."

At a trans group I lead, one of the women there had SRS with Schaff in Germany (My only doctor at the moment  is Liedl in Munich...and she was saying there is a world of difference between schaff and liedl (Schaff uses a method different than what most western surgeons are doing, Liedl does the modern Penile Inverison with scrotal graft. basically the same thing every other western surgeon does)

I REALLY hate hearing stuff like this, as I was on a natural high learning one day I WILL get a pussy despite having HIV, and then I went to being kinda mad, can't keep shaking the feeling my pussy will be ""2nd rate"" I almost don't know what to do...I have really bad genital dysphoria (I blame the hiv on it in the first place), but I also don't want something I'd be unhappy with BUT beggars can't be choosers. Going to Liedl would pretty much be like going to Brassard or Bowers or any other ""name brand"" western surgeon and I see tons of posts saying how they make wonderful vaginas. Also, a girl at the meetup said she fucked a liedl pussy and said it was nice...still can't shake the feeling.. uhhhhgggg

I don't see them very often and we were catching up and whatnot.  My one friend works with troubled youth out in a very rural part of the country and was saying how the organization has its first transgender client.  He was saying how no one knew how to respond or if to take her (mtf) seriously and how because he knew me, he was able to step up and help validate her to the other staff.  

I'm just touched that me being my trans self ( which is a result of me lurking around here with all you trans selves) that my experience helped validate another individual.  It just goes to show, no matter how dark and depressing your transition might be, your experience is helping to validate countless others who may have stumbled down a less fulfilling path and I wanted to thank all of you for your part in this!"

The_Deaf_Guy,asktransgender,Deaf person with hormones question,Hi all! I'm a deaf person with bilateral cochlear implants (one on each side) and I've always had problems with my maps (programming of the implants to resemble a hearing 'map' of a non-hearing impaired person). A lot of things can influence the maps such as hormones which was what happened during puberty. So I'm interested in taking hormones but I really do not want to change my maps because that involves a lot of audiology appointments which involves money and is basically a headache for all involved. I'm also not out to anyone so I can't just go ask my audiologist about this. So I wanted to see if theirs anyone on this subreddit that can help with this question. Thanks!
Abby_Road88,asktransgender,Dysphoria worse after HRT?,"After 4 months on hormones I find myself experiences more and more sever bouts of dysphoria.  It's all starting to add up and culminate in one giant mess of emotions that I don't know if I can handle.  I'm still presenting as a male, and feel like, although I am out to most people, my job makes it impossible to transition halfway through the year.  I am a teacher, and although I have the support from my school, it would be way too hard on the kids to come back one weekend and have gone from Mr. To miss.

Girl me is trapped in my apartment it's beginning to really drive me crazy.  Additionally, the dysphoria I am experiencing from my body issues has been the worst it's ever been.  Am I putting to much faith in hormones?  I look at my body, and I am just grossed out and infuriated with what I see.  Even though my legs are shaved, I've had a few laser sessions on my face and I feel like I began in a really good starting place in regards to my height/weight.  However, when I look in the mirror I HATE my face.  It's like hormones are making me realize just how much I really hate my body?  In a weird way, there is an exhilarating rush that comes with these feelings, because although they cause me physical and mental distress, they at least validate my questioning of my gender identity.  I guess that's a good silver lining.

Sorry for all the text.  I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this surge of dysphoria after starting HRT?"

ChickenCake248,asktransgender,Apparently I was hit on a couple times and I didn't know,"I know I've been cat called and honked at, but my girlfriend told me that there were a handful of instances where guys were actually hitting on me. I was totally oblivious and thought they were just being friendly ... awkward."
aconfusedmoron,asktransgender,Lack of dysphoria making me worried I'm not trans?,"I show a lot of signs of being trans: fixation on anything with gender bender / crossdressing / trans elements, daydreaming consistently about being or turning into a girl/woman for years (and dying in all other fantasies), using a girl's name online for no particular reason and liking being called she, the magic button test, etc. But I don't think I really feel dysphoria exactly, which makes me worry that this is an idle but unimportant fantasy that I have ascribed too much significance to.

Socially, being called ""he"" never bothered me before I started thinking about all this stuff consciously, and it still only feels kind of off, which could easily just be because I'm expecting (hoping?) for it to feel off. (Except when I use a feminine name online, being called ""he"" in that context always felt pretty bad.) There are aspects to being perceived as male that I don't like, like that I might be automatically perceived as a threat, and I feel like I would rather be seen as a woman, but I don't hate being male or anything.

Physically, again, I'm not sure I actually feel any dysphoria. I mean, I've always been embarrassed about my body hair (avoided swimming / buttoned shirts too high / avoided shorts so that people wouldn't see my chest/leg hair), and I've felt better now that I've shaved them off, but I'm not sure that's a strong enough feeling to count? Maybe it's a definitional thing. If a trans woman doesn't like her receding hairline, we say it's dysphoria, but if a cis man doesn't like his receding hairline, we don't? If someone who hasn't learned to shave yet obsessively uses scissors each day to cut off every piece of their beard that's long enough to cut, is that dysphoria, or is it just that some/most men prefer to be cleanshaven anyhow? I've never especially liked my body after puberty (except my hands which are unusually small), but not in an obvious BREASTS SHOULD BE HERE sense?

The only time I've felt something similar to how I've heard dysphoria described was a weird panic attack (the only panic attack I've ever had) where I held a skirt up in front of me in front of a store mirror to see how it would look, and had this overwhelming feeling of doom that my face was wrong, that it looked more like a cave-troll than a human, that it was awful and I was stuck with it forever. Which lasted a couple of minutes and was very distressing. But it also only happened once.

The ""That was dysphoria?"" article that gets linked a bunch sounded similar to my experience... but it also sounded very similar to depression in general, which is something I suffer from.

I'm wondering why I'm thinking about all this if I can live fine as a guy. But then I remember that a few years ago I planned on killing myself for no obvious reason, and depression's been interfering with my work a lot, so maybe I'm not living as fine as I think? Like, maybe dysphoria is causing my depression feelings and I'm just not properly connecting the feeling to the source?

I do know that the couple of times I decided not to crossdress for a few days (I didn't start crossdressing until I started thinking about this stuff and usually just do so in the evening in my room), I didn't hate wearing only guy clothes and was worried that meant I wasn't trans. Also I felt kinda down those days. Then when I put girl clothes on again I felt better and realized that I had actually felt more down on those days than I thought, and  while I still can't directly tell where that feeling came from, the correlation with only wearing guy clothes seems like solid evidence. That seems to establish that in this particular case that I can feel bad from boy stuff without it being obvious to me that the boy stuff is making me feel bad, so maybe the same is true in other ways too? I'm not sure."

(*Insert typical trans timeline from 8 y/o until realizing the upcoming depression has to do with gender dysforia*). And here I am, 25 y/o starting HRT within 2 weeks.

However. I am feeling so bad about transition due to my dads wish to have a son. Newly he said to me ""it doesn't matter if I got 3 daughters, or 2 daughters and 1 son"". But I know he doesn't mean it, and it's making me sad. I want to make my parents proud.

But when I think about it, I have always tried to make them proud, and I partly did succeed in some areas, got a good job, financial independent, car etc... But I was always feeling like going on autopilot. And now it's feeling like I am betraying them/especially him.

I just wanted to get this out. I don't expect any answers. It's just feeling so good to be able to share the feelings here. I'm really thankfully that Reddit exists.

If you have similar experiences, how do you cope with it? How did you overcome the betray feeling? Or maybe you just didn't care about your parents thoughts? Interested."
reallyconfusedone,asktransgender,How comes gender identity and orientation are separate?,"Let me say first that under any circumstances I'm not saying they are not, I just want to hear what others think. 

I identify myself as a bi despite the fact my orientation strongly gravitate towards women. After all who says to identify as a bi you need to have 50/50 split. I'd say my orientation is 99% women and 1% men (it takes very specific men to turn me on). On top of that even if I would be in releationship with such a man I wouldn't be satisfied unless other woman would be present. So basically polyamorous releationship.

Here is a thing I don't understand. If I have such a super strong preference towards women I don't understand why I have need to be one. After all wouldn't it be easier to be bi-male? I would have 1000x times bigger dating pool and much easier life. If I see a cute girl my first thought is ""I want to be her"" and my second ""I want her"".

What kind of cables got crossed in my head? I would totally understand being transgender and being bi with prefererence for men or being transgender with preference for hetero releationship, but this? I don't understand. I feel like my brain has damaged area for gender/orientation and just misinterprets attraction as gender confusion. Is it possible?

I mean, doesn't it sound wierd to you to say I'm MTF and I want to have releationship with woman? I wouldn't even have a problem to have a sex with her and I feel like using my junk wouldn't be any problem (even though I would prefer something else obviously)

I just feel like it invalidate my gender identity and transition would be a big mistake. I don't understand why I would transition if I like women so much, if I can just be in heteronormative releationship possibly add man along the journey later."

The problem is i dont pass and probably wont for a while. A mixture of body weight (Big stomach/chest/shoulders small lower body), money, and deep voice, now im currently working on all them things but i would really like to move forward with my transition without just waiting months for me to lose weight and fail at training my voice. I would like to start Laser hair removal and voice training before i even start presenting, because honestly i don't live in the best areas and it would be dangerous for me to be obviously not passing.

OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,I think realizing who you are and accepting that is one of the best feelings in the world. Wouldn't you agree?,"I feel like regardless of the struggles of coming out or transitioning or dealing with discrimination, that simply finding yourself, finally seeing yourself for who you are, is one of the best feelings in the world.

Just a few months ago, I was a guy who had wanted to be a girl for so long but disregarded it as a fantasy,  who was never truly content with themselves and saw the world as a boring place with something missing.

But now, I've accepted who I am. I stopped running away from my feelings and now I'm so much better off. I'm a girl, through and through, and knowing that fills me with peace and joy. I can proudly say that I'm a girl, that I like guys, and that I know that I'm going to soon be on the road to spending the rest of my life the way I want to.

It's so freeing. And it didn't hit me until quite awhile after coming out to myself just how wonderful it is. I know who I am, I know what I want in life, and I'm not scared to admit that to myself anymore. I can be who I want to be. 

I dunno, maybe this post doesn't make alot of sense. But I'm a 17 year old girl whose dark sky just filled with so many shining stars, and in many ways I've never been this content or happy with MYSELF in my entire life."

LaurenRhymesWOrange,asktransgender,How to be *truly* stealth in the digital age?,"I wonder about this often. I'm coming up on two years of HRT and trying to figure out what is next. I play around with the idea of going stealth in the future, but I wonder what that actually means.

I have a paper trail of my past that accumulated over the first 24 years of my life of living as a male. College transcripts. Name on old company websites. Published articles in which I was quoted and named. Maybe a half dozen or so pre-transition pictures of me that appear when my old name is Google Searched. Picture and name of me from when I was the prom king of my high school (lol) floating around out there. My name and such in umpteen million databases. I mean, someone could just search my current name or my somewhat unique last name and places I've lived and in five minutes put the whole thing together. I work with data for a living, it's *really* not that hard at all to sync up all kinds of PI. And any company I work for would have at least one HR person know, unless there is some crazy way around this.

If anyone reading this is *truly* stealth, how did you cover your tracks as much as possible? How do you duck or get around documents and conversations and interactions that may reveal some significant personal information that would lead someone to knowing you are trans? At what point did you even make the jump to stealth?

This is part thought experiment but part functional for me as I try and figure out what to do going forward.

Thanks for any info you can provide or experiences you may share! :)"

throwmeinthetrash144,asktransgender,Straight(maybe?) and looking for answers.,"Hi. Really not sure where to start or if I'm even in the right place but hopefully I can get some perspective. Typing from mobile, sorry for any formatting issues.

I've always identified as a straight male &amp; I've always been quite effeminate. Now in my mid 20s I've come in contact with some friends in my local music community that have shed light on some feelings I wasn't aware we quite as.. prevalent. It started with painting my nails and wearing jewelry. I felt pretty. Not just attractive but pretty, idk. I've started wearing lipstick and eyeliner and wearing women's clothes when playing shows sometimes. I feel absolutely wonderful and part of it has to due with my surroundings. Though I'm in a very conservative state, there is a small community of queer folk/trans/femme (sorry if I'm not using the correct words, all this is sort of new for me) that have fostered an environment that's encouraged me to do what I want. I've never felt this way before. I've never not cared wether people that I was queer or not. I've never felt as confident as I do when I feel like I do when I put on makeup, borrow a friends dress and paint my nails. 

This has me thinking a lot about myself personally and my effect on those around me. I've always liked women and only been with women. I've never had a problem acknowledging other men or trans women attractive. I don't really have any intention to try and date men/trans etc. But I don't want to step on people toes once they find out I'm straight. I don't know if I'm crossing a societal line because of the lack of experience with things like this. Idk if this is just a starting point to revealing feelings I'm not willing to dig up right now. I'm just confused. Is what I'm talking about common? Are there straight men who embrace their femininity in this way and don't receive a negative stigma from other trans/queer people? 

Idk. I'm sorry if this is the wrong place or something I've said upsets others in this community. Just looking for perspective. 

Thanks"

GabiCap,asktransgender,"Thinking I'm a ""failed man"" because of porn?","Marking this NSFW because it discusses porn....

So at one point in college my first girlfriend (now my best friend) suggested an open relationship. I went for it, not wanting to lose her. She started seeing a guy, attractive guy, African-American. I couldn't handle it so we broke up (eventually to get back together).

When we broke up, I turned to cuckold porn, especially regarding race. It became an addiction (and still porn I enjoy watching). At that time my depression reached new levels.

Looking at it now, while my ""trans"" thoughts came after this (and first manifested for a couple months freshman year of high school, only to resurface 7 years later), I can't help but think maybe these thoughts are because I'm so deeply entrenched in this porn that I've brain washed myself into thinking I'm trans because I'm less of a man.

hey_its_Espeon,asktransgender,High Heels for at home?,"I've been thinking alot more about girl clothes and stuff, and I also stumbled upon high heels. I LOVE high heels.

Today's my birthday and my parents gave me quite a bit of money because I turned 18. I've been looking online for high heels because I REALLY want a pair for myself at home. The only problem is that I have to let my mom buy them because I'm kinda bad at handing money so I don't have access to my bank account.

I found a pair that I was SUPER BADLY and they're fairly cheap, like 80% off for a couple of days. Should I just tell it to my mom? I doubt she will understand because, well, I don't have normal girls' shoes aside from the pink ones I wear nearly every day.

What should I do???

BrainBattle,asktransgender,I'm more than a little confused...How do I know if I'm really trans?,"Hi, I'm 20 years old. I was born a female but I don't feel like this is how it was supposed to be. First off, and I know sexuality and gender identity aren't connected, I started heavily questioning my sexuality when I was around 12/13, and came out as a lesbian to my family when I was around 15/16. I immediately regretted it, but I stuck with it and still agree that I am a lesbian (I don't date, etc so it doesn't come up often), but I lean more towards bisexual, I suppose.


 My bigger issue is that I am not very comfortable as a woman (at least not all the time) but I'm not sure what I actually am. This started around the same age I started questioning my sexuality. Most of the time, I'm just *me* ,I try not to think about what gender I am--I know I have big boobs and a big ass and sometimes I like that fact while other times it makes me want to die. I wear very very little makeup, and don't often dress super girly, but I get in that mood every once in a while until people start telling me how pretty I am and it worsens my depression and I don't want to wear dresses anymore. 


I get extreme baby fever, I love kids and I want to be pregnant--it's this insane heart clenching feeling and I can see it happening one day, and then then next I just want to be a man. I still want kids, and obviously adoption and surrogacy are options but I get that feeling so strongly I'm not sure if I could actually be a man...I think that makes sense. I'm just so confused and for the past week I've sunken into another darker depression and this is at the forefront of my mind. How do you know? How do I you really really know for sure?

UndeadBane,asktransgender,Can anyone recommend an English-speaking therapist in Berlin?..,"Hi everyone from a long time lurker!

Can someone please recommend a good therapist to visit in Berlin?
The problem is, I've known I am a trans (mtf) for quite some time. At first, I denied it, then I feared it, but the more manly I had became to look (and I had to go through hormone autoimmune sickness therapy which made me bulkier really fast) - the more disphorya was kicking in. 
I literally could not do anything about it nor seek any help, as I originally come from Russia, where such actions were downright dangerous, but now, since I've moved to Berlin I really need some help. 
I have a great supporting wife, to whom I came out fairly recently, but that support is already not enough, while disphorya gets stronger and stronger. Additionally, I most likely can't pursue an HRT, because with the way I look (not even the bulky build, but my face) I feel will never ever be passable - and that depresses me even more. 

If someone could share a contact, or suggest some alternative, please, your help would be so greatly appreciated!

KBAREY,asktransgender,I (Cis/22/M) am very attracted to MtF transwomen and am not sure how to feel about it,"OK, a little background here. I'm a 22 year old cis guy, about to graduate college. I'm straight and have never had a girlfriend, probably due to being a quiet/solitary person in general. 

Last year I started talking to a trans girl I knew via an online forum we both used. We started talking and really clicked - we had similar personalities and interests, she's very nice, etc. For a variety of reasons (long distance being one of them) we never become more than friends, but we did develop a weird online FWB equivalent where we flirted and cybered with one another almost daily. 

My point in bringing this up is that, ever since meeting that girl, I've found that I'm suddenly *very* attracted to transgender women. My friend sent me a few pictures of her dressing up and I honestly was more attracted to her than most porn stars I've seen. When I see a girl who I know is trans (or who I think might be passing) I find it hard to stop stealing glances. 

I don't really know why this is. I'm definitely not a chaser, since I don't really do any romantic pursuing to speak of and mostly keep to myself. I don't think it's a fetish, since, as with anyone, I wouldn't let physical attraction override incompatible personalities (another trans woman from the same forum I find to be physically attractive but personally insufferable). And I don't think it's entirely sexual - I have a low sex drive to begin with and don't really care about a penis or lack thereof. 

Maybe it's a combination of physical attraction, empathy and admiration? Being trans is hard and, on a personal level, I find it really inspiring and beautiful when a trans woman can embrace who she truly is. And I like the idea of dating a girl who is trans - but less for sex, and more for support. I have a recurring romantic fantasy that involves dating a trans girl and helping her through her transition with financial and emotional support (the former of which I do not have in real life, sadly :P). 

So what do I do? Why do I feel this way?"
shoeroof,asktransgender,what's wrong with me? depressed? just emotional?,"A short summery of my transition history: I realized I was trans 11 months ago. I started HRT (cypro+estradiol) 10 months ago.

I had a rough couple of months in the beginning, with a 10 year relationship breaking apart (not really in the traditional way, but more in a redefining our relationship kind of way) and some pain from a disrespectful friend (11+ years friendship, we're not really friends anymore, haven't spoken since).

But apart from all that shit, I felt very liberated and came out to everyone I knew as soon as I could, and was accepted by everyone. Overall I've been very joyful and enthusiastic. I've met a new wonderful (trans) friend, and we get along really well and understand each others issues.

However, for a while now I've had this bad feeling - I can't really put it into words, because I don't think I've ever felt it before, but it's a deep sadness, emptiness, loneliness, meaninglessness, along those lines. I feel fatigued even though I exercise regularly. I've lost all interest in my old hobbies (computer programming/hacking/administration), music (guitar) and overall curiosity. And I don't really feel I have the energy to take up new ones, don't even know what they would be. I feel distant to everyone (except my new friend), like I'm not getting the deep emotional access that I crave, and it feels like my friends are distancing themself from me. I can't be alone without crying, I don't know where it's coming from - probably that bad feeling I'm trying to describe. I ate some psylocin mushrooms a week ago, to be able to introspect and get new perspectives, to get to the roots of my problem - I just cried and cried the whole trip, 5 hours of crying. Didn't really learn anything else than that the problem is more of a problem than I thought/wanted it to be.

It's not really getting any better, if anything worse, and I'm a bit afraid. I wish I knew what was wrong, so that I could handle the issue, but I have no clue. I mean, I have strong feelings, so I guess I'm not depressed. But life kind of feels a bit pointless/meaningless from time to time and it scares me.

Maybe this is just what life is like with emotions? And I'm not used to have strong emotions.

So maybe my students already know i'm trans and they're fine with it and i'm not kidding anyone.

I'm also a student, and mostly out at school.  Not sure how I want to navigate things there.  It's a very very trans-friendly school and department but there's a decent chance i'll be applying to jobs as a boy when I graduate in a couple months, so I'm not sure the logistics of like, coming out and then asking for recommendations referring to a boy-self, etc.  Does anyone have any experience with things like that?

Now that I'm finished questioning and doubting myself less and less and starting to fail boymode, I probably will just come out totally (except in my classrooms where I teach) and request my new names/pronouns from everyone.  The only thing besides the job logistics is that I don't want to feel pressured to present extra feminine when I don't want to.  Or like people will give me a hard time about new names and stuff if they don't perceive my as wearing women's clothes.


Thanks everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &lt;3"
amon_erin,asktransgender,Masturbation on MTF HRT. (NSFW),"Hi all. I've got a NSFWish question.

I've found that the day after masturbate I feel kind of bad. Like, my anxiety is generally higher, I'm super dehydrated (easily fixed), and I just all around feel not great. I also usually tend to doubt myself more on these days.

Has anyone else experienced this? I'm trying to make sense of it. Because I usually feel fine immediately after. And usually the initial arousal is kind of dysphoria inducing."
flisan91,asktransgender,Is this genius or stupid?,"If you are in the middle of the transition process and you applying for a new job and you think your new employer might be a bit of transphobic. You dress and present yourself as your goal (fully female in this example) at interview. Your new employer will notice that you are trans.

BUT - If you tell them you transitioned from female to male (which is a lie) and that you recently decided to detransition. Your employer will react like its positive. And you will be able to transition. Is this smart?"
sameolddays99,asktransgender,When did you start noticing face changes? What actually changes?,"I'm 4 months into HRT at this point and pretty happy with the changes. So far the biggest things I've really noticed are softer skin and breast growth (really started to take off recently, pretty happy about that one!). I'm not totally sure if anything's changed facially just yet. When I look at pictures from 4 months ago and now I think I definitely look different, but I'm not sure how much of that is due to laser and longer hair. Don't think I'm close to passing just yet but I know it's still really early. Been wondering a lot lately about what hormones will actually help with.

So, what actually changes facially with hormones and when does it start being noticable? Is it actually really noticable or is it all super subtle? Are most of the changes from other things like laser/long hair/makeup?"
OnePunchRoxanne,asktransgender,Is anyone free to PM :(,I hate being transgender.
needhelpplex,asktransgender,I feel useless and worthless (depressed rant),"I'm a 21 year old MtF. Sorry if this is long but I'm crying and need to get some stuff off my chest.

All I've ever wanted to be was a novelist, but it doesn't pay the bills unless you're J.K. Rowling. I got really good marks in school (people thought I would be dux), so my parents have always expected me to go well academically. I studied law for a year and became massively depressed, and dropped out. Then I tried teaching for nearly two years and hated it because I'm an introvert and I don't like kids or public speaking. My parents want me to finish a degree and that they'll pay for it. I feel like telling them I'm not even worth spending the money on. I'll just fail or drop out like I've done since I finished school.

I've considered computer science but I suck at math. I've considered nursing but I have a phobia of needles and blood. Lab technician? I'm not good at science either. There's no degree that I've ever seen that I'd enjoy or be good at, unless it was an Arts degree in literature or history, and neither of them have good employment prospects unless you go into teaching.

I'm only 1 month into my transition, so I'm not even attractive enough to be a cam girl. I wouldn't even succeed at being a prostitute if I tried, that's how worthless I feel.

It's not like I care about money, I don't. But when I add up the costs of hormones, laser hair removal, electrolysis, and all of the surgeries, and the cost of living in Sydney, housing and rent prices, my qualifications and my bank account, I quickly realise that in 10 years time I'll be just as worse off as I am now unless I get a decent paying career. And I can't get a decent paying career, because apparently I just fucking suck at everything. All my siblings and cousins have decent paying jobs and are successful, moving out, buying their first house, etc.

I know my self esteem is in the gutter and I honestly don't even know what to do about it. I have nothing going for me, and absolutely no idea what to do. I feel like a burden on everyone around me, especially my parents. I don't know what to do. :("
SeleneMarie,asktransgender,How to get family to come around?,"Yesterday I forced a confrontation with my mom, probably not the best idea, but I was tired of her running away from the issue. 

I can live with the, 'you are making the biggest mistake of your life' thing because she doesn't understand this yet. She also doesn't understand how I can't just go back to how I was, how now that I'm out I'm pushing things so 'fast' (she has seen the last month, I've seen this for the last 8-10 years minimum..) because for the first time in a long time I see hope. I was unsure at first,but I cannot give this up, which is something I've made clear.

Despite all of this it is clear my 'choice' is tearing her apart. She outright told me she sees her son as dead. Again, something I expected given the stages of grief. But I wasn't ready for the rest. I asked her, 'is it truly so bad to have a daughter?' to which she responds, 'No. I've just had 25 years with a son. Now I see some girl I don't understand at all. So many small things have changed.' How am I supposed to answer that? 

Or this, 'I expected you to bring a girl home, and eventually have kids. Now you are going to be some girl who can't have kids (I can't afford freezing sperm, and I don't want kids at all) who brings other girls home and lives an alternative lifestyle.' To which I ask her again, 'is being a lesbian that bad? This is what I've wanted for years. Its why I couldn't date and a huge part of why I kept myself inside.' She had no answer for me.

I'm the same person I've always been and I'm just dropping the act I've had on a lot of things. I can't maintain the 'cool' in control guy anymore where I bury emotions. That almost killed me. Now I'm trying to use my heart and my head. I probably seem a lot more impulsive then I used to be, but everything I do because I've thought it through. Initially we agreed I would put off HRT for 3 months, one month ago. 

I couldn't do it. Every single day I thought about the pills I had, and how I can't start. It almost put me back to the dysphoria wave I had at Christmas. So I had to. What else am I supposed to do? Go back to being a dead husk inside for 2 more months, when huge changes won't happen anyways?

I love my mom more then anyone else in this world, and she clearly loves me. But at the same time I don't know what to do. I can't go back, I've made that clear. At the same time I want to help her. But she is pushing me away because I've tried to help her understand better.

bstew520,asktransgender,"Clinician in training, what are the most helpful skills you might desire your therapist to have or aspects to be mindful of?","Hi all, 
I'm a cis woman training to be a clinician in therapy. I spent several years working at an inclusive sexual health center which offered HRT services on a sliding scale and am now working towards my MA for therapy. I'm very passionate about being an inclusive, competent therapist and would love some feedback. I so often hear that it can be incredibly hard to find a trans* competent therapist, so I'm curious about what skills would be most important to those in the trans community seeking these services. Have you ever sought therapy before but been turned off of therapy by something a therapist or clinician said or did? What is something you wish they would have offered you or said instead? Thank you so much for your honest, open feedback. I will read each one and take it to heart and mind as I move forward with my education and practice.

GonkDroidOne,asktransgender,Common question I'm sure...,"I've searched a bit through the subreddit and found tonnns of information; however, I couldn't find the droids I was looking for.

I'm in limbo right now about what's going on in my life and my head. All I know for sure is I like crossdressing at the very least. Recently, I've been dressing more and more, and in this vein, I want to go out in public en femme. I'm not on hormones, and I'm not exactly femme looking - though not too masculine either. 

My main concern being this: If I need to pee while out, where do I go? Obviously a family/unisex bathroom if possible, but what if not? 
I don't really care that people will be clocking me outside of the bathroom, but inside.... that just seems like a recipe for disaster being in TN.

I could use the ""men's"", obviously, but what kind of reaction would a ""male"" in a dress and wig elicit? I mean, that applies to the ""woman's"" room as well. 

Thoughts on how to go about this? Right now I'm just thinking I hold it if possible."
NMBusch04,asktransgender,Came out to my wife and the world did not end.,"I came out to my wife as transgender and going ahead with HRT and she surprised me. I expected to get told to leave and a time frame in which to do it. This fear was based on a coming out 16 years ago where I told her I was a crosdresser and also thought I wanted to transition. Well back then she set a don't ask don't tell policy for crossdressing and a divorce for anything along the transition lines. I told her I really just wanted boobs to fill out my girl clothes and she practically yelled at me for bringing it up since she made it clear what would happen.

Well I held out for 13 years trying to repress my feelings and fulfilling my role as the Man of the House. That started failing as my daughters gained independence and graduated high school and college. My role as father was diminished so I had no excuses left to hold down the gender dysphoria. I became severely depressed and withdrawn. I lost all motivation for anything and hope for a happy future. This past summer I planned my suicide to look like an accident so my wife would have a bunch of money to get over the loss of my income while she and the girls picked up the pieces. Then I sought a therapist to help as a last ditch effort to save my life.

It worked but it laid out my GD as the driver for the depression and the only current cure for it is to transition. Knowing my wife's previous response I 'knew' I was going to lose her in divorce and hoped my daughters would still talk to me at least. Since I would lose it all being dead and lose a lot of my life transitioning, the fact that I could still be alive as a woman helped me put away the suicide plan.

So the other night I explained this all to my wife 'knowing' the end was coming and she amazed me. She was not happy with the suicide planning nor the transition but she realized that I have been suffering with this a long time. She also notice through the wash that something had changed over the summer (I have started wearing bras everyday) and figured it had something to do with my gender issue. She decided she valued my companionship and personality more than outward look. She said she has a hard time seeing me in a bra but her discomfort was something she could accept if I got mentally better. I told her I didn't think I'd every be mistaken for a woman but could still be happy with myself as a 'man with boobs' most of the time. She was relieved that I wasn't bent on full time woman presentation so she could still have me as a man. She also said if that changed she would rather we stay together in separate rooms and not separate lives. I am good with that since we are not very sexual beings anyway the rest really doesn't impact us. She agreed I need to do whatever I need to get myself right. She will stick by me as a best friend at the very least and is willing to adjust however she needs to to make that happen.
So I am happy there is a future for us and that I am not losing a big part of my life due to transition. 

We have decided to keep this a secret from the rest of the family writing off my boobs as a side effect from the prostate medicine I am on (a real side effect that I am not experiencing but they don't have to know that.) We will be truthful to the daughters in the summer as they live elsewhere and really will not see any changes until then. We will explain to them what is really going on with me and advise them to use the prostate story when explaining my changes for simplicity in their lives.

We still have things to work out and variables to solve but we are doing it as a team. We are both transitioning together and admit there will be some awkward times ahead. There will also be great happiness to experience now that I am finally coming out of my depression. So life will be different but overall better.

She is truly my love and joy and I know how this must hurt her. I am glad our 30 year marriage has meant more to her than my physically male body. I know that when I am old and in a wheel chair she will still want to be with me and that makes me very happy.

Those who are dreading coming out I know how hard it is but it needs to get done.  People can be amazing when a transition hits home.  Trust yourself, know you are doing the right thing and let your family know how much better you will be after transition."

AgnosticThalassocnus,asktransgender,I would very much appreciate it if some Genderfluid Trans-people could talk about their experiences.,"So I was AMAB and now I self-identify as a person of *trans-feminine* experience. I also refer to myself as *trans*, *transsexual* and *MtF*. I hesitate to refer to myself as *transgender* due to the fact that I don't actively identify as female. In fact, I don't identify with any gender identity at all. I just don't experience gender identity on a conscious level. **But I do** experience gender dysphoria toward my male physiology and socialization. For this reason, I have chosen to transition from male to female and am much happier for doing so.

I've posted here before, but I am getting desperate and really, really need some help. I'm full-time and would actually pass quite well if it weren't for my stubborn beard shadow. No matter what I do, it just doesn't go away. Whenever I look at myself in the mirror, I honestly feel like dying. Unfortunately, there's no way I can afford laser or electrolysis right now, and shaving does absolutely NOTHING for me. I barely have any facial hair to begin with, so I usually just pluck it, but that doesn't make the shadow go away. I am going insane, and permanent hair removal isn't an option. What can I do?"

My genes are really bad, too. My hairline receded pretty bad even though I am so young so no female hairline for me, I had weird eyebrows until today, now I got weird permanent make-up eyebrows that make me look disgusting, my voice is so deep that no matter how hard I try, I just barely get to a feminine voice after all the training and I have to lie on my back and can only hold it for 10 seconds, my chest is disfigured (right half is bigger and tilted outwards and this will probably make my breasts become pretty ugly, above one eye the skin is pushing over my eye 50% of the time. My jaw is monstrous, my hips will probably just grow a tiny bit (narrow hips in family).

I just don't know what to do, I just think death is the only choice. My body is disgusting, I fail at every attempt to make it better, my dreams will never come true, I have no money for surgeries and will not have it for a long time.

I started HRT a little over three months ago. While that could be going better, I've also lost or in the process of losing everything.

It started when I first came out to my closest friends or at least I thought they were. They were let's just say less than accepting and have cut all ties completely. This wasn't too bad because I knew I would need to cut out the negatives but this was just the beginning.

Next came my family. I had already lost most of them long before I started transitioning but the reality of knowing that I'm no longer welcome around them anymore still hurts.

This was followed by losing my job. I held a well paying job but when I went on vacation last week, I came back to find the lock to my office changed and laid off. They even refused to allow me to collect my personal belongings. I'm still gathering information; however, it looks like it's because they were uncomfortable with me.

Next, it looks like my marriage is soon to follow. My wife said she was accepting; however, the reality is much colder as she cannot deal with the loss of the guy I was while struggling to accept the woman I am becoming. Maybe it's salvageable but most likely it's not. We'll see what the coming months have to bring but the storm clouds are gathering overhead.

While I know things will get better, it's still a lot harder than I ever realized. How do you hope and not let the darkness overwhelm you?"

I made my selection and beelined the registers. Human eyes were my enemy and-god damn! The self checkout lanes were closed! I checked out and the clerk glanced at me which of course could only have meant, ""Oh, another effing weirdo."" Though harrowing, this adventure was valuable if for nothing else an adrenaline rush. I kept thinking I could steal a companion's confidence had I brought one but unfortunately, I can't come out to anyone. I go to a Christian college, not only a Christian college but a Church of Christ college. If you don't understand the difference, I, having grown up as a southern baptist, make fun of these people for being repressed! All though I expect all my shopping experiences could only be worse,it'd be difficult to find a supportive friend here. Do I need one or can I get away with Reddit?

Tl;dr I recognize that coming out to someone would help but I'm frightened of coming out due to attending a Church of Christ college. Should I suck it up or keep quiet?"
ekv44,asktransgender,Trans folks who have divorced during/after transitioning -- is there anything to watch out for at my court hearing? Advice is welcome too.,"On Thursday I will have a court hearing for my divorce.  My stbxw and I have mostly been amicable -- we are united in the best interests of our 9-year old son -- and it's an uncontested divorce.  (I don't know why we actually need a court date for an uncontested divorce, but the judge insisted we appear in court,  so ....)

As a trans person, what (extra) documentation should I bring with me to the divorce hearing?  I am already planning to bring a copy of my court order for my name change (from last year), though the original might be filed away somewhere in that same courthouse.  Do I need to bring my birth certificate, or any other ID documents?  

In addition, does anyone know if they bill you for court costs on the spot?  And will the first child support check be due immediately after the hearing?  Finances-wise, I expect to be annihilated -- in all likelihood, I won't even get to *start* saving for GCS until the year 2025 -- but it would be nice to at least have an idea of when it will hit.

Any general advice for appearing in divorce court while trans would be appreciated as well.  Thanks!"

3 months ago I realized I got dysphoria.


In August/September 2016, I was so happy. My life was getting so much better. My social anxiety had been getting better, I managed to get the grades I needed to get into sixth form, I had more friends, everything so was much better.


At the same time, I discovered about being transgender, although at the time I knew for a fact I wasn't. I said one day in the distant future I might be trans, but at the time I thought I was completely cis.


Anyway, in October, everything clicked into place. I discovered I did actually have gender dysphoria. This was the start of october half-term, so I was at home all week. But I had more euphoria than dysphoria. I thought it was great I realized I was trans, and wanted to start transitioning. However, I told myself it was all a phase and it will be over soon, and thought by the start of December it would of all gone. It's the start of Janurary, and it still hasn't.



Now, I am so depressed, suicidal, and just got so much anxiety now. I struggle to talk to people I don't know that well (6 months ago I could just fine), I have no care in life anymore, I've pretty much been told they don't really want me back at sixth form for Year 13.

OK, I could transition. However, I can't afford too, my family + friends will not be supportive, and honestly I'll never be a cis-woman anyway. I'd never have this struggle if I were born female. I'd be totally different, feminine, everything would be so much better.


The thought of transitioning, all the reactions, just everything about it is just making my suicidal. I'll always be trans. I don't want to be. I just want to be a cis like all the other girls. I just think, what's the point in living like this, if I died I wouldn't be like this anyway? If I was told I'd die next week I wouldn't care.



Like, is there any point in life? We all have ambitions for the future, and let's face it, hardly anyone ends up like that. I want to be a woman, but I won't. I even doubt if I will enjoy the transition anyway. 


I literally cannot talk to anyone about this. A couple of best friends know about it, but they don't know about my dysphoric side, and I don't think they think I am being serious about being transgender anyway. Even to myself, I am not sure if I am being serious about being trans.


The only time I am not like this is when I am at school or out with friends, neither of which I have the motivation to do. On the outside, I just seem like any other 17 year old guy, and when I am out I don't really experience much dysphoria anyway. But I almost hate it when it happens, because it makes me doubt I am transgender anyway, which I hate so much.


Around November I was all like ""If I were more dysphoric I would be able to transition more comfortably"", and I kinda hoped that would happen because then I could transition into a girl more easily. Well, that came. Here I am, I'm finding it even harder to transition, I have no money to see a therapist or anyone, even so my anxiety is too much to see anyone anyway, I'm too scared to walk into the GP surgery just to get a referral.



Well, I don't see the point in living anymore. I am living my life, I don't even know who or what I am anymore. I want to be a girl, but I can't so there is literally no point in living anyway. How do I know what I want in the future? Will I be happy that I transitioned in the future or not? I have no idea. It scares me too much.

This is wrong, going through hormone therapy will not make me happy, getting vagioplasty won't make me happy, however it will put me at spiritual ease. I will still be unhappy and happy, and stressed, frustrated. I will still have been sexually abused and have had a bad childhood, I'm not trying to cover up my scars, but embrace myself, my future.

krw13,asktransgender,Just wanting to share!,"So, yesterday, I drove down to the Travis County Courthouse from Fort Worth. I was extremely careful not to drink too much, as I was terrified of the idea of stopping in some small town in Texas to use the restroom.

I arrive early and was one of the first people to enter the courthouse. Most people were completely neutral or used my preferred pronouns without needing to ask. I was already anxious and guarded and a woman at the service desk blatantly and loudly misgendered me. I had to go to the building next door for an atm and had to walk back around the courthouse to re-enter and then down some stairs to make change.

I was tired from limited sleep and a long drive, scared, and now beginning to sweat from walking up and down stairs and the hill the courthouse was on in 3 inch heels and a light sweater which had been totally appropriate for the weather before taking my tour of everything in a mile radius just to complete a simple task.

I get my appointment for 10:45am so I can meet with the judge privately and now have nothing to do for two hours...but I don't want to have any negative interactions and just sit outside the courtroom, tired and drained. I also used the women's restroom, which, given SB6, was totally anxiety inducing. 

I finally get in the courtroom, expecting to be grilled. I don't present at work and I am just so sure this will create issues. The judge was just the most amazing woman ever. She did ask about why I couldn't present at work and I explained I was a flight attendant and dealing with the TSA daily with inconsistent documentation. 

She told me she had considered being a flight attendant and that she loves my company. She asked about my family and my choice of last name. She marked out one portion of my order, but it was pretty insignificant. She signs the order and then says...'Wait!'.

I got really nervous as the legal council who prepared my documentation had slipped in the wording to amend my birth certificate and that is super important to me with the bathroom bills in place. Sure enough, she flips to the second page and I could feel my heart sink...

Instead, she was just looking for my new name which was located on the second page of the order so she could properly congratulate me and told me I make a 'beautiful woman'. I was floored and suddenly on cloud nine.

I couldn't get to the first floor fast enough to print out copies of the order. And now I am just a few days away from having all of my documentation reflect my correct name and gender. I am so excited! This judge was the absolute best! I just had to share my happiness with you guys and tell you there is hope even in Texas!"

Jassy2cute,asktransgender,IT Department Doesn't know who I am LMAO,"Another funny story! I'm about 4 months on hormones, I was able to pass before starting HRT so things just happen to get better.

The same kept happening the more people around the office saw me. This gave me a huge boost in confidence. 

The guys in IT saw me for the first time last week, and all waved hello and kept staring at me. One of them stopped dead in his tracks to look at me.

HE ALREADY KNEW ME BEFORE I TRANSITIONED!!!!! I was dying inside. Like yes the hormones are work, plus I had little make up when this happened.

However, it was really gender segregated, and seems to still be (with a girls camp, and a boys camp). I've since transitioned. Was at girls camp as a kid, but now present as, pass as, and live as male. I don't mind having to be open with them about being trans in order to be a part of the organization/camp again, but in the past (I don't know if they still are) the camp was kind of slightly religiously based, so I don't know how well me being trans would be taken. Though there were people who worked at girls camp who everyone knew were lesbians. (The lady who ran the art building was, and I think had a long term partner at the time...they might have even gotten married at one point, not sure.) Everyone at the camp seemed to be fine with that. But to religiously minded people, trans is often thought of as on a whole different level than being gay, and is still thought of as ""wrong"" or ""too weird"" or something. 

Just reaching out here seeing if there are any other trans people who went to camp there, or who are/were involved in the camp in any way. "

I can't practice my voice/makeup because I don't get alone time (probably an excuse), I haven't bought any clothes (I bought a few ages ago when my brother was still at uni and haven't gotten anymore because I don't feel like I'll wear them because I don't know if I'll ever actually come out as well as again no privacy to get used to it alone).

Body hair still grows fast, barely any boobs, don't think anything is happening to my hips/face (I can't notice a difference). Dr Webberley has said my levels were fine although when I went to CHX they said my e was a bit high. Does having high e cause problems? Also does having a vitamin d deficiency mean much?

literallyjusttrans,asktransgender,Need some reassurance--okay to start on HRT without gender therapist?,"I've been attending a couple of family therapy sessions with a conventional therapist who has a couple of trans clients, but is obviously not very experienced with gender issues. I believe my parents are paying for the therapy sessions.

They were concerned that my desire for taking HRT without having a gender therapist (yet). I'm in an annoying situation where my current insurance is gatekeeping me until next year, and my dysphoria has been through the roof lately. I wanted to start HRT so that I could at least cut the brain fog and be on my way towards transition. I'm going to switch insurance when my work has open enrollment again in a couple of months. Note: Going Informed Consent to get the HRT out of pocket.

For what it's worth, I've been presenting as female full time since November, and I've been generally passing for about a month. I have no doubts about being a transwoman. I just want to get started on the physical transition.

I'd would get a gender therapist out of pocket, but the closest ones are about 30 miles away and I don't have a driver's license yet. Once I do (which will be very soon, but probably a little bit after starting HRT) then I can go out of pocket.

My family, and the therapist, are acting like if I started, I could become an emotional wreck and not have someone to help me through it. My thinking is, I can get on the HRT, continue my transition, reduce my dysphoria, and evaluate how I'm feeling. If I start to really be affected negatively by the HRT then I can just stop, wait until I have more therapy support, and continue afterwards.

I want to at least try it, and see if it's going to reduce my negative feelings and settle my mind a bit more.

Is there anything dangerous about doing this? My understanding is that the HRT is going to alleviate a lot of problems for me, and is not really that dangerous to give a trial run for a couple of weeks. I should know pretty early on if it's right for me."

AliceInDetroit,asktransgender,Any bigender experiences?,"I'm trying to understand bigenderism, and by proxy, understand an aspect of own experience. As a disclaimer, I'm not looking for anybody to offer a label or figure me out; I'm asking if anybody is personally familiar (or has friends) with this dynamic and has any insight or anecdotes to share.

I'm biologically male, heterosexual, married, present masculine, yet the best way I can describe my experience is ""bigender"" (a term that's new to me). I typically identify as male, but I've had a number of times in my life (over a span of decades), where I secretly identified as female and overwhelming felt like I actually was more female than male.

When I say, overwhelming, I mean like a gasping for a drowning breath of air. If I could switch genders during these times, I would.

Then, eventually, I find my way back into my male sense of self.

The older I get, the more frequent, and less disorienting the transitions, likely due to experience. Also, over a lifetime of deep self-exploration, I think I'm coming to the conclusion that both of these are fully true. That, there's a facet of my experience that's 100% female and a facet that's 100% male, and that I can never accept myself as either/or, but only as both/and. I've tried to deny one or the other, and it always leads to dissonance, detachment, and psychological struggles.

I'm still very much on the road to understanding/accepting myself as I am. I've tried to read more about this, but, for most people, it seems gender is still very tightly tied to gender expression.

**TL;DR** I might be bigender? This has no bearing on outward expression for me. Any stories/experiences/insight?"

Dustman28,asktransgender,Why am I the bad guy!!,"I'm so sick of this bullshit I keep getting from my wife and family! (Oh yeah, warning:rant) 

I (28, AMAB) came out to my wife (26, cis-female) a few weeks ago and she immediately brought in her family to back her up in attacking me and telling me I'm confused and ruining my life and marriage for a phase. After a lot of therapy and crying I finally have her convinced that I really do need to transition.

She's set on divorce, which I don't blame her, but she's trying to erase me completely out of her life and blame me for the hardships she is going to face alone as a result of erasing me. I keep offering to help her and that we can stay friends and help her financially, but she doesn't want to.

I'm hurting and vulnerable, my life is changing at a faster pace than expected and she tells me she still loves me out one side and blames me out the other for ruining both our lives ""just to be a woman"". She doesn't want to know anything about what I will face or any steps along the way, but wants to say she loves me still.

I have been faithful, loving, supportive and honest in every way. I didn't tell her I was Transgender when we married because I was in denial, yet I get blamed for being a lying asshole by her family. They want me gone and keep insisting that I will hurt her more on the way out. It is so bad that she/they want me to leave my job (which as of right now has transgender inclusive policies) and leave the state for ""my safety"" and so they won't cross paths with me.

I tried to bring it up without outing myself as Trans to a neutral party and even they insist on me being a scumbag for hurting her and ruining her life. Somehow I don't deserve a shred of sympathy despite all the good I have done for her and her family.

I loved them all, I did so much for them, and now I just feel anger that I am the one shouldering all the hurt, blame and hang ups. I'm planning on coming out to my own family today and I fear them doing the same to me as she and her family did.

What the fuck? Do I just leave everything from my life behind, quit my job, run to another (more trans friendly) state? Do I have the right to even fight for what I want, or am I just a bad guy that lied about being a good person all my life?

TLDR: I did my best and now seen as a bad guy by those I loved. They want me to quit my job and flee the state over coming out. "

backalleybitch,asktransgender,I need to get genital surgery. How can I make this happen in the states?,"I need surgery. I literally can't and won't live without it. I've been trying to get it for two years now and I am so worn out avoiding swimsuits, turning dates down, and getting triggered by other girls just doing normal things. I am done.

I am quitting school because I can't handle another 4 years of this. I want to know what options, feasible or not, are available. I am willing to do criminal things for money and have in the past. I think maybe moving to another state would be good, since my state doesn't even offer healthcare for anybody, period. I am partially a business leadership major and work with a few multi millionaires and I might ask some of them for help, but they are very conservative and the ceo woman I spoke to about this just freaked out and didn't know how to respond when I revealed this to her asking for advice. Oh and I have cut off my family because of lack of support after high school and they are too poor to care anyways.

What ways can you get surgery done?

Be it long shots or illegal means doesn't matter, I am beyond caring about the logistics at this point.

My doctor messed up this week.

throwawayaccount2212,asktransgender,Question about temporarily not taking spiro while continuing estrogen,"Hey everyone. My trans gf went to the doctor today and was told to hold off on taking her Spiro for one week due to a low sodium count on her lab, but that she should continue taking her estrogen in the meantime. She is concerned that her body will convert the estrogen into testosterone without the anti-andro to go along with it. Is this something she should be concerned about, and would it be a better option to just hold off on the estrogen as well until next week and then resume both?

yasqueen123,asktransgender,Confusing Agender Friend in School,"So I have this friend at school who was assigned female at birth and presented as this the first three years of secondary school. Now we are in the fourth year and he came out to me and said that he didn't feel like a boy or a girl. And I was like, okay, cool. 

And then he said that he rather wants to be called by 'he' and 'him' because those are the pronouns that people use for general 'it' words, in my language (Dutch). I find it super confusing. And I think that I'm the only person in school who he told this to. So he probably expects me to call him 'he' when talking to other people about him or calling for him. But other people will notice that and I would have to explained his situation, which I feel is defenitly not up to me.

Also he wants me to call him by his new genderneutral name. But again I'm one of the few people he told. And again I don't want to explain his situation to other people. So a lot of times I just call him by his old name and old pronouns at school. He also never corrects me and so I don't know of he is still in it. I'm just very confusing and I hope if anyone has any tips.

I've kind of tried to talk about it with him but he is a bit socially perculiar. And he will probably think that I'm the freaking weirdo for having these thoughts about it. That's kind of a vibe I get from him a lot when I say any opnion of mine."
alessandrawhocodes,asktransgender,Makeup training / makeover in Boston area?,"Hi everyone ~&lt;3

After a long time, I finally gave myself permission a couple of months ago to start wearing makeup while going out. That, incidentally (and perhaps, obviously) coincided with me starting to live full-time as myself. And had gone great. Didn't saw people noticing nor making comments, and I was getting properly gendered constantly.

That is, till I travel back to the States.

I don't think I'm particularly getting misgendered here (got only one ""sir"") but I do think maybe I'm not passing or people are not sure how to react to me (like cashiers saying ""Have.. nice.. evening""). Perhaps there are some cultural gender cues I'm missing, or my voice sounds different speaking English or a combination of those and other factors. Or perhaps it's all my imagination and people are just focused on other stuff. But still, it does feel different to my previous months.

Instead of feeling down on that, however, I decided to refocus those energies in taking more care of my presentation. Perhaps since I present as a kinda tomboy-femme isn't helping, and though I don't plan in changing how I want to look (that's why I'm transitioning after all), I do think that I'd helped me to learn more stuff in case I ever want to used them. 

One of those things is, then, makeup. Like I mentioned, it was a process (kinda long) of me trying things and adding them to my routine. From using only foundation plus corrector, to then adding eyeliner, eye shadows, and other stuff. And though I believe I feel ready to try more, I do lack the knowledge to see what fits me better or how to apply other things. 

I've been checking out YouTube tutorials with my girlfriend (she also didn't have a lot of skills, but have picked up a lot since), but though pretty helpful, I'd really wish to have someone along side that would take a look at me, notice my features, and help me find out what works better for my type or eyes, or perhaps another way to style my hair that would help me get the kind of look I'm going for.

Do that kind of services exist? Do they in the Boston area? Ideally, it'd be someone that can do house appointments and block a couple of hours for that, but I think I could also go to some place as long as it's private (I don't see myself ready to try those public makeovers they offer in Mac or Sephora).

Would love to get some ideas that would help me jump this hurdle and keep on learning.

Thanks a lot! &lt;3"

pinkchips,asktransgender,"My exception-to-policy, which would allow me to adhere to female military standards, has been denied all the way at the top. I have to cut my hair and present male throughout transition.","I was overjoyed when the military let us come out and seek transition.  I have been fighting the gauntlet for months trying to get everything started, desperate not to cut my hair again.  And I finally just got it long enough to look feminine.... at last I don't need a wig.  
  
But today I got bad news.  Despite it being recommended by my doctors, and even the special trans council the military appointed to be authorities in this matter.... despite the fact that I am approved to transition... my request to stop adhering to male standards has been denied (by whoever at the Pentagon they appointed to make such decisions).    
  
Apparently, such exceptions are only going to be granted at the ""late stages of a transition where the person's desired gender characteristics have become apparent."" (Their words). Part of this transition is expected to be 'real life experience', but they mandate that happen during *off-duty* time, and since on-duty time isn't expected to be part of transition.... no exception-to-policies granted.   
  
You are expected to present 100% male until such time that you have magically transitioned completely (or at least a panel of grubby military men decide you are feminine enough), at which point they will consider allowing you to grow your hair.  
  
I am despondent.  There are no appeals, and no one can help me.  The hormones have already begun doing their thing.... I mean.... I have small breast buds already.... my face is losing masculinity at an alarming rate (I had my first casual male-fail the other day).  I don't even feel comfortable in the men's room anymore.  
  
And yet I'm supposed to cut all my hair off and return to work this week presenting male.  ����  
  
Everyone cheered for how progressive the military was being by allowing trans people to come out of the closet.  **What they have actually done is give us permission to out ourselves, so we can be exposed to a sick and inhumane gauntlet of rules, regulations, and judgement that still prevent us from being ourselves.... except now they have conveniently  identified us.**  
  
This has been the most emotionally excruciating experience of my life, and it is happening right as I am experiencing the emotional tsunami of estrogen for the first time.  It is no wonder that most trans people I talk to in the military aren't at all jubilant.... we are beaten down and hurting by a system which won't help us and is clogged by a thousand disagreeing parts.  
  
I had hoped to lead the way for trans people to proudly serve openly in the military.... but I don't think I can do this anymore.  Months spent trying to prove who I am, only to be told it doesn't matter.  Transition in silence and suffer in silence too, is the apparent direction they want us to take.  
  
I won't.  I've been laying on the floor crying for hours.  At least my contract is up in June; I'm only sorry for the trans members still stuck in this nightmare.  I just wish I had known how much the military wasn't going to support me before I decided to come out.... I would have just done it myself and not even bothered.  "

the_great_magician,asktransgender,About 1/4 of tall women are trans,"Okay so this is kind've a weird topic but going by the napkin math about 1/2 of all tall women (&gt;6 feet) are trans. Whether this is an issue or not I don't know. Anyway, so heights are what's called a ""Normal Distribution"" which is a special statistical concept that means that to us means we can pick a certain height and say that x% of women or men are at or above that height. By the way, I assume here that being trans is not affected by height. So, in the US there are ~160 million women. Of those, about 272,000 are above 6 feet. In the US there are also about 160 million men. Of them, about 28,480,000 are above 6 feet. Also in the US, there are about 700,000 transgender people of which there are about 500,000 MTF transgender people. 17.8% of them are above 6 feet (89,000) which means that there should be about 361,000 total women above 6 feet of which 89,000 are trans.

Also, even though my Adam's apple is really visible, my voice isn't that deep, so I'm quite happy. But how does someone change a voice? Again, are HRT and training enough?

GenericUsername5421,asktransgender,HRT Causes Negative Reaction. Is HRT not an option for me?,"I was taking DIY hormones for awhile, and I may have ramped it up too quickly (went from 2 mg Estrofem daily to half of a 10 mg/ml of Progynon Depot weekly).  I was having a negative reaction from E only.  My throat would feel kind of tight, and I would get bad acid reflux.  The acid reflux is pre-existing but definitely made worse (exacerbated) by E.

Since I'm not a doctor, I didn't do as good a job as I could have with the DIY.  I quit because of these negative reactions with the intent to try again in a few months, but instead start slow...

So a few months passed, and upon taking .25 of a 1 mg Estrofem pill I noticed that these symptoms came rushing back in about 1 or 2 days after starting.  These symptoms died down a bit after a few days and I continued for another 3 weeks but never really felt quite right.  I tried to increase to .5 of 1 mg but these symptoms got even worse again.  I decided to quit.

I plan to go to a doctor to continue any further.  I'm just worried my body is somehow incapable of HRT?  Has anyone else experienced this before when beginning HRT?"

That being said, since I attended this university for my undergrad, they already have a litany of info on me (including old name/gender marker, etc.), so surely it doesn't matter whether or not I disclose my SSN...?

I don't know, I guess I'm just really stressing over this app since it's for my top choice grad school program, and I don't want to volunteer any info that immediately outs me to people reading my application (which I guess at this point is unavoidable...?), but I also don't want to do anything that will give those people any reason to be leery of me/deny me."

Clarine87,asktransgender,DAE?: When I thought I was CIS: I wanted to be trans. But from internally identifying as trans I wanted to be CIS (but not my assigned gender).,"**(Sorry if this title is misleading, this thread is mostly about porn, sorry.)**

That (title) said, until I discovered transporn, I wanted to be a girl all the time. Oh the humanity!

The point I'm getting at is that the uninformed mind can rationalize anything. Those performers were an acceptable compromise which gave comfort to my suffering.

Unfortunately, today when I found myself watching such material for the first time in 6 months, I realized that before I self-identified as trans I had not viewed the pre-op performers as their desired gender (although to be fair transporn does not spend any time stating the gender of the performers), and in the case of transwomen in porn, I only viewed them as ""*not-men* wot had what I wanted"". 

Within days of identifying internally as trans, *that* porn became abhorrent to me, and I finally understand why.


It's because until that time I saw the performers as an acceptable compromise between wanting to be female and wanting to be not-male - which I rationalized as making me not trans [because I didn't know about non-binary at the time]. I've been on E for less than a month and I'm starting to wonder whether this rationalization has tainted how I feel about my gender identity. 

I spent so much time wanting to be something which I though it was acceptable for a cis person to want but which I viewed as *neither male nor female* because I didn't view pre-op transwomen (in porn) as binary (And **at the time I thought everyone watching transporn wanted to be those performers :S, I couldn't figure out why that porn existed except to satisfy people like me**). 

Could I actually be binary (rhetorical). And if that's the case I wonder how long it will take to break through my conditioning. I certainly don't feel binary - aw man this E is really screwing with my perfect reality.


[disclaimer] Before my change in identity as far as nonfictional transgender people were concerned I didn't give much thought to their genitals. I lived in a enlightened albeit black and white world where if a person said they were a gender and looked that gender that was enough for me."

**Dealing w/ Depression Today**

I have spiraled down into a deep depression that I can't seem to pull myself out of which can be a double-edged sword, because when I'm feeling depressed I feel even worse that I can't just ""snap out of it"". Everything seems like it requires so much energy that I've significantly stopped a lot of my day-to-day activities: cooking, going to the gym, meditating, etc. I just get up, go to work and sleep because I'm severely mentally exhausted.

**Eating Disorder Relapse**

I've also recently relapsed on my eating disorder to help cope with my depression. (I've lost almost 100 pounds after I stopped binge eating 2 years ago when I chose to start eating healthy and exercise regularly. I finally felt like my relationship with food was healthy!) But now, I literally do NOT give a shit! Chocolate for breakfast? Sure! Oreo McFlurry for dinner? Sounds AMAZING! And it's not just what I'm eating, it's the amount as well. I never feel satisfied when I eat...so I eat and eat &amp; eat until I feel sick and I hate myself for it. 

**Tsunami Dreams**

My dreams have also been different lately. Almost every night this week, I've dreamt about a Tsunami approaching (I live off of the coast) and in the dream, I'm trying to strategize with my family to find refuge and to travel as far inland as possible, to avoid the disaster that we know is coming. 

This dream is a classic interpretation that my emotions/feelings/issues are rising to the surface and right now it feels like I'm running from them, instead of facing them. So what am I'm running from? I want to try to dissect that by looking to the past. 

**My Childhood**

My parents divorced when my twin sister and I were two so we were primarily raised by my Father's Grandmother and my religious, Fundamentalist Christian Mother. My Father was never physically or emotionally available. However, my Grandmother and Mother were strong women who I love and respect dearly to this day, but I would watch the light leave their eyes when their spouses drank and abused them. 

I idolized and envied my twin sister. I wanted to grow up and be just like her! We would ALWAYS play with Barbie dolls together and I would love dressing up in her clothes. We shared similar friends since I identified mostly with other girls; It just made sense.

That was an amazing experience when we were kids, but when we grew older, she started getting angry with me because of how attached/codependent I was with her and treated me poorly in Middle School and Highschool for it. I felt lost, because to some extent, she was the only person who didn't care that I was different, so why was she distancing herself all of a sudden?

Growing up, I remember being the happiest child and was fabulous in that I was always doing what I loved...until puberty hit and I realized that I was AMAB and stuck in my body. When I realized I was different, I immediately hated myself for it. 

Although I was never physically abused, verbal abuse is real and that's when my eating disorder/self-harm started. I ate my feelings to help deal with my unstable environment and the hateful words from my Grandfather, Step-Dad and sometimes from my Mother, who would condemn me every so often for identifying as bisexual. I started cutting myself in Middle School and that's when my parents sent me to my school's counselor. However, I never opened up and felt guilty for even having to see a counselor in the first place. All I wanted was just to be myself and not get reprimanded for it from my family and the rest of the world. I told the counselor everything was ""fine"".

**Dating in Middle/High School**

I came out as bisexual in high school, but before that, I exclusively only dated girls. I had a couple of sexual encounters with boys, but never a successful relationship. 

**Getting Married**

There was one special girl that I fell in love with that I met at my home church when I was volunteering on the worship band. (I loved playing the piano and singing back then but I haven't played an instrument since I left the church). We dated Junior &amp; Senior year and I ended up marrying her after high school. That’s what heterosexual Christian men do, right?

We really became one in our relationship, however, we were awfully codependent and she constantly put me down anytime I would act feminine and was very transphobic. All of our friends witnessed the verbal abuse but usually said nothing. To me, I was used to it, HELL, even enjoyed it. Negative attention is still attention, right? One could probably say it's all I knew growing, so it makes sense why I attached myself to a strong, opinionated woman who knew how to control and manipulate me. 

My wife at the time knew I was bisexual and was attracted to men, but our religion made us blind to the real truth. She chose to love me besides my attraction...or maybe she chose to ignore it. We were married for a year and a half before I came out to her as gay and ended the marriage in divorce.

I wonder if she ever knew that I dressed up in her clothes and wore her makeup while she was at work...

**Coming Out To My Family**

Ever since my divorce (almost three years ago), I've been in therapy with an amazing therapist. In the last three months, I experienced my ""awakening"" and I came out to my immediate family and close friends as Trans. My mother could not be more than loving, supportive and has removed herself from the church, my Father doesn't understand, and the siblings that I've come out to love and support me for who I am.

I couldn't be more than happier that my immediate family and close friends are supportive, but sometimes I feel like I, MYSELF, am still having a hard time accepting myself as trans. Does that make sense?

I've been living a lie for so long, have encountered a lot of codependent abuse and now I'm able to live my truth, but sometimes the truth is dreadfully painful. 

However, it's liberating to be living my truth and I would rather live my life authentically than living in a Christian heteronormative box!

I've been living in that box for far too long and know how damaging it can be.

**Spiritual Awakening &amp; Reading**

Today, I have discarded my fundamentalist Christian ways and believe in many things spiritually. I don't worship one god, but am open to exploring different truths. I believe in my spirit guides and karma. I had a reading done this last October by an awesome teacher/psychic/friend who said I have issues with perfectionism, which is spot on because before I came out as a trans woman, I was identifying as a gay male and everything in my life had to be perfect; the clothes I wore, the food I ate, the conversations I had, and my job. Once I came out, I looked at myself and realized I was really Pansexual. Just kidding (sorta lol). I realized that my male self was all a facade, a veil that I was using to hide my real, authentic self.

**Closing Thoughts**

That's my story so far and I feel better that I was able to release it because even though I've been through a lot emotionally, the one thing I'm sure of is that I'm still here, adapting and changing the things in my life that I'm no longer happy with and I will get through this! Healing takes time and sometimes I don't even want to accept it, but if I want to move forward, accepting and loving myself is the first step.

I'm questioning my gender, and I have things I want to try out and explore but my anxiety gets so bad that I feel very uncomfortable and unable to try them or I criticize my ""performance"". (Sorry, I'm struggling to find words)

I have figured out part of my discomfort with doing these is because I don't read as anything other than ""female"" so I have anxiety about being ""found out"" -- for example giving a name at Starbucks or wearing a binder/packer. I was also terrified to cut my hair but I finally did it on a whim after all these years. The problem for me is that I don't know how I can see if I'm trans if my anxiety flares up so bad. It's not only stressful to go through, but also very difficult to tell how the experiment made me feel about my gender because all I could feel was the anxiety. And part of being anxious means analyzing every little thing, thinking others constantly perceive you negatively, dreading what may happen, and being so mortified by some look/word/action that you avoid doing it again. Anyone have tips to navigate questioning yourself while living with mental illness?"

In one sense..I do in a way.  However..I transitioned so long ago that maybe I forgot what it was like.  But dealing with guys especially in dating or some sort of social setting I find myself not knowing what to expect from them or how they should respond.  On another observation..I've been so emersed living my gender through the years that another irony..I find myself ""on the other side"" of the preverbial gender fence.  Especially at work.  I notice that I'm often working alone when there are a group of guys. They flock together and have their ""guy"" things all the time as I'm the only female staff now.  At least when other females were employed..I had someone to relate to. So...what a difference now that I still wouldnt trade for the world."

Throwaway999333222,asktransgender,I need some honest and non-nosugarcoated support at this point in my life. [TW: Very Heavy Dysphoria],"Yo, everyone. I've contemplated posting here for many many months, but I've reached a point where I need to communicate about my issues with people who actually understand what I'm going through.

HRT. It's a fickle thing, and at 16 with one non- supportive dad (believes in trans people being a 'fad' and 'untrue' and a household with very little income I'm terrified of never being able to transition. The most I've done in years since coming out to my mom is grow my hair out.

And, even if I do manage to start transitioning, I'm again terrified of it working. Even as from a cis male standpoint I feel hideous, fat, and freakish. And from a trans standpoint?

All I'll say is: I'm lucky to go a day without being legitimately scared of my own reflection. I've got a fat, wide, jutting, ethnic nose, sagging cheeks, laugh lines and eyelids (especially my right due to its non functioning), a hideously large forehead and ears that would make Grunkle Stan jealous.

Not to mention my sasqurtch- esque body hair, fat belly (even with 3- 4 days of exercise per week and healthy food ...), lumberjack length shoulders, and oars for hands and feet.

I've had friends call me ugly and only family members and therapists call me pretty/handsome/whatever among other things. I see very little hope of transitioning, much less passing, and even with antidepressants, good friends, a well meaning (though misunderstanding) mom, and bi- weekly therapy visits, I still feel depressed and suicidal every day.

So, any advice comments or encouragement for a 6""2, saggy faced, barrel chested transgirl like me?

Harlick,asktransgender,"Reddit, I am so happy I could plotz.","When I was 15 years old I realized that I wanted to be a woman more than I wanted to be a man, but being immersed in a very strict conservative culture I hid it and suppressed it. For 20 years I told myself it was just a phase of puberty, a teen boy exploring his sexuality.

In the last year I've become increasingly despondent about my life. I kept having this nagging feeling that something was out of place, that my life had gone in the wrong direction somehow and I was meant to be doing something else. My wife noticed it and started probing me to find out what was going on in my head, and I started having this nagging suspicion of what might be wrong.

On Monday I discovered /u/jackmolay's fantastic crossdreaming blog, and for the first time in my life I came to understand that what I had been feeling for so long wasn't just a phase or a fetish, but a side of me that I desperately needed in my life.

I slept horribly Monday night, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Tuesday morning I found this subreddit and all you wonderful people. I spent the entire day reading personal accounts, both happy and sad. Stories of tragedy, joy, and self discovery. Finally I found /u/transientavian's [list of simple little pleasures](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3wfkzh/lets_be_positive_what_mid_to_post_transition/) that she had found mid and post-transition. I messaged her to give my thanks and we had a small conversation about the post. This was the tipping point, it was that conversation that made me realize I had to do this. That evening I went out to pick up takeout and blasted my favorite Green Day album in the car. I rocked out, sang at the top of my lungs, and felt like a million dollars. I came home positively giddy with excitement. My wife commented on how suddenly vibrant and joyful I seemed.

I didn't get a single wink of sleep Tuesday night. Not one bit. I spent the whole night exploring my memories, recalling things I had forgotten or deliberately repressed, like how I would wear spandex leggings under my clothes when I went to school (it was the 90s, don't judge!), and how I had stolen clothes from my mother's dresser and would wear them around the house when she was out of town. I imagined coming out to friends and family, replayed a fictional conversation with my wife over and over again.

I was a disaster Wednesday morning and finally crashed at 8am and slept for two hours. I told my wife it was because of all the iced tea I drank the night before (which was true, it absolutely didn't help). All day I stressed about broaching the topic with my wife. We had discussed last week that I should probably see a therapist, but of course she didn't mean _that_ kind of therapist. I knew that I _had_ to tell her what I was going to do, and I was 90% certain that she would be supportive, but she's 31 weeks into the pregnancy from hell and I was terrified to put any more strain on her, emotionally.

I messaged a trans friend of mine on twitter, laid everything out, and asked her what I should do. She told me that realistically if it was going to work out, it would work out whether I told her now or told her later. Last night before bed my wife and I took a shower together. For five whole minutes I stood there nearly silent, wrestling with myself. Finally I said it.

&gt; ""I think I need to see a gender therapist.""

&gt; ""Oh, ok. Good""

She didn't even bat an eye. No pause, no strong reaction. I thought she didn't get it.

&gt; ""You do understand the implication of that, right?""

&gt; ""Yes, but I want you to be happy, and I'll love you no matter what you decide.""

I was floored. I wanted to cry. She _did_ cry. She is 100% behind me and supports whatever course my therapist and I decide to take. We talked in bed for three hours about my past, my present, and our future. I told her _everything_. We both laid out all our hopes and concerns and vowed that we'll take all of this one day at a time and both do our best to help each other through whatever comes our way.

Then this morning came the icing on the cake. I have struggled with obesity my entire life, never able to find a goal that overwhelmed my desire to enjoy food. Every diet I've tried has failed because, at the end of the day, I enjoyed eating more than I cared about my body. The instant I knew I wanted to transition, I found my goal. I finally have a body image that I want badly enough to stop over eating. I tracked what I ate yesterday and realized I only consumed 880 calories (it was easy, I was too worked up to eat). Before my shower this morning I stood on the scale and discovered I've lost 8 pounds since last week.

Ladies and gents, I am on top of the fucking world this morning. I want to dance on rooftops and sing to the stars. I want to shout it to the skies.

I am a trans woman, and I finally know my place in the world."
negatonic,asktransgender,Is gender dysphoria considered a pre-existing medical condition?,"For those who don't know, last night the US Republican Senate voted 51 - 48 on the following: 

1. End coverage for preexisting conditions, veterans benefits, and aid to rural hospitals.
2. Remove discrimination protection for women in healthcare.
3. Against provision allowing children to remain on parent's insurance till the age of 26.
4. Cut funding for the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
5. Against ACA contraceptive coverage and maternity care provision.
6. Direct committees to send budget legislation to defund and repeal the Affordable Care Act.
House votes on Friday.

For those who get health insurance through work, no pre-existing conditions and lifetime caps for coverage are back for everyone.

I have health coverage through work, and have been on the phone with my provider to find out how this will affect transgender health care, and when it might take affect if it does, but haven't received any answers. 

I'm scheduled for vaginoplasty in February, and a follow-up surgery of labiaplasty in May. I'm wondering if this is potentially in jeopardy now. Does anyone know if gender dysphoria is considered a pre-existing medical condition? 

-----

Update: ""Last night senate Democrats inserted their own amendments to proactively protect coverage for people with preexisting conditions and adult children covered by their parents. These amendments were struck down, largely on the argument that they were not budget items and therefore did not qualify. THIS WAS NOT a vote against these provisions, it was a vote against protecting the provisions. Yes, this gets senate Republicans on record as being very shitty people, but it does not repeal these important provisions.""

Zoequest,asktransgender,When did you transition at work?,"Hey, everyone. This may be just personal preference, but I was curious to hear about the experience of others who have been through this.

I just recently spoke with the head of our diversity department about beginning the dialogue for workplace transition. A few allies of mine say that this person can be trusted to be a strong advocate for me during this process, so I am cautiously optimistic.

Thu0117,asktransgender,I can't handle it anymore!!!,"I made this post an hour or so ago (
https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5nni4l/when_i_am_alone_i_feel_mtf_when_im_in_public_im/) when I didn't feel that trans. 


My dysphoria is so bad right now, it's gotten from bearly noticeable to so bad in just over an hour. I just watched some YouTube videos about some trans girls, I just got my phone and threw it across my room. Knowing they can do things about it and I can't fucks with my mind so much. 


I fucking hate everything. On that post I said in an hour my dysphoria would be worse, and I was right. 



Literally, reading this sub, seeing people who are getting hrt, transitioning, etc.  Just makes me feel so much worse, knowing I can't. I have no money, the time I'll be able to get HRT on the NHS I will probably be dead anyway. I were born female I'd never have this. 


I honestly see no point in living. Day in, day out all I'm doing is just wondering if I'm trans or not, everytime I think I'm not trans I get so frustrated. I've had this everyday for the past 3 months. Before that life was so much better, everything was getting better, I had more friends, I just felt do much better with everything. I was less anxious. Now since going on this sub I'm not the reverse, I'm depressed, sometimes suicidal, and so anxious about everything. I'm close to being expelled, I don't even care. 


I got school tomorrow, my dysphoria will get better but I'll just have more denial, which just makes everything worse for me. It's preventing me from doing anything about it. 
"
justthrowingthis34,asktransgender,Unsure of where to go from here.,"Hello everyone I am making this on a throw away account. I really need help. 
I am in my early 30s and i am mtf. I have had these feeling since I was around 10 years old. I have tried my best to overcome them by mostly by trying to bury them but that did not work. About 3 years ago I reached my breaking point and had to do something so I finally started seeing a therapist.  I have been seeing my therapist now for about a year and in that time I have made some small steps the biggest being I told my Aunt and mother (that went OK while they aren't supportive they didn't disown me either) also started to buy more clothing makeup etc. 

Now to where I currently find myself. After all I've done so far my therapist believes the next step for me is Hrt. The only thing is whenever I think about this a fear and an unwillingness to do it takes over. I read so many stories of people starting Hrt and they are excited to start. whenever I think about taken the pills I get really scared. This is the next step and yet I am frozen in place. I think some of this fear can be coming from the fact I don't want to be known\seen as someone who is transgender. passing to me at least is so very important. It's not something I can just get over yet I know I won't pass (big hands, feet, ears, etc.).But if I continue to live as I have been for the past 20something years the depression will win and I would be able to act on the suicidal thoughts.

I suffer everyday and the depression is so bad I don't want to even leave my house. Don't want to transition but don't want to keep suffering living as a man. I feel like I lost a rigged game that I never wanted to play. I feel so hopeless like I should just learn to embrace the depression. Get use to the fact that all I will feel though the remainder of my life is sadness, anger, and anxiety never knowing what ture happiness feels like. How do I overcome this if there is even a way to. 
"
cdortrans,asktransgender,I'm forcing myself to be trans?,"I think if I just try to avoid anything transgender related, I could probably live as male fine. 



I was fine crossdressing until I discovered about gender dysphoria. It was amazing... Being a guy who wants to be a girl and transitioning seemed amazing, like I kinda wished I had it, weirdly enough. 



But the more I read, I actually started having some dysphoric thoughts. They where very mild, but it was somewhat there. But as time moved on, they got worse and worse, and I'm now depressed and even suicidal over this, I'm the space of 3 months. 



I used to want to be more trans so I would be more happy about transitioning, but instead of feeling more trans, I've had more dysphoria which has not helped at all.



The dysphoria generally has to be triggered, or I have to be reminded of it. Often, for the first 30 seconds or so I completely forget about dysphoria until the thought comes into my head. If I see a girl (often attractive) it will trigger it. 



If I see a girl, I'll ask myself ""do I want to be like her"" and I'll say no. Then I'll see a boy and ask myself the same question, and it will definitely be ""no"". Then I look at the girl again and ask myself again, and then I'll be ""not sure"". 



I often trigger the dysphoria because it makes me slightly better wanting to be a girl. The thoughts are almost comforting. I'm scared if the dysphoria will go away, because that will mean I'll be male for the rest of my life. The thought of being male my entire life scares me and not knowing what it will be like to be female scares me. 



When the dysphoria is hardly there, I feel worse because I don't really care about transitioning, and I hate the feeling. When the dysphoria is there, but not too bad is when I feel the best. When the dysphoria is not there or really bad is when I feel the worse. "
Canadiannabis,asktransgender,"Am I getting weird looks cause I'm androgynous, or is that just wishful thinking?","I've noticed that when I go out to places people will stare at me for longer than before, bus drivers and random people are sometimes colder towards me and I'll occasionally get people glancing at me and whispering to each other.


Of course, these things could be completely unrelated to me and this could all be in my head. It's not the first time where I've found patterns in things when there are none.

MorganX85,asktransgender,Help,This dysphoria is getting beyond painful. I have a general therapist right now. I hope they can help somewhat but I don't really want to talk about my dysphoria with anyone. I've just been suppressing it.
LoveIinus,asktransgender,How to deal with a psycho Mom,"Alright this is it, things have gotten so bad that I need to seek help from you guys. I don't know how to deal with my psycho Mom.

She's a horrible Mother first and foremost. Since young she has been verbally and non verbally abusing my Sister because she hates having a Daughter. Therefore me obviously being AMAB I did not receive such horrible treatment from her growing up.

I have to reiterate that she's a horrible woman. She mistreats my paternal Grandmother and I can't stand watching that growing up. I would always end up throwing a fit to protect my Grandmother whenever I saw this. She has got no respect for anybody else.

Ever since I've came out and been on HRT, her target has changed. Now I'm being abused and her attitude towards my Sister has changed for the better. She straight up told me in the face that I'm no longer her child should I transition, that I have no use for this family since I won't be having a kid in the future and I can't carry on the family line. Originally they were gonna leave the inheritance to me (because I'm the Son). Now they are going to leave nothing for me  (well fine by me). 

But the amount of abuse that she's giving me is so immense. I can't say that I'm taking it well. In fact I think I'm almost going crazy. Having to witness her mistreating my Grandmother even up till today and on top of that, I have to deal with it myself! 

My Dad's the nicest dude in the world and honestly I feel bad that he got himself such a deranged Wife. Absolutely nothing short of a lunatic. My dad is okay with me transitioning but not my mum. I have to hide my female clothes and my appearance is already giving things away. Soon I'm going to change my legal name and I'm sure that's going to evoke some reaction in her. In fact I just talked to him about her today and he just told me to ""try to present well and not enrage her and you should be fine"". But even taking a rest after working straight for 9 days had her chiding me with words coming out like ""sleeping all day such a useless person"" can she just go  and die already? 

Can't believe things took a BIG change. My psychopath Mother being SUPER nice to my Sister and being a depraved person towards me. Oh well. 



"
asktragen,asktransgender,Is there anything that could potentially cause dysphoria?,"OK. I have doubts if I am actually having dysphoria, or if I've managed to trick myself into thinking I have it. 



If you go back to when I was 12/13, I was a completely straight cis guy who just happened to like wearing girls clothes in private. But no dysphoria whatsoever. I had a little desire to be a girl, but that's only because I liked their clothes more than guys clothes, but it didn't bother me at all. 


But at the same I was an incredibly horny teen back then, I'd watch a lot of porn (although so do a lot of 13 year old boys) , I would dream about having sex pretty much all the time, I had crushes on girls in my year, but I didn't have any dysphoria. 



Fast forward to last year, I had this crush on this girl in my year who I was quite friendly with. I really wanted to ask her out, but I have quite bad anxiety so I never did ask her out. 



Then in September I discovered what being transgender meant, and what gender dysphoria what. I said to myself that being trans is something I might be in the future, but I just said that I'm cis, and ignored it. 


But then I came across ""That was Dysphoria"", I read it and oh my God, it was like reading my own biography. When puberty I became depressed, I hated life, didn't care about anything, but I was really odd. I had no friends but I was like the trouble maker in the class, was quite dramatic, but at the same time was the loner. I knew I was very different from everyone else, but never knew why I was that way. 



But it's only been the past few months I've had dysphoric thoughts, it's pretty much came out of the blue. But now, I'm more depressed, I sleep all day, I don't care about grades or anything, I don't bother seeing friends anymore, instead I'll stay at home or go on this sub. 




It's like, why have I been fine for years, but suddenly I'm not? Why has it come out of the blue without any sort of trigger? It all seems a bit suspicious to me, like I'm making it up or just hoping I am trans. "

hbomb232,asktransgender,Questions from cis-gendered photographer,"Hello! I am a portrait photographer and I am interested in entering (creating?) the niche market of coming out portraits for trans people.  In my work, it is my job to pose my clients so they look their best. I guide the women to flattering feminine poses, and the men to strong, masculine poses. There is a lot of nuance that the average person doesn't consider--hand position and placement, how the spine is curved, how the weight is distributed, etc. I often see photos of trans people where they are not posed well and it upsets me because I know I could have done a better job. The portrait session would have the same pricing as my other sessions but I would like to donate 10% to an organization that helps the trans community. My questions are:

1 - Do you think a coming out portrait session would be of interest in general to trans people?
1a - Is ""coming out"" the right way to describe the session?
2 - Do there tend to be local trans communities and if so, how could I find them? I would like to reach out to them since my clients would need to be local. I am in NJ if that helps. 
3 - Are there any pitfalls I am missing as a cis-gendered person? The very last thing I would ever want to do is cause offense or hurt to someone. 
4 - What are reputable organizations I can donate to?

Thank you for your time!

Edit: Thank you all so much for the thoughtful feedback. I really appreciate it because many of you brought up concerns that had never crossed my mind. I really learned quite a lot. 

I now understand that the coming out phase is a painful and difficult one, and that people are generally not happy with how they look. If these portraits were to happen, it should happen once they feel they are comfortably passing, and as someone wrote, would be better called “gender-affirming portrait sessions.”

I understand there is an important difference between trying to cater to LGBT people and just making it apparent on my website that I am LGBT friendly. My hope with these sessions, if I go forward with trying to do them, is that people would know I am aware of and sensitive to issues that are specific to people in the trans community. This thread has gone a very long way toward making me aware of those issues, and I am deeply grateful for that.

Some people brought up the idea of being supportive to the trans community simply by donating a small percentage from jobs I am already doing, or by volunteering to do portraits for free. I like both of those ideas very much. Maybe I can hook up with a local support center and offer a free service through them. I doubt I’ll be overwhelmed with requests, so it shouldn’t be too difficult to schedule the sessions in. This is something I genuinely want to do to help people feel good about themselves.

Thank you again for all of the thoughtful replies and feedback."
elliotnewname,asktransgender,"Being cis is a weird concept to trans people, similar to trans being a wierd concept to cis people?","I'm trying to get my head around being cisgender.


Like, living as you assigned gender for life, without ever being curious about being the opposite gender or wanting to be it?



I always thought I was cisgender until I was 16. Between 13-16 I thought ""I'd rather be female, but being male is fine"". Although I think it was purely because I crossdressed in private and I just wanted to be able to wear the clothes in public and not look strange.


Whereas the clothes part is still there for me, I'd rather of been born female because I would of never known what it was like being male in the first place. I'd rather be a cis woman than a cis man.




Does anyone else think it's just so strange being cis? Like, never ever thinking about it, or rather being like someone who is female or anything? It's so weird for me

lnd940,asktransgender,"Strong, go-getter personality vs MTF Transition","I've grappled with this for the past 10 years. I think I have what some would call an Alpha personality - I am a go-getter type, I started a bunch of businesses, own a bunch of real estate, have aspirations of running for office and being a billionaire (I can dream, right). At the SAME time, I've had trans feelings.

I've tried low-dose HRT but I felt ... weaker on it ... like, personality wise ... from one side, I wanted to look like a woman, from another, I want the male strength to power through things.

I feel that TRANSITION (not being female) would adversely affect my aspirations. Introducing my body to a bunch of drugs/pills, passing issues/etc .. all would be a hassle, although a PLEASANT hassle

I've been torn between this forever and do not have an answer. I wonder if my TRANSNESS is PART Of the reason why I find myself smarter than almost anyone I meet? I literally feel like I should've been there on the team that founded facebook or google ... 

has anyone else experienced this type of thing? "
flisan91,asktransgender,Thoughts about my situation,"- I didnt have body dysphoria before I realised I might be transgender
- My self confident has always been very bad. Never knew why, and it became worse the last six months, ended up quitting my job.
- I am feeling like I would be happier in s female role, less pressure, more beautiful, female friends.
- I have always felt like I have been running away from things in life. Never felt satisfied.
- I dont know what came first. The feeling of ""never being satisfied"", orr the desire of being female. Is the female desire just another ""running-away-episode""? Or is it a fully legitimate symptom that is common among transgender people?
- I am a sensative person who's always trying to be kind. I dont like conflicts. I think this mkght be the reason of ""running away"" symptom. But I want to believe it is about my gender role. Maybd its both?

Here I am, began with 50mg spiro two days ago and trying to figure it out, how I am.

It's just too easy...It can't be so easy!? Will I become truley happy if I transition to female? I want to believe it but I can't... It feels like I'm giving up or surrender if I believe it. 

So many thoughts... my head nevers rests."
[deleted],asktransgender,Parents want to invade my Privacy,"Hi! I am Kenna and a mtf/19 transgender, HRT for 1 month. So I came out to my parents and they said all they want from me is to be happy. I am glad for that but during transitioning, they want to always come to the apartment like every 4-5 days. I NEED some alone time to transition! Like makeup, clothing, hair removal etc. I feel like this change when they see me after 5 days and I wear makeup, is too much for them to handle. Also it would be too hard for me mentally to present to them. They took my coming out like it was a dramatic soap opera and afraid they will do the same after all this. I know they want the best for me but I really need some privacy to transition. 
How would y'all go about this? I don't want to sound cold-hearted to my parents. I also go to community college if that is any help."
violaceous_trogon,asktransgender,What's your weirdest source of dysphoria? [Possibly NSFW],"Call it morbid curiosity, but I'm interested in our unique little sticking points about ourselves. Stuff you haven't seen other people mention they're dysphoric about.

Sorry if this is TMI but mine are...well, my nipples and areola. In comparison to a lot of other cis and trans girls, they're *tiny*. I've been on MTF HRT for 8 months or so and I have boobs, the areola are all big and puffy when I'm not cold or aroused, but as soon as one of those things happens it's like they got hit by a shrink ray. 

Weirdly enough they lose sensitivity when they're aroused which sorta bums me out."
AnotherThrowaway__1,asktransgender,"If I'm not uncomfortable living as a male or female but I am living as a female, what does that mean?","Let me elaborate.... I am currently living as a woman without HRT, but, i feel the exact same I think as when I was living as a male.

bct488,asktransgender,Should i get MTF SRS?,"I really want mtf srs. Like really badly. 

My penis is really annoying, i want to be able to wear bikinis, leggings and do normal activities without having to worry about my crotch.

I also feel like getting srs will allow me to feel more 'complete' as a women, as ill know my anatomy is now entirely female.... Basically I just REALLY WANT A VAGINA

However, sometimes i do doubt myself. one reason for this, is that even though my penis can make me uncomfortable, especially when others make reference to it, i don't really hate it.. like i don't mind my penis, when it doesn't get in the way.

Also, i quite like masturbation (sorry.. this is really crude), and am scared getting srs will change this experience negatively, and i will be less sensitive.

Ultimately, i wish i already had a fully functioning vagina, but I'm not sure if i should get the surgery, and risk the complications that may occur.. 

Any advice??"
blitz4040,asktransgender,Hormone Levels,"I'm currently going through a university doctor, but just like Planned Parenthood they don't test levels since they generally only adjust based on the effects and if regular blood work determines an issue with liver, kidneys, etc. Is this sufficient testing for those things or would getting levels tested as well be sufficient?

AMYgdalia96,asktransgender,HRT and Hearing loss? (otosclerosis),"Hi everyone. 

I'm a 20 year old trans women and I've been on estrogen for 9 months.

Around last July, I yawned and there was a sudden ""pop"" in my left ear and I felt as though my ears were ""full"", like you may experience on an airplane.

The ""full"" feeling came and went daily in both ears, and after about a month I developed very loud tinnitus in both ears. 

I started seeing an ENT who had me try nasal steroids and ear drops, which did nothing. Which made him think it's a jaw issue called TMJ - Temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Sure enough a couple weeks later I got more TMJ symptoms such as jaw pain, tight neck, and jaw ""clicking"" noises.

I saw my ENT today for a follow up and was given a hearing test and found out I've got low frequency conductive hearing loss in my right ear, about 20 decibels, which is considerable. He told me I may have otosclerosis... a condition that leads to deafness without surgery. He told me that otosclerosis is very common in pregnant women and studies have shown HRT in cis-women can worsen otosclerosis.


Any other trans ladies on estrogen have otosclerosis? I'm super depressed about this because my transition has been going so fanatically well. I don't know what I'm going to do :( "
transthrowaway222,asktransgender,Question about estradiol levels,"I recently got my blood tests done after self-medding for about three months and my results were a little strange. Everything else seemed alright but my estradiol levels were 991.2 pg/mL, which after a bit of research looks to be about three times the max amount a cis girl would have.

I've been taking 4mg Estrofem(split 2mg in the morning and 2mg at night) sublingually and 50mg cypro. I made the mistake of taking my morning dose around two hours before I was supposed to get my blood test done, but that spike still seems unnaturally high. 

Am I missing something here? What should I do?"

Not depressed or anything, just physically really exhausted. T is at 4 ng/dl and E is at 200-350 pg/ml. Progesterone is at 0,6. 

I'm on cypro ( 50 mg ) and Progynova ( 8 mg ) supplemented with Progesterone 200 mg daily. 

What-o- what exhausts me so much? "
helloitslouis,asktransgender,Biased opinions on passing?,"(I'm not a native speaker, and I'm very tired, so please don't hang me up over bad grammar or a wanky phrase. Constructive criticism on my language is welcome, learning is good.)

I've been told that I ""completely pass"" and have a ""perfect passing"" by other trans people. I've even had it used as an argument against me, brought up when I, disappointed, literally said that I don't seem to pass. (They basically told me to stfu because in their eyes, I pass perfectly well.)

In reality, I don't pass. I'm four months on testosterone and while my voice has dropped significantly, my face looks almost exactly the same. Amongst cis men, I look and feel like [this](http://m.imgur.com/X4f1skS?r).

I only get gendered female in public and the only time I passed was when I was introduced as male to a group of people. I get ""lady"" and ""madame"" daily. It sucks. I once passed pre T when someone thought I was 13. I am, however, addressed with my preferred name and pronouns by all of my classmates and teachers, for which I'm really glad and thankful. They're great.

Now here's the thing: I think that many trans people - especially those who work with other trans people or are around them a lot - have biased opinions/impressions of the passing of others. 

I see it myself: I'm so used to addressing people with their preferred pronouns and name that I have trouble telling if someone passes or not. Mostly it's like ""yeah I guess?"", but I think in reality I think it's just my brain going ""that person is saved in the file *he/him/his* so we gender them male, alrighty?!""

I volonteer with trans youth (my age, and a bit older/younger) and many of them are not on HRT (yet). I have a really hard time saying if they pass or not because I'm so used to seeing ""feminime"" men and ""masculine"" women all the time.

What are your opinions on this theory? Have you experienced similar things?"
amabtrans,asktransgender,Should I try to present as female before I start HRT?,"I keep asking myself, and I have two completely different thoughts.



* I present female, decide it's not for me, or have even more doubts about being trans, and be constantly stuck in this loop



* I don't present as female, start HRT, then I start to have permanent changes, go out as female and realize I don't actually like it.



This is why I wish I were born female. As my parents have quite strict gender roles, I would of been raised feminine, and not masculine. Sometimes I think maybe because I never got to do much feminine things as a child it has made me like this.


What would you do if you were in my situation?

punstressed,asktransgender,The word transgender too harsh?,"I've always thought the word transgender was too harsh and rigid sounding. It comes with a lot of negative connotations. Even though other terms such as shortening it to trans still have negative connotations, I'm still apprehensive to use that word when talking. Anyone else feel this way?"
RatchetandClankguy,asktransgender,May have just made peace with who I am?,"just got off the phone with my parents. I couldn't sleep last night so i had ~5 hours for my mind to wander, and after spending most of that time researching it (a lot of it coming from this subreddit, and identifying with many of the stories here), i have come to the possible conclusion that i am Trans (MtF). I told them about it and my mom was super supportive and i really haven't felt this good in years :')
don't know if thats just my brain thinking that I SHOULD feel this way or what, but it doesn't really matter, I'm just going to enjoy it while it lasts. This is just a ramble post cause i'm still not quite sure what i should do right now, my brain's going a mile a minute. I wanted to thank the wonderful people on here who's stories helped me to come to terms about this and stop denying these feelings/thoughts.

edit:I just realized the ""ask"" part, and this isn't really a question. I hope that a post like this isn't against the rules of this sub. If it is then I apologize and will take it down."
twasanotherthrowaway,asktransgender,I just had my first tears of joy,"This is probably relatable for everyone here. Finally after 8,5 months of HRT, my body catches up with my mind. I failed the boymode almost completely at this point, and gave my first public speech (without showing my face) using my new voice. It's still not as good as it should, but it passes.

Last month was very hard for me, but this week was really great. Today I woke up, brushed my hair, and sat down in my bed. What i saw and felt, my longish hair on the right side of my head, breasts under my t-shirt that i sleep in, wide hips, and my amazing legs (don't judge please, i really love them).

Even looking in a mirror didn't gave my dysphoria and if it weren't for my skin problems/shadow between my upper lip and nose, Adam's apple and eyebrows, i would pass in my own eyes. I can't wait until I'll get rid of those and correct my curved septum that not only will look better, but my head will stop hurting (my brain doesn't get enough air because of that) and my voice will sound better and more neutral.

Thanks to meeting one person that doesn't know that I'm trans, I feel a weird encourage building inside me to actually go girlmode. I was planning to do this in a few months, but who knows...

So, being in a body that catches with how your brain works (more or less, because of things that i mentioned above plus my breasts are tiny and this thing between my legs are driving me nuts) feels amazing. I'm still crying even though I'm posting it from a phone so took a while to write. This sub usually aren't happy, but I'm so happy right now that i can't even describe it. It's totally worth to be alive, and i love you all guys!"
scracher25,asktransgender,A couple questions about banking sperm,"I have a few questions about it and I am debating doing it at all. Right now, I do not want to have kids at all, and on top of that, if I were to have kids, I don't think I care if they are genetically related to me. I am perfectly fine with adopting or maybe having a future partner either find a surrogate mother or to find a sperm donor. My only thought is that my opinions on both having kids and wanting biological children may change with time, and so I am considering banking sperm as an option.

My biggest question is, how long does the process of banking sperm take, from start to finish? I have the opportunity to start HRT this Tuesday, probably. I am being given the option for banking sperm before starting, but it may delay the time that I do start HRT. I am concerned with this because I have been waiting for almost a year since my first referral to a therapist, and now I am finally at somebody who can prescribe me with HRT, and that appointment is on Tuesday. I don't want to have to wait months in order to get HRT once again just to bank sperm.

My second question is what are the costs? My parents are willing to cover any costs (within reasonable amount) for now, but when I move out and am living on my own for the first time, I may not be able to afford it.

Sorry that this got a little longer that I thought it would, but it would be incredibly helpful if anyone with experience banking could help me out. I just don't want to make any decisions I will end up regretting (whether it be waiting longer to bank or not banking at all)."
Samanthakru,asktransgender,Need some help from trans men,"Trans men, can you please explain how much u hate/hates being AFAB?

noryql,asktransgender,Where to start? Where to get help?,"I've kept my depression and dysphoria hidden for as long as I could, I'm hitting severe new lows recently, without any changes or life events to blame it on, there's no concrete reason for these lows.

I think the lack of change and the lack of distractions that take me out of reality is exactly what's causing them, I have little else but suicidal thoughts, I feel like I've only liven half a life and it's time I do something about this, at 25 years old, where I already feel close to hopeless.

While I find an overwhelming amount of information on the specifics of a transition, as well as the emotional states and experiences of people before, during and after, what I seem to lack is the very start:

*(Note: Anywhere in Portugal's capital, if you can give me specifics.)*

**1. Where do I find support?**

Online communities to talk with, which are supportive - but not echo chambers, allow criticism and some uncomfortable truths -, which I could potentially become a member of, receive and try to give some help back as I go through it.

More importantly, what community do you choose, and how can I become involved in a productive way?

Additionally, where do I find any local groups and at what point should I even look for them?

**2. Where do I find a therapist?**

I've had plenty of years to understand myself, I feel that I know what I am and what I need, I'm lightly concerned to have that certainty ripped away by an uncooperative therapist and treatment forbidden, is that concern as unreasonable as it sounds to me? I'll keep an open mind, regardless.

However, where do I even find someone specialized in gender issues? My googling efforts have turned rather fruitless, not finding any specialized therapists making their services and availability clear online, and I'm lightly afraid of picking a random one, as I can't find any sources of people's experiences with most of them either.

Should I just... pick a random mental health professional and go?"
PancakesaurusRex,asktransgender,"To those of you who have decided to not transition in the end, how do you do it?","I chose to not transition a couple of years ago, and some days it becomes really hard to remember why I'm even abstaining in the first place. I remember realizing I was trans when I was a young teen, and I promised myself that once I left high school, I was going to finally become happy and identify as the gender I always wanted to be a part of. As time went on and I actually graduated, I began to realize how important my family, my girlfriend (I'm a male), and my career are to me as well, and in the end, I chose to not do so.

On days like this, I wonder to myself why do I even put up with the always looming unhappiness just so I can make those I love happy. I grew up with a single father, and we both love each other very much, but I know if I were to undergo a sex change, I would not be able to ever speak to him again. As for my girlfriend, I know that if I changed I would become unattractive to her since she's only into men and we'd be best friends at best, and I don't want that considering that she is the world to me and I'm planning on proposing to her in a few months. Meanwhile, it's also my dream to become a famous filmmaker and I'm afraid that if I were to change my appearance, people would not be able to take me seriously professionally in my career, and so I chose to not do so for that reason either. 

At this point, I'd like to hear how those of you that are also trans but are choosing to not change are doing as well. I'm hoping that maybe I'll hear something on how any of you guys are doing that will make me feel better about the last few days. My girlfriend has been a huge source of support for me since I came out to her when we first started dating, but even her kind words don't do a whole lot for me past a certain point because I know she will never truly understand how I feel. 

Is it such a weird thing to want to forgo something that would be integral to my happiness just for the sake of those I love and my art? The latter makes me happy too, but it's like there's always this huge elephant in the room for me lately and it eats me up inside. Hell, even if I decided to change, there's no guarantee I'll walk out the other end as being able to pass and looking like the reasonably attractive young woman I always dreamed of being.

In the end, how do you guys move day to day with this kind of thing? Sorry if it got too drawn out with this post, but I feel like I had to get it off my chest somewhere since I know that whatever tree I'd bark up to otherwise, it'd be the wrong one."
annalee9831,asktransgender,A funny note on passing,"I thought I'd share this since passing is such a big concern for many of us (myself included). While we were out shopping today, my wife (cisF) was sir'd on three separate occasions. She does have a short haircut, but she definitely looks female in the face. It's a great reminder that passing isn't a science, and even cis women/men can ""fail"" in certain situations. "
LostTrans,asktransgender,After nearly 7 months on HRT i'm back into questioning again :(,"So, today i wanted to spend the evening as me and stop living this seemingly endless life dressed as a man.
I dressed up with some clothes i just bought recently, did my make up and everything.
And before going out, i looked at myself a last time and i was still able to see my male face behind all of this, i was a little depressed but i just remembered that during those last months i male-failed quite a few times.
I just got over my fears and finally had the courage to get out even if i already did it the past.
Everything went smoothly, i was actually finally happy that i did it and extremely enjoyed that everyone was actually seeing me as the woman i am.
The thing is that i felt so insecure mainly because i don't own a car and i need to use public transportation to move around the city. I was constantly afraid and paranoid that someone will recognize that i am transgender and insults me or worse attack me even though everything went fine i was constantly scared.
When i got back home i hated the fact that i was scared and paranoid, i just see now how easy life is when i'm dressed as a man that i started questioning again if i really want live as a woman.
I don't wanna live the rest of my life scared and in constant fear even though it cures dysphoria.
I feel so selfish that i choose to transition over my parents that raised me hoping that i will become a successful man.
Transitioning actually did not bring me any happiness but instead only sadness and i lost everything i had (Family, Friends) and i don't know how it will turn up in the future and i am just wondering now why would someone go through what i call hell (Hormones - FFS or FMS - Other surgeries - SRS) when they had it easier as their assigned gender. I know dysphoria sucks but why.
I am thinking of stopping hormones even though i can't do it. I really want to continue my transition but i feel so low now.

Finally, i am so sorry for the rant.

cyanmallet,asktransgender,How do you handle the large swings in dysphoria?,"I think I should give some context to explain what I mean. I started going full time about two weeks ago despite still waiting to start with hrt. Generally it has made me so much happier, but then there are the bad times.

Yesterday I went to a MAC and had my makeup done professionally. I am lucky enough to have a rather androgynous body and already having very feminine mannerisms and voice. We went out for dinner last night and I was wearing a dress in public for the first time. To my own huge surprise I actually passed, nobody called me anything other than ma'am the entire night. I have a hard time believing it was anything other than country because I definitely don't look female to myself, but my friend tried to convince me it was in my head. I felt absolutely great while we were out and have never been more confident in myself. Right until I got home and took of the makeup. Suddenly the man in the mirror was staring right back at me, and like an idiot I took off the makeup before the dress (dresses tend to really trigger my dysphoria, yesterday was the first time I've felt comfortable in one). It got so bad that despite how great the rest of the day had actually been I was crying myself to sleep. Does anyone have similar experiences? How do you handle the the dysphoria when it hits you like that? Thanks a lot in advance &lt;3"
xDreamsleep,asktransgender,For those that need to come out to HR at work,"I have been wanting to come out to HR for over a month now and the anxiety has been just getting worse everyday I thought about it. Everyday I would tell myself this is the day but I would freak out as soon as I seen the office door. Well today I finally did it and am very please with the response. 

It can be very hard for each step we take in our journey but you never know how things will be until you do it. I kept telling myself that even though Im scared to talk to HR I know I'll leave her office in a good mood. Things like this just have to be faced head on and with a positive outlook.

Although it seemed odd to me the response I got was excitement. The HR lady seemed happy for me and excited that she could help. She told me her number 1 goal is to insure my safety and to make sure there is no harassment. 

Pretty much what Im getting at in this post is we all have doubts and low points. We all get to a point where we feel stuck and can't move forward. Just believe in yourself and push forward when you hit a wall and you will be surprised just how good the results can be. This hasn't been my first hang up but it was definitely the hardest. I got through this with positive thinking and determination. All of you can do the same. I believe in all of you and all it takes is believing in yourself.

Hope someone finds this post helpful in anyway."

DeadliestTulip,asktransgender,i dont have a question,"its not really a rant either. i just need to get my thoughts out some where.

i started HRT on Oct 19th. WHen I started I felt happy and amazing. my Confidence grew.  I felt like everything was working properly like I had he right plumbing.

On Nov 19th - I already started noticing changes. Even the slightest change made me feel happy. Forward to Mid December and I was told that my estrogen is too high and that they can't re-order my estrogen. I still take my spiro tho. At this point tho I noticed hair thinning and facial hair thinning. CHest hair was thining. I felt even more amazing. So at the time I'm like ok 1780 is super high Im sure I can hold out until I see my doctor next. Too be honest it was probably too high as I was literaly crying over nothing.

Forward to present day now and I don't feel happy anymore. I feel different. I think my estrogen is too low now. I don't feel feminine and I hate being a dude. I feel like I got teased and suffering from it. Like I get it they're trying to keep me safe. Blood clots who wants that. I just feel like certain parts of my system is falling apart. My hair that was thinning is growing in again. I think My ""bald"" spot is going bald again. A lot of hair grew back in. I have 2 weeks until I see my doctor again and I'm hoping I'll be ok. Dysphoric episodes are the worst and I really don't want to experience those again. My friends keep telling me that I look the same and I still look feminine. But I feel different. Maybe it's just a plecebo thing because I'm not taking estrogen right now. I dunno.

OK sorry just need to talk. 

Edit:
I need to talk some more.

For me, I don't know about any one else, dysphoric epsidoes involve suicidal thoughts. They are relentless and very difficult to control. Since starting HRT literally halted those.  I once confused it for bi-polar disorder. I'll be happy one minute and want to die the next. Sounds pretty bi-polar right. I think that's why people confuse gender dysphoria to bi-polar disorder. Completely not even related. To treat bi-polar they take lithium for trans people we take estrogen. Not even in the same drug category. 

Ok I think I'm done for now.

In some ways I feel like I've had lots of friends and in some ways I don't.  What I mean by that is many feel more like acquaintances.  Probably because as time goes on people settle down and go their separate ways. I've had very good friends in the past and before everyone went separate ways, most of the time was spent drinking and partying.  Although I was heavily repressing my trueself, we had fun times.

Since then, I got married, became a dad and got divorced with full custody.  I enjoy the time I spend with my daughter but I don't get much time to get out and when I do most of my old friends are either difficult to get hold of or they are busy with their families.

I know I should meet knew people but I hesitate because I don't want new friends to see me as a man.  With old friends, its still difficult but they already have the male image of me.  I tried finding other trans people in the area but everyone seems to be looking for some kinds of fwb which I'm not looking for any kind of physical relationship.  Also, I'm working on starting hrt and hope to transition socially this year and I'd like for new friends to only know me as a woman if at all possible.  Maybe I'm wrong to feel this way."

Trans_Taylor,asktransgender,[NSFW] How can I separate my sexual feelings from my being trans?,"So, I have pretty recently realized that I might be trans. I feel a lot of similar feelings to other posters, and pretty much every search I have done on /r/asktransgender has come up with a someone else who felt the same thing as I have. I realized that I am jealous of women's bodies and their clothes. I realized that I relate to female protagonists in books and on TV. If I can get over my embarrassment, I pick a female character in video games. I have tried on women's clothing, and like the feeling of it. When I think of being a girl, and look at other trans women's success, I get an ache in my chest. But all of this is undermined by the fact that every time I think about being transgender, or myself transitioning, or just being a girl, I often become aroused.

I just can't get over that it might be a fetish. My first exposure to transgender characters, specifically boys to girls, was through erotic fiction. This led to a rabbit hole of me eventually only seeking out these types of stories, and then just doing research on the topic.

I have had dreams about just being a girl. Before I go to bed, I make up stories in my head about being males changed into girls; some are sexual, but many are not. I just can't seem to separate what is sexual attraction and what is wanting to be female. 

Is there some technique or something to be sure?

Malloryisaboyname,asktransgender,Embarrassed trying to fax IC documents at Office Depot. Is there somewhere better I can go?,"Doc says I have to fax them for the sake of my privacy, but I feel thoroughly exposed trying to fax these papers at Office Depot. I mean, maybe if they didn't all saying things like ""**INFORMED CONSENT--TESTOSTERONE FOR TRANSGENDER PATIENTS**"" and ""**YOUR BODY'S CHANGES ON TESTOSTERONE**"" and ""**TRANSGENGEDER HEALTHCARE PATIENT INTAKE FORM**"" and  ""**SEXUAL CHANGES**"" in big bold letters on the top of the pages. But I gotta fax all 17 pages, so I took them to Office Depot. Tried to be very discreet, and then the guy just takes them and starts rifling through them. Puts them in the machine and they start going through, but then goes to do something else so when they come out of the machine they fly all over. Them the machine jams. He picks all the paper back up but it's all out of order, so now he's sorting through them trying to put them back in order for me. I say ""please let me do that"", he insists he's got it, I more firmly say ""give me my papers"", and he reluctantly hands them over so I can sort them back into order. I once again try to hand them to him somewhat discreetly, and again he starts rifling through them, counting out the number of pages before it jammed, and takes those seven and puts the other ten back in the machine, and then just fucking walks around holding the first seven pages. I ask him to give them to me, he says ""but I'm not sure if they went through"", I say I'd like to hold them, he gives them back, I hold them for a minute while he helps other customers, then he comes back and asks for them back and tries to put all 17 pages back through. I ask if there's anything wrong, and he says ""no it just takes a minute, why don't you wander a little?"" so I do, and as each page comes through he sets them god damn face up on the fucking counter that other customers are coming up to, with my sensitive medical paperwork just laying their face up. I rush back and collect up the pages and flip them over. The machine jams again, this time at 10 pages. The guy gives me the rest of the pages, says to wait a minute cause it was sending pages through faster than it was faxing them so it needed to catch up, has another employee come help me, and goes to do other things. The exact same sort of blatant disregard for the sensitivity of my papers happens twice more with this second employee, and finally I just leave cause it's not going through.

I want to start hormones, I need to get these papers faxed, but god damn am I thoroughly embarrassed by tonight. I don't want to go back there. My parents asked me where I had been when I got home, and since I'm carrying an Office Depot bag (I bought a sim card for my phone at the beginning) and a stack of papers I can't very well lie so I say I had to fax things. Both of them offered to take it to work and fax it for me, but I didn't want them to see what I was faxing either (I'm out to them, but their responses were basically ""we're not gonna disown you or anything but we don't want to be a part of this"") so I said no and now they're gossiping trying to figure out what I was trying to send.

should I go back to stupid Office Depot? Would UPS or Kinkos be better? Is there anywhere I can do the faxing myself instead of having an employee do it? Because tonight was just awful.

Edit: update: this afternoon I went to the UPS store and tried to fax it again. They guy wouldn't let me self-fax but he was much better, didn't rifle through my pages or anything, and it went through easily (though we had to divide into into two parts; he let me do the dividing instead of going through himself.) Overall a much more pleasant experience, and once my papers are processed I'll have an appointment to start T!"

NenaDaconte,asktransgender,I let go on a date with an amazing guy who was interested in my personality and not in my appearence. MtF rant.,"I let go on a date with a straight male who wanted to get to know me for me. He thought I was beautiful from my pictures and he wanted to get to know me for my personality. I chickened out because I felt ugly and not passable enough. An hour before our date he sent me a text telling me that he knows that a transition takes years and that he doesn't expect me to be perfect. He told me that he would take me for who I am and that he wants to see me growing as a woman and a person. 

I sent him a message half an hour before our date telling him that I won't come and that if he respects me he should leave me alone. I broke his heart. He sent me a text back that he waited there for an hour and that he understands my fears. He is so disseapointed that I didn't show up and if I would ever want someone to talk to that I'm still welcome. He waited more than an hour for me and still he isn't mad at me. He invited me again for lunch on Thursday in the cafetaria of his university. 

What a fool am I? This guy isn't ashamed to introduce me to his family, he truly likes me for who I am and when I told him that I feel ugly he replied that he didn't care about my appearence too much and that all he wants is a woman to find happiness with. He is monogamous, smart and sweet. What a fool am I?

I purposely wear gender neutral clothes. I could wear masculine clothes, which I do own, but I just don't wear them because it makes me feel more masculine, and wearing neutral kind of hides my masculinity a bit more. I do often wear a men's t shirt under a unisex hoodie (which I don't take off) 


I threw out a pair  of my trainers/sneakers and replaced them  unisex shoes, just because I hate the fact they are too masculine. 



I've gone off certain interests, I hardly ever play video games now, I feel bad for being into cars, as that's a masculine thing. I know that women can like it, but I just dislike being associated with male interests as it makes me feel less like a woman. 





I was completely fine with this until 3/4 months ago. I've never really been a guy that would like to wear button shirts and suits and have their hair all stylish or anything.

helpiwantcuddles,asktransgender,Any Favorite Sex Tips or Resources? (MTF),"My girlfriend and I (both MTF) have pretty different experiences with genital dysphoria. I don't really have any and she has lots.

We've had really phenomenal sex in the past, and just holding her tight is still magical, but increasingly, touching or doing things that get her excited down there make her upset. We've talked about it and we're both committed to having sex that works for us. Since it's such a difficult issue for her I want to bring lots of options to the table for when we get to start scheming.

The Situation As I Currently Understand It:

* We don't have an issue with changing attractions; I can get her aroused easily.
* Her distress is with her own body. It doesn't bother her to see ""flaws"" reflected in mine.
* Seeing lumps where they don't belong freaks her out.
* She prefers to keep panties on.
* Touching downstairs is sometimes ok (less often lately) when it's clear that it's just heavy petting.
* Masturbation is equally problematic.
* She enjoys nipple play / light torture.
* Very ticklish: good sensations in moderation but easily goes sour.
* She wants to try but stuff but the level of prep involved puts her off.
* She needs to be stress-free to consider sex.

What Doesn't Work:

* Getting frisky under the blankets (too hot for her and too little communication)
* Treating her bits like they're the ones she wants (the touch still freaks her out)
* Anal (too messy and she feels like the pressure's on when it's something that involves planning, but she still wants to figure out how to make it work)

Any tips or tricks?

I've read about muffing and inguinal canal stuff which sounds intriguing and I think would probably be an ok place to touch. I think someone said that it looked like getting fingered, and with how much the optics mater to her I think that would be ideal. That said, I've experimented a little on myself to try to figure out how I would implement it for her, and I don't get any pleasurable sensation. Maybe I'm doing it wrong?"

I am FtM, Pre-transition on in all forms, except I have begun socially transitioning. I have a bad habit of inflicting guilt upon myself, for no good reasons other than overthinking. What can I say? The family I have is small, but treasured deeply: I couldn't stand knowing I did something that ended up hurting them. 

My greatest concern right now is... how will my transition psychologically affect my Biological child? 

My kiddo is two, as of right now, and my husband (his father) is very accepting of my transition too. So there is a very healthy, positive environment on the behalf of our relationship being virtually unaffected by my coming out. (No kidding: my husband laughed, came out to me as being Pan before ever meeting me, and admitted he was wondering how long it'd take for me to admit being who I am to myself)

But, no doubt to the scarcity of studies ever being done, I cannot find any reports on how well children mentally cope with a parent's transition. I have seen studies (that conflict one another) on same-sex parenting: but that's another can of worms I'd rather avoid opening right now.

broken-neurons,asktransgender,MTF - Strange health issues since estrogen dosage was reduced. Help!,"Since my estrogen dosage was reduced back early December I've been having several health issues which are a bit weird. They are namely:

- Difficulty sleeping
- Waking up with nighttime sweats
- Itchy skin. Worst areas are the mons pubis region, under the arms, lower arms and lower legs and ears.

After searching on the internet I seem to be showing the signs of Perimenopause: 

- http://www.webmd.com/menopause/guide/guide-perimenopause
- http://www.theperimenopauseblog.com/35-symptoms-of-perimenopause-dry-itchy-skin/

Is that even possible for transgender women?

I read that women in Perimenopause can alleviate the symptoms using progesterone, but I'm already on 5mg Androcur per day, which I thought was a strong progestin in itself. Would a progesterone cream be something that might help, or could it clash with the Androcur?

I use a gel pump for the estrogen, and my dosage has been halved from 4 pumps to 2. My most recent blood tests had my estrogen level over 600 pg/ml from a previous reading of 240, which was why is was reduced. The key difference being quitting smoking between the two tests.

I would like to resolve the sleep issues primarily, as it is starting to take its toll on my daily life. Would I be better applying the estrogen gel just before I go to sleep, rather than in the morning after my shower as I do currently?"

I'm a trans girl, out, but not on hormones yet.

I have been tucking for three months, using what I could find since I live with my parents (I'm eighteen). Meaning I used what was recommended on youtube videos, a cut tube sock and the top of some pantyhose to make a gaff. I'm wearing it underneath another pantyhose and lycra boxers.
It kinda holds through the day, but it hurts a lot, especially while sitting in class, and I can barely focus. I have to use the bathroom every one hour and a half to relieve a bit of the pain.

I think it's due to the penis getting pulled in and by the folds of the gaff, especially beneath the butt, it's very uncomfortable. I also have no idea what to do with the extra skin, scrotum and such. My penis is kinda small but I don't know if it's related. I tried to cut the gaff thinner but it gets even worse and doesn't hold.
I can't use tape because of a lot of hair that grows back really quick.

Please excuse any bad English or things I may have worded badly, maybe even offensively I don't know, I am tired right now :(


I'm an 18 years old male(?) currently identify as homosexual, but I'm not entirely sure about My gender anymore.


This all started last year, when I 'came out' to myself as not straight, then some friends and gradually got to where I am now identifying as gay, throughout this process of figuring myself out I also kind of started to question gender, I've always viewed myself badly and had no confidence.


When I started to identify as gay, I started to act more feminine, tried to raise my voice when talking with my close friends. This made me really happy, I looked in the mirror and didn't think badly of myself that day, it felt really weird.


For the longest time I've kinda wished I was a girl, and I can safely say that if I was given the option to time travel and make myself be born female, I would without thinking twice about It.


I absolutely hate being masculine, when my voice goes deep when I'm tired or sick I hate speaking because it makes me sound too manly.

When I look at really muscly men I don't think of being them at all, it disgusts me to even think of being that manly.


But I don't feel the same way at all when I think of myself as a girl, I think I'd be fine with it...


On the flipside, i don't know if I am entirely comfortable identifying as a girl and being transgender, I know that if I was I also wouldn't want to transition as I hate meds and operations and all those things.


I looked into it some, I found the demigender labels and i think demigirl suits me well, but i don't know...


In the end I'm not even sure why I'm posting this, I guess I would just like some opinions and input and discussion in this confusing time."

Fly_By_Orchestra,asktransgender,I just gave myself my first IM injection solo. I think I messed up?,"Just for clarification, it's prescribed, and I did go in two weeks ago to get training for it with a nurse (performed it myself with her supervising). 

What happened this time is that everything was going fine. Got the needle in my leg. Aspirated. No blood, a little resistance. But in checking the plunger for blood the needle rose up out of my skin (it didn't exit, but it rose a good cm or two). I simply drove the needle back down and injected. 

My muscle twitched a bit from this, but apart from that it felt more or less like the one I did in the clinic. 

Now, my concern, is that should I have aspirated again when I shoved the needle back down? Could I have unwittingly injected into a vein/blood vessel? There were few tiny bubbles (which the nurse told me were fine) but I'm scared of something bad happening if they ended up in my bloodstream."

We have been actually doing very well together. We have always been in sync but these last few days have been closer than we have been for a while. The subject came up about kids again and I declined. When pressed for the reason I decided to come out. 

I've been in therapy for the last two months and had known I was transgender for years, but I could never get the courage to come out. Weather has stopped me from my last two sessions and I have been hanging on a limb over it till tonight.

After the tears and confusion was over and the shock came in she called her parents up and had them come over. After coming out a second time to them, they let into me as to how stupid I was for coming out. They insisted I should have had three therapists, a letter from my GP (which won't be able to see me till March) and should have broken it to her at the Therapist office. There were surprisingly few questions, just a few ""How do you know"" and ""What do you want from being a woman"" questions. I tried my best, but it clearly didn't ease any hostility.

I want to transition and deal with the dysphoria that has been eating me up. However, my wife has told me that there is nothing for us down that path, and we will be strained from now on if I don't transition and find other ways to deal with it.

I don't live by any of my family and my friends have suddenly dried up. I'm at home alone and feeling like an idiot. I felt like I had thought things through and had it planned out. Now I am alone surrounded by a house contains all I have achieved in life and I feel I just gave it all away for nothing. She even took the dog I loved on her way out to stay with her parents. I'm on the edge and considering getting a box of ammo and ending it tonight. F--k being strong, I am stupid enough to wreak my marriage, not to far from ending my life. I mean, it already feels over already. Do I just go back to living with increasingly suicidal dysphoria, or end it with some dignity? Did I really need all that s--t her parents wanted anyways? Can I really be OK losing it all? I don't even know if my job will keep me after Trump takes office. Is being Transgender such a ""fad"" diagnosis that I can't be honest? Why couldn't they just be ignorant biggots, at least then I could have written it off better... Sorry for the vent, but I really need anyone right now.

This sadly means that six months of real life experience is still a requirement to start HRT (so much for ""first country to remove transgender as a mental illness""...). 

I'm lucky to have a rather androgynous body and I have already long hair that several of my female friends have commented told me that they are jealous of. On days where my dysphoria is not too bad I am actually kind of looking forwards to this, because I want to finally start living as I've always felt, and not having a choice means I'll do it faster. Then there are the days where my dysphoria is bad and I can only see all my make features and know that I will never pass before I stay on hormones and the thought of going out like that absolutely terrifies me.

I'm already out to most of my friends and my parents, but the thought of being a woman I public is so scary. Did anyone else have to do real life experience? How did you handle it? "

juliagirl1,asktransgender,dysphoria and prostatitis,"so ive been at home from school, kinda wasting away, trying to recover from this prostatitis, which basically makes it impossible for me to tuck because it will be very painful. Now im starting to think it's chronic because the antibiotics are finished and Ive seen some improvement but im not in the slightest cured. This has driven me into a deeper depression where I dont shave or keep myself more feminine looking. I feel disgusting and although today i will shave my body again, I wont be able to wear panties still and have to wear mens underwear, which makes me sad. I really was proud of myself for replacing my mens underwear over the last year. im at home, going by owen, because my parents (as much as they try to understand) are still uncomfortable and honestly, I'm uncomfortable going by Julia around them. Also my shitty cousin lives with us and she makes me so fucking jealous. She's beautiful and sheltered and literally doesn't have to worry about anything it feels like (which probably isnt true, but it seems that way). Anyway, on the prostatitis reddit page, I feel weird as a trans person posting there and I wish there was more info on transgender ppl with prostatitis because I cant imagine any of us having an easier time with it than cis people. All my doctors think that my reaction to this disease in correlation with my transness is making it extra stressful and I would say they are 100% right. "
demcmd,asktransgender,How long is long enough to start tying your hair back?,"I've been growing my hair out for a while and it's getting to the point where the front part, if not parted, goes over my mouth and everything else is close to hitting my shoulders. I'm ecstatic about this (obviously) as I think my hair may reach to my shoulders by summertime, but obviously long hair creates problems with constantly having to brush it aside when wind blows or gravity becomes a bitch.

GabiCap,asktransgender,Accepting it doesn't mean I need to act now,"I've looked at this every possible way. Believe me, I'm trying every possible way to come to the realization I'm not a transwoman and am just making all this up.

And while driving home after a therapist appointment (yay for an hour drive back!) where I laid out my best anti-arguments it kinda hit me. I'm trans. The way I see myself, the way I interact with women and men and want to be seen by others. Those times I've joined men's groups to ""learn how to be a man"" so I can act like it.

I'm now letting that sit with me but it got me thinking, even though I'm transgender, I don't need to act now. All options available before acceptance are still available. Sure, I feel the clock ticking if I ever plan on being a cute 20-something, but I don't have to rush.

And I kinda feel freer now to lose those extra pounds, work on that voice, buy that cute top and rock it.

The one fear of acceptance is action. But I'm thinking I could wait on that and let the acceptance sit with me.

Anyone felt the same? And if acceptance is a process, how do you keep it going without ignoring it as a phase again and just let it be?"
[deleted],asktransgender,Tell me I'm overthinking things?,"I've been full time for the past year everywhere but work, until (hopefully) this week. I'm going to be going to court to make the name change final this month (everything's already prepared) so that means finally telling my boss. I'm not worried that my work isn't going to be accepting, as I work for a tech company that is very inclusive, what I'm worried about is way less reasonable sounding.

So, my boss is trans. She works in a separate office (we have multiple locations) but is the head of my department, which in my office consists of only 4 employees including myself. One of the four is transmasculine. So, when I come out at work, 2/4 of us, half of us will be trans, with a trans boss. I'm worried that people will think this is anything more than coincidence. Our department is small but the company as a whole is not too small, I think we have like 200 employees at my office total. 

Of course, I know no one would make this drastic of a change, and go through so much shit for anyone but themselves. Buuuuut, that still doesn't stop me from feeling like someone will think that, that I'm trying to get in my boss's favor oooor that our boss is playing favorites and intentionally filling the department with trans folks... I've even had fleeting concerns that my boss will be mad about it, because it could it could put her under the spotlight to be accused of favoritism or something. However I don't think that's the case, and I feel like she'll probably be excited more than anything.

I'm going to bring it up to her hopefully tomorrow or Friday since she is going to be in town, buuuuut.... I'm scared. Plenty of people probably already suspect it because well, they're not blind, and things have been changing quick, but it's never been so real feeling until now. Am I overthinking? Are these concerns valid? Am I just crazy?"

A while back I swore I was trans but decide that in the end it was probably just a period of questioning and I wasn't truly trans. But now I'm thinking about it again.

Would it be better to stop waxing now, and wait for HRT ?"
Mellowbelle,asktransgender,How do I ask my family how feminine they think I am without them trying to spare my feelings and tell me the opposite?,"I feel like I've always been a bit feminine, not super feminine, but definitely feminine enough for people to notice.

I'm afraid that they'll try to tell me that I'm not feminine, or that I am masculine, because they probably think that telling me that I'm feminine would hurt my feelings or something. 

So what's the best way to get an honest answer out of them? Should I tell them upfront that I am not expecting them to tell me that I'm masculine? But wouldn't that kind of sway their answers a bit? Any and all help would be appreciated."
Tigerseventeen,asktransgender,Are implants as good as doctors say?,"Hi all! I'm pre-HRT and have a friend who's a few months into it. Both of us are quite fond of implants as our preferred HRT method (both Australian btw).

I've heard from doctors that implants are the best because of the high E levels and relative lack of side effects, but after reading into them I've found stories with somewhat mixed responses. I've heard that they don't cycle your estrogen levels as well as they should and this can cause tachyphylaxis, while I know you have to replace the implants every 4-6 months anyway, I was just wondering if this time frame is enough to ward off said tachyphylaxis.

I was also wondering if implants are the best HRT method in general. Thanks!"
dolphinsarepink,asktransgender,Puberty Blockers at 19? (MTF),"I have read that puberty does not end at 18 (I'm nearly 19) and may continue masculising well into the 20s. I am terrified that permanent developments such as facial bone growth and height may still be waiting for me and it's making me feel suicidal. 

I'm already getting less than six hours sleep some nights because I read that less sleep means less puberty. 

I already know I'll have to have FFS because HRT alone won't change my brow and eagle-like expression. But I guess I've still got fat in my cheeks and I'm terrified of losing it: http://imgur.com/a/3klPd

The NHS waiting list for me is said to be 10 months and I have yet to phone up the GIC and confirm whether I'm on it. By my first appointment my face might be even more manly then it is now. I'm already 5'9 and don't want to grow any taller.

My parents are supportive but they just can't seem to see what I'm getting at. And my parents were terrified for me when I suggested using the internet to find a GP like Dr Webberley who sells bridging prescriptions. 

I've already had a previous GP in the same surgery patronise me and 'play God' by trying to send me off to a mental disability centre. And now that I finally have a GP whose supportive my parents say I don't wanna rock the boat by being impatient and pestering him by checking up that he's referred me to the GIC. 

But I'm finding it hard to be patient and live in the present moment when my body may be continuing to masculinise. I look at photos of myself from two years ago and I haven't really changed much at all, but that makes me feel like some kind of spurt is being stored up to catch me out. Plus, the sooner I start the better I will look female. 

I didn't worry too much in my mid-teens because I thought I could get away with not transitioning, 'convinced' myself it was all a fetish and that masculinity was the 'cure.' If I had known the intense emotions of wanting to be a girl were here to stay, I would've started earlier. 

The main reason I ask about puberty blockers and not HRT as well is because I have five months of my college A levels left and don't want things to get awkward in the classrooms.

It's not that I care about what others will think. I'm a complete nobody so I have no one really to come out to other than my seven siblings (who don't even live with me.) 

If I'm successful in getting a private prescription can I take puberty blockers as a standalone prevention measure during the five months? 

Would it guarantee no more irreversible male changes to my body? Or should I just leave it till June when I wrap up for the summer?

AuroraSophia,asktransgender,The millionth: how do I come out to my family thread... I really need help.,"I'm in a weird situation... im mostly independent from my folks.. parents are divorced, mom went back to home country, dad stayed and got remarried and now I have a 2 year old step sister... which is awesome.. 

My dad's side of the family are quite liberal and probably would not do anything too drastic, but because of the little one, things might become a bit more complicated... complicated as in... my family kept addressing me as kor kor [and then my guy name] (which means older brother). Having them call me that fells like I'm getting stabbed in the heart. I know that they don't know and it's not their fault, but I can't change the way I feel. If I do come out to them, it's gonna be hard to explain it to the little one and that's what's holding me from coming out... if things go south, and I'd have to choose between her and the family and me doing what I'm doing, without a second heartbeat I'd choose continuing doing what I'm doing.. but it would be saddening that I could potentially lose a huge pillar of support... 

On my mom's side, she's very understanding but if anything happens she'd always blame herself and think that she did something to caused that. Now she's in no way suicidal, but might go into depression like she did after my parents split up.. 

 I would say 95% independent from either, financially and if things come to worst, I'd be fine, but I'd just be heartbroken.

I feel like telling my mom, because it might be like ripping a band-aid and after that the talking and healing can begin.. but again... there is always that uncertainty that she might not take it well.."
em-jay,asktransgender,Failing to transition: Am I right to be anxious about getting treatment?,"I'm on a waiting list for my first appointment at Charing Cross in London, which is expected around June/July. I've become increasingly concerned recently that they are very unlikely to consider that I've done enough to warrant treatment. I don't expect to be recommended for HRT for quite some time. The problem is that I haven't been making many changes to my living situation since I was first referred.

On the one hand, I present as at least a little feminine on a daily basis, professionally and personally. I wear makeup daily and nail polish regularly, and most of my wardrobe is made up of womens jeans and t-shirts and things. On the other hand, I have failed to: come out to anyone who actually lives in the same city as me, except for my gf; change my name; think of a name I'd like to  change my name to; ever leave the house in clothing that couldn't be mistaken for menswear; work on my voice; or in any way intentionally presented as female.

I have heard from a number of sources that treatment will be further delayed if I'm not out and living as a woman. And I've been told that if they don't see me as a woman when I turn up, they won't think I'm taking this seriously. But I think I might've pushed myself as far as I can possibly go without support.

Am I right to be worried about all this? And has anyone else ever been in the same situation?"

-mousey-,asktransgender,Trying to build muscle while on HRT and blocking T (gasp!),"Sup!

So I started hormones about six months ago. After some initial worries and doubts I've gotten used to them and they've helped with my dysphoria so much. 

Without constant dysphoria, I'm way less concerned with what a woman is supposed to do, how they're supposed to look and how they're supposed to dress and I've started exploring myself a lot more. 

I like to dress way more masc than most of the girls I know, I like to shout more than the girls I know, I like to compete more than the girls I know, and I like to hit the gym way way more (and harder) than the girls I know. I'm super into being the strongest and best and just generally pushing myself harder now that I'm not absolutely terrified of anything that's traditionally associated with 'masculine'. I guess I'd say I'm a tomboy, or whatever. 

Anyway I've been reading about the effects of testosterone on muscle building and muscle growth, and I fully understand that it will be much slower and more difficult now that I'm all E'd up. But I've also been reading about the effects of birth control in CIS women and how blocking the boost in T people get from exercise can effect strength in a pretty major way. I'm sort of worried that T-blockers will effect me in the same way - I'm not concerned about being disadvantaged against males because that's obvious and I no longer compare myself to them, I'm just worried that I'll be disadvantaged against other women when it comes to progressing from training.

It's frustrating because all the articles I read on MTF fitness and training are like ""top ten tips to shrink your thighs!"" and ""how to get a killer toned butt!"" rather than ""How to bench press the universe like the absolute savage you were born to be!""... I mean I understand why but come on!!

Anyway, any athletes/bodybuilders/fitness freaks here? I'd love some tips if you have them! Also do you find it manageable to keep improving? Or have you found your training has plateaued? "

Gc13psj,asktransgender,My flatmate just laughs at me when trans stuff comes up. I don't know what to do about it.,"I've been on hormones for a year, and went full time during the summer break before moving in with her in September. I try not to bring it up with her, and avoid talking to her in general now, but sometimes I have tro, and somehow something to do with being trans comes up, and she always either looks at me like I'm talking nonsense, or just flat out laughs at me.

We live and study in the same class together, so she's always around. She always wants to walk into uni together, which means we spend a lot of time together just us. She never tries to make conversation walking into uni, so it falls upon to talk and force conversation out of her, and again inevitable some trans stuff comes up. These days I try and avoid talking with her, but it makes it really awkward in the mornings in the flat :/

Am I being overly sensitive, or is she being a horrible person? I can't tell, It makes me feel terrible, but when friends are around they ignore it, and she acts like I'm being really over sensitive when I try and bring it up with her.

For example, just now we were discussing the shower being broke, and I said we'll have to get gym memberships to use their showers, and she gives me a weird look, and I say, ""Agh, that'll be a bit of a problem for me :/"" and she just laughs her head off and walks away.

Another example is one time this guy started harassing me when I was trying to go to into the local LGBT support centre. It really shook me up and upset me, so I got home really upset, and and she saw. So she asked what was wrong. This was about a month into knowing her so I told her, and she laughed her head off. There wasn't an ounce of empathy or understanding, and she said 
""Well you *want* to be a woman, what do you expect?""

I don't know what to do, does anyone have any suggestions of what I should say, or if I'm just being over sensitive? :/"

But the only explanation I have for this is that my T was running at unnatural levels possibly since puberty. 

I'm now torn and all over the place about my T levels because on the one hand if I am AIS then does that mean I don't need Female T levels to achieve E dominance, and/or does this mean my new T level is where it was supposed to be or what the fuck is going on. I feel GREAT, but I'm accessing the types of feminisation much faster than [the graphs](http://imgur.com/MN5MYrW) say and I'd swear i've had pelvic tilt too.

(DIY so can forget asking a doctor) /freaked

I've linked my levels solely because the low E may be relevant to understanding where I'm coming from. I'm under no illusions that my T reduction may be aberrant or incorrect, and I suspect getting from 10 to 2-3 is going to as difficult as it is for most MtF."

maccas196,asktransgender,Could I have cancer?,"I'm 21 MtF and about 1.5 months on hormones. Before starting hormones, I had gynecomastia (male breast growth) in my right breast, however it was only mild. After starting hormones, my right breast has grown much faster than the left, and the hard gynecomastia lump that was under the nipple has spread almost entirely around the nipple also, and is tender to touch. The lymph node between my right nipple and right armpit also has swollen, and the mass is firm/hard/tender. I figured it was normal for one to grow faster than the other, and ignored it.

Last week I discovered a lump in my left groin, and immediately thought it was a hernia because it was quite painful. Went to the doctor and he said that while it's possibly a hernia, it's too firm/solid and doesn't move when I cough (like a hernia should). He asked if I had any infections in my left leg, and I haven't. I'm having an ultrasound on it tomorrow.

EDIT: from what I've read, a lump in the groin can be generally three things: hernia, infection, or cancer. If it isn't a hernia (doc didn't think it was), and it isn't infection (he asked, I haven't been sick or had an infection in the leg in forever), then cancer seems to be a likely possibility to me?

I'm starting to get concerned. Firm/solid lumps are often indications of malignancy/cancer from what I've read... and I now have two, in different areas of the body, and both of which have formed after starting hormones. The main question I'm wondering is: if it is a form of cancer, would I be allowed to continue hormone treatment?"

I never really met anybody transphobic than my parents and living with them really let me know the definition of transphobia.

If I ever have a child of my own and they happen to be gay, bi, trans or whatever, I guarantee them that kicking them out will be the last thing I'd do to them. I will love them no matter what. And I will make sure that their fate won't be like mine.

After she left I had a shower and stuff because I was all icky and sweaty from my walk, dressed up in my favorite girl clothes and sat in the lounge and had coffee, then randomly burst into tears, i'm so freaking happy right now, I literally cannot remember being this happy ever before, hopefully this feeling sticks around!"
endlessly_entropy,asktransgender,"Tired of stealth, but no other option.","It's so exhausting when everyone's open about how much they hate you...

Trans_Taylor,asktransgender,Questions about hormones and presenting and family.,"So my previous post gave me a lot to think about, and I am pretty sure that I am trans. I really want to go see a gender therapist, but I do have some questions that I think will help me move along my trans-journey.

My family isn't the most accepting, but I can't really see myself just cutting them out of my life. I want to know, if I started on hormones, just how well could I hide it? I feel like I could transition in everyday life, and I don't have to see my family that often. I don't use social media, so that isn't an issue. I also feel that I would be fine if they just thought I was feminine, or if they thought I was secretly gay or something. I know that a lot of people say that after a few months they have trouble hiding changes; but, I feel that as a girl, I don't really want to be overly feminine. I don't want to always wear dresses or stuff like that, I don't want long fingernails, and my eyebrows are naturally pretty well formed. I am a little over weight, and have been for all my life. I don't want big breasts, in fact I would probably feel uncomfortable with them, although I am not sure. I would probably do voice training, but I don't feel like I will get a tracheal shave. 


To sum this all up, could I pass off a feminized face and body as simply losing weight; could I maintain both my masculine and feminine voices; and, as I don't want large breasts, could i just pass it of as pesky leftover fat, or gynecomastia? Any other changes they might pester me about, but I know they won't be too bad.


Sorry if it sounds like I want the easy way out or something, I don't know. I might change my mind at a later date, and am open to doing so. I just feel like this is a big hurdle to get over, and if I knew that I could just ignore it, I could start accepting myself as a women, and move forward with a transition.


P.S. Talking about this in realistic terms is honestly exciting. It feels like a load of of my chest. I can't wait to go see a therapist, and normally I hate them.

SophieCalle,asktransgender,Social vs legal transition at work in an office full of men,"Hi everyone!  So, of course, I'm continuing on my journey and it's come to the point that I'm looking into how this can be done at my job.  I've got a bit of a unique dilemma.

A few months ago, my company had the HR policies be reviewed with us and with a lawyer, went over everything they expected us to do, and what they were going to do themselves.  Included in that was an explicit statement of supports of transition.  They explained an example and that it was supported.  

Great, right?

Well, I'm a trans woman, obviously coming from a CIS male presentation, in an office full of men.  I'm talking like 50 men, once CIS woman, and me.

I feel like I'm covered on the legal side, but the thought of others' reactions kind of frightens me.

So, does anyone have a similar experience?  How did it go?  

And, what's your advice on the whole thing?  

Should I just transition and change jobs to avoid problems?

I could use anything on this.  Greatly appreciated!

Thanks!"

TristiePixie,asktransgender,The Chair Trick: Works for trans women on HRT? How about trans men? A fun experiment!,"No stupid questions right?

A long while back I ran into a funny ""parlor trick"" that ""proved"" women could do something men could not. It was made popular on the show [All in the Family.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXxrfqY0kA0)

1. Step three foot lengths, toe to heel, away from a wall.

2. Place a chair between you and the wall

3. Lean over so that by touching the wall with your head, your body is an exact right angle, legs straight.

4. Lift the chair to your chest

5. Stand up

The vast majority finds that while women can do this, men cannot, supposedly due to women having a lower center of gravity. [Plenty of Youtube videos show this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW0ZTvRCS1o)

We did this experiment in High School, and it was true, none of the boys could lift the chair. All the girls could. I even remember going home and trying with my family and sister. I couldn't lift it. She could.

Fast forward to today, after 5 radical months of HRT. The trick popped into my mind after feeling for the last month like my walking was getting wobbly and unbalanced. At times I felt like something had changed and I didn't know how to compensate for it. Walking with my hips seemed to do the trick, but I'd still wobble and not always get it right. I wrote it off as learning how to walk like a girl was messing with my head. But what if... I had to try!!

Up went the chair, and up I stood. I was dumbfounded. This was a thing on HRT?!

*No no, that can't be right.*

Slippers, then Socks. Then Shoes. Different shoes. Different chair. Different wall! Farther away. Closer. 

Every time up went the chair, and up I stood as seamlessly and effortlessly as the girls in the videos. Damn was that reaffirming. All is finally right in the universe.

So my question to all of you (both MtF and FtM) AND both pre and post HRT, what are your results? 

1. Are you a trans woman or trans man?
2. How long have you been on HRT?
3. Have you felt your center of gravity shift?
4. Can you stand up?
5. Could you stand up prior to HRT?

HakaweBrave,asktransgender,"New doctor, new dosage. Questions","So, I recently moved across the country days after starting HRT. My starting dosage was 4mg E and 50 mg Spiro. 

Fast forward a month, and I have found a new doctor in my new state. He upped my Spiro dose to 100mg, but took me off E temporarily until I quit smoking cigarettes (went off for about a week, in the end). So, today I go in to see him again, I got my E back, but he has me down to 2mg. Whatever, he's the doctor. 

However, his reasoning was a little odd to me. He said he did some reading over the holidays, and read that  up estrogen levels more slowly leads to better breast growth. High estrogen levels too quickly can lead to faster breast growth, but with weird hard boobs. Whereas stepping estrogen levels up over time leads to more natural feeling breast development. At least, that's what he said.

So, basically, my question is has anyone else heard of this theory? It's just a bit odd to me that I have never heard this before. Especially considering what a frequent topic of conversation breast growth seems to be around here.

Another question I have, that's sort of related: early in transition, how frequently should a hormone panel be done? Is once every three months sufficient to tweak dosages?"
BigStrongGirlyMan,asktransgender,Questioning everything.,"I am a 26 year old guy who has crossdressed for the last 2 years. I came out to my wife that I had always wanted to dress and although she is supportive with my hobby, she does not feel comfortable being at home while I dress and has never seen me in girl mode. I've never truly been happy with myself and I really am only happy these days while dressed.

 since I started dressing I have been proctoring her to take part in girl time with me, but she has always refused. It has definitely led to some tension in our relationship. Over this time I have always told her that I didn't want to transition at any point that dressing was just a hobby. Lately I have been questioning that.

 Sometimes if I look in front of the mirror and close my eyes I see a woman's reflection staring back at me. I hold my hand out in front of my face and see a woman's hand with painted nails. I looked down and see a woman's body with a cute outfit on. And it scares the hell out of me.

 I hate myself for feeling this way. I have a career that is not exactly known for being the most progressive field of work. I just started a five-year apprenticeship that could lead me to making over $100,000 a year. I have been working in this trade for close to 10 years and it is all I know. My job takes me into a lot of industrial places and requires quite a bit of strength and dealing with severe weather while working outside often times.

 I so often wish I could transition and be a girl full time, but I don't want to throw my life away. My wife and I had already been married for over a year when I came out to her. It took her by complete surprise. Like many people, I have over compensated with masculinity in my life. Grew large beard, spend a lot of time working on my truck and restoring antique tractors, picking a very physical labor career, chewing tobacco, and so on. I spent years getting picked on and bullied due to being a sensitive kid and crying a lot, and if compensated by being a big tough guy with little emotion to show. I'm afraid if I were to start transitioning I would lose my career that I am very good at and enjoy, my wife who I love more than anything, and my family.

It seems like the more I dress the more and my wife and I seem to drift apart. After I go back into guy mode, I get very depressed for a few days following. I end up shutting her out and sink into my PC and zone out with video games. Our sex life has been steadily decreasing since I came out due to the tension between us.

I don't work out or exercise at all, but because of my very physical job, I am very strong although overweight. I average close to 20K steps a day according to my pedometer while often carrying  40 to 50 pounds of tools on me, but I have always tended to eat my problems away and drink too much beer. I would love to be in better shape but I hate my body too much to really give a damn. If I were to transition I feel like I would be much happier with myself and would push myself to lose the extra weight. I'm afraid though that even if I were to lose weight, I would still have to be very muscular to be able to do my job. Most of the guys I work with are over weight and those who are not are still very large and strong due to the nature of our work. If I were to transition, I think I would have to give up my career to have a remotely feminine body.

My wife and I have an agreement where if I really want to dress for a full day on a weekend, she will go spend time shopping or hanging out with her sisters or my sister. This agreement works out fine for the both of us. I always have to fight the temptation to stay dressed after she calls me to let me know she's on her way home. Neither of us want kids at this time and part of that is because I don't want to have to give up my dressing and part of it is because of the tension between us that all of this has caused. Also we have 5 nieces and nephews that we can rent whenever we want, we don't feel like buying at this time. Lol. 

She is the only one in my life that I am out too, and she hates the fact that she can't discuss it with anybody. We were both going to therapy for a while but stopped due to financial issues at the time. I have not talked to her about my feelings to transition because I'm afraid I will lose her. My wife is my rock and has been with me for close to 10 years now. Although I love her dearly, I feel so much resentment towards her sometimes because I feel like I can't truly be myself around her. She was very upset that I did not come out to her until after we had been married for a year. She understands that I wasn't ready to come out to myself until that time but she still feels hurt.

I have a few awesome groups of friends that I hang out with on a regular basis. Unfortunately I live in a small rural town, that isn't exactly progressive. My brother in law is probably my best friend and I'm sure that if I were to lose my wife, I would lose him too. I am also very close friends with a guy I work with but he is extremely religious and holds some very outdated views. A lot of my friends that I grew up with in my small town whole lot of the same views, even if they are not religious at all. If I were to the world I might end up losing most of my friends.

So now comes the questioning part. Do I come out as trans and risk losing my career, my wife, my friends, and my family, or do I keep on the path that I'm going? I just don't know anymore. I hate the feeling of being in the wrong body and hating myself, but I don't want to lose everything I've worked so hard for in my life and be in a worst place than before. I know I'm only 26 and have my entire life in front of me that I could build a new life for myself, but that scares the shit out of me.

Spookytama,asktransgender,In a fit of Dysphoria I cut off all my hair. I look like a mess and I'm at a loss of what to do. Advice?..,"Sorry for formatting, this is my first post.

I've always been questioning my gender. Hopping back and forth between being unsure/afraid and trying to tell myself to ""ignore it"" in order to make my life easier. But, after yesterday I think I finally realized I need to stop lying to myself and just accept that I am not comfortable being female.

Except now I feel and look horrible.

Yesterday, since my hair was getting obnoxiously long, I had it cut. I walked out of the salon incredibly upset because I didn't realize how feminine it was going to make me look. My previous hair was long, but it was messy and still rather ""boyish"" in style.

I came home in tears, I didn't see myself in the mirror, I felt wrong. In a fit of dysphoria, sadness, and a multitude of wild emotions, I grabbed the nearest scissor and began hacking at my hair without thinking. I even grabbed an electric razor and shaved chunks off. I made my mom cry because she didn't understand why I was doing this to myself. And now I'm sitting here in regret asking myself the same question.

I have random bald patches on my head now, and my hair looks absolutely hideous. I'm going to be stuck wearing a beanie for months unless I somehow salvage this mess or just shave everything off and start anew.

I'm not so much asking on how to fix my hair, rather.. I don't know how to recover from this. I finally realize I'm FTM, except now I look like a mess. Depression and Bipolar have already been ripping at me like crazy, and I don't know what to do with myself, or where to start.

How do I pick myself back up and make progress in taking the right steps..? I feel like I've waited too long, even though I'm only 21.

But, one sign for me is this.  I don't know if it's just a coincidence, but it might be. 


My first ever real friend (I'm going to call her Ellie) was female (I'm AMAB). There was some sort of connection I had with Ellie and always did. This was when I was 4 years old. 

My mum said that we where so close, we where almost impossible to be separated. Obviously being 4 y/o I don't have strong memories of being with her, but I've seen a few photos of me at this play group and I noticed how I was with a group of girls and not a group of boys. It's the only photo I have though.

Also, as things get a little rocky politically in my state due to a recently proposed bathroom bill, some of my coworkers are voicing not so pleasant opinions of trans people. I'm basically forced to sit there and make whatever argument I can without outing myself, which is not much. This sits poorly with me. 

If push comes to shove, I'm not sure who I would even contact about coming out at work. I'd like to start with an entity like HR, instead of having rumors work their way up to management. Unfortunately, I work in a lab that is contracted with a hospital. The hospital's HR is not my HR. That means the only immediate people I have to talk with are my managers. Or I email/call our company HR which is three states away.

Privatetranscare,asktransgender,Insurers and what they cover? How best to take advantage of their policies? Etc - All countries answers welcome.,"I'm hoping someone can help me out here. I'm in the UK, so I'm looking for UK answers, but I think it would benefit others if Americans also chime in as a post like this could benefit a lot of people. I don't want to stop others from getting answers they might also need.

Is there a comprehensive list held anywhere of insurers and what they cover for transgender patients?

I'm not at all in the system for being transgender yet and have the intention of starting private health insurance in order to start receiving private care. I believe this will be much quicker than using the NHS.

NHS treatment looks terrible. They have year long waiting lists just to be seen and force transgender patients to prove ""living everyday as opposite gender"" for as long as a year before allowing various treatments. This is absolutely not an option for me. I know I'll kill myself if subjected to the hate I would receive and the constant self reflection on my appearance I would be performing by not having the body I should have yet being forced to live publicly as female before even having treatment. Right now I hate myself but nobody else does. The problems I have would rocket upwards.

I don't know what or where I should be looking at to ensure I sign up with the right insurer. Nor do I know where I should look to make sure I've been with the insurer long enough to be covered at the time I ""come out"" with the issue.

Thank you all."

It is like an inquisitive thought poking my consciousness saying: are you reaaally sure about your orientation as well?
Gender and sexual orientation are separate entities of course and I didn't really expect this to happen and it confuses me. Then again, I am confused as is by this whole transition process, so it is not a bad thing :)

babygirlskunk,asktransgender,"post-op depression, trans guy, had top surgery a month ago","So I had top surgery about a month ago and even though I had sort of a hard time right after going off the Vicodin (I was on half of a typical dose for about a week), I bounced back after that and was able to start slowly resuming normal life. I do have a lot going on in my life because I'm still pretty early in transition (six months on T), still getting my family onboard, etc...however, I feel like I was handling it pretty well.

Until about 10 days ago when I went back to work and started feeling extremely depressed and also continuing to have referred pain in my shoulders from all the nerves re-connecting and such. I had periareolar top surgery so it wasn't super invasive but I have an old shoulder injury that now seems to be causing additional nerve pain. 

I'm planning to call the surgeon's office about the pain tomorrow, but as for the depression, that's what actually concerns me more. It did coincide with a spell of some pretty gloomy winter weather (I live in the Bay Area and we've had horrendous disgusting rain for like fucking ever). and I am prone to Seasonal Affective Disorder, but this feels like it's beyond that. 

I just feel really down... I find myself caring less about all the things in my life which I would usually consider positive- having a nice place of my own, my band, having a job that's relatively painless and allows me to afford living where I do, my girlfriend, stuff like that. I just want nothing to do with anyone, I don't care about food, I want to sleep so that I don't have to be conscious and feeling this way, and the worst part is I can't even really cry that easily or talk about it. 

Suddenly all the things that were exciting and interesting to me, feel like draining obligations and burdens. I'm also sort of freaking out about my surgery results even though my chest looks really good...I keep looking down from certain angles and thinking I still have boobs and it's really fucking with me. The healing scars are making my areolas look fucking huge, which is also really jarring to me. I constantly worry that every move I make, I will fuck up the results somehow. And it's really aggravating to not be able to play bass or go to the gym and to feel like I still have to be so careful.

On top of that, I'm still getting misgendered and I've just run out of the mental energy to correct people. 

When I was recovering and home from work, and all of my friends were stopping by to hang out, I felt fine. Now I just feel completely disconnected from my life, myself, and my feelings. 

Has anyone else been through this? When did it get better? I'm thinking about asking for more time off from work but am worried I'll get in trouble even though we have unlimited PTO.

The thought of wanting be a woman makes me gag a little bit. This feeling comes occasionally.

In fact, from what I can tell, I rarely feel regular dysphoria (i.e. I don't mind being a man, I don't feel weird when people say ""he/him,"" I'm neutral about my body though I've never really *liked* the way it looked), but on the other hand, I do feel good when I imagine myself as a woman. So I have most of the positive reinforcement thoughts, but few of the negative reinforcement ones.

But, some days, I don't feel any desire to be a woman at all. I'm not sure what it is, but it's only making me more confused than I'd like to be. I've told my closest friends that I want to be a woman, as well as my mom (and she was disheartening, to say the least), and it's odd. It feels weird to say it out loud. Like, I'm not sure if it's right. Most of the signs point to the fact that I'm trans, but all the rest are giving me anxiety.

I was genuinely surprised when, at the age of 21, I finally commented on it to one of my male friends and was shocked to hear that he had never wished he had been born a girl, let alone spent his whole life wishing that.

I didn't have that same inclination from a young age that I was supposed to be a girl, like many other transgender people do. It was more of a wish or desire.  I had always assumed that was what part of being a man was, ""Man Up!"" I believed, was some kind of affirmation of that.  That it was almost a call to arms of resisting that inner urge and struggle of wanting to be a woman.

So I was wondering did anyone else have this same experience of not feeling like that were the opposite gender from a young age, but more feeling that it was an innate desire that everyone felt and must resist from a young age? I'd love to hear from FTM and MTF on this experience."
SuperSillyKitten,asktransgender,Was my 'discovery' wrong? (NSFW),"I feel like shit because the way I found out I was trans is...unusual, I think.

One day when I was 18, I was thinking about my kinks and stuff and I suddenly realized: ""Wow, none of my fantasies involve my dick. Like, ever... matter of fact, I don't think I even want a dick. I... I want a vagina""

Suddenly I was hit with a huge flood of repressed memories. I used to want to be a girl all the time when I was like, 10.
I thought about it almost every night for at least a year, maybe two
But I told myself that it was wrong/unnatural/weird and tried to stop thinking about it.
Then my family moved, then middle school and high school... I kinda became too busy to think about it.
I'm sure I thought about it every now and then, but it was pretty repressed.

Anyway... finding out I'm trans while pondering my fetishes makes me feel... uneasy.
Am I right to feel that way? Am I overthinking this?
I don't find the thought of being a woman arousing, it just makes me feel happy.


PS:The worst part of this story?  If I had just told someone when I was ten... I might have started transition at 13 instead of 19. My parents are great and are fine with it. I even had fucking breast reduction surgery when I was 18 (unilateral gynecomastia) now my boobs are jacked up."

In good faith due to family problems I gave my folks $10,000 in savings three years ago, leaving me with little savings. I have tried to rebuild my savings, but the last nine jobs, in the two and half years since then. Have either physically or sexually abused me, when my boss or fellow employees find out I am trans or not attracted to them. Is there any advice or way for me to continue my transition? I am afraid I go into deep depression with nasty side effects if I do not. O.O"
_Rexysaurus,asktransgender,I don't know how to tell my parents that my boyfriend is actually a girl,"Okay so, I'm 16 and i've been dating someone for 2 years. I started dating them while they identified as male but they believed that they were female and have started identifying as female. I still love her and she has been identifying as female for about 6 months now. 
My parents are divorced, and I live with my mom and see my dad on a regular basis. I don't have the best relationship with my mom and im not sure how she'll react to me telling her that im dating a trans person. I have a great relationship with my dad and his girlfriend but i'm not sure how he'll react, either. His girlfriend knows and is accepting of the idea. I'm nervous to tell both of them and my girlfriend is a little frustrated that I haven't yet. My goal has been to tell at least my mom before summer.  I just really need some help of what I should say/ do and any advice is welcome. "
vlokan4952,asktransgender,Do you think STEM-majors and Atheist are a Transphobic group in society?,"I have heard transphobic arguments from students majoring in STEM-fields, especially biologists, and people devoted to an Atheist worldview.

They say that humans are biological beings just like animals and plants, so they are destined to a cisgender, male/female society just like apes, rodents, or reptiles are. Your chromosomes and sexual organs determine your gender, etc...

Richard Dawkins, a prominient biologist whose social commentaries are radically against religious bigotry, has posted transphobic comments on Twitter, saying that he ""doesn't believe"" in Transgenderism and calls Trans Women ""she"" ""out of courtesy.""

I found more tolerance towards Trans people in Neopagan, particularily Wiccan circles, who are perfectly fine with the notion that ""a female soul can inhabit a male body"" and vice versa.

What do you think about this? Do you think Neopaganism is more open-minded towards Trans people than Atheism?"

canaduckgoose,asktransgender,Canadian name/gender changing passporting shenanigans?,"I've got a bunch of signed and ready documents to send off to serviceontario any day now, a stack of forms and signatures as tall as my hamster.

Does anyone know if I can just change my birth certificate, wait half a year, then start with the new passport application? i would need photo id on top of the new birth certificate, which means a new drivers license which means physical presence and so many weeks of waiting.
basically, does changing name and gender somehow invalidate my passport or can i just crossdress to look like my current passport?"
lnd940,asktransgender,I don't think transitioning if for me - looking as a woman vs feeling as a woman,"So I've been on a low dose HRT for about 10 months - 1/2mg Estrogen (mix of patches/pills), DIYing.

I am a small business owner and a pretty ambitious individual, in general.

I don't fully like the way estrogen makes me THINK. I do like LOOKING more feminine ... feeling weaker is ok too ... but I feel more scatter-brained, not as sure of myself, not as much of a go getter as I used to be .... things are less sharp ... 

However, this was a super useful experiment for me, as I feel much better about trying this and knowing how things are. I might continue this low dose, not entirely sure.

Has anyone else had a similar experience?"
windlep7,asktransgender,I cant deal with all of this!,"I'm an extremely anxious person, I find it hard to deal with stress and this is one of the most stressful situations anyone could be in.

I didn't get the job I applied for in software development and the only others going are in infrastructure, which is bad for a trans person apparently.

I have Aspergers and don't have many friends. I live alone with my cat and feel lonely.  I moved out of my parents house to learn how to fend for myself, in case they didn't want to see me again after coming out (I'm still closeted)

I have little hope of passing.  I'm short and have a round face, but my nose is huge and have a masculine forehead, broad shoulders and deep voice.  I can't afford surgery with my retail wage, nor will I be able to do the RLE necessary for surgery on the NHS, it's too anxiety provoking.

I'm 31 and time is ticking away.  I'll be even less likely to pass if I don't do it soon.

My family won't deal with this well either. They're Christian and believe God made me a boy.

I'm too weak to deal with all of the fallout, stress and abuse of transitioning.  I think some just aren't able to and are destined for suicide, except I can't even do that because it would kill my family.  I don't fear dying and going to hell because I'm already there."
PanTran420,asktransgender,Online sperm storage companies?,"At my appointment with my doctor yesterday we talked about storing sperm. Since there isn't a good storage facility locally, she said she's had some clients who went with online companies. I figured I'd be able to find one fairly easily, but so far have only found sperm banks that sell sperm, but don't have self storage options. 

I found one that seemed OK, if somewhat expensive, in ReproTech. 

Has anyone else used online sperm storage? What company, and how much was it?

I'm planning on calling my doctor tomorrow to ask if she knows which companies her clients used. I asked if she had a recommendation and she said all of her clients had used different services, and all had reported success. When she said that, I figured I'd just find one on my own. It's proving harder than I thought, though."

Does anyone know how long the procedure will take? Will I need painkillers afterwards? How long did it take for you to heal?

Apparently I can't take anti-anxiety meds (xan) the day before, and that's freaking me out ��

EloiseSkye,asktransgender,Does anyone know how HRT (specifically changes to the hips) can affect scoliosis?,"I was reading something about hip tilt and was wondering how that would affect my spine as I have scoliosis (on the off chance I get hip tilt, I started hrt at 18 so who knows). Does anyone here have any idea if it could make it worse or better?

acegiak,asktransgender,Progesterone? What are it's effects?,"A couple of translady friends are taking various artificial bio-identical progesterone equivalents and I'm wondering about it for myself.

Two of my biggest gripes about HRT include suddenly being cold all the time (I'm from a family of cold-fish but first winter on HRT was unbearable) and (obviously) that my breasts aren't as large as I'd like after a year or so.

SOME sources I've read say that progesterone helps with both of these things. Some say it helps with neither. Some say it's really good for mental health (which is an issue for me, especially on cypro) and some say it's bad.

If you're on or have been on progesterone (especially those who were already on an estrogen/AA combo and then added progesterone later): Why? And what effects did you experience?"

Kavik_Ryx,asktransgender,Does dysphoria have to be intense?,"To preface the question, I have been more and more inclined to question my gender over the past couple years. A while back I took up wearing skirts at home and will occasionally full on cross dress. I'm fairly closeted about it, though I am developing a small reputation and will do it when I go places where I won't be known. More recently I have tried out makeup and have grown out my hair so I can get a more feminine cut. 

When I was younger I was fascinated by the idea of reincarnation, and what I told myself was that if I were to come back, I would want it to be as a woman. More than that, it would be my own life I would have wanted to experience like that. Where I am today, I am at least grateful that I'm not especially masculine. I'm not tall, have little hair on my chest, and lack coarse skin. As a person I know I can be anxious and high strung, though that's par for the course in my family. 

That being said, the matter of my gender hasn't been much of an issue in my life until recently that it has caused me any distress. The distress isn't great and is more of a lingering feelingn that I think needs exploration. And by now I'm 25, so it feels too little too late for it to be a sign. I don't knot if I couldn't live with myself were I not to transition, on the other hand were somebody to hsnd me a potion that would change my sex, I would take it with few reservations. 

All that being said, is gender dysmorphia ever such that one feels on the fence about their gender?"
FavoriteColourGreen,asktransgender,I would like the doubts about my ftm transition to stop now or to just be cool with the fact that I don't want to transition. I just can't stand being split up like that all the time.,"Hey, I am really close getting my ftm diagnosis now but I have had really intense doubts the last few weeks. I really don't know what is going on. It's like I am trying desperately to find a way being ok with not transitioning. 
Probably I am frightened. I think I fear that testo will not be good for me cause I tend to be over sensitive with meds. I am afraid I will react badly to it. I also don't like the idea of being stuck with meds for the rest of my life and having to do stuff to my body just because the world is fucked up. I feel like I don't deserve to go through such pain as a transition might come with. I feel like I am tired of feeling weird, I miss the cis privileges. And then I find myself testing the mindset of not transitioning and after a while I feel horrible. I have put so much into the fact that I am trams the last years, it's a very big part of constructing me a new self or a kind of sense of meaning since I've moved to this country (been here for four years now) after having to leave my southern country. 

This transidentity has been so much more than me being ftm it has given me a purpose, it's like if I am trans than I have something to come with, I am someone.

Whereas if I am not... I don't know who I am.. "

Inlovewithoreos,asktransgender,Life before transitioning,"Hey,
I would like to hear what your life was like before you came out. I am 15 years old, MTF and didn't come out yet. And although I'm not happy with my current situation I somehow found a ""niche"" that kinda works for me. So as I'm pretty short and super slim, many of the people I know think I'm cute and see my not existing masculinity as childishness. And even my girl friends think I'm just being cuter and nicer than the other boys. It's like I am a younger brother to them. 

The other thing I do is that I build ""fantasy"" worlds in my head, where I'm a girl. I ""live"" them when I'm alone. And the stories are pretty huge with many characters, who all have names and personalities. It's kinda like a parallel life I'm living in my head. I think this is pretty weird, but it is my way of dealing with the situation. So yeah what was your life like before coming out?

- A laptop table for bed, I got it from HomePro in Paradise Park - omg I cannot recommend this enough, I have spent literally a hundred hours on my laptop with it

- A funnel for transferring bottled water, you can get this for cheap in Seacon Square. so you can buy bottled water in bulk, and not worry about if the water is safe to drink

- Extra toilet paper to help with dilation, because this hotel does not give me enough

- A blender to help make smoothies

simaiinox,asktransgender,Help - mind haziness? Do you feel like a different person post-hrt?,"Hi, I'm about 2 months into mtf HRT. For the past few days, I've been feeling like 'I' am 'breaking'. My mind has just started feeling hazy, and I feel almost dazed and just out of it. I found at https://redd.it/2ooepp that a possible explanation was ""As far as memories... I think my roommate referred to this as 'cognitive disconnect'. The HRT rewires your brain, so the memories are still there but are someone elses. They are very fact based, so unlike my memories of my new life, that dead guy's memories have no emotions or thoughts attached. I don't know what he was feeling when something happened, or what was going through his mind. It's like watching an old VHS tape of someone else's family videos. The picture and sound are all fuzzy, and it's from a third-person point of view."".

I obviously can't confirm that that is what is happening to me atm, but I can imagine this being a precursor to that, and I'm suddenly feeling uncomfortable with that as an option of a change. 

I do want to be a woman, but I haven't come to terms with 'killing' my old self almost. I feel....guilty...? I feel like in general I really value and appreciate reflecting and growing from my past in a framework of my emotional responses to situations. I don't know if I'm ok forgetting so much of that?

Has anyone experienced this? Do people feel like they have fundamentally changed as a person throughout HRT?  Like, in a framework of body (physical), mind (thoughts, hobbies, etc.), and soul (everything you felt was literally completely fundamentally intrinsic to your identity), do you feel like your soul/'essence' changed?

Do you still enjoy the same friends?

I would really appreciate hearing stories from people who have both experienced or not experienced these things while on HRT, thanks!"

Lea1687,asktransgender,Questions? Just Thoughts? IDK confused,"So...questioning for a few months 47 MTF here. I don't really have a specific question. More just putting my thoughts down because I'm confused. But I welcome any feedback. 

Here is where I stand...
- I don't necessarily feel feminine. though I'm not even sure what that would be.
- I tend to get along with and feel more comfortable around females.
- The idea of socially transitioning and how it would impact job, relationships, etc. scares the hell out of me.
- I have started seeing a therapist.
- I don't hate my male self. But I could see myself as liking to be female also.
- I am pretty emotionally ""dead"" or detached inside. I rarely have stronge feelings about anything.
- I have started trying female undergarments and like the way they feel.
- I have been thinking about this daily since my questioning began.
- The ""button"" test...YES I would push it.
- I wonder if it's possible to transition with HRT and SRS but present as a female leaning masculine in appearance?

I probably just need more time to process my thoughts and come to terms with things.

Thanks for indulging me.

I'm mostly just curious about how I should handle this, and what (If anything) I should communicate to my parents and loved ones. My conflict is that saying I'd like to be a girl wouldn't be accurate. I wouldn't want to change pronouns, grow breasts, lose what I have between my legs or any of that. I want wider hips and thighs, a more gentle voice and just more feminine traits like soft hair and skin, still while being considered male.

Would I have to take hormones for that? And how should I come out to my parents? Is there a word for what I'd like to become?

Thanks so much-"

androhex,asktransgender,how to become physically androgynous?,"To preface this, I don't really consider myself transgender.

However, this seems like the most fitting place to ask based on the content of my question and the wealth of relevant knowledge this subreddit possesses.

Keep in mind that if I use any language or wording that could be considered offensive, it is not out of ill-intent. I am a social recluse both online and off with the exception of 4chan, so I have absolutely no idea how I'm supposed to say things. I assure you I will not use phrasing I found on 4chan.

I am a biological male, and identify as such. However, I don't like having an identifiably male body. I don't want a female body either, so I guess I want to be androgynous. This isn't really a gender thing for me - I feel male, I suppose - it's just about wanting a more comfortable body for myself.

My main issue is that my upper body (especially shoulders, back, and ribcage) are noticeably large. Huge, even. People think I'd make a great football player, if that helps get the idea across.

If you shaved off all of my body hair, spent an hour painting my face, and squeezed me into the prettiest dress you can find I would still look manlier than the average dude off the street. I've done it, once.

I've done everything I can to minimize it. I lost pretty much all of the fat on my body (I still somehow kept quite a bit on my butt and thighs, which is nice for my goal). I cut a lot of protein out of my diet and am sedentary to minimize muscle, even though it didn't work at all.

It seems like the only viable solution is hormones, unless there is some fancy diet change I can make to drastically reduce muscle mass. But, as I said, I don't wanna be a girl - just a girly guy, I guess. I don't want boobs. I just want to look small, I guess, with mild curve. But I for the life of me can't find out how to achieve that.

A more minor problem - my face. It isn't nearly as bad as the upper body thing, but I have a pretty wide jaw. Obviously nothing can be done about that, so I'd just like advice on how to hide it as well as I can.

Basically, I just want to know where all of you think I should go with this, and to tell me straight-up if you don't think it is possible to do what I want to do. I can take it.

Also if it is relevant, I'm 20. I also suspect that I may be in a bit of delayed puberty. I'm fully grown physically, I think, but I just now got struck with the turbulent emotions and desire to masturbate that are associated with puberty - I never had either before this past month. I was as sexually dry and emotionally stable as people come when I was a teenager."
Texas-Kangaroo-Rat,asktransgender,Waelp my insurance stopped covering my patches and I've learned my doctor doesn't know what she's doing.,"Also she won't write a letter for the passport thing cuz she won't stick her neck out for anyone.

In any case like I've been on 100µg Climera patches for a few months, and my indigent insurance stopped paying for them, now only doing Climera pro which is 45µg E and 15µg P ... my doctor prescribed only one box.

Now, I should say I asked for her to up my dose, and she was going to until she found out that the pro is different. Naturally I assumed that she'd stick with the same dose (she wanted to do blood work on this first) but no.

Since I can't get a hold of her cuz of sleeping problems I had to decide to just... take the prescription and hope it doesn't fuck me up since having nothing definitely will fuck me up.

Though the good thing is that I'll only be off of it for like four five days...

I wanted to try to get a new doctor, both for the passport and also because like, my doctor has no idea why my baseline T levels were like 50, she also doesn't seem to know basic math.

Though I can't find any endochromotologists in the Austin area that regard transgender people as a thing that exists.

I was considering like, getting the insurance from the healthcare.gov thing, but I know literally nothing about the insurance and not sure if they would both A) pay for the brand name Climera cuz generic is trash and B) if it'd really be worth it if I make $40 a month doing art.

Shockingpink13,asktransgender,I No Longer Need Permission to be Trans,"This is the text message that I have sent my pastor earlier today.

Pastor (censor)

I had another night of awful sleep, and I think I know why.

It's extremely stressful going to see you.  It's extremely stressful because it sounds like you believe that being trans is a sin, and that I am doing something wrong by choosing to transition.  I get that feeling by your word choice, your tonality.  It just feels wrong.  It doesn't make sense that my sexual identity would be sinful to God.  It would be as if I told you that being a man was a sin, and that you should become a woman.  I doubt you would like it.

Which is why I can't see you today.  I'm not rested.  I'm not ready.  And I'm not sure if I should visit you anymore because I have decided that, yes, I am trans.  It feels right, and for the first time in my life I feel genuine peace with myself now that I have accepted this.  I don't expect you to understand.

I'm sorry (censor).


The church has it all wrong.  God doesn't care about what gender we are.  He only cares about what's in our heart."
OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,"I saw a transwoman IN MY TOWN the other day. I kinds wanted to say something, but I didn't know what.","Okay, that title may be strange, so let me explain.

I live in a very conservative, old-fashioned dump of a town/area. And I had never seen a trans person, or at least a visibly trans person, in real life, until the other day. I was in the local Walmart, And I saw a transwoman who works there. 

I'm 99.9% sure she's trans because not to be offensive, but she was as tall as the tallest guys I've seen and despite the androgynous look had a girl name on her name tag.

Seeing her made me happy, and it gave me hope. A transwoman, IN MY TOWN, WITH A JOB! I was really tempted to try and stop her so I could talk to her. 

Who'd she go to for HRT? How old is she? What was her experience transitioning? 

I wanted to ask her these things. But that would have been rude and I wasn't alone at the time.  

Have you ever met another trans person unexpectedly, especially while in the closet? Did you say anything? "

Elena1270,asktransgender,College anxiety and hormones,"I started online course for college yesterday and after four hours between both courses I was totally beat. Then I got really depressed and anxiety kicked in. I got this feeling that I made a horrible mistake and I got this fear of flunking out. I tried to lay down and clear my head, but all I could do was cry. Could this be hormones affecting me? I am on estradiol, spiro and provera if this helps. Also I have been REALLY run down for the past several weeks. I could sleep all day and night if I didnt have anything to do. Also, I get REALLY tired after eating certain things. Example, I had two buttered bagels on Sunday for Brunch as I was REALLY hungry and hadn't eaten and it was already noon. About an hour later, I just couldnt keep my eyes open. I kept nodding off for a minute or two. Then at some point I think I slept for 20 minutes or more. After a couple of hours, I kinda got a second wind if you will. I wasnt tired anymore. Could this also be hormones messing with me??"

A few days ago I went to get a chest X-ray (for SRS, incidentally). It's important to note first that I'm stealth (or at least trying to be - I think I'm mostly successful).

Anyway, while I was waiting the receptionist called to me across the waiting room and asked ""Your other name is [old name] right?"" I suppose she had that written down for whatever reason somewhere and wanted to check that it was me.

I'm fine if she had to check my previous legal name. Y'know, shit happens. But I'm not fine with her basically telling *everyone* in that waiting room that I used to have an unambiguously male name, and therefore pretty much telling everyone that I was trans. I would have preferred it if she called me to the desk. I just replied with ""That is no longer my legal name"" and left it at that.

Tbh I was pretty upset by it and I wrote a complaint to the local radiology group. Also I wrote to my GP asking for advice.

Anyway, my question is, was I right to make such a big deal over it?

Older_Wiser2,asktransgender,MtF: Good thing I don't live in North Carolina! I'd be in jail now for SURE!!!,"Things are happening so fast for me right now .... a few months ago I was worrying about whether or not I ""passed"" and as I'm most often called ""ma'am"" I kinda think I'm doing okay ..... 

I work out every day at a local gym (it's a fairly big one) and the staff know I'm transgender. They've been very accommodating and they open a family locker room for me every time (it's always locked) .... But, as I mentioned in a post a short time ago, the gym director took me aside and said they wanted to change my name to my preferred name and they also wanted to change my gender marker to F ... as they're a chain this new profile will show up at every one I go to .... SO, this was a BIG DEAL for me! Validation!!!!

Then a week ago when I went in the desk attendant was very busy with people waiting in line .... she just looked up, winked, and said, ""you've graduated"" .... And apparently the staff had discussed this earlier and they wanted me to know I was welcome and in fact encouraged to use the Women's Locker Room!  WOOHOO!!!!!

But that's also associated with a LOT of fear and anxiety .... what if someone challenges me, outs me, or complains .... so the first time I went in it was with a fair amount of trepidation .... but I went off to a corner, changed my clothes, and back out fairly quickly .... then I did it the next day and the next day.... each time a bit easier ....

Then comes today ...... I walked right in and put my workout clothes on .... I passed some women I talk with occasionally and they said hi .....  I worked out for an hour and kinda kept my eye out for a time when it wouldn't be busy in there.... and I also watch for when younger girls go in ... if they do I'll wait them out .... that could be way too problematic ....

Anyway .... I went back in to change .... and you guessed it .... the women followed me in .... and they had lockers close to mine ... I had already begun changing and my plan was to slip into the sauna, alone, for a few minutes. As there was no one in there when I went in I ""thought"" I could pull this off .... then the women started getting really chatty .... asking a ton of questions (nothing trans related) .... as I'd already started heading towards the sauna (a towel around my waist and my shorts on but topless) the women said, ""can we join you?"" ***ARE YOU KIDDING ME????? NO - I'M ABOUT READY TO HAVE A STROKE!!!*** But I said ""sure"" .... and we proceeded to the sauna .... they only had towels on which they dropped in the sauna but I kept my towel around my waist .... My voice is my biggest tell at this point, I think (previously a strong baritone).... but I upped the pitch just slightly, sounded a bit raspy (I have a cold right now), and carried on a conversation! 

And I seem to have pulled it off!!! BUT, in hindsight, I don't think this is a good thing ... if they do EVER find out they'll be thinking, *""holy crap - this is a guy and he was in the sauna with us!""* And that would make all the good things about this go horribly bad very fast .....

Anyway .... that's my weekend .....

VousValentina,asktransgender,Trans-Attraction = Fetish?,"Recently (past few months) I have been curious about dating or hooking up with a transgender man because I see them as men (I identify as straight), but I do not think I would have been attracted to them when I identified as gay (before I transitioned).

Possible explanations for my attraction:

1. I just see *transgender men as men* because I realize gender is about more than what's between the legs;

2. I've encountered more trans men and have felt a connection with them because we have a *shared experience* of being transgender;

3. I am attracted to *masculinity and chivalry* and I've noticed trans men tend to be more masculine and chivalrous than other men I've met;

4. I feel like they'd be more respectful and empathetic about my reservations towards using my private parts.

That being said, I dunno whether this qualifies as fetishizing trans men because if it is then I want to develop a healthier relationship with my trans-attraction so as to avoid falling into the mindset/set of behaviors that I despise.

Help? Advice? Judge me, please.

Edit: I said ""I don't think I *would have* been attracted to transgender men when I identified as gay"" because I didn't understand what transgenderism was all about back then and I was closed-minded. 

I said the hypothetical ""would have"" because I was never actually confronted with the question when I identified as gay, so I'm speculating based on my mindset back then."

I actually like how I look clothed sometimes now but naked I feel like I look worse. I don't look like a girl. I look like someone is trying to create an uncanny valley body of mixed characteristics. Maybe even a guy body wouldn't be bad, I can achieve hair loss etc. through shaving and keep my looks androgynous.

I'm fucking terrified. What am I doing? All the hypotheticals about wanting to be a girl are cute. But the reality is fucking awful. And soon I won't be able to hide it. Except I don't pass fully yet.

mrsindigooo,asktransgender,hrt question [mtf. 23 y/o],"hey! so I live in Panama and it took me a really long time to find a doctor that works with trans patients for HRT. My doctor is not an endocrinologist but a gynecologist, and has had a few trans patients in the past. It's what's available so I take it.

He started me only on T-blockers (100 mg spiro /day) last july so it's been a few months. He didn't want to put me on estrogen yet bc something about my liver was wrong from being overweight and taking antidepressants, but I lost like 40 pounds and my levels are fine now so I asked about started estrogen and long story short I started this week!

He started me on 2 mg of estradiol a day. My first question is: is this ok/good/normal? Ideally I would like to feel safe enough with him so that I wouldn't have to ask strangers on the internet but it is what it is.

So, my second question is: i might be paraphrasing but he said that spiro sometimes only blocked the testosterone produced in the prostate and not the one produced by the testicles. He asked me to find out if other trans women take something to stop the testosterone produced by the testicles. He mentioned something about DIANE 35, but after a short google search I stumbled upon a susans post about why that's not a good option. I emailed him that link.

I have some friends that have been prescribed just spiro and estradiol and that seems to be enough but I'm still curious about what he said and if there's any truth to it.

Also, what is the blood work trans women have to get done periodically while on hormones to make sure everything is ok? Like just hormone levels?

I just want to have the information and take matters into my own hands if he doesn't seem to ask me to get any blood work done."

Planning on going to see a gender therapist, but I want to present my situation to reddit.

--

I don't know what to do. I am terrified, confused, panicking. I feel trapped and I am having a hard time not giving in to thoughts of this being impossible.

I have known since I was 15 I am transgender. I have fought it every step of the way even through a six year enlistment in the Air Force when I was an aircraft electrician. The dysphoria got harder and harder to fight every time it cropped up. I got out of the military in 2013, and over the last month... I gave up the fight. I gave in. I accepted it. It was one of the best decisions I have ever made, and I just wish I would have done it sooner.

I was born and raised in San Jose, California but through the machinations of life ended up in a tiny town in Tennessee with about 1000 people. A town where a gay man was found hung from a telephone line in the 90s, where people hang black scarecrows from their trees as Halloween decorations, even this last Halloween. 

I am an industrial mechanic. I work in field service on air compressors and compressed air equipment. I am very good at my job. I have a stellar reputation at work; I am one of the go-to technicians when problems and weird things come up with machinery. I also LOVE my job. I love field service. I drive a work truck from job to job and dictate my own schedule, mostly. 

But it is in the South. Tennessee is one of the most trans-unfriendly states in the US. There is ZERO gender identity protection at work. My company is, however, a progressive worldwide company who has a robust and inclusive LGBT support program and their company policy DOES protect against gender identity discrimination. 

But, since I work in field service on air compressors... I go all over the state. From Nashville which is a liberal island in the area to auto shops and manufacturing plants located in or near small towns and VERY conservative areas. Thinking about customers I have been to, I can count several where I can promise you the customer would immediately refuse to either do business with us or refuse to allow me to do my job and service/repair their equipment.

My situation is complex. I am living in a house that my mom left me with (largely against my will) after my step dad died suddenly, without warning, two years ago. My mom has never worked and had no intentions of working, and she shacked up with a new guy within a year who would pamper her and allow her to live without working. I can't summon the energy to just leave the house and leave her with the payments. It's a double-wide trailer that is falling apart, and while I make far more than enough money to afford a decent apartment in Nashville, I can't bring myself to screw my mom over like that.

I have a four year old daughter who lives two states away with her mother. I pay something like 650 dollars a month in child support. That is a fixed cost I will have for the next 14 years. That makes it nearly impossible for me to even entertain the idea of going to college despite having the GI bill. I have literally NO other experience besides that of a mechanic and I have never been to college, ever.

I just feel trapped and I don't know what to do. I want to transition so badly. I am addicting to /r/transtimelines and trans youtubers and all I do is daydream. I want this so badly. Fifteen years of repressed feelings and desires is just... now that it's out. It's hard to keep it all in. 

Luckily my girlfriend is totally cool with all of this, and the few friends I have come out to are totally cool and understanding and awesome with it. I haven't talked to my dad in years and my mom is probably going to be okay with it. So I feel very fortunate for that. But the work situation. I don't know what to do with that. 

The only thing I can think of to do is go see a gender therapist and talk about all of this, which I DO plan on doing. And luckily the VA hospital here will do hormone therapy should I decide that I can risk that.

I just wish there were some way for me to cope with being a son, nephew, brother etc. until I can say ""LOOK at me. Do I -look- like a boy?"" I know it takes time to transition, that I'm venting, but.. Is it really possible to hide until you feel ready when the feeling is this intense?"
Roscoe_Underbough,asktransgender,"How many times did you change your name before you found ""the one."" And how did you know it was the one?","Hey y'all.

I originally went by Andy when i came out, but have since moved on to Jesse, which is relatively close to my birth name. Now I'm being read more as male, I kind of hate having a name that is so similar to my birth name. It's also a bit unisex so I feel like it could stop people from gendering me correctly.

So I am trying to find a new name. One name that sticks out is Roscoe, which would basically be stealing my DND character's name (also my Reddit username.)

Anyway, I just wanted some thoughts on names with y'all, how long did it take you to find your name, how did you discover it, and how did you know it was the name for you?"

I told her that I wanted to finish the semester, but I don't know what to do now. I want to come out to friends and others but I want to be sure. I basically want to wait until I have seen a gender therapist. Should I wait or come out? My workplace is super supportive,(they're science people). My other friends are very liberal and open minded. I don't want to come out because even though I know I am trans, I almost feel fake, like I need to validate myself somehow, for example, seeing the gender therapist."

CailanJade,asktransgender,Non-binary transition - what to call it?,"I am afab bi-gender, with distinct male and female sides.

I plan to continue living mostly as female, but I also feel great when I bind and dress as male. I really want to have both of my sides represented in my sexual presentation, to give both some happiness. My guy has been neglected for too long.

asktransgenmilddys,asktransgender,I only care about transitioning when I'm alone?,"I'm having this problem here I don't know what to do, because I'm not sure which feelings to trust. 



When I'm alone, I think about being female, and all I care about is that I was AMAB and not AFAB. I feel depressed, suicidal, you name it. I feel like life would be better if I were born female. 



But when I'm actually in public (college, shopping, with friends, etc) , I don't really care. It doesn't really bother at all. I see girls, and I think ""being like them would be alright, but not sure if I'd like to be that forever"". I guess you could say I'm agender when I'm in public. I'd still rather of been assigned female, but it just doesn't bother me that much. 




I sometimes feel I only wish I were born a girl because of my crossdressing habit. I'd much rather wear women's clothes in public, but because I was born male it looks weird to others. 





All I think is what thoughts do I trust, me being MTF when alone or agender in public? It's so confusing to the point where I'm not sure what I should trust.

I'm feeling pretty good (don't know if it's a placebo effect, but I'll take it. Stupid morning and spontaneous erections are gone too -yay!-). One thing that really bugs me is my hairloss though. 

I definitely have male pattern hair loss. Judging from some graphs and figures it's a beginner stage M-shape male pattern hair loss.

Not going to post a picture of myself because I'd die of shame, but it's similar to this picture I found on google. It's been like this for a few years, thinning -very- slowly over time, especially on the front. No hair loss on top or at the back though. It's still pretty thick there. 

http://hairloss.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hair-loss-grading-system.jpg

I read it's a big YMMV thing to expect hair regrowth, especially on those spots, so I'm going to (for sanity reasons) assume it's not going to come back on its own.

What's the probability for hair regrowth on its own? It's basically a miracle if it happens, right?
Is it enough to bring my T-levels into female range to stop further hair loss? 
Would it help to add finasteride to my HRT?
What are my options to restore hair? 
Is this easy to hide with long hair?
Has anyone bought hair implants? 
How expensive would they be for this kind of hair?

I'm sorry about these dumb questions, but this is the one thing that's really freaking me out beyond reason. If all else fails, I'll wear a wig, but I really want to do what I can to keep my natural hair. It's the uncertainty that's killing me and I don't know what realistic expectations are."

biwo2017,asktransgender,Medical Authority- how do you view it?,"I have a close friend (who is cis- somewhat relevant) that I regularly get into arguments with about medical authority in the trans community. What I mean by this: he believes that needing approval from a doctor to switch your gender (on legal documents) is wrong. He admits needing medical approval for HRT or surgeries makes sense- but only insofar as is needed to ensure no adverse physical effects, not to judge if the person is actually trans. Basically, he thinks any situation in which medical authority is used to try and determine if someone is trans or not is morally questionable.

I actually don't like that point of view, and I'm a bit twisted up about it because I have in the past taken shortcuts (diy-ing hormones) and I feel really guilty about it-- internally I viewed it as a form of self-harm and although it helped, I felt like I'd betrayed myself in desperation. Therapy has healed this somewhat, but I still don't believe my friend has the right of it. Some sort of diagnosis, word from authority, feels right to me. And yet I'm not sure this isn't some kind of internalized bias. What do you all think? To what degree is medical authority needed in the trans* community?"
I_dont-get_the-joke,asktransgender,I just had Transgender Equality training in the navy. As awesome as it made me feel it was uncomfortable hearing so much hate coming from so many people.,"I have been on the fence for a long time about whether I'm transgendered so I apologize if some of my terminology is wrong or offends some people, i just needed to get this out: 

The navy (thankfully) is allowing people who are closeted transgender to not only openly come out, they'll pay for it. People are expected to treat you with the dignity and respect you deserve as a united states sailor regardless of how they feel about your decision.

Should you be diagnosed with gender dysphoria they'll pay for your entire transition. All the way to GRS (should you choose to go that route). The rules following this were you had to be diagnosed by a navy doctor, and you were seen (by navy dress and PT standards) as your birth gender until all the legal paperwork said otherwise. Easy enough right?

However, one thing got people (auditorium of about 500) standing up in protest. That should you choose not to go the route of GRS but still go through with transitioning, if all the legal documents were in order you would be seen as your preferred gender. Regardless of anatomy.

Reon98,asktransgender,Confirmation Bias?,"So, I started seeing a therapist (yay!) and in my first meeting I explained to her that I've been severely questioning my gender. Her initial approach was maybe it is caused by close friends also doing so and I'm simply following herd mentality- which made sense in my head. To help figure this out, she asked me to start graphing my days on a scale of my choosing. I decided to do 1-10 where 1 is most masculine and 10 is most feminine. She also told me to continue doing research.

Well, lately, I've been in a mindset where I am simultaneously certain that I am somewhere on the transgender spectrum but also scared shitless about where and how to deal with it. In any case, I'm nervous that through my research I've created confirmation bias due to this conclusion. 

Of course, then the problem I run into there is the question of why I would have already come to that conclusion and to that the only logical answer I have is because I would innately know that conclusion is correct to some degree. 

Either way, I am curious, does anyone else on here have this problem? Does everyone sort of just go through the ""what if this is confirmation bias"" thing? Or am I going insane. Thanks!"

[deleted],asktransgender,"The Usual Wall of Text, With Questions at the End","Hey peeps! I've been a lurker here (on a different account) for a while now. I guess I'm finally ready to start admitting to myself that this whole transgender thing (MtF) might actually be a part of me. There are a few specific things I'd like to ask, but I want to preface it with the reasons I think I may be trans, and the feelings I've been having. Not entirely because it's super relevant, but because It'll hopefully feel good to get it off my chest. It's also four AM (as of when I started writing, who knows what time it'll be when I'm finished) and I haven't gotten a wink of sleep so I'm crossing my fingers that this will be coherent and not just some poorly written continuous stream of sleep deprived thought.

A brief bio: I'm eighteen years old, and a freshman in college starting on my second semester. I'm currently a Music Ed Major, but I'm thinking about switching to Language Arts Education after this semester for a ton of reasons unrelated to this.

And on to the story.

As a child, I naturally gravitated towards other girls. There was actually a photo of me from preschool that I used to have, where I was drawing rainbows with chalk on the asphalt of the playground with the other girls in my class, while the guys were playing some sport; unfortunately I don't have it anymore because in middle school I was embarrassed by it so I crumpled it up and threw it away. At family gatherings I would always spend my time with my grandma, aunts, and mother over spending it with any of the guys in my family. It wasn't until the peer pressure kicked in around third grade that I started hanging out with guys by choice, with a few exceptions. There was actually a time in second grade, while my mother was pregnant with my little sister, where I asked her if she could sleep on her tummy while she was pregnant. She responded no, and I was disappointed because I slept on my stomach, and that when I got pregnant one day I would have to change the way I slept. Then I realized I couldn't get pregnant. I remember starting to read those Tamora Pierce books around fourth and fifth grade, imagining myself as a fierce heroine like the characters in them. I remember hitting puberty, and having most of my sexual fantasies being ones where I was a woman, whether it be by some magic spell in some far away fantasy land (dorky middle school me lol), by futuristic technology, or fantasies where I simply was a girl. I also remember teasing and making fun of my guy friends whenever they'd express any sort of femininity in middle and high school. As a side note I'm not really that feminine myself, and if I were to transition one day I'd still probably feel the most comfortable in some flannel, jeans, and boots. Not really a cross-dressing person, whether it's just not my thing or it's a little bit of unwarranted self-disgust. I did used to put on my older sister's bra as a kid though in later elementary school when she'd leave it in the bathroom. I wasn't the most friendly to the concept of someone being transgender back when I was still in high school, whether it was picked up from my family or from some internalized transphobia I don't know. I would laugh in my head whenever the idea of transgendered people crossed my mind, thinking things like ""well I fantasize about being a girl, and get along better with girls, and I'm not transgendered so they must be making it up to feel like special snowflakes. Just people with too much time on their hands."" I know horrible, right? The cringe is real. Thankfully I've still got growing in life to do and have a chance to be a better person. A few months ago I questioned if I was transgender for the first time. I laughed it off at initially, but the idea kept persisting in my head that I might be. So I did some research, and realized that there's nothing shameful or wrong with being transgender. More time passed, and eventually I subbed to /r/transgender and here just to ease my mind and convince myself that I'm not really transgender. But the opposite happened. So here I am, with my most inner secret posted on a public website. If there was a button I could push to change genders, I'd be running to it and slamming my hand down. But there isn't, because of course life has got to make things complicated.

TL;DR: The usual stuff I guess.

So here's to the questions now.

1. I want to be a teacher. If I were to transition would that hurt my prospects of being employed, especially in more conservative parts of the country?
2. How many of y'all decide not to transition? I think I can live in my body and be content enough with my life, of course that could very well change over time I guess.
3. If I decide to not transition or come out of the closet due to the fiscal, social, and other concerns and costs involved can I still really call myself transgender, if that's what I am, or should I just move on in life and try to put it all behind me?
4. My family is very important to me, but I don't know if they'd understand fully. Especially if I came out and (in theory) transitioned during college, I'm worried they'd withdraw their financial support of my education (not that it's a whole lot but it's enough to hurt if it were gone). Would it be better to wait until I'm completely financially independent before I come out, if I ever do?

Thanks guys and gals of /r/asktransgender. It means a lot, even if no one responds, just to get this off my chest.

Conflicted123456,asktransgender,I feel content and it scares me a bit.,"So for the last 2-3 months I've been suffering from crippling dysphoria (I've been lurking/posting here ~10h a day during that time to keep myself calm.)


However, the past day or two i've felt weirdly content, i've been relatively ok with everything.  I still have the usual stuff going through my head, but it's not upsetting/confusing to think about as it has been, I feel like I just don't have an opinion/emotional response to what im thinking.


This may seem like a good thing and I suppose it should, it means I can try and get on with life and stop being consumed by the whole trans side of me, which makes logical sense as it should only be a small part of my life and shouldn't define who I am.


Although i've seen countless similar threads in all my time here, I can't help but feel a little concerned.  I plan on starting HRT this month and nothing is going to change that.  I'm also aware i'm not going to feel ok forever and things are certainly going to resurface, I just don't know when.


Although I kinda believe it's not true, some part of me can't stop thinking i'm currently forcing things upon myself because i've reverted back to a state where i'm devoid of emotion.

ReimiS,asktransgender,2 Hours until my court hearing for my name change... getting nervous.,"So yeah, in 2 hours I'll be sitting at the courthouse waiting my turn for what might be the most important day for the rest of my life...

And if he does sign off on it, then comes updating all my legal info, and coming out at work... which has me equally scared. I've been looking forward to this day for a while now, and I still want it, but knowing this is when everything finally comes together and all my plans for the past 2 months line up, it is a lot to take in...

Name change is OFFICIAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Passport has been applied for with correct name and gender!

So, full story.
I wait for over an hour past my appointment time, I finally get called in. I only get called by my last name, which isn't changing. I head into the court room and take a seat. Just me, the Judge, Bailiff and Recorder in the room. The judge looks at the recorder and says ""before we go on the record..."" ""I will do my best to use the correct pronouns, and I apologize if I make a mistake since deadname is on the petition"" I get sworn in and We run down the petition, I answer everything, state my deadname, my chosen name and why I need the publication clause waived (past abuse) and that's it... he wishes me luck and signs off on it. O_O


I get 2 free certified copies of the order and file for my passport downstairs. (I had everything ready to go) and yeah... huge relief, like holy shit, that was it!? REALLY hope coming out at work is as much of a non event as this has been."
SallyngSoul,asktransgender,Yes? Maybe? What?,"So, hi everyone! 

I've been going through a lot of confusion and self-doubt over the last few years and the last 2 weeks in particular and I'm still not entirely sure what I want. I've been having those feelings since the beginning of puberty and I just suprressed it...over the years those feelings came back periodically, each time triggerd by certain events...and each time I felt worse. The thought of wanting to be female never really went away but it got quiet so that I could live normally.

A few weeks back, those thoughts and feelings kicked in again and I felt really damn bad...but I didn't want to supress it this time, because I finally wanted to get what was wrong. The last two weeks of december where just full of being in conflict with myself, thinking about what may or may not be. 

...and I came to the semi-conclusion that I might be trans, but I'm still not 100% sure about that because I'm not sure if what I'm feeling is dysphoria...I mean if I could swap my gender right here and now, I would do it without any doubt, but it does not feel like a screaming voice in my head that tells me that I should be female, but I still fear that if I don't do something about it that this whole thing gets worse over the years and I don't think that I could live with this feeling all my life. I am 20 now and I feel like it's not too late yet and that I can still do something about it, but I'm still not 100% sure if this is what I want to do.

I have been an introvert person all my life, have social anxiety to some degree and I'm missing the ""engine"" to start or finish stuff and got a really small depression (not thaaat bad and managable, never had thoughts about suicide and am pretty much neutral atm) and my day basically consists of escaping into videogames and listening to music...I also never had any kind of relationship and I think that it could be because I just can't really picture myself as a male in a relationship and I feel like all of these issues could be connected to the fact that I am conflicted about who I am.

I am going to therapy at the beginning of next month and am scared as hell, because I don't really know where to start and where to go from here and how my future will turn out. At this point I can't really admit that I'm trans because I am still not entirely sure about it, but still I can't say that I'm not trans, because of all of this. 

Have I already accepted it but something keeps holding me back to admit it? I mean, goddamnit I already have ""settled"" on a name I really like, so why am I still hesitant to admit what's wrong?
Has anyone gone through something similar? (stupid question...i think there are a lot here)
How did therapy go for you? I never talked to a psychologist before, only when I was in elementary school because I had far too much energy.
How did you came to the conclusion or acceptance of being trans? What held you back and how did you get over it?

I'm currently stuck in a loop and just needed to write down my thoughts, since I'm in kind of a clear mindstate right now...and sorry for the long text &lt;3

nau_,asktransgender,3 month blood test. Any consensus on whether or not I'm supposed to take my morning dose?,"I've seen some people say that you should, others say you shouldn't. I've asked my doctor 4 times now and they never got back to me so, going in tomorrow with no direction and potentially wasting time if I guess wrong. I normally take it around 9am, but my appointment is at 11:30am. 

Any personal experience shared is much appreciated. "
et-puis-je-fume,asktransgender,Do any of you see the incredible strength of the individuals here as I do?,"I’ve been very reluctant to write something like this because I’m new to the community and I don’t want any of my observations or thoughts to come across as presumptive. Still, in case it has any meaning for any of you, I’d like to take the opportunity to share a bit of my perspective and I hope I can express it as respectfully as possible. 

Understanding gender identity and presentation and how it relates to my past and present life is relatively new to me, and I’m in the midst of dealing with the implications even as they seem to continue to grow larger and burrow deeper. This is actually welcome, in a way, because as painful as it is, the incomprehensible despair that preceded it was worse. I acknowledge that pain is something that many of us probably share, here, and the suicide statistics in the community are a devastating testament.

When I’ve observed reactions from trans people perceiving a positive response from others upon becoming aware that they’re trans, I often see a lot of negativity. To me, there are a least a couple of reasons why this is understandable, and I’m sure there are plenty more! The first that comes to mind is personal safety: unless this other person is a close friend, trans people face a lot of risks and trust needs to be earned and motives questioned until then. The second is a deeper and more nebulous reason, and I hope my explanation will make at least a bit of sense: acknowledging that something positive can come from a process that was and is so deeply painful can feel terrible—as if that very pain would somehow be negated or erased. But often the pain is so keenly felt that this cannot hold and the pain wins and the positive is dismissed. 

I’ve no idea if this resonates with any of you, but if it does, it might suggest that there’s a way forward to accept more positivity into one’s life. In either case, what I really wanted to share with all of you is what I see:

When I see gender expression that strikes me as obviously genuine, or when I learn that someone is trans, what I see is someone who’s faced incredible adversity and has likely suffered deeply as they’ve taken heroic measures to stop the catastrophic trainwreck of their lives. I say heroic because many of us consider suicide and the decision to persist is not fucking obvious. They’ve gotten down to one of the last, hardest choices in life and have said, “I have no choice”. Then they do it. 

Do you not see how utterly impressive that is? Can you not imagine why others might be attracted to someone capable of such intense and deliberate personal growth and transformation? I’m fucking *blown away*.

Pbastos,asktransgender,DAE have high anxiety dreams concerning their dysphoria?,"One of my dreams that I keep having over and over, and, unfortunately, has a lot of anxiety in it, is about my hair growing back again. 

I think this is because it was such a burden for my parents to let me cut my hair short that I sort feel traumatized? I don't know, just guessing. "
cfvrgtbyhuikmol,asktransgender,TERF across the restaurant today...,"Today, I felt pretty good... until I went out to eat. I pass, really well, and always have, been stealth for years. But, today, today my perceptions got thrown in a flux. So there's this woman, she had gray hair, was somewhat out of shape, and happened to be with a little girl, a little girl that had down syndrome. At first I thought nothing of it, just some lady and a kid that needed a little extra help. But then, suddenly, they were talking loud enough for me to hear them. I don't know if this was directed at me, but I'm paranoid, I couldn't tell if she was looking at me or past me when her gaze shifted from left to center. I almost felt like I was the joke, from how she was laughing, but I don't know. This is what I recall:

To the maybe 15 year old girl: ""Oh, you mean, like, it wasn't a woman? They found out *it* was really a guy wearing women's clothing?""

Child: ""Yeah.""

Woman: ""Oh yeah, those men, it's creepy and weird, wearing women's clothing and going into the women's bathroom. I don't get it, it's weird."" *she makes a disgusted, disapproving scowl*

Child: *inaudible*

The older woman laughs obnoxiously as the girl says she had a similar experience with ""a guy in the girls room"".

The thing is though, I don't think it was her kid, because she said, ""stay here and finish eating, I need to go out and call my husband."" So basically, her she is, reinforcing this sort of hate/negativity to a kid with special needs. All if it makes me sick to my stomach. You could tell by her voice she was being factitious too, like she was dancing around the subject, and she knew what she was talking about. Not much of a question rather than a rant... I guess, am I wrong to be so bothered by this? "

sarcasmagasm2,asktransgender,How to come out to new family?,"So, I have kind of a complicated situation I could use some advice on. 

I came out of the closet in 2012 about being trans to my immediate family and some of my friends and a period before I was planning on moving out of state. It was a wonderful and fortunate experience as I was accepted and loved by all my family and didn't lose a single friend and it did a lot to help me gain a lot of willpower to overcome some crippling issues with avoidant behaviors and social phobias. Then I moved out of state and moved in with my boyfriend, ready to start a new life for ourselves with a long term goal of transitioning but no real precise plan. Unfortunately, I kind of went back into the closet out of fear after losing a lot of that will power when some of my plans didn't pan out. 
I've recently decided that in order to get anything done I need to regain that willpower by facing down the fears I have about being out to my boyfriend's family, who still see us as a couple of guys. I haven't had a whole lot of willpower as of late to even start *thinking* about how in the world I am going to pull off transition and a lot of that is because my network of social support is two time zones away. I've come to believe that I would have a whole lot more will power if I had a geographically closer network of support, plus it would be a great excersize in courage building to just come out to these people. 
I have only known them for a handful of years, they are my boyfriend's family and he's known them his whole life and they are all very close. He claims no one would reject me if I was out to any of them, but I told him years ago that I wanted to be the one to come out to them and didn't want him to out me and he's respected that wish for years. I have already been accepted into their family, but as a man, and have spent a number of years trying to build relationships with all of them, aunts, uncles, siblings, cousins, nieces and nephews, all of them. But I've always been intimidated by them because I am back in the closet with them. I still struggle with what I know are irrational fears of ruining my boyfriends relationship with them by being out. He has said that in the possibility that such an event would happen he would defend me and stick by me if it meant cutting himself off from some of his family, but that honestly just makes things a lot more complicated and scarier. I need to face this fear myself, and I need to get these people on my side. This seems a lot harder than what I did in 2012 because I do not know these people as well as the ones from back then, because back then those were people I had known my whole life and I knew how to gauge them. 
Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Has anyone found themselves needing to come out to a family of a partner, people who are sort of strangers? How do I approach this? How do I approach this in a way that builds courage? What is your advice? "
T1res1as,asktransgender,How do I stop saying stupid shit?,"On the verge of transition I find myself having alot of emotions running trough me. I always ran from that shit. But now I have to deal with it and I don't have it all figured out in advance. 

Atleast in the closet everything that went out had to be thought about and pre-approved. Not great for being spontaneous, but I liked the sense of control it gave. Now it's like there is no filter. Now I find myself f.inst acting angry when Im angry. Like wtf?! I thought I had that emotion shit wrapped up tight and fully tamed...

Im just so scared I will blurt out some dumb shit about something Im going trough and someone will take it the wrong way and think it's about them.

Especially when talking to other trans people. Im just walking on eggshells there.

When does this pre-transition freak out period end? It's exhausting and mentally I feel like an akward 16 year old in many ways.

It feels like learning how to ski, and to do that I guess you have to fall on your ass a few times. I don't like falling on my ass. I just want to win the gold medal on the first attempt, without going trough that akward and tiresome training phase. Is that to much to ask?"
Laika_Come_Home,asktransgender,Worried that I'm not trans? (Or at least trans enough?),"I'm still figuring this out.

And, unfortunately, I'm still poor, so I don't have the means to afford a therapist or even a small dose of hormones (unless I decide to sell shit, but I'd need the money for bills, first). 

That being said, I don't know if I'm really trans, and I'm trying to figure it out. The biggest dilemma on my mind is that I may attempt hrt, and after a year or so of being unsatisfied, I decide to detransition.

What was the point? And, what's more is, if hrt didn't work with me, exactly what's going on in my head?"
PavementBlues,asktransgender,I got harassed on the street for the first time last night,"So last night I was meeting up with a friend of mine at a barcade in the Castro in San Francisco. I was walking to the place, about a block away and wrapped up in my own thoughts, when I realized that a drunk bro I had just walked past was yelling, ""YOU'RE A MAN! YOU'RE A MAN!""

It was kind of surreal. I've read so many stories, but for the first time I was experiencing a stranger go out of their way to confront me about my gender identity. For a moment, I was confused as to what emotion I should be feeling in response. Should I get upset? Should I get angry? Should this ruin my night?

Then, I started laughing. My first time getting harassed was *in the fucking Castro*. This neighborhood is the center of the queer universe, and was plastered with rainbow flags as far as the eye could see. Did this guy get lost? Did he know where he was? HOW DID YOU END UP HERE, MYSTERY BRO?

Then I realized just how totally absurd it would have been anywhere. This guy got worked up to the point of screaming over a random passing stranger who has nothing to do with his life whatsoever. That doesn't even make any sense. I started laughing harder.

I'm still laughing. Yell all you want, weirdo. I have a date with a pint of beer and a game of Joust.

Edit: Yeah, I know that gay guys can be really transphobic. I've experienced that at LGBT centers, but the Castro has always felt extremely friendly. It's developed a lot as a neighborhood since its years of consisting pretty much exclusively of gay guys."

cremijeur,asktransgender,"Long term bf has sissy/cross/trans fetish and I'm a straight cis woman, what can I do to be more supportive?","Hi reddit! This is my first (mobile) post and I need some help with a somewhat newly* discovered fetish my boyfriend of 5 years has. 

The other night my phone dies and I'm bored (he was playing vidja games). So I use his phone to look up ""games"" and the first thing that pops up in recent search history is something along the lines of struggling with a trans identity / being gay. My heart starts to hurt because he's never communicated with me about these feelings or even his cross dressing in over a year. Naturally I start looking through his history (I know... I know) and there were countless pornhub sissy searches, dildo searches, sex toy searches, chastity, and tucking. The next morning I confront him about the one search about being gay and his answer was basically that he's been into women since he was born and -basically- I have nothing to worry about. 


So my question is.. where do I go from here? How do I be as supportive as possible? It's hard for me to try and understand without having a panic attack that I'm never going to sexually fulfill him and he's going to leave me because I'm a cis woman. We haven't tried anything in bed yet but I am open and willing to try anything!

*For some background info, he told me his cross dressing ""secret"" around year 2 of being together. I was super excited and supportive, I did his make up, let him wear my expensive clothes, etc etc. additionally, my only kinks are pain and anything to do with cum."

I hate this so much. I'm at school, I'm in a class and all I'm thinking is why do I think I'm trans? I hate it so much. It makes me doubt transitioning is worth it. I think ""do I feel male? No. Do I feel female? No. What are you then? Shit"". But then at night I'll say yes to female.

Napstablooregard,asktransgender,You are worth it.,"I just wanted to take the time while contemplating on the toilet to say to all of you that you are worth it.

No one lives life without struggles. No one lives life without heartbreak or failure in some capacity. But please remember this: you are not alone. Whether you're at the beginning of your trans-journey, sailing through the center of the storm, or watching someone else you love go through this hardship, there will always be someone out there who understands what you're going through. Life is hard, but not exclusively. We can grow stronger together. Where one of us is weaker, another will have the strength to compensate.

You don't have to be perfect, just be you. The world needs a ""you"". Though insignificant you may feel at times, the tiniest thing can make a difference for someone. Your efforts will not go unnoticed. You are known. You are loved.

To those of you who have reached that beautiful nirvana of self-love and acceptance: congratulations! To those of you still striving for that: we believe in you, even if you don't always believe in yourself. Things do and will get better. And to everyone connected to this community: thank you. Your love and acceptance has changed countless lives. Keep up the good work.

TL;DR - You are worth it. Keep being you."
justdoingresearch01,asktransgender,How Do I make the sexy time better? nsfw,"Hello you wonderful people, 

I need some advice in the area of bedroom romance.

My partner and I have been together for coming on a year now. I'm a 26 yr old cis-woman and my girlfriend is 23 yr old trans-woman. We have a great relationship, I work in the tech industry and my girlfriend is finishing her degree in psychology. We have two cats and rent a downtown apartment in a very pro lgbt community. So things on the home front are good, just wanted to get that out of the way.

We're both into kink and up until recently have been pretty active in the community. My partner has started making comments about experiencing genital dysphoria so we've pulled back to get things figured out. My girlfriend has been in her transition for about 7 months now. We both have small frames, I'm about 5ft3 and she's 5ft5, both under 130lbs and present femme. 

My partner still enjoys penetrative sex and we're started talking about different words to communicate her needs so that I dont make her feel self-conscious unintentionally. I've always been more dominating in the bedroom and I also enjoy dirty talk, so this was a super important thing to figure out. 

How do I perform oral in a way that will make her feel feminine? As I said, she doesn't mind penetration, so most of the time I ride her clit because it the only way I can get off and she likes me taking control of her orgasm. But the last couple of times I've tried to perform oral on her she stops me. She said she wants me to treat her more like a girl, I'm not sure how to do this. I'm very dominating in the bedroom and she's in a sub role. I've tried approaching from different positions. I almost make her cum by sitting straddled ontop of her thighs while she's laying on her back, I push her clit down flat against her stomach and focus strictly on the head. I have an oral fetish so I sometimes get too enthusiastic but I just want to make her cum.

As i've said, penetration wise, she's still comfortable penetrating me but she doesn't like the motions of receiving head. 

How do you handle this? how would you want your partner to perform oral on you in a way that wont mess with gender dysporia? "
ZebraTank,asktransgender,Dealing with STBX cis spouse,"My STBX cis spouse and I are planning to split due to irreconcilable differences around sexuality and gender. We would like to remain the best of friends, because we've shared everything together and are already the best of friends.

As they suffer from depression and anxiety, I've agreed to not dress fully as I wish until sometime within a future (but fixed) timeframe, as well as wait to do things like move out, split finances, do legal documentation, etc, until they feel more ready. They are quite distraught about the whole thing, and wish that things would have worked out between us. And basically, say that everything was perfect except for the gender.

So in the ideal situation, I would be able to be supportive as always. But yesterday, after looking too long at my face and becoming disgusted, then wishing I had been born with my preferred body parts, when talking with them I basically unleashed bitterness that while I've always managed to handle their problems, they couldn't do this one thing, and now I still have to refrain from doing certain things to make them ok enough, when everything else was fine and we never had successful PIV anyways (and only a few failed attempts) so who really cares.

Like sure, if you don't want to be in such a relationship, fine, then we'll have a nice easy split and be happy enough about it, but then why are you so miserable you won't be in our relationship any more? This is what I don't get, because isn't being able to express your (hetero, in this case) sexuality supposed to make you happy, not sad and miserable?

I don't know how to stop feeling bitter about this at times and I like being mean :( Either I need to understand their position enough (and I get it superficially, but not enough to not care), or be able to suppress this negativity for long enough until I don't risk blasting them with it."

probablytransiguess,asktransgender,How do I bring this up with my wife?,"Hi guys,

I'm 30. Married, two kids. Posted here before with a different throwaway questioning whether or not I *am* trans, but I've come to the conclusion that yeah, I'm an AMAB woman.

I don't know what I'm going to do about it. My dysphoria isn't terrible. I can avoid it. I can ignore it. I hate shaving, I hate cutting my hair, I hate having my picture taken and I hate looking in mirrors but if I can avoid those things then I can just remember that I'm me, and not let my body define me. I'm a pretty feminine guy all things considered. I'm the stay-at-home dad, the kids primary caregiver. I don't exist outside of the house a whole lot. Gender presentation doesn't totally matter.

I know I'd be happier in a female body, with or without GCS, and that my depression and my anxiety are probably at least in part due to this, but I've learned to live with my brain. I can still live a happy, thriving life as a man. I still fantasize about waking up one day as a woman, just like that, with everything the same otherwise, but...

I'm scared, I guess. Not of what parents or friends or anything think, screw them, screw their opinions. It's my wife. I honestly don't know how she would react. Last year when Jeffrey Tambor won the Emmy we got to talking about transitions later in life and she said ""Well, if that were my husband, I'd feel betrayed. I'd feel like he'd been keeping a secret from me the whole time we were married."" That kind of hit me hard. Didn't really know how to respond. I've been keeping it a secret from myself, too, you know? I've only just come to terms with how I feel myself.

I don't know, if she were *actually* put in that position, would she take it that way? We've been together seven years, married five, have had two little girls together, she's my everything. She's my rock, my support, my strength. We have a wonderful relationship and talk about everything and nothing.

Except this. Because I'm so scared that it's just going to upend our whole life and I'll wind up out on the street with limited access to my kids and just wasting away trying to find money for HRT. Telling her could be throwing my whole life away. Keeping the status quo isn't the end of the world. I'm happy enough, I just know I could be more happy if I was myself, my proper self.

I don't know, gang. What do I do?

Throwaway1383827172,asktransgender,"UPDATE: ""Fuck it: I'm 'coming out' to my mom next time we're alone""","Two weeks ago I made [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5le9iv/fuck_it_im_coming_out_to_my_mom_next_time_were/)

TL;DR: I'm 16, trans girl, and live in a very conservative family. For most of the time I've known my trans I've kind of accepted that I'll just come out after high school but after realizing how lucky I am for not having a very masculine body yet, I don't want to wait and potentially get fucked over by being a ""late bloomer."" However, there's no way in hell I'm straight-up coming out to my family. Since I have a pediatrician appointment coming up this month, I decided I'd tell my mom in a very general way that I'm unhappy with my body and want to talk about it with our doctor, so that I can't be blamed by my parents if the worst case scenario happens and they're totally opposed (I'm a good student and I don't need that distraction).

So I did it. For some reason I was so fucking nervous even though I wasn't saying anything specific. Me and my mom are watching the Texans vs Patriots playoff game right now (she has no idea what I'm typing right now lol) so I just up and said during a commercial break that I want to talk to our doctor about how I haven't been feeling like I've been growing right when we have the appointment.

Of course, my mom thought I was talking in terms of not being masculine *enough,* but I went with it. My mom genuinely cares and loves me, so she was very supportive and said to never be afraid to tell her anything (however she still thinks I'm a nice Catholic boy and not a foulmouthed atheist trans girl sooooo). The most specific thing I said was that I felt like I was *too* tall: she didn't get that since I'm 5'8 (probably the most masculine thing about me now, but I'm fine with it if I don't grow any more) and average for boys my age, but I moved past it quickly.

It feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my chest even if I didn't say anything specific. I've literally never told anyone this before in person.

It basically went as good as possible. My mom was very happy that I told her (she just thinks of it in a ""not boy enough way"" so I won't take it as assurance about my trans-ness yet), so now that she has the idea in her head she'll have an expectation about what my doctor might say about it.

Which'll help because I'm fucking saying it at the appointment.

It's happening, dudes (dudes is gender-neutral). I'm fucking saying it to my doctor this Tuesday. The mom-thing went as well as could be expected, so worst-case scenario is that my mom thinks it's bullshit and gets mad at my doctor and not me.

I also don't want it to seem like I'm being a dick (cunt?) to my parents or anything. Like I said, they love me and I feel the same. I'm just worried that they love the facade (and that goes beyond just being trans, I'm literally the antithesis of everything they stand for and they don't know it) I put on more than they would love the actual me. But I feel like my mom at least would be more sympathetic and support me unconditionally, so I'm optimistic.

For better or for worse, my life is changing on Tuesday. Wish me luck! Luckily, I have studying for midterms to do to distract me from the nerves.

Note: these posts aren't asking for advice, or anything. I just like writing down my thoughts. Maybe I'll look back at this one day and be glad that I did this early. And if it helps out anyone going through the same thing it's worth sharing."
IceprincessOCN,asktransgender,At what time will I actually start feeling love for myself? [Vent],"This is more of a venting thing, but I need an outlet.

I've fought hard for being who I am today, sure everyone genders me female, people see me as a woman, all my docs are female, hormones have made a good work with me, which is nice and all.

But I feel like my life is lacking direction. I feel alone most of the time, purposeless and powerless. Kind of like there's no reason for me to actually be here on this Earth, you know? And I don't say this in a suicidal way but more in a ""What am I here for?"" Kind of way.

I'm having to drop out of college temporarily to focus on my business and save up some money for projects I want to do, as well as a bit of traveling around the country. Something tells me it'd be a good idea. But this decision hurts my ego a bit as I'm almost 25 and I've done nothing that can really be considered important with my life. Then again my current business makes me more money than what I can make living here in Mexico. This country sucks, especially for trans people.

Sure, I transitioned into my true self, but I'm FAR from being the best version I can be and I haven't done enough. I still can't get over my binge eating disorder, I still feel like I lack confidence in myself, I haven’t had an actual loving relationship since 2013 and I feel lonely as fuck. 

I feel like I’ve gone nowhere and I’m stuck. 

Not sure if therapy can actually work for me, some people have suggested antidepressants but messing with my brain’s chemistry is something I don’t look forward to. 

What can I do to better myself? At what point do I find someone who will actually compliment me and make me feel like I’m actually alive and worth loving? At what time do I actually get to love myself and stay consistent to become the best version I want to be of my true self?

*Sigh*"
Princess_Catherine,asktransgender,Why do I still doubt?,"Hello. I haven't been here much. Just recently have I started posting a bit, but mostly lurking. I mainly used this sub when I came out around two years ago now. This is quite long, but I would appreciate anyone who takes the time to read through and respond. 

Basically it created a huge shitstorm, and my life has been mostly very bland and I've been depressed a lot. My anxiety has spiked as well. My mom has said a lot of hurtful things to me, and my confidence in myself as a girl is extremely low. I have to work hard just to not think of myself as a freak.

Anyway, I've wanted to transition for quite a while now. I've just recently gone to a clinic where they gave me papers for bloodwork and said that I could see an endocrynologist in a month if I have a letter of reccomendation from my therapist.

Now, he says I have to express my feelings more, and describe what it feels like to be a woman. This panics me.

I've been up and down throughout the years of feeling so strongly about being a girl, then feeling like shit about, then just feeling empty. I feel like I've gone so far down in supressing my feelings just to get through life that they are gone.

Now I feel very doubtful of myself. For example, my mom recently came to me (presumably after seeing my clinic form that I left in the printer) with an ugly picture of me from middle school when I was most masculine, and very ugly, at least in my opinion. She asked, ""Where did he go?"" In reference to me.

I feel ashamed of myself then because seemed like such a boy, and I don't recall being dysphoric AT ALL. I just know I had sexual feelings with girl's clothes, and sometimes had feelings to draw girls or play as them in games, for whatever reason. It's really quite embarassing, and it makes me feel invalid.

It's like I just don't know. I feel so uncomfortable with the thought of being a girl now. I feel I will only be a fake, or that I have convinced myself lf this, or that I'm just a confused guy. I'm at the point where it's so exhausting that I'd rather just not be anything than be a girl.

It's so confusing because I've felt very happy about the idea of being a girl, even crying about it. Now it's just gone. So I don't know if it really was just a phase or whatever. I don't know.

TL;DR: I can't find my feelings of wanting to be a girl anymore, I just feel numb, which makes me anxious and depressed."

I came out to my mom two weeks ago (ish) and she took it really well and has been very supportive. I started counseling, have a date for my consultation for HRR, etc..

Due to shitty scheduling I need to come out to some school staff this week to handle the whole changing room issue, which is kind of scary but what choice do I have? Then I need to come out to my dad, who I really doubt will take it well, soon because of more shitty scheduling! Everything is piling up all at once and really quickly right after coming out.

feelinqueer,asktransgender,What are some GOOD things that you can take from your life during your assumed gender?

But I like to try to find the good in my past also!

For me it's looking back at my childhood and thinking that growing up as a ""male"" allowed me to explore hobbies that I enjoyed without being told that it was something that ""girls aren't supposed to do"" because of the shittiness of society. (Granted there are TONS of things I wish I could have done but couldn't do them because of the opposite as well, but trying to keep positive!) I honestly don't know if I would have the same hobbies and the type of skills that I have now and enjoy if I didn't grow up the way I did, and now I can still enjoy them as who I am (aka a girl)!

I really just want to try to stop looking at my past with nothing but regret and I'm sure the same feelings are a weight that many of us carry and wanted to try to look at the positives for once instead!

**So what kinds of things can you look back at from your time during your forced gender expectations that you can be happy about?**"
tgthrowaway1871,asktransgender,Feeling isolated and lonely,"Hi everyone. I'm posting on a throwaway because I do not want the folks who follow my main account to know who I am.

I'm just over 8 months on HRT and a year on blockers. I'm still part-time but looking to go full-time this summer. Coming out to those close to me just over a year ago cost me my partner of almost a decade and all of my friends. I knew things would not go well but I always felt things would get better over time. While I have made a few new friends and been on some dates since then I'm still feeling quite alone. I haven't been able to connect with the people I've been on dates with and I feel like the few new friends I have made don't have time for me (which is mostly true). It as if all the new connections I've made with people are shallow.

I'm finding myself spending lots of time alone and simply shut off from the world, similar to how I was before coming out. I simply don't know what to do. To the people I interact regularly see my as a happy, bubbly person so they would have no idea how disconnected I feel, hence the throwaway. I had a therapist about 2-3 years ago but I did not get any benefit from our sessions and she ended up disappearing on me after about a year of meeting regularly. After she closed up her office and stopped responding to messages was about the time I came out.

Growing up I never knew what I wanted from life. Since being on this journey, I've found I very much want a normal life. Married to a partner who loves me, 2.5 kids and a house in the suburbs. I'm starting to feel like that will never happen and I will always be alone. I don't know what to do. I just... I don't know."
zxcvasdfqwe2,asktransgender,fear and loathing in my mind,"so I'm a 30 something trans woman, pre-hrt, appointment made but in a country where you have to wait months. 

So yesterday a girlfriend came over we talked a bit, she's poly and talked about her relations. This generally makes me sad because I've never had a relation. Apparently it showed because she asked me about it, and it was like some door got opened that should stay closed, I got emotional, I didn't want to get emotional but I just couldn't stop it, on the brink of tears and not being able to talk because then the dam would burst, and I didn't want to tell her, didn't want to break in front of her. 

I think somewhere in puberty it started, discovering that I couldn't socialize, that it was easier to be alone then be around other people. I had friends. First my childhood friends, the typical bar/party going teenagers. But they started making fun of me, and I stopped hanging out with them. Then sort of overlapping I met a bunch of nerd friends, playing magic and dungeons and dragons. Then early adult hood I started working. Software engineer. I was good at my job so things went well, I lost touch with my nerd friends. I knew my social life was a mess, but I just managed it, pushed trough, and focused on my work. In a couple of instances I looked for love, but never found it. 

And over those years this all just accumulated in this self-image that I'm just tolerated at best. I don't bring anything to the table socially speaking. And those feelings I've just locked away, which perhaps ironically have given me a knack for dry humour with deadpan delivery. Pushing away my emotions and keeping my face bland is something that's now second nature to me.

But now, now that i'm in my 30ies and have discovered my transness and have a handful of people I can call friends, there is apparently still that black festering place in my heart that I can't look at. My description of events really doesn't do justice all the reasons I became that way, but I hope it can be fixed by my transition. Whenever I read about people saying they become more sociable after transition I secretly hope that will happen for me too. But I'm also afraid, afraid that the psychiatrist will say i'm not trans, but that i'm just broken in my head.

I don't think that last thing is likely, it's just a fear. But I am wondering if this is somehow more common or if i'm really that unique."

tomorrow morning I have to go get a blood sample for a blood test to ensure I don't have HIV, Hepatitis B or C, or Syphillis to be allowed to schedule an appointment for sperm banking. Of course I don't have any of these, but it's standard procedure here apparently (I guess it's a good thing!). 

I'm just wondering, if I have a dinner with friends tonight and drink wine, could this give a false positive for a strain of Hepatitis, or is it unrelated? They're not checking for liver function or enzymes, that was done a couple weeks back and everything is fine.

So, can I enjoy my night or I should stay home?"

[deleted],asktransgender,"Why are strangers/friends/coworkers so nice to me, while my parents are my only enemy and the only source of my misery?","The truth is, and I'm bragging without shame, society at large accepts my transition because I'm just so cute, and they're fully aware of how bad I look as a guy. I'm only 5' 7"" and quite small boned and feminine-faced, so society gives me a pass to pursue feminine stuff that makes me better-looking. I never experience transphobia.

Except from my damn parents.

Older women call me cute names like ""love"" and ""sweetie"" and ""darling"", while my own mother calls me ""gross"" and ""ugly"". Then wonders why I'm so mean to her.

Girls always say they are jealous of my eyelashes and they are perfect for mascara, but I put on makeup and my parents heavily criticize me and make me feel ashamed and tell me to get help (code word for conversion therapy).

Girls always say I have the perfect square-shaped nails for nail polish, but if I tried putting on nail polish to school, my parents would probably disown me.

Older women call me ""pretty"" and ""cute"" but my parents still keep insisting that ""you were a very handsome boy and you ruined it""

Older women always smile at me when they see me, even if they don't know me, because I'm just that cute. In comparison to STRANGERS WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN ME BEFORE, it feels like my own mother doesn't love me.

My parents say this is because ""strangers don't care about you and your future, transition ruins your future job prospects, but strangers/friends don't care so they compliment you in the moment"" but I HAVE A JOB RIGHT NOW, EVERYONE KNOWS I WEAR MAKEUP AND I EVEN GOT A RAISE and they definitely don't dislike me!"
nashnat42,asktransgender,More Dysphoria after coming out as trans?,"My journey to realizing I am trans and accepting it has felt like a long one. The thought of being transgender first occurred to me six years ago and I am now 25. Within the last year I have seriously considered the idea and it has slowly become more real for me. The past six months have been the hardest though. Within the past six months I have realized that yes, I am transgender, and yes I need to do something about it because I am not happy with where things are. Four months ago, I officially admitted to myself that I was transgender. I admitted to myself that it wasn't just a phase, that I couldn't deny the feelings anymore, and that this was my reality. it all felt like a huge slap in the face that I did not want. I was frustrated at the situation and mad that I was transgender. I did not want to be transgender. All that being said: I have made huge strides to help me feel more comfortable with myself and who I am as a person. Back in the beginning of July I changed my name to a shortened masculine form of my birth name. Changing my name at work was a huge step for me. Changing my name was one of the first affirming steps I took that made me realize I was trans. In November, I told my parents about my new name change. At the end of July I started going by they/them pronouns which didn't really feel right but they felt better than she/her pronouns. Three weeks ago, I told all my close friends that I wanted to go by he/him/his pronouns. Three days ago, I came out at my job as wanting to use male pronouns and I also came out to my parents at the same time about the pronouns. For the first three days after asking to be referred to with male pronouns I felt great. I had this huge euphoric feeling like i was floating on a cloud. I also felt an immense amount of relief and a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders. I felt happy. In the months leading up to the pronoun change I felt very depressed and anxious and dysphoric. After changing my pronouns it all became real for me and I felt like transitioning was possible and that it was what i needed to do. I felt very confident in who i was and what i wanted. Everything seemed to fit into place and I finally felt more like myself. However, now three days after all these amazing feelings, I feel the dysphoria again and the confidence has subsided. I feel like People don't see me as male. I pass as male based on my looks about 50% of the time but my voice is super high and as soon as i start talking everyone knows i am female. I just really wish I had a deeper voice. Why do I feel worse after coming out and after feeling so good about everything? Is it normal to feel worse after coming out? "

A_Whole_New_Me,asktransgender,Finding a DR,"*Long story* 
I had a talk with my dr. today during my physical and I got the nerve to bring up that I didn't quite tell the nurse all the meds I was taking. I started with DIY a few months ago (ill-advised I know) and wanted to get a blood test as I never got that initially and she asked about why and why these specific things (I had them written down). 

I showed her the hrt meds I was taking and she asked ""What is your end goal?"" and there must have been something about the way I mumbled or the look I had because she quickly said she understood what they were for. 
I had thought I was tough/prepared/etc but I didn't even have the nerve to say it out loud. I am generally extremely quiet and introverted so it comes as no shock that I am afraid of the reaction(s) saying I want to transition brings. 

She was really nice about everything but had no experience in this area and couldn't refer me to anybody and said I would have to research it for myself. 

**ACTUAL QUESTION:**

I know there is a pdf link around here. Is that up to date (I mean the doctors/locations)? Do I just start ringing up the offices and start asking if they are taking new patients? 

Anything else I need to do? I have very little experience with doctors/hospitals so assume I will not know even the basics.
I am in central WI (pretty popular city if you know football) if that helps any.

I have read that push up bras can make one's breasts appear two cup sizes bigger. Does this work if you're essentially starting from no cupsize? Would a push up bra make it look like I have breasts or would it be a waste of my money?

PennyLisa,asktransgender,Tips on coming out.,"I've developed these tips for coming out to people. It's a combination of what I got taught by my psychiatrist, the things I wished I'd changed when I came out, and my own experience working with trans people. 

I've repeated this a few times in various threads now, so I thought I'd post it so I can link easily.

###Why come out?

Basically, it makes your life easier. Hiding is stressful, it's not fun. If you're living some kind of double life it is going to grind you down over time. 

You're not obligated to come out to anyone, however if you don't disclose to someone close to you who's life is going to be affected to some degree then you're far more likely to leave them with a sense of betrayal and secret keeping if you don't tell them before they notice or find out indirectly.

Often times people avoid coming out due to fear of a bad reaction. This is the worst reason to avoid it. If you leave it longer then the chance of a bad reaction increases because of that sense of betrayal.

When relationships break down due to infidelity, it's not generally the infidelity itself that's the problem, it's the lies and loss of trust. If say your wife finds out you're trans and transitioning when she stumbles across your alternate FB profile with photos of you out with others, she's going to feel incredibly betrayed. This is what destroys relationships. Sure she might have left anyhow if you'd disclosed early, but you improve your chances by doing so.
No you're not obligated to out yourself to people, but if you want them to have a chance at trusting you, you have to give them the chance.

###When *not* to come out?

If you're financially or otherwise dependent on someone like your parents, and they're going to react badly to the point where you're on the streets, then play it safe and keep it to yourself. This isn't going to be fun, but you need to be safe first.

If you're in this situation you're probably best not coming out to anybody, or at the very most someone you really absolutely trust or has no connection to your current life (like a support group or something). With every person you tell, the chance of it getting back to the parents increases rapidly. Consider seeing a psychologist or someone duty bound not to disclose.

###Who to come out to?

Your SO or spouse should be first on the list. Parents and siblings should be on the list too if you have a relationship with them. Close friends you'd probably want to tell. Once you've got all that done, then just post it on facebook or whatever. 

###What is the aim of these tips?

The aim of my tips is to get you through a difficult process with your dignity intact and feeling stronger. You can't control how people are going to react, you can only control your own actions. 

##The tips:

1. You're sharing information. You're not asking for permission. This is how it is, it's not something you need approval for. You don't need to apologise for being trans, you haven't done anything wrong. You don't need to ask permission to have heart disease, you don't ask permission to be trans. Don't expect to get permission from someone who's not going to give it. Unless you're really lucky, your SO or spouse won't want you to transition because being in a queer relationship isn't something they want, and that's OK. It may be something they accept as necessary for your on going health, and they may well adapt to the change in circumstance, and be gracious if they do. Conversely, you can and probably should express ""sorry for how this will affect you"", because that's only fair. Maybe your Mother's church group with look down on her, it's fine to express that you're sorry about that because well, that sucks for your mum.

2. There's no perfect way to come out that will grant you acceptance. In the end if someone has an issue with the information it doesn't matter how pretty the language. You're better off being direct rather than indirect with the message - use simple words and terms and don't be overly long.

3. It's scary to come out, but it's just something you have got to do and not avoid. Finding out indirectly is the worst way. If the person you're telling finds out from someone else, they're more likely to have a bad reaction. The more you avoid it, the harder it gets. Conversely, the more times you do it the easier it gets, and can even start being fun/amusing.

4. You're not responsible for other people's bad reactions. If you had a cancer diagnosis and that got people upset, it's hardly your fault. It is what it is. ""How could you do this to me?"" ""I can understand this takes some getting used to and you might find adjusting difficult. Being transgender is just something that happens sometimes, and it's happened to me."" You could throw in an analogy to cancer or depression if you wanted to, although that might not go down so well depending on the person.

5. If you want to explain how you got to this point, but don't go on the ""science defensive"". Sometimes people google up a whole load of stuff, and then try and argue with you. You're better off not engaging in argument. If someone has a fixed opinion, arguing with facts opposite to that opinion actually just hardens their stance. ""I read somewhere that this is a sexual fetish and most people regret it"". ""This is something I've come to after longstanding and deep introspection. I feel hurt that you think I've not explored other options or that you know me better than I do. I can sympathise that this might be hard to understand for you, but this is who I am"".  If you can get the discussion to feelings, then acknowledge their feelings and express your own this is better. You can't deny someone else's feelings exist, and they can't deny yours exist either.

6. If someone still doesn't get it after step 5 you're better off just disengaging. Continuing to JADE - Justify, Argue, Explain and Defend, just results in circular arguments and a load of wasted emotional energy. ""I'm sorry you can't accept this, I hope in time you will come around. I need to go now"" and leave or change the subject.

7. With those close to you they may go through the famous stages of grief - denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. The stages of grief are pretty common in all life changes, not just loss of a loved one. Don't be surprised if their reaction and comfort level changes and evolves over time as they get used to it.

8. Some people accept straight away. Some people accept it in time. Some people will disappear from your life. It's just how it goes, try not to take it too personally. You can't control other people's actions, just like they can't control yours. There's always some loss, and there's some gains, but in the end transitioning is better than jumping off a bridge, so there is that.

9. If you tell someone, don't expect them to keep it secret. It's a bit unfair - you're putting a big thing onto them and then you expect them not to talk to anyone about it. If you do ask to keep it a secret don't be surprised or resent it if they tell others, it's just how it goes. You're better off asking them to tell you who they're going to talk to about it, ask them to keep it to themselves for a limited time (weeks at the very most), or just rip off the band-aid and post it on facebook or whatever."
KYA797,asktransgender,Buying Needles for HRT?,"Hi all.

So I've been coming to terms with being trans for a while and have been opening up to more and more people about it. There's now about ten or so people who know and a few who sort of know but it's not confirmed/discussed. Family stuff.

I've also been posting makeup selfies on Facebook when I'm drunk which is stupid I know - those who know like them and comment but everyone who doesn't stays silent. Predictably so I guess as it's probably a bit weird for them to see. 

It's eating me up inside! I just want to tell everyone and be done with it but I really don't want the carnage that may result. I'm being pressed to a decision because some friends who don't know are messaging those who do asking what's going on. 

What would you do? Just open the floodgates or take my time? These are some of my best friends we're talking about plus people from school, old work colleagues etc. I kind of want to throw the dice and may things land where they do but... I'm scared...

OMGBEAR,asktransgender,Has anyone had success with natural androgen blockers?,"Saw this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlXeVAXwx2w&amp;) a couple days ago, and I'm curious if there are any others who have had success blocking testosterone in this fashion or have better suggestions.  Basically I'm looking for more than anecdotal evidence of success.  And part of me believes that this might even be having a placebo type effect.  If that's not the case, it would be great, because who wants to deal with the side effects of Spiro or other anti-androgens?

In case you don't want to view the video, she basically is taking 1-2 mls of Spearmint oil VIA gel-cap each day.  Roughly the equivalent of 8 glasses of Spearmint tea.

Also, assuming this could work, would it even be wise to do so prior to officially having ones levels tested.  If it succeeded in lowering testosterone levels, a doctor might prescribe less estrogen.  Or at least that's my thinking.  Your thoughts?"

A few days after Christmas I came out to my family and it couldn't have gone better. Everyone is accepting which is surprising considering my family has a slight Canadian conservative lean to it. A day days after that on New years Eve I came out to all my friends via face book. Everything so far has gone great that way too, except I'm not sure how I feel about it. I got comments about how strong I was, what an inspiration I was, how brave I was for coming out. I wont lie, I liked the attention.

Throwaway_transhelp,asktransgender,"I'm a heterosexual male that met a girl on the internet. We wrote together for a while, she is suicidal and on a lot of medication / therapy. She told me that she was born a man and pre operation after we fell for eachother. I know there is no way i can be with her, but i still want to help her.","So i met a girl some time ago, we had a lot of fun and shared many interests. She fell deeply in love with me and quickly attached herself when i started being nice to her. I am a very stable person and want to fix most problems, so that stuff didn't bother me much.

We started chatting a lot and soon i started getting feelings as well. And dreaming about doing stuff, you know the whole thing when you fall in love. She had a lot of mental problems, was suicidal and on medication / therapy. So i wanted to help as much as i could. She started going down the spiral of negativity and kept telling me how she would hurt me and i should leave her and that i was too good for her. I really tried so hard to get her mood back up. For a moment i stopped being worried because she started sounding relaxed again. Then she started going back down that dark spiral, and told me her story and told me that she would stop talking with me after sharing this.

She felt like she was a girl trapped in a mans body, and was molested as a child. So she had a problem of the thought of other touching her body. She told me that i was the best thing that ever has happened in her life, and i was the first person ever she wanted to let touch her and embrace her. We even sexted days before this and i made her indulge(sorry this is awkward for me) for the first time in a long time. She told me she was pre-op and is going to do an operation next year.
I couldn't believe it. My mind was telling me that this person was a girl, and i wanted to kiss and hug her so much. So it was so out of reality for me that i told her that i didn't believe her, and that she said it to try and push me away because she kept saying i deserved so much better.

We talked a little more, i was starting to get confused and just a little bit disgusted in myself. I hated it and couldn't believe it. I told her to prove it, with a picture of her now. She told me that she was going to cut communications once she had showed me because she didn't want to see.

With this she wrote:  
""say you want to hug me and kiss me one last time..""  
""tell me again what could've been""  
""i need this to be our last memories together..""  
I told her i really did want to hug her so much and kiss her. Even in a mans body no matter at this moment.

She sent the picture and i started to cry, not because i was sad that i felt no attraction to the man. But because i really wish that i could love based purely on the person i knew inside that man.

I really wanted to be her anchor. Even after this i still do. I still wanted to make her laugh and smile since she never does. I want to protect that person so much, she deserves so much goodness for all the shit that has happened in her life. She has cut contact with me now. I know i will be fine i have gotten over heartbreak before... But it hurts so much right now because i still want to help. But i have no way saying that anymore.
And even if i fucking did i would end up hurting her so much more later on. Fuck. I'm so afraid that she will commit suicide before she gets the chance to experience her transformation, and i can't do anything. Please someone who has gone through the other side will she make it? I can't have her die. God i never cry but i can't hold them back, there is nothing i can do to help her. Please someone help me understand this.

beyouorfuckyou,asktransgender,MTF Swim Training,"I've found more than a few threads on swimming as a trans woman here already, but I have questions about swimwear that aren't addressed by any of them because I'm not looking for beachwear. I want something I can train in.

Last year, I returned to athletics after a five year dry spell. After years wasted feeling anxious about being seen sweaty and without makeup, I went for my first run outside on November 4th. I used to worry about the bulk added by building muscle (in hindsight, a really stupid thing to let get to me) but my priorities have strained and shifted.

Running's easy, albeit expensive. Swimming is another beast. I haven't swam in a pool since I was thirteen and it makes me really, really sad to think about it. I just signed up for a two week free YMCA membership, but I can't get what I want out of it because I don't know how to prepare myself; for the locker room, for the fit of a swimsuit (non-op but post-orchi), etc.

I tried the dress on first. Dresses feel amazing, but I look in the mirror and I just see a guy in a dress, it makes me feel quite upset. 



What I see in a mirror never quite looks right. I know it's me, but it just feels odd, like something is not quite right and I have no idea what. 


Anyway, I then tried on a suit, and looked in the mirror. I felt so angry (a dysphoric angry) and I just hated what I saw. I struggled to even look at the mirror comfortably. 



All I want is to be reborn as a girl and end this maleness. If I were born a ciswoman I'd never have any of these problems. 


I look into the future. I see myself as a happy transwoman or a depressed man. 




I don't now what to do. I'm not sure if I'll be able to get HRT or not in 2017, but hopefully I will. I might go back to being a cis 17 year old soon, although I've been like this since October and it's only getting worse, not better.

Clarine87,asktransgender,"Learned a valuable lesson in information control today. People need to be told that confirming knowledge with ""I know about that, but I can't discuss it"", and ""I don't know what you're talking about"". Are VERY different.","I told my mum I had gender dysphoria (the symptom, not the diagnosis) in August, nothing else. 

She spoke to her brother about it sometime in the last 4 months. He asked his son about it around 4 weeks ago. His son responded in the affirmative (but apparently disclosed no information while failing to understand that he was creating new information by telling his parent something they didn't know), when he should have said ""I don't know what you're talking about dad"". 

My cousin told me what he'd done (without knowing it was a breach of my privacy), but I had not read my messages on facebook for almost a month so only found out today. :(

Since apparently my uncle has phrased the question under ""sex change"", my foolish cousin has given information to his parents which I never gave him.

Now I have to find a way to stop my uncle talking to my mother if it's not to late. If it is too late, whatever information has been passed back to my mum is likely fiction. Afaik my cousin only said yes without elaboration.

/endrant

Lesson: If someone asks you about a third person, and they apparently have information from someone close to that third person, do not assume said third person has 'come out' to whomever their source was.

EDIT:

Explained myself to my cousin, he said ""I won't tell anyone anything you've told me, but if someone asks me if you're transgender I'm not going to lie for you"".



EDIT2:

&gt;This failed to convince him:

&gt;Simply the reason this is so distressing is that I don’t know what you said yes to, to your parents. And if they relayed it to my mum, it could be a COMPLETE FICTION.


&gt;The last thing I need to get from my parents is a question about something about me which I know nothing about which they think is accurate. Most people do not know the up to date or correct terminology for specialist subjects like this, crossed wires can be very very easily made. For example the term “sex change” means to me only ONE thing: Removal of the penis. 

&gt;I have zero plans to have my penis removed. Currently all I want removed is hair on my torso and shoulders. 

&gt;Likely that is what my parents will think sex change means. The current colloquialism is “transition” and that can be social/physical/mental/surgical/medical/hormonal/legal, and social can be as little as just changing pronouns, as legal can be name and gender markets. 

&gt;In effect, from my perspective you told your parents I want to have my penis removed. That’s very bad since it is 99% untrue – and the 1% accounts for my research of the subject matter. You must see how that is not something I want relayed to my parents. Don’t get me wrong, if gender affirming/confirming surgery is a treatment which might have a positive effect, I can’t rule it out as part of a course of treatment. But now, and a no point in the last 10 years have I wanted that. I wanted that when I was 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21. But that was back when I didn’t understand the difference between gender, biological sex and orientation.


&gt;GRS/GCS is one of the most painful and radical elective surgeries out there, yes for binary male to female transwomen it is consider necessary and lifesaving (and not elective). But I don’t, nor have I ever, correctly identified as a transwoman. Again, I wont rule it out (I am hopeful that my teenage desires were correct). My gender and understanding of my sexual orientation has changed distinctly 9 times since September 2015.


&gt;I have mentally transitioned, I can’t go back, I never thought of myself as male, but not in those terms, historically it was just a “wrongness”, a dysphoria of my gender. But that’s it. That is a mental realisation. 

&gt;If I decide that I don’t wish to move further with any other aspect of ‘transition’ I’m sure you can appreciate that I do not need the hassle of ‘un’-coming out.

I will admit, she has always been a bit of an attention seeker, even as a boy, but is this just her pretending that she doesn't care.

SparkleKittee,asktransgender,I'm pretty sure I'm trans (M2F) - now what?,"Since it's the new year, I've been looking over the events of 2016 over the last few days. This year's been an interesting one for me personally, as I have finally managed to put a label on how I've been feeling all these years - I cannot live the rest of my life as a man.

It's been kind of hard working out what gender dysphoria is and if I have it as different resources say different things, and it's been very confusing and a bit distressing, as if nobody knows what's real and anything goes if you have anecdotal evidence. I once thought that I was depressed because of my disconnection from my emotions and my serious lack of motivation to do anything despite experiencing crippling boredom and lack of willpower to do anything (and I mean anything: eating, sleeping, homework, things that I enjoy like playing my guitar or video games), and when I do have the motivation to do things, there's never enough time, and it really pisses me off. However the whole hatred of my born masculinity made me realise it's probably something more than depression.

The thing is, now that I'm confident enough to tell someone, I don't know who to tell, or how to tell them. Whenever I try and tell my mom, I always ease into the conversation with something like ""I've been feeling a bit down"" or ""I don't really see the point in life"", but she always dismisses it and tells me it's just hormones, which just reminds me of my lack of the right ones and my overwhelming desire to replace them. I'm currently 15 years old (I'll be 16 this year) and I live in the UK, so if I go to see a doctor about this, they're going to have to tell my mom, or I'm going to have to tell her first, which I'm really scared of doing - not because she's a bigot or anything, but just because I don't want to disappoint her, and I'm really bad at explaining things with words, so I'm worried that I might make things worse.

I also don't have a clue who my GP is, or how to make an appointment at the doctors, or which doctors' to go to (me and my mom have been homeless up until recently and have lived in various different places). I haven't seen my GP since I was about 8 or 9 years old iirc, so for all I know, my GP could have changed.

All I know is that I want to go on HRT asap before I take the easy way out.

In them two months my dysphoria has gradually gotten worse and worse. I just turned 17, and I'm AMAB. 



A few months ago I was incredibly sociable, I used to go out with friends every day, my social anxiety was getting a lot better, I passed all my GCSEs, I thought my life was getting better. 


At the same time, I did wish I was a girl a little. Although, it didn't really bother me at all. I just thought ""meh"" about it. 


But then in October, I discovered this sub, I started reading lots of stuff about dysphoria, and then I thought ""wait, maybe I am transgender"". Ever since then I've had more and more dysphoric thoughts, sometimes I even think what's the point in living if I'll never be a cis girl. Other times when I'm not dysphoric I feel really annoyed for not caring about being a girl. 


I've become really depressed, my social anxiety has gotten really bad again, I skip sixth form because it makes me have less dysphoria which equals more denial, which I hate. Instead of going out with friends I just stay at home and I don't really eat that much anymore (I'm a bit overweight, I used to be able to eat tonnes of food and still be hungry). This has all happened in the space of 2 1/2 months.

ThrowawayAmITrans777,asktransgender,Am I trans? So confused.,"I will start this off by saying I am AMAB and in my late 20's. I am unhappy with my appearance in general because I am obese, so it makes it harder to really figure out wtf is going on. 



* When I see an attractive woman, often I wish I looked like or was her, and I get turned on. Some times it's hard to tell if I want to be her or be with her, you know?

* I don't think I've ever seen an attractive man and wished I looked like him. I am generally not attracted to men. Though the body of a really fit guy might get me goin' and penis. I like penis. But I've never been interested in being with any guys I've known.

* I have read stories and captions about MTF transformations and often wish I was the character involved. Reading these turns me on. 

* I have never had any desire to crossdress. 

* When watching porn, I fantasize what it would be like to be the woman. I often wish I was the woman.

* I don't think I am necessarily unhappy with being a man, but maybe it could be because of my weight? Like, the fat might hide more masculine features or something?

* I don't hate my penis and am not distressed by it. In fact I enjoy it because it makes me feel good. 

* I am not sure when my fantasies about being a girl started, but I do remember at least a few occasions when I would pretend to be my ""sister"" when talking to my online friends over instant messenger. I can't remember the nature of the conversations I had, and I don't know if I thought I was playing a prank on them or what? This happened over a decade and a half ago when I was much younger.

* I am not bothered by male pronouns or my very male name, but that could just be because I am used to them. I don't really think about it much.

* In video games, I generally play more female than male characters if given the option. I have played a lot of various characters male and female, but lately I have noticed I tend to play females much more often than males. 

* I might be depressed in general. I have never once had a suicidal thought though. 



I made it in a list because it's easier to organize my thoughts this way. I kind of just wrote stuff as it came to me. I don't know what to think specifically because most of the time fantasizing about being a woman either is a result of me being turned on, or results in me being turned on, so it's really confusing me. 
 
I guess I am just asking if anyone here can relate to what I've said here?

I'd easily pass the button test, I'd press it without thinking about it. 



At college (AKA high school in other countries) I'm not really that dysphoric at all. I sometimes don't understand how I'm so dysphoric at night. I'm in class, I see guys, I don't want to be like them. But I see girls and I don't really know what to think. I'm not even sure if I'd rather be born male or female. It almost annoys me that I don't want to be a girl, really bugs me. I do get dysphoric over the attractive girls, especially when they wear dresses (dresses and skirts really trigger dysphoria for me). But I don't really see the point in transitioning when I'm like this. 





Dunno why I feel this. Maybe the dysphoric thoughts go back to subconscious, then come out again when I'm alone? Maybe I'm not trans and making this up in my head? I don't know anymore.

Psychogre,asktransgender,"Starting HRT but also a hypochondriac that is super afraid of side effects, like to be more informed.","So I just started Estradiol patches and Spiro and I have struggled with dysphoria my whole life so I do think this is a good thing for me to be trying to do but I have also struggled with hypochondria my whole life and get very anxious over what ifs and side effects.

Mainly I worry about the whole blood clot warning and other possible side effects and what the percentages really are and how likely it would be to affect me. I am a little overweight as is and not the most active but I'm trying to change. What do they mean to make sure you get up and move every hour though? Like how long, and what kind of movement? Also like if I have to stay seated for a bit will I be in trouble? Can anyone educate me more on this? Does anyone have advice on dealing with intense anxiety related to health and side effects? Sorry if this seems inane but I'm just trying to reach out and get help from people who'd know."

PlasticElectricity,asktransgender,Is it possible to perform permanent hair removal in the vaginal introitus after vaginoplasty?,"TL;DR is the title.

I'm looking for information or a personal account of someone who has undertaken some form of permanent hair removal in the vaginal introitus after SRS.

For personal context:

I got vaginoplasty via the Thai non-inversion method almost two years ago. I was informed that hair removal on the perineum was optional so I did not pursue it. Because of that decision I now have a significant amount of hair in the vaginal introitus which is difficult to manage using traditional temporary hair removal methods.

I've searched Reddit but failed to find information about removing perineal hair after surgery.

Yes, I've asked the doctor, and will share information when I receive it.

Before you read this, I want to let you know that I have ADHD as well, so my words tend to jumble a bit, thoughts mush together, and other stuff. Also, this is probably my first ever reddit post that highlights a major victory of mine, so I am SUPER SUPER excited.Sorry if you have trouble!!!


So, I was feeling like it was a good time to do my workout, so, naturally, I got dressed. I got into a black volleyball shorts with a neon green trim on the top (they were really short, and wrapped around my curves in the best &amp; most feminine ways &amp; places. They made my legs &amp; belly look and feel like those of a Victoria’s Secret model. Maybe not the look part, :p, but OH MY GOSH!! I FELT AMAZING, like I was emitting a radiant feminine aura! EEEK!!!). I also slipped a black sports bra, a blue-black hood to cover my face,* and a cute Omega head/sweatband to top it off(lets be honest, its been so long since I really dressed like this, I was sweating buckets despite my cool, pure feminine outfit
.

*(i'm really  paranoid about everything, and this was a huge jump from anything i've ever done, and  I knew someone might get inside my phone[protected with 2 passwords that are about 14 chars each], and I am extremely timid, awkward and shy, and NEVER let anyone in my bubble until I feel comfortable, which I can say about nobody but my imaginary friend. I can talk more about why I am like this if you wanna hear.


Usually, I just get into my clothes, and do my work out for 20 min, then change back into those weirdly shaped suits to get to ‘real’ world things. But today, I decided to take my phone out. “Ill just look at myself through the camera and not take any pictures to be safe.” I told myself. So I did for a while, and started off positioning the camera so I was a feminine silhouette, and did some poses. After that, I went out in the open, posed a bunch&amp; made the cammie hover around my body for a while, searching eagerly for the most feminine and confident angle&amp;pose, curious about how it looked. I usually hate selfies, and can only remember one other moment in my life I took one, and it was for a teacher I really liked. So it was a new experience, and I was still totally comfortable with it all. Wanna know what the cammie saw? Sure thing! Look below.


SO, little break... to talk about---My body! Skip this if you aren’t interested. 


___BEGIN_____


Legs, Hips,&amp; Ass- 8/10-They have always been the strongest part of my body, and I can kick &amp;scissor hold with a fatal force that could beat several cis women (I’ve measured myself holding around 130 lbs. of pressure for 15 seconds straight), and run a mean 6:23 mile. My legs &amp; ass are super toned, and look really nice, maybe with the exception of my upper thigh, where the muscle contrasts slightly with the knee’s minimal fat(I am also extremely thin, which ill elaborate later why this is an issue in the rest of my body desc) when I flex or get in a certain position, and my ass, which is strong, thick, packed tight n’ firm(, but the outer left and rightmost parts have a sizable hole from the serious lack of fat, visible when I’m naked/in underwear in an ugly way.


Waist/Back- 7/10-I have a nice curve, but ribcage is visible (even to the point you can oftentimes see my heart pounding fairly distinctly). However, all the fat in my body distributes to my core, which, is really visible in weird situations only, thankfully. Another issue is that my core is weak&amp;NOT TONED!!


Bust/Shoulder/Chest-Etc-3/10- probably the worst part, maybe tied with the face. The skin over here wraps over the masculine shoulder frame, biceps, and arm, and when I flex, I look like the Hulk, almost. This is probably the most annoying part about my body in a way, and ofc, ive not gone through HRT(im just a 16 y/o teen, going to do it much later but I’ll do what I can to make it easy for now)


Face-5/10-This really depends... If I wear a cap/hood to cover my face, I look pretty feminine if I can make slight adjustments to my expression. Otherwise, I have a square-ish shaped chin, and stocky brows, the usual brown guy look, and yes, I am brown.(however, my lashes make most cis folk jelly ;D).


Voice-2/10-I know this isn’t part of my body, but I felt I should talk about it as well. Its basically 100% masculine, but when I try hard in girlmode, I can reduce that by up to “40%”.. But that’s very hard... Also, I tried singing once while moving my larynx (with my throat muscles, ive heard using your hand is bad), and I sung. Now normally, my voice is extremely squeaky, and I can’t even sing a full octave, but that time, I could sing all the songs I knew, while shaky, astoundingly wonderful from before.
All in all, my body looks like a normal thin female/male frame depending what I wear, and how I wear it. Usually, exposing the legs w/ a hoodie makes me look feminine, and jeans&amp; a t-shirt make me strikingly masculine. I’m brown (bit lighter than most), so I grow hair in good amounts all around. But I love, in a way, the ability to literally shift gender... but of course, I’d rather stick with being a woman.


~Me&amp; my workout regimen!- SO, to explain my bod, I decided to tell you quickly what I did. I did this a few days a week for about 6 months, and the results are basically above-NOTE-I vary these and its really random which one I do each day. Sorry if I confuse you! :(


Ass-Huge focus here- I mean, like Ass,Ass,Ass,legs,Ass,Ass,flexibility, etc. 

Assisted squats-30X-I do these about once a week

Hardcore run-All out mile sprint, once a week.

Scissor practice-I take 2 pillows, lie on my side, hand on my hip, other resting my head, like a “sexy pose”, force myself to scissor the tip of my foot down and make contact with the other and hold it till I start shaking&amp;can’t take the shooting pain any longer(usually about a minute). WOULDN’T RECOMMEND. I made this one specifically for myself, also given that I had very strong legs before. If you wanna do it, be very careful. I wont accept responsibility if you hurt yourself doing this, or anything I mentioned in this entire post!!!


Splitz-I just keep going lower and lower and lower and lower... until my legs start crying.. cant wait for that one day when I go all the way down and my crotch fits down perfectly on the ground, no balls or anything, like it should! ;D

-NSFW-

Hi kicks-Kick higher, keep kicking,.. see how high I can put up my kicks, SHOW THEM ALL THAT FEMININE JUNK! LET IT FREE! LET YOUR HOT BODY ROAST THE MASSES! (sorry if this is rude, but I think of it like I’m showing the world my real ‘junk’ doing it in these shorts)


Clamshell-self explanatory-search it up


Pistol squats-Remember when I said I got legs of a femme fatale? Yep, the pistol squat is a one footed squat.. currently im working on the one where you bring your leg all around your body and hold it in front of you while squatting on a single foot. 


ELYPTICAl! :D-I love these so much, not because they make my ass and legs nice and tight, but its fun!, and I really enjoy it! It’s like you are skating across magical field where everything is controlled by your sheer will for a body that’s finally yours. You gotta relax and do the stuff you love!


________END_______


Now, I decided to pull out a swiveling 360 degree stool, and put the camera under it(Imagine it like I had you put your face under the stool facing up, so you could see the bottom of the stool and it's legs, my limbs, and my partial shape spinning from underneath the stool). I stared spinning, looking at the camera to see myself like this and making shapes and moving my limbs, dancing for the first time, like I’ve wanted to for years, but in a unique and quirky twist: Spinning around at the same time! I was overjoyed, and was making passionate kicks now, and stretching out my body in new shapes and positions, all while spinning around on the stool. And then I decided to take my second ever true selfie- I took a full out, 6 minute video-I spun around, swiveled, danced, posed, had a few awkward moments struggling with some hard positions(I was trying to spin while making a C shape, with my back on the stool and my body facing the ceiling, and fumbled, almost falling off the stool... then giggled and tried another position). I then spun rapidly, afterward pulling my hands from my side to show a heart towards the camera-telling my future self how much I LOVED THIS MOMENT, EVERY LAST DRIP AND DROP OF IT. I then took the camera from underneath, stuck it inside my bra, and spun some more, starting out from my point of view, and pointing the camera at my feet eventually, while wriggling and doing cute things with them while I spun. Finally, I took the camera, did a quick run-up of my body, and adjusted my bra &amp; ended the video.


Afterwards, when I changed back into idk what even, I decided to watch the video-I was scared. I thought it would be like every other video of mine, awkward and strange, with me doing something silly(not in the good way), while everyone just stared. Heh...  I started watching, and it was clear


Words.They can’t describe the feeling. OMG! It was like.. my heart was pulsing, letting out a feeling of respect, fear, admiration, and total bewilderment to this radiant, confident, quirky, passionate young woman showing the world what she was all about, telling the viewer that “I don’t care, what you think. I know I’m sexy. I know I’m confident, imaginative, fatally feminine, beautiful on the inside and out, loving woman whose going to change your life forever” vibe to it. I was SEXY. I was HOT. I was so.. FEMININE! I could almost feel the dysphoria burning and shriveling in my feminine blaze of confidence. I never knew I could do this. I only saw myself as the loser who never got anything she ever needed. I actually cried a little. Bringing this up now... it makes me water up. I couldn’t believe it. I thought I looked like a jock wearing a bra and having a penis bulging out of panties all the time... But here I was, OWNING THE SHOW, showing off my true colors like the young woman I always knew I was- I didn’t think I could have been much more feminine(maybe my giggles sounded masculine, but that was probably all). This changed me, even though it was just a matter of hours ago, for the rest of my life. 


And I want to thank you, thank you thank you thank you thank you, THANK YOU!!!!!!! For reading this all, for giving a shit. 


It means so much to me, and I promise I mean it, every single one of you. It’s SO fulfilling to know all the effort wasn’t wasted. PM me if you wanna chat about ANYTHING! Please! I wanna chat with y’all. All I can say is, this really changed me, as a trans, and also made me feel like all the effort that never paid off-finally did in the most feminine way possible!!!

orbital121,asktransgender,Am I crazy or are the results of most forms of SRS insufficient?,"This has literally been driving me crazy for months now but whenever I look online to see the results of SRS I'm always put off... It doesn't seem good enough...? Am I just too picky?

It's not like I look at the results and dismiss them either... I found many of those 'natural vagina' images which is meant to show guys what average and 'real' vaginas look like and even then when I returned to the SRS images I kept pointing out anatomical flaws...

Am I being picky? Am I ungrateful for what is available and do I need to just deal with it?

On a side note I've also looked at FtM surgeries and even they don't seem to look the part... I really wish there was a way for me to 'donate' my equipment to somebody and vice-versa...

Edit: I wanted to clarify I know that these kind of surgeries must be incredibly difficult for doctors to do and that is part of the reason I feel like it's a me problem... Moreover it seems like nobody else has mentioned this at all... Maybe it is just a me problem..."

Shockingpink13,asktransgender,Terrifying Experience With My Dad. Nearly Outed,"Pre Hormones.  Pre coming out.  Pre everything.

Earlier today, my dad and I were working on my car because the Check Engine Light came on and we were trying to figure out what the issue was.  So we were looking at this thing and that thing until my dad asked, ""Why don't you get the car manual from your trunk?""

My entire body froze.  The trunk, that's where I had one of my dresses and one of my leggings were hidden.

He was still standing at the front of the car, at the engine, while I looked.  So I looked, and there was no car manuel.

My mom then pulled into the driveway and she began to talk to my dad.  I thought about making a break for it, to run upstairs and hide my clothes, but I didnt.

I went to the front of the car, where my dad now stood talking with my mom, and told him that the manuel wasn't there.

""Its got to be in there Alex.""  He then left my mom at the top of the driveway, walked to my trunk and said, ""Open it."" 

Then, me thinking of any excuse that my mind could grab, I said, ""I cant.  There is a present for you in there, and I don't want you to see it.""  

He rolled his eyes and walked back to my mother.  I was hoping that he would go back inside the house and wait for me to hide ""his present"".  But he didnt, he just stood there talking.

My brain was scrambling, looking for a way, any way, out of my situation.  It was then that I realized what I would have to do.  What I did, was I stuffed the clothes into my coat and ran.  I heard my dad shout ""Alex!""  as I flew into the house carrying my clothes.

I was worried that they would come in through the short cut in the garage and get me.  But thankfully they didn't, and I ran to my room and hid my clothes inside of a large typewriter case.

When I came downstairs, I saw my mom.  She asked me, ""Alex, what's wrong?""  And I told her that I was hiding my dad's present, that he almost saw it.

When I came back, my dad said he found the manual on the front seat, and we then continued our work.

This was honestly terrifying.  This is only the second time that I have been nearly discovered, and I hate it.  I hate having to live with this secret and worry about these kinds of things all the time

In the end, I decided not to go (it's too far, and I'm afraid of having a panic attack in the middle of an unfamiliar city). But it got me thinking.

One of the things that crossed my mind was that now that I understand that I'm a trans woman, I have an obligation to go, that I'll be a coward or a hypocrite or something like that. I have no choice. I have to be involved, I have to fight.

I'm in my early 20's but my genes are cursed and I have some thinning at the top and my hairline is ""peaky"" (shaping like a V) I've been pretty desperate to get some growth back or at least prevent further loss, even now to the point where every other night I'll create a concoction from soybean oil, vitamin e, and saw palmetto, and apply it to my scalp. The reasoning being that saw palmetto supposedly is soluble in oil and that soybean oil and saw palmetto both can be absorbed subcutaneously and have slight (underlined) evidence that they can prevent testosterone from being converted into DHT which is the form of testosterone linked to Male pattern baldness. So far this mixture hasn't accelerated hair growth significantly but it has seemed to stop further hair loss. During weeks when I slack I notice sometimes I shed a few hairs in the shower vs weeks I'm diligently applying it I do not shed at all. Does anyone else have any recommendations or suggestions on how they've helped their hair growth? I'm in the home stretch but I really want to do all I can over the next few months to help things along, it's the biggest trigger for dysphoria that I feel. "

As for the question to the post-ops, well, as we all know, we need to take hrt for the rest of our lives or we'll get an osteoporosis. But do you still need to see a doctor to buy an estrogen? Let's say that you moved, and you need a new box. Can you just go to the GP and ask to prescribe you a new box of estradiol? Does dosage change after surgery?

I'm just curious about how it looks like after a few years + op. It's kinda funny, i need to save for SRS first (which will take me about a year working 6 days a week in 2 jobs, but my genital dysphoria is killing me and brexit's ahead so i have no choice) but I'm already reading what i can find about it.

I forgot about it, but today I was peeing and looked on it and I thought that it's weird, 5 years and it didn't disappeared. I googled it and apparently... these lines mean that you have hormonal imbalance in your body, and it appears mostly in a pregnant women.

I think about it in my head and I'm utterly repulsed but I'm scared of the prospect of not being accepted by people as my gender.

I mean - I have a support network made of really good friends and I tell them how I feel about it and they obviously treat me properly and I don't get any flak from anyone but despite everything I just feel so awful and I, for some stupid reason, don't believe them even though everything tells me that I should. I'm not sure why I feel this way. I feel like they feel differently to how they treat me even though no evidence points towards how I feel.

She assures me she'll get in touch with some folks and we'll be good to go.  About two weeks later, I receive an email from the HR rep with an article from a website about the Trans individual in the other branch.  He gushes about how cool and understanding everyone has been, and, how he even got his own private bathroom stall.  I was pretty upset at this point.  I work in a very mysoginistic environment.  

I was scared to come out to people on my own, and HR seemed to really be dragging thier feet on the issue.  Fed up I decided to start telling my co-workers, one by one, that I would like them to start calling me by the proper pronouns and name.  One coworker I come out too, congratulates me but makes me pretty uncomfortable when he tells me ""Your gonna look pretty sexy"".  At this point, nothing has been done by HR.  I'm still being misgendered and deadnamed, including people I've come out too.  The man who called me sexy even goes as far as saying ""I bet you look great in a thong"" WHILE continuing to misgender me during conversations.  

Around the beginning of December I stopped using the restrooms at work, in all honesty out of fear for my safety, and if necessary I just went across the street to the single occupancy restrooms at Starbucks. I also tell them about the bizarre sexual comments and other crappy comments.  I have a meeting with them where they tell me that the head of the office has been contacted and he will tell ALL of the managers in the office, who will then tell the employees that work under them to inform them about my situation and to start using proper pronouns and referring to me as my correct name.  I tell them I'm uncomfortable in a misogynistic and unstable environment with lots of volatile people that I'm not yet comfortable with how the office would respond so I would appreciate a neutral restroom until the office is fully aware and accepting.  Clearly, with all that's gone on I feel it's not only essential for my safety but I figure since they made such a big stink about giving a trans man a private stall surely they would give a trans woman a neutral restroom, right?

Anyway, about a week after (supposedly) all of the managers have been told, two of them (who were walking together) each have a brief conversation with me.  They BOTH call me sir and deadname me in the conversation.  These are managers who not only should of known for a week at this point, but should be backing me up and telling the people under them about my situation.

At this point, I'm not really sure what to do.  I don't feel safe using the bathroom.  I'm not sure if people are taking me seriously.  I've had numerous shitty sexualized things to me that I've told to management with no action.  I'm currently on vacation, but frankly I'm scared to go back.

I should add that I live in a major american city with local and state laws (if I'm not mistaken) laws protecting gender identity in employment.  Any advice is appreciated, especially from any lawyers that might be potentially willing to help.  Thank you!

[deleted],asktransgender,This board seems pretty screwed up to me.,"So you people upvote those who accuse others of being hateful, when it's totally unwarranted. I feel unwelcome here. That's absolutely messed up. 

I was having a discussion with someone, and we disagreed about the definition of feminism. I understand I have an unpopular opinion, and I expect I'll get down voted for stating it sometimes. But disagreeing about a definition absolutely doesn't make me hateful towards women, and the fact that people think the other person should be upvoted for that is really enough reason to make me want to leave and never come back. So good bye all. It was nice being while it lasted, but that's too much. Someone essentially calls me a misogynist (one of the worst things someone can be imo), because we disagree about a defintion, and you praise them for it. Insults shouldn't be meet with praise."

DrywallJackson,asktransgender,It's been damn-near impossible for me to order hormones,"A couple weeks ago, I bought two $50 Visa prepaid gift cards. I'm doing all this secretly from my parents, so I can't use my bank account or anything. Since I got the cards, I've been unable to spend them anywhere hormone-related (but I know the cards work because I successfully added $10 to my Nintendo Eshop lol). I tried spending them at ADC, but they recently stopped accepting credit/debit cards. So I tried out wire transfer. I set up a Western Union account; it never accepted my cards. I finally decided that I can have Western Union send me one of their own cards, then I load it with money at a CVS or something. They sent the card a week ago and it still hasn't come. Earlier tonight, I tried setting up a Bitcoin account, but Coinbase keeps giving me some sort of error.
Anyone else have struggles similar to this? And what do you do to fix it? I'm really fucking tired of waiting."

genderfluidchick1989,asktransgender,Awkward sexuality questions [NSFW].,"I'm within the trans umbrella. I don't necessarily identify as a binary woman, but I know I sure don't identify as a cis man. There are just too many things that I know aren't what guys normally think that I think of myself.

One of them is my masturbation. I tuck my penis and masturbate as close as I can to if I was masturbating as a girl. I've taken to referring to this as a form of fingering, even though that feels a little wrong to call it that. Is this a weird thing to do?

Also, for what it's worth, I actually identify more with thinking of myself as a lesbian queer woman in terms of sexuality as opposed to anything male. Is this out of order? When I think of having sex, I picture myself with a woman, but I don't picture myself being ""the man"" or anything like that."

They often say stuff like ""I just can't accept it,"" etc (as though their acceptance is worth anything) or make uninformed statements about genetics... It's the same tired crap over and over again.

Even more infuriating is that if anyone responds in a way that they deem to be ""hostile"" they act high and mighty as though they're some intellectual renaissance man having a discussion in the *piazza* instead of someone on the internet mouthing off about things they don't understand.

The other Name I consider is the one my parents would have given me if I would have been born a girl but I'm not quite sure about that one.

Reon98,asktransgender,Is it normal for Cis people to question their own gender?,"This is probably something I should ask my therapist, but it's come up with my mother a few times. 

A few years back, my mother had a student at her Tae Kwon Do school who came out as transgender at the age of six. While I was very excited to hear this because yay! Someone is out and figured it out! My mom was more skeptical and cited that when she was six she wanted to be a boy. She said that she used to think being a boy was the best thing in the world and she wished she were a boy- but then she grew out of it.

Well, I distinctly remember having a similar period of time in my life. I remember asking my mother why I wasn't a girl at a very young age and receiving an answer to the effect of ""god wanted you to be a boy"" which I suppose was enough to shut me up because I don't remember it ever occurring again in my mind until I was about 10. 

In any case, is this just normal? Do all cis people at some point or another just think ""wow, I wish I was a boy/girl?"" Or is this something to legitimately dig into with myself?"

Jnoah12,asktransgender,FTM or a phase?,"Ever since I was 8, I had an odd feeling that I was different from the other kids. The vast majority of my friends were male, and I flat-out avoided the other girls because their hobbies and interests were boring. I didn't care about this at the time. I have a vague memory of myself wearing a boy's shirt and I recall looking at it and thinking this was the best day of my life, but unfortunately I never got the opportunity to pursue those feelings because I had no male siblings. I had a habit of sitting down with my legs spread out slightly, and my mom repeatedly told me to close them, though it felt uncomfortable to me. It
 
Later on when puberty came, I had breasts and I hated them with a passion. I began wearing large jackets in public in order to hide them, no matter the temperature. I then started looking at boys, but not really because of attraction, but because I badly wanted to look like them. Their hairstyles, their clothing styles, their flat chests- I refused to admit it to anyone, but I envied them badly. I despised looking in the mirror then, because all I saw was a girl trying to look like a boy and failing badly. I began to make fantasies about becoming male, and I scoured the Internet for said stories. Nearing the end of middle school, it became worse. Whenever I looked at an attractive man, I would get a strange happy feeling from imagining what it would feel like if I looked like them. I began crossdressing after watching a girl on a video do it successfully, but I soon stopped because when I looked in the mirror all I saw was a girl trying to look like a boy. 

I didn't have a name for these feelings, so I simply tried to ignore them. One day, I made the mistake of telling my mom it, and she brushed it off and told me I should just be a policewoman. Later in an argument she let the word slip: Transgender. I looked it up and it just seemed to fit. As the year slipped on, the male side of me got stronger. I felt an aversion to female articles of clothing (they wrapped around my waist and I hated it). I also avoided mirrors. By that point, I thought of myself as male, and to look at the mirror and see otherwise was deeply disappointing."

Just posting for some help. I'm an AFAB person who is nonbinary. I generally present as pretty masculine. 
I'm asking for help because I have a friend who is also nonbinary and who has massive struggles with people being really shit about it. 
My issue is that I want to understand more about their gender and the different ways of being nonbinary. They are also AFAB, and they are femme, and attracted to cis men. They don't really have any issues with being told they should act in a way which they don't want to, they act, dress, perform in every way as they are expected. Their major issues is around pronouns, which I respect, and I know they find it incredibly difficult being misgendered constantly. But I need some help understanding a gender and gender oppression which seems to be largely based on language? 

Its not that I think they're wrong, not nonbinary, less valid or anything at all. I just don't want to be part of the mass of people hurting them by not getting it. 

I get that my not getting it is likely largely to do with me, because I'm not fussed on pronouns. I get funny about titles and that but mostly people  just call me by my name, and I'm used to she. But when I've been not respected because of who I am it never been because of langauge. It's being spat on because of how I look, or hit because of being with my girlfriend, or being told to walk differently etc. I know my friend has a much harder time than me and is constantly furious or suicidal because of misgendering, so I need to get why and how language is such a big thing.

hello_myself,asktransgender,My dysphoria seems to be increasing after I realized I was trans,"Hey everyone!

So, as the tiltle says, some aspects of my dysphoria seem to be getting worse since I realized I was trans.

For instance, I never liked having body hair, but I could just ignore it and power through it and wear swim shorts to go to the pool/beach, and normal shorts on hot days, though more recently I only ecer wore pants except for pool/beach.

However, I realized I was trans this year, and I finally understood what I felt was dysphoria. It's really hot where I live right now (southern hemisphere, it's summer) and I just had a family meeting/dinner/party  for new year, and the thought of just taking my shirt off to use the pool and showing what little body hair I still have after shaving just feels terrible. Showing my body, honestly, feels bad, and it always has, though I could usually just do it, but now it's way too uncomfortable.

Idk if that even really makes sense... Can anyone relate?

The main issue stopping me from getting started has been depression/anxiety making me constantly put off making an appointment to actually go and do something about it.

Is it a bad idea to start self-medicating now to maybe give me a bit of a kick into actually doing something about it and making an appointment? Even if I were to go see my GP tomorrow my understanding is between waiting for specialist appointments and stuff it would take upwards of 3 months to start officially, which is a lot longer than I think I can wait.

My main concern is that it could make it hard to move onto official treatment if my levels are changed to begin with from self-medicating or that I might get into some sort of trouble in trying to start if I have been self-medicating previously.

pairofsafehands,asktransgender,Reading this sub makes me want to parent all of you.,"I'm not a dad yet, in fact I'm still pretty young. Although I cannot even promise my future kids this, I just think you people deserve these.

If you feel girly:

- I want to take you out for family picnic, and make you flower crowns.

- I want you to shop for beautiful, beautiful dresses, even the Disney dresses (not oftenly, because this is not the most interesting thing for me, and possibilly the other dad)

- I want you to be able to say ""But my dad tells me I'm beautiful!""

- I will gently french braid your hair.

- I will let you be comfortable saying no when things you are asked to do makes you feel uncomfortable. Too many women these days are taught that they are obliged to sacrifice themselves for others.

- I will not exclude you when I am teaching my other kids mechanics or basketball, but if you are not interested, you are free to go

If you feel guyly:

- I will not physically harm you just because you are physically tougher. When you get into your first fight, I'll ask you why you used violence, and challenge you that from today on, you need to find a better solution than violence; and teach you that true power is being able to use force, but choosing not to use it in situations not appropriate.

- I'll try to attend as many matches that you are in as I could.

- I will try to explain to you how something works when you take things apart to see how they work, and set appropriate limits about what you can touch, and what you cannot. (Instead of shouting at you beforehand)

- I'll take you out to your first Barber shop.

- I will share with you an expensive whiskey, before alcohol is just a party-mood-booster to you

- Despite feminists wanting equality, and they may not want to have their chairs pulled out for them anymore; I will teach you what it takes to be a gentleman, by being one myself.

- There'll be a PlayStation at home, or something else for video games they have in the future. I'll let you show me a few cool tricks that I don't know.

- I'll share with trans sons how to take care of yourselves when your boy part is ""under maintenance"" [Wear ""pad-holders"" (These https://goo.gl/images/WB6fxt ) beneath your underwear so you don't stain your pants; walk around often; cut caffeine; drink hot green tea; have panadol if your boy is starting to act up]

Everyone:

- I want to annoy all of you when you guys are on your first dates, and tell you guys that if that person plays with your heart, emotions or trust, I'll make them pay for it; and if you do that, I'll make you pay for it.

- I want you guys to feel so comfortable with your sexuality, you can just tell me right away ""Dad, I think I like this guy/girl/person, he/she/they is SO cool.""

- I want you guys to not have to fight for right pronouns, I'll supportively help you make an announcement during family dinners after you come out, and if any of our family members do not support you, I'll host another family dinner during festivals, which only allow non-transphobics to come. In the public, when someone mispronounce you, I'll find a way to call you ""son"" or ""girl"" on purpose, so they feel less foreign to call you the right pronounce you deserve.

- I'll make you love music by enjoying it myself. I'll play music instruments, and teach you how to play them if you ask me how, and sometimes dance with you, because dancing and music makes you feel good.

- I will read to you guys. Children books. Poems. Then when you get older I'll lend you guys my favorite books.

- I won't ridicule you when you make a terrible performance in front of the family. We can just causally laugh about the tiny mistakes you make TOGETHER, and let you do it again until you do it right, then celebrate with you!

- I will teach you that education (among other things) is not ""an end in itself"", but ""a means to an end"".

- I'll raise you to be a reasonably empathetic person, and that you don't have to be stone cold just to protect yourself from emotional abuses or emotional neglect.

- I'll make you all camp on your own in the wild for 4 days by the time you turn 18, it'd be a family tradition.

- I will take us out to volunteer as a family.

- I'll buy you a Burberry trench coat when you have your first ""stable job"", and you'll have to buy one for me in return when you have your first paycheck.

- When you face a trouble, I'll let you know that if you fail to find a solution on your own, I'll be there for you to take part in helping you sort your problems out. The least thing you need would be self-blame.

- I'll make sure that you are loved. No matter how you are born.

- The society is crude, I cannot protect you from all that. I am just an ordinary man. All I could do is to provide a shelter for you, when what happens outside our door is too much, and take care of you, until you are able to stand on your feet again to go to wherever you are going.

I am not a perfect dad, even if I have done all that, but I just wanna let you guys have this. I wish I could be there for you guys when you had your childhood. Quite many of my trans friends do not have supportive families, so they struggle to get intimate with healthy people, and end up in dysfunctional or toxic relationships, exhausting themselves, and find themselves giving up faith in families. I have been there, and it doesn't have to work that way. I wish all of you a good life, I wish I could make life better for all of you (and sadly I couldn't), just don't give up on life, and remember to enjoy all the small things in life!"
LiterallyEmily,asktransgender,Non-binary people of asktg: what adjectives do you like/hate when being acknowledged as attractive?,"I was surfing timelines/passing and it got me thinking.

Colorora_,asktransgender,How can I feel less feminine/how do I figure out what I am?,"Hi there! I'm a 13 year old ""girl"" who is currently questioning ""her"" gender identity. Basically, I just hate being a girl, I hate looking like one, I hate being seen as one, I hate everything about it. As someone who has always lived by the ""if you don't like something about your life, change it"" mantra, I've been struggling with this. I am bisexual, and have identified as so since I was eleven, but I always thought for sure I was a girl. Lately? Not so much..

I came out to my mother about it tonight and she was really accepting, more than I thought she would be. We talked about getting me a chest binder, but we don't know if it'd be safe, seeing as how my body is still developing and all. She's researching it. But other than that, I don't know how I can feel less feminine. 

I used to think I knew a lot about how trans people go about transitioning, but I don't know where to start! It's all so overwhelming and I want it all to change ASAP. Does anybody here know how I can make myself feel less feminine? I'm willing to do anything, recommend me certain types of clothes if you want. Preferably a more androgynous look than masculine though. 

Secondly, I'm looking for something to call myself. I know a lot of people are always like ""you don't need labels!"" But like,,, I want them? I want to define myself clearly, not just to others, but to myself. I was wondering if anybody could help me figure this out? Here's basically how I feel: I hate being a girl, but I don't wanna be a boy, but sometimes I wake up and I'm like ""damnnnnn I wanna put on a dress and makeup and be super pretty today"". And other days I'm like ""can I just say no to gender????"" or ""Can I be every gender???"" 

Is this genderfluid? Or is it something else? I never feel like a boy. Do you think they/them pronouns would fit the bill?

TL:DR I wanna feel less like a boy and I wanna know if I'm genderfluid, any tips/advice?"

Mtsukino,asktransgender,Well some hardships,"This is my first ever major post on Reddit. But I feel it's time to start talking openly to people even if it is just the internet.
Im a 26 mtf pre T and just coming out. This Friday I am seeing a psychologist and going to go through that.
So my hardships are similar to probably most of you all. I told my mother of how I'm feeling internally and how I don't feel comfortable with myself for the past 20 so years of my life.
My mother who I thought really was supportive must have been going through some problems because she told my father who now thinks of me as being highly mentally ill and would rather see me fight these feelings and to stay as what I am. My plan was to eventually tell him when I had my courage high enough.
Like how the fuck can someone just tell you that you're fucked up when you already know what you're going through isn't their norm? After hearing him say all this I felt like my world started to collapse and I was just numb. I came to them for support mainly just emotional. I have my own job as a programmer and privately discussed this with my boss and a coworker. Thankfully they are quite supportive of me in what ever I chose. Or at least so they say.
I just feel very lost and hurt inside because I thought that people who were the closest to me would at least try to understand but it seems I was too hopeful and should have seen this coming. How did you ladies or men deal with this? How do you try to help them understand? Are they experiencing the stages of loss?  I thought I was following steps right but I think I stumbled and fell. The pain hurts. It hurts a lot ...
So with or without them.. I have to see this for myself. If the world puts me as an outcast then so be it. At least I will finally love who I am both physically, emotionally mentally. Hopefully things with this psychologist will go ok, I've only ever been to one once before for an unrelated thing (losing a friend).
Thank you for listening.

ghostathogwarts,asktransgender,How can I stop being transgender?,"I realized it in middle school, that I wanted to be a boy. But when I mentioned that I might be a boy to a friend back then, she shot me down so I didn't think of it until high school. During high school, it was generally a awful and confusing time. Tenth grade was possibly the worst year, cos the entire year I tried really hard at ""looking like/being a girl"" and I just felt anxious and awful the entire time. 11th grade I identified as agender, but that also didn't feel right and made me feel horrible. 12th grade, I started going by he/him pronouns and the name ""Alex,"" which was a name I've wanted to be called since back in middle school. But I'm here now, hopefully starting college in the fall, and I still go by Alex, I still use he/him pronouns. All throughout 12th grade I said I was genderfluid, but I think I really am a boy. And I do and don't want to be at the same time. My family will hate me. Transitioning would be impossible. I don't want this, I don't want to be like this anymore. I don't want to end up disppointing my mom or anyone. So how can I stop feeling like this? How do I just feel comfortable being a girl? "
4thKaramazov,asktransgender,Just Wanted to Share This Experience With Anyone Who is Currently Unsure,"I want to preface this by saying that I am not a licensed therapist or psychiatrist. I'm also assuming that this is a very rare scenario, but I wanted to share it with anyone who is currently questioning because it really opened my eyes and cleared things up for me a lot.

I also would like to say that I am in no way trying to discredit people who actually experience gender dysphoria. Following this experience, I feel I've developed a deep sense of sympathy (maybe even empathy) for transgender people.

Anyway, following puberty I had gotten into transgender fiction. It was a sexual thing for me at the time, and I never really and truly considered becoming a female (except in fantasy, if that makes any sense). It was more the concept of being forced into becoming a female that got me off. 

Fast forward 5 years or so... My girlfriend at the time shows me the movie ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" and I absolutely loved it. It really resonated with me, so much so that a few days later I was suddenly struck with this overwhelming feeling that I might be transgender. Little things I used to do as a kid that I once wrote of nonsense suddenly presented to me a glaring signs that I wanted to be female (growing my hair out when I was 10, wearing my moms shoes, etc...). It hit me like a ton of bricks, and for about a month it was all I could think about.  

I felt utterly disconnected with the world and the people around me. It wasn't so much that I felt out of place in my body; I just had a strong desire to experience life from a female perspective. I felt as though if I could not be female, I could never be happy. It got so bad that I started seeing a therapist.

After about a year, my therapist and I came to the conclusion that I was not actually transgender, at least not in the sense that I really wanted to be female. What was actually bothering me was my inability to express my true self. In other words, I was happy with my body, but I was not happy with how I was being forced to present it. 

This didn't really make sense to me at first, but I tried my best to follow her advice. I tried wearing girl's underwear, letting my girlfriend put makeup on me, and I started performing in a RHPS shadowcast. All of this helped, then one night (I was no longer with my girlfriend at this point) I hooked up with a girl I had met at university. I don't want to go into any details, but she took total control of the situation. 

The next day, just as suddenly as my feelings of uncertainty came on, they evaporated. I loved my body and and I felt totally comfortable in my own skin. After about a week, I came to the conclusion that I was very submissive in the bedroom. I believe I had been confusing my desire to be dominated with a desire to be female.

5 more years later, and nothing has changed. I still feel very comfortable in my body, and I have totally embraced my nature. 

I guess my point is that there's a difference between enjoying things and behaviors that society views as ""girly,"" and actually wanting to be female. At least for me there was. 

At the end of the day, you are who you are, and the society you live in is nothing but a (very persistent) construct. As soon as I accepted that, and stopped giving a damn about how I was ""supposed"" to dress or act, I realized a much better understanding of myself. 

I hope this post might clear things up for people who may be experiencing similar feelings. If your situation sounds at all similar to mine, my advice to you would be to find a therapist that you get on well with and do some serious soul searching. You never know what you may find.

AmireallyaTransGirl,asktransgender,"I watched a programme last night on transgender people and there was anti transgender professor on it, and the things she said are making me doubt! Help!!!","Someone in my family was telling me less then an hour ago that they watched this programme last night about transgender people. There was one person who was an expert on transgender people and he said things like, being transgender isn't a mental illness (which I completely agree with in every way!!), but he also apparently said that some people can think they are transgender even when they aren't. Now, this scared me because I am not sure if I am transgender or not.

Then there was his opponent who was talking about regret, she even had people on her side saying that they do regret transitioning (one said that they wished that psychologists had looked deeper into his case and found out what was really wrong with him, because he said he is not forced to live as a man, when he just wants to go back to being his assigned gender, which is female) and she even said that there was apparently no proof that there is a difference between the male and female brain (even though there is a TON of scientific and psychological proof to say otherwise that there is a difference and that transgender men have cisgender men's brains and that transgender women and cisgender women's brains!).

As a questioning transgender woman, this raised alot of questions and really just intensified my doubt. As I was being told what was said I was thinking things like, ""what if I am just thinking I'm a transgender woman because of traumatic events in my life"", ""what if I do regret transitioning into a woman"", ""what if I am just transitioning into a woman because of the cultural advantages"", ""what if I'm just mentally ill"", ""I don't really feel dysphoric over being a male, so maybe this is just a fetish"", ""maybe I am just attracted to the female gender role and not actually being woman, as I have been told this before"", ""what if I just want male attention from men and there why I'm doing this? I mean, I do love male attention"", ""what if I'm just a fetishist"". These doubts are driving me nuts!! What do they all sound like to you?"
FayeDeviant,asktransgender,Is it possible to become used to living with gender dysphoria?,"**Please read it all before replying**

So I have two friends that are very likely experiencing gender dysphoria (both MAAB), but both insist that they have no desire to transition. One cross-dresses sometimes and seems to really enjoy it. When I asked him if he ever thought about transitioning, he admitted to questioning for over a decade but says he is happy as a man. The other said that he would have transitioned if he knew it were possible 13 years ago but that he has no desire to transition now. He also insists he is comfortable living as a man. 

So the question is are they repressed or is what they are saying actually possible? I showered them with links and resources on being transgender and transitioning, but they do not seem interested in learning more.

I wonder sometimes if the reason they talk to me is because they are flirting with the idea of transitioning, but that makes me worry that seeing me fail at transition is discouraging them from even trying. I will have been on HRT for two years soon and am still miserable, so I worry they see me and ask themselves what the point is. 

I have also been doubting myself thinking that, if I were not mentally ill, I might be able to tolerate living as a man and not feel like I need to transition. I am very depressed. In contrast, they seem pretty happy and mentally healthy.

Please help me understand.

JessieBear512,asktransgender,Trans For Wrong Reasons?,"I know that no one can tell you that you're trans or not, but I'm just trying to reason with my thoughts before deciding on pursuing a GT about whether I'm MTF. I don't really have much dysphoria as a guy apart from just feeling awkward. I really dislike being in pictures, but I don't know if that's general dysphoria or gender-related. I have a past that involves dressing secretly (but not consistently), wanting to be the boy that the girls decide to put make-up on, etc

However, I feel that a lot of what I want from it is shallow. Things like wanting long hair that I can dye and style, being able to experiment with all of the different make-up, not being limited in what kind of clothing I can wear, etc. Just all these ways to express myself that I feel restricted in by being male. But I'm turning 26 soon (I know it's never too late to transition) and feel that a lot of those things described above happen more in youth, and I worry that by the time I'd pass, I wouldn't get to fulfill those roles for myself. I feel shallow in my wants because I'm drawn to the outward aspects and social constructs of being a woman, but don't know that I'd feel right identifying as a woman the rest of my life. 

If anyone could help shed some light on my feelings or share some of their own experiences, it would be much appreciated. From what I've seen on this sub the past 2 weeks, you're all quite wonderful people so I'm really sorry if anything I said offends anyone, I'm still trying to learn more about the trans world as I go.

worriesthrowaway,asktransgender,Did I hit a vein? Really scared.,"So I gave myself an IM injection in the thigh earlier, and....really scared I accidentally injected into a vein.

I pushed the needle in slowly (because I'm still getting past needle fears), injected, and....after I finished injecting, while the needle was still in my thigh, I saw a single little bubble of blood float up into the syringe.

Should I be worried? Is this a sign that I injected into a vein or something? I've never had a blood bubble float up *while the syringe was still sitting in my thigh* before and it's kind of freaking me out a lot.

I didn't get the burning oh-god-i'm-going-to-die feeling Google says injecting into a vein feels like, just dry heaving and coughing a little (and that might have been from nerves idk) and shakiness, but I'd still really appreciate it if somebody could tell me if i should be worried or not. :s"
nmze,asktransgender,Unsure whether to take hormones?,"I'm looking for a little bit of advice.

I'm an FtM living in the UK and getting treatment for my dysphoria on the NHS. I was hoping to get started on hormones soon, but after speaking to the clinician today, she said it's basically an all-or-nothing thing: I can commit completely to it for the rest of my life or not have it at all.

Originally, I wanted to only take it for a little while to get some of the effects of T, primarily the lowering of my voice.

Things like getting hairy, spotty and smelly really don't appeal to me. I guess I'm a little vain like that. I don't want to have to deal with all the maintenance that comes with all that stuff. The males in my family are predisposed to male-pattern baldness too, and that's something I really don't want.

Other effects though, such as increased musculature and genital growth are positives for me. 

I feel incredibly confused and stuck in this situation. I can honestly say that I don't think I NEED hormones to be happy, and as it stands me being pre-everything, I pass 99% of the time anyway. But I might be denied surgeries which I really know that I do want if I don't take hormones.

I just kind of get the feeling that nothing is going to move forward unless I play the NHS's game and follow their definition of what transitioning means.

Trying to rationalise things in my head, yeah, hair can be laser treated and spots can be tamed. I'm pretty sure the vast majority of guys go bald, so I should stop complaining and just accept it.
A lot of good things can happen from taking hormones: my periods will stop, I'll be able to build muscle far faster than what I've managed in the past four months, my hips should look slimmer thanks to the fat redistribution. Heck, I might even get a nice luscious beard out of it.

I figure if I was that unsure about hormones, then I wouldn't have been so upset when the clinician said I should wait a few more months and have a couple of therapy sessions. Then again that could've also been down to the fact that I'd discovered I couldn't take hormones the way I'd imagined and just the general feeling of pressure from wanting to make a decision.

Anyone else felt like this?
Has anyone here had experience of NHS treatment?

Thanks for your time guys."

GabiCap,asktransgender,"""Realizations are the worst"" -Liz Lemon and could it be a phase?","I go through phases. That's the one thing I keep going back to when I imagine telling my dad. Sure he has a live and let live attitude as of late (not so much when growing up). But that change is expected after some personal stuff we've been through.

Anyways.... I go through phases. When I was young I thought I was gay and came out. Got a bad reception from my parents and went back to girls. Though now, 10 years later, I identify as bi. I go through hobbies. I spent a couple years as a Mormon and loved just about every minute of it and believed it was a part of me.

Given things like this, I can't help but think it's a phase. Heck, my dysphoria and thoughts of being trans come in phases. Maybe I'm fooling myself I say because of this.

And to realizations...

I ended up spending a couple days snowed in at work. On the dangerous track back home all I could think was ""I want to dress up, I want to be Gabi tonight."" I didn't realize this or feel this until the ride home, but part of me felt relieved to be heading home to be alone and not have to fake anything.

Didn't even need to dress up when I got home, so it's weird that I feel better. Maybe I'm just a home body.

So as you can see, I have realizations (that make me think oh, crap!) but then go back to it's just a phase or I'm faking and there's got to be a better answer, like depression or anxiety or loneliness.

Can anyone else relate to any of this."

* I had the jacket on when I male failed.
* I came out last Tuesday and have a Sara nametag and everyone calls me Sara now at work. 
* I wear no makeup at work because I still feel silly wearing makeup and it makes me more shy.
* I shaved last night and my facial hair has been absolutely destroyed by HRT alone anyway (I'd say a 50% overall reduction with the 50% that hasn't dissapeared being lighter and softer)
* I usually use my female voice at work but today I was having a **very** bad day and was floating back towards my natural voice which has naturally gotten a little softer and higher (still sounds kind of male)
* My hair has highlights

So anyways after all those details you probably didn't need: The customer I was helping was waiting for her drink I was making and she made small-talk with me and then we chatted a bit more and she said ""Have a good day ma'am."" and I just stood there dumb-founded and slightly blushing with my mind completely blank. She must've thought I didn't hear her because she looked at my name tag and said ""Have a good day Sara."" and I sputtered out a ""Thank you, you too."" to her.

Rose_Hawk,asktransgender,A story of just not caring about staring :),"Hello there, so quick bit of context for the story.
 - Openly Transgender (MtF)
 - Not on HRT (NHS sucks so hard)
 - Have bad anxiety
 - Have a slender not really guyish frame
 - Not great at writing so sorry for the typos and grammar

So I went to college for my course and my college has a bloody strict policy of gender and overall equality for student in the good way, people who are offensive/disrespectful get kicked out. On the day I was wearing;
 - An awesome new coat I got which weirdly makes it look like I have boobs (Magic wonder coat of dreams)
 - Women's skinny jeans because HOLY COW the are more comfortable that the male equivalent some how.
 - Pink and black butterfly scarf because it's pwetty :3
 - Black slouch beanie hat
 - Red plaid shirt 
So overall a rather feminine look in personal opinion. Anyway back to the story.

The room my course is in is at the very end of the corridor so I stared to walk to it and right before the room was a group of ""Men"", stereotypical douchebags (Jocky but ech people). As I walked through them they when silent and after finding out I was early I stood against the wall and waited. Then all I could see out the corner of my eye is 8 guys trying to sneakily stare at me with all the subtlety of a 3 year old and I just sighed, shook my head and said out loud while laughing ""Fucking hell"". A minute passed and then they had to find an ice breaker of "" Politics right?"" Followed by the most awkward forced laughs to start talking again.

It has been so funny watching peoples reactions to seeing me in women's clothes and I hope in some small way this could help someone to realise that really if your comfortable who the fuck cares.

Is that a reason to hold off on HRT? Was anyone else unsure before HRT?"
TheLivingExperiment,asktransgender,Long term post-SRS question (i.e. 3+ years later),"So there was a recent thread in here about how to clean a vagina post-sex. In there there was a link to a paper that talked about neo-vagina tissue becoming more like natal-vaginal tissue over time (although not metaplasia changes, i.e. not actually the same tissue). But it suggests that over time a neo-vagina will have more natural self-lubricating properties to an extent. Certainly not to cis-female levels, but much more so than I'm seeing. I know this is highly subjective, but am curious of two things: 

* 1) Are there any more recent studies/papers than [this 1996 one](http://www.gendercare.com/library/italiano_paper1.html) or [this 2007 one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17992150) that look into long term post-op neo-vaginal changes?

* 2) For those of you who have had SRS 3 or more years ago can you say if it's changed from the 1 year post to now? Also what surgeon and how long ago was it if you don't mind sharing. "
teacoaster,asktransgender,FTM(questioning) dysphoria questions,"Hello,
I've been questioning my gender for sometime, and to cut a long story short I get dysphoria with my hair which I recently cut it to look more masculine/androgenous which made me super happy for no reason I could think of other than gender dysphoria being lifted. As well as my breasts (but not everyday, same with my jaw line). However I have never had it with my period. Is this normal? can a trans guy experience no dysphoria with a period?"

Wth 6 people in the room I don't think its possible that theres anyway to guarantee that one of  them would not go tell an acquaintance about the participants they met and so on. The therapist doesn't think so and emphasized that it would stay discreet. I would reallly like to get some opinions on this. Thank you."
NenaDaconte,asktransgender,Passing in a very unpleasant manner,"An old guy came to flirt with me in a post office. I was so grossed out by the old dude that I used my most masculine voice and said : "" I'm a lad, a gent, not a chick ""

I still feel really gross because of the old perv. He was the kind that sleeps in a van and drinks 24/7.
Worst thing was that the lady in the post office was a class mate of mine three years ago. I was so afraid that she would notice something.

I never want to transition socially I guess, I'm happy being a transfeminine boy. A pretty boy. 

On moments like that I really hate womanhood : pervy dudes need to leave me alone. As a guy no one ever flirted with me and now everyone is way too gentle and guys seam to read a "" fuckable "" sign on my head. I love being read as a woman and look like a woman but I'm a tomboy and I don't like the fact that people seam to sexualise me subconsciously. I don't like the barbie-ish treatment.

UnknownSpecimen97,asktransgender,Pregnancy... [Possible TW],"I don't know where to begin... I've been feeling like utter shit recently.

It feels like, no matter where I go, all I hear about is people getting pregnant. I was reading a manga called Kyoukai no nai Sekai, I won't go into too much detail but in one of the pages, the transwoman mentioned how she could get pregnant unlike ""old surgeries"" (This is based in the future by the way.)

I'm not sure if it even makes sense. I'm just so sick and tired of feeling this way. I feel robbed, derived of something that definitely should've belonged to me. I'm tired of being reminded that it's not possible, that I'm not a real woman.

Nothing makes me consider suicide more than this, it hurts so much that I will never be able to concieve. It hurts that I won't be able to maybe carry my boyfriend's child one day. It just hurts... so much.

How in the hell can I just accept it? How can I just let go of this grief? Is there anyone else who feels the same?

Sorry for rambling, I just really need some support right now."
SunAndStorm,asktransgender,Does anyone else feel that your needs aren't as important as soothing the people around you?,"When I was very young, I used to dream of being a girl - nothing particularly painful or sad at that point, but I used to take my mother's clothing and wear it occasionally, that kind of thing. I hit puberty, and suddenly I have all of these feelings of sadness and loneliness, and my anxiety shoots through the roof. I worked out that I was trans within a few months, and that I desperately needed to transition or I was going to go crazy. I was about 14-15.

I tried to tell my parents several times, but every time I did they just responded with arguments why I shouldn't. My mother once told me that I could get a girlfriend 'if only I would stop telling everyone that I wanted to be a girl'. She expressed sadness over the fact that I already found it hard to find a partner, and at the same time that my dating pool would be vastly diminished because I'm trans. I already felt terrifyingly lonely, and being told repeatedly that I wasn't good enough because I'm trans was awful.

When I told my father, all he seemed to be worried about was that we wouldn't be able to do things together any more. That people would hate me because of sexism and transmisogyny. He told me that I was selfish for hiding my sadness when I was away from home at uni, and he told me to be careful of what I told my mother, because she worried about me.

I got stuck at a single sex school, so transitioning there felt like a terrible idea. When I came out to my best friend, all he could do was shrug and tell me 'good luck with that' and never mentioned it again. There was a culture of calling each other 'gay' and making jokes about transfolk, so I suppressed myself there too.

When the time came to choose my new name, I felt hamstrung because my given name was in remembrance of a family member. I didn't know how to feminise it, and I didn't have the courage to take a different name because I knew it meant so much. Additionally, my partner at the time expressed sadness and anxiety at having to remember a new name - so instead of taking the name I'd wanted and dreamed of having for such a long time, I took a feminisation of my given name in that regard as well. I felt so little ability to stand up for myself for fear of ending up truly alone.  

What about me? What about my mental health? Why do I have to tiptoe around everyone else's perceptions of me before they'll even try to understand and support me? I'm exhausted and I just want a hug. I'm so tired.

tl;dr - I never feel like I can be myself and want things for myself because I'm trans and I fear being very lonely."

FreyaAsikari,asktransgender,Came Out to Friends Last Week as a Transman- Wanting to Make My Partner Most Comfortable,"After a long time coming, I came out to a good majority of my friends and some family last week through Facebook. I've been struggling for years with my identity, but I have some incredibly non-supportive parents that I had to deal with growing up. I still haven't told them any of this (other than I did chop off all 18 inches of my hair, lol), but that's another matter for another day. The friends and family that do know have been super supportive, and I really haven't had any issues with anyone so far. However, what I'm most concerned about now is my partner. He's a cis bisexual male, we've been together for almost five years, and he has been more than 110% supportive of my decisions. I really couldn't have asked for a better person to be with. I know that coming out as trans is a personal journey, but I feel like in order to be a good partner, I need to make sure that he is totally satisfied and doing well, too. Any tips or suggestions from the group about keeping our relationship solid, and how to deal with your partner coming out? Thank you in advance!
Edit: One thing that I *do* worry about is that he's going to miss my more ""feminine"" side (even though I didn't have much of one to begin with). What can I do to combat this complete loss of femininity?

Well I've been thinking about coming out at work which is the last area of my life in still closeted. 

I work in the retail side of a large drugstore chain and they have great policies (100 on HRC CEI) but my store is in kinda an odd place. 

My store manager is leaving and I'm the senior supervisor below him, and I haven't come out because we had an issue with one employee (who is universally disliked) calling another cis but feminine guy a faggot. That was reported to HR but we've seen no action and the manager is checked out and isnt too interested in disciplining said employee, because before this he was his choice for promotion.

While I've thought about leaving I'd need to be able to drive to another place which I can't do for awhile and I can walk to this place and every other employee is supportive.

Do you all think I should come out before he leaves to establish it before anyone else or wait to see what the new person is like?"

At the moment I'm just out to my sister and brother an planning on coming out to my parents in another week.

My sister and brother were quite supportive but also really concerned for how our parents will react and the impact it will have on them. It's not likely that my parents are going to take the news well, but it's so important for me as well as my siblings to tell them.

Another issue my siblings have raised is whether they can tell their close friends. In my sister's case, her two closest friends, and for my brother his housemate. I'm really apprehensive about this and quite conflicted, I don't want to unreasonably burden them with 'hiding' this from their closest friends (because we all know what that feels like), but on the other hand I'm not ready and fear that I'm going to lose control of my coming out process (one person tells another, tells another, tells 50).

To try and maintain control, I've insisted that if they really need to tell their friends that I want to be the one to tell them. I'm worried though that I'm going to be pressured to do this before I'm ready.

This is all so daunting and I'm feeling so out of control of it all. For those who have been through this, do you have any advice that would help?"
[deleted],asktransgender,Should i take a study break ?,"Hi ! I'm a french trans girl who started her medical transition 2 months ago, and who started law school 3 months ago. I'm turning 20 in 3 days. 

Transition is such a stressful, exciting and depressing thing... stressful because I have papers to fill (for my surgeries, for my name and gender change) and tons of things to do, exciting because I can't stop daydreaming about me being a complete woman, and depressing because I'm totally alone with no friends nor support and have to wait and deal with my dysphoria... 

I feel like I'm not stable enough in my head to study. I have no motivation for this right now. My exams for the first semester started this week and I know that it's gonna be a disaster... and hormones making me all emotional and depressed is the icing on the cake. 

Plus, my parents don't know for my transition and they wouldn't understand why I'm doing this. I don't have a close relationship with them... I even plan on cutting ties in the future. But I still don't want to be a disappointment while in their house. 

So, should I take a break ? Is there trans people who did this ? "

ReadMyIntelligence,asktransgender,"Thinking about getting castrated to become calmer, more responsible, and asexual","I desire more control over myself and I want to eliminate testosterone and estrogen to gain that. I want to become asexual, and lose emotions like anger and desire. 

I also want to become a leader, which may or may not be compatible with castration. I imagine that a person with less emotion and more control over themselves would be a better leader, am I right? I'm not aiming to be charismatic, but zen-calm, stable as rock. Impossible to buy, impossible to scare.

I may not be able to imagine what it's like to not have these hormones, since I have a chronic excess. I may become a victim of ""The grass is always greener"".

Is it how I imagine it? That I would be calmer, with less desire, but have more self-control and be able to function better? But there is another thing, since one is less daring afterward, is there also more fear and anxiety? Or less? And how about my assertiveness?

I guess the only sensible question to ask is, do you feel better after castration?"
gambutt,asktransgender,Could I be trans?,"I know no one here can diagnose me or tell me straight that I am - that's up to me to figure out, and I'm sure I will in time. It's just that I don't have anyone to talk to about this. If I could, I would talk to a therapist, but since I'm still a teenager, I'd have to speak to my parents about it first, and I'm honestly terrified to do that. I'd just like to hear an honest opinion from someone with experience in order to put my mind at rest.

I'm AFAB, but I haven't always felt comfortable presenting as a girl. Sure, as a little kid I wore dresses and skirts and liked pink and stuff, but something still felt wrong. I didn't really ""get"" the girls, and preferred to play with the boys. I remember sitting awake one night and wondering if something was wrong, if I was a boy raised as a girl to connect better with my sisters. That doesn't really make sense, but it's what I believed for a while, and I played along with it.
I used to try peeing standing up (and mastered it!) and made all my toys boys, as well most characters I made up for games and stories. I always played the boy in pretend games and video games. Once I accidentally bought a boy's shirt and the sense of excitement I felt was unreal when I realised. I remember once really wanting a pair of boy's pants, and while my parents said I could have them, we tried them on and they fit wrong and I was devastated.

When I realised my theory was impossible, I shoved these thoughts deep, deep inside myself, and tried to live normally as a girl (aside from getting my hair cut off). I knew what being trans was growing up, but for some reason I thought only trans women existed. I was thirteen when I met trans boys over the internet, and it all started again. That was almost three years ago now.
It's worse this time, though. I hate looking at my chest - I even avoid showering a lot of the time. I dress in mostly men's clothes and wear hats to cover up my hair (which is short but not as short as I want it to be). I don't really see a future for myself as an adult woman, but I still have doubts.
Almost all of my friends are LBGT+, and because all (except one) see me as a cis straight girl, I wonder if I'm making up all these feelings and memories so I can fit in with them. I spend a lot of time reading about trans issues, and I'm scared that I'm just easily influenced and that I just think I'm trans.

And even if I am, coming out terrifies me. My mother is accepting, but might think I'm too young to know yet. My father isn't intolerant, but isn't exactly understanding or accepting, either. What if I cause a rift between them? And my sisters a understanding, too, but I'm anxious about making things weird between us. We're pretty close, and I don't want to upset them. One of my friends came out as ftm trans recently, and he's kind of petty, and I'm scared he'll think I'm just copying him.

Is there a chance that I'm just pretending or have just been led along? I'm sorry for posting this here when it's such a long-winded and stupid question, but I don't know where else to go."
asdfpoiuqwermnbvzxcv,asktransgender,My brother is trans?,"So my 18 year old brother just told me he was trans. We were talking about trans people and he just said that he's sure he is trans. He told me about how he looks at women and just imagines what it must be like to look like that. He told me about his dysphoria and how he sees himself as a woman in the future. He also told me he is still into girls, and not attracted to guys in any way. This is all so confusing to me, I know that gender and sexuality are two totally separate things, but it just makes it so much more difficult to understand the way he is feeling. It was a total shock, considering there are absolutely no feminine aspects about his life. He plays football, every single one of his friends are male, he plays PS4 with his pals all the time, he's a typical 18 year old lad. I will obviously support him through everything, and support him when he tells our parents. I have no doubt they'll be accepting, but I think they will be even more shocked than me. Its been about a week since he told me and I still have no idea what to say to him or what to even think about. I honestly keep thinking its a dream until he mentions something about it again. 

I guess i'm just looking for people who have went through the same stuff, or could help me better understand the way he is feeling. 

(edit - Sorry if I have offended anyone with my use of male pronouns here. I dont want to go round calling him female pronouns when he's asked me not to tell anyone. When i am with him im trying to be as gender neutral as possible and avoiding using any, I think that is the best thing I can do until I talk to him about it )

EmilyGS,asktransgender,Seeking Friendship CT,"Hey everyone I'm 25 and transgender (mtf) form Waterbury CT, USA. I'm finally comming to terms with being trans after denying it for so long. I'm just seeking friendship with trans friendly people or people going through the same thing as my current friends probably won't be accepting. I just want friends I can trust. That is all."
JediDalek,asktransgender,"As I transition, I've remained a bit more conservative/religious than most of the LGBT friends who have supported me. Am I the only one who worries that those differing views might isolate me at some point? (Somewhat long post)","I can't remember if I've posted about this before but, like a few others here, I was raised in a fairly conservative Christian family; something that was responsible for a fair bit of denial before I realized yes, this was who God made me to be and I should transition.
Unlike many I've talked to, though, when I changed my views on gay/trans/etc. people (mostly due to, y'know, realizing I was those things...) I tried to hold on to most of the other religious/political things I was taught simply because they still made much more sense to me than the alternative.

Now, this might sound silly, but I sometimes feel like this prevents me from ""connecting"" with the Trans community at large as much as I'd like. I'm not here to debate anything; if you think what you think you pry have a good reason even if I don't like it, but the fact is that just due to the kind of nature of transition/where our society is regarding it, most of the people who decide to transition/be active or open in the LGBT community tend to be ""coming from"" a worldview somewhat different than what I come from.

For the most part, this isn't a huge issue. We all have the same struggle at large, share experiences, want the same kind of freedom/recognition/affirmation etc. and it's great to have people where we all ""get"" what each other are going through.
But, I just sometimes feel like that's all we have in common. We can always be friends &amp; support each other, but when it comes time to really ""stand"" for something, I tend to feel... distant? So many of the queer/trans friends I have care really passionately about things I kinda disagree with or just don't feel that strongly about and I'm sure they would disagree with or be confused by an equal number of the things I care about. Again, it's not like we can't be friends but I just tend to feel like this middling person who has to choose whether I want to share one side of myself or the other, never really having anyone I can fully be ""me"" around. Even most of the LGBT-affirming churches I know of tend to not quite ""click"" with me.
And it's not like I'm the only rightish-leaning or Christian trans person out there. I know this. It just feels sometimes like there are probably very few people out there who I could really stand with and not feel like the odd person out.
I just would really like to know, has anyone else felt like this? Am I being too arrogant/picky about my relationships? Again, I do have some great friends in my life. I just wish our diverging ideals didn't make me feel like that friendship came with a cutoff point is all.

EDIT: I attempted to be vague simply to avoid debate, but I see that kinda got turned around on me. Just to clarify, I consider myself more Libertarian as far as American parties go than ""far-right""/Republican/whatever. I still don't support Trump, HB2, etc. I just also tend to favor personal/religious freedom, free markets, etc. stuff that really doesn't directly relate to transition, but seems to have certain common positions among LGBT  people.

GirlygirlKristi,asktransgender,"Looking for resources covering two things: the science behind being transgender, and covering the topic of being transgender as it relates to religion (particularly Christianity)","I'm slowly working on compiling information to have handy for family, friends, co-workers, etc. when I come out.

Does anyone else have sources they would be able/willing to share? Medically, resources from PubMed would be amazing! I'm in the process of sorting through studies listed there, but when I search transgender I get thousands of hits - it's going to take time to go through it all. Along with gathering information to have handy for presenting to people I know, I'm kind of hoping we can get a solid list of sources together for all of us to have access to that we can use to educate others."

Outside of that, I feel like I vicariously live the lives of my trans women friends, and the lives of the people on /r/transtimelines.

I say most of the time I feel like a girl and then ask myself ""Do I really, though?"" as an impulsive thought.. Surely, if I wasn't trans I wouldn't even be needing to have this anxious inner-monologue with myself. Maybe I'm just subconsciously tryign to find a way to cling to the past out of fear of change.. 

But I want to change, I want my life to get better. I don't want to be back at square one, feeling depressed and out of place. I look at times I've felt relaxed as a male and told myself ""Oh, see?"" but then I remember in most of those cases it was drink that had relaxed me.

lyaa55,asktransgender,trans with dignity and feeling like a jerk..,"I'm like 4 months into transition, and it's really going well for me.  Feel desirable in dating, like it hasn't impacted work life yet (i'm not out there yet), and accepting family and friends so far..

But I still get so frustrated.  I feel like i'm too proud and have too much internalized transphobia.  I hear about other trans women, who are friends of mine, who get photographed without their permission, get stared at, etc.  And I just feel, ""I won't let that happen.""  But I know it's not necessarily a choice.  I feel too fucking proud and like i'm a really exceptional person (and starting transitioning has actually made me feel much more that way) SO I won't STAND to get gawked at!  Or discriminated against!

Now, I think i'm cute, although not at all passing.  I'm comfortable not presenting overtly femme, so stares and harassment haven't really been a problem for me.  Right now, i'm pretty comfortable being really part time, and just ~telling people~ my gender, and not being worried if service people and acquaintances and people in professional contexts gender me male.

So my issues, while not urgent or earth-shattering, are threefold:

1) I am petrified to start having noticeable breasts while still being read as a guy like, right as summer starts and I'll be looking for new jobs.

2) I feel like a jerk-- and possibly worried-- about how i'm sometimes tempted to compare myself to other trans women.  Like, ""well i'll look better than that"" or i'll be more cis-passing or more conservative about going full-time early on or more comfortable presenting androgynously rather than signaling full femme.

I feel like a jerk because this feels like internalized trans misogyny, or at least like caving to social trans misogyny.  And I feel worried because ~what if i'm never satisfied with my looks~?

3) last issue is that I really need to resume therapy.  Sorry y'all.  I'm realizing I need a professional to talk to about these things that are basically minor but that I nonetheless need to resolve.  Been trying to get back to seeing someone.  Thanks r/asktransgender for being here in the interim."

But I've finally run out, and so now I need to decide if I'm going to buy more powder, or try liquid. I'm on a really tight budget, or else I'd buy both and experiment. So I was wondering if there was a strong preference one way or the other among those of you more experienced with makeup!"

I have been through 3 sessions of laser hair removal and i'm pretty happy with the results, even if there is a lot of improvement to do (on my chin particularly)

I saw this morning that the my skin was whiter on zones where I gone through laser. Above my lips, around my ears.. It this is something you can relate too ? I don't know if it's because I didn't protect myself enough of the sun, or it is because of the shadow made by the remaining hair.

In the beginning of the sessions I didn't put any sunscreen on my skin some days, because I forgot it at home and I wasn't able to buy some. FYI I'm in a sunny city (south of France)

If this is actually the reason of the color change, what can I do to reduce it ? Am I intended to hide it with make-up or are they more permanent solutions ?

Thank you !

Mellowbelle,asktransgender,Cashiers really don't care what you're buying. [Motivational],"Not a question, but yesterday I went to Walmart to buy some disposable razors for shaving. I had coupons for both Gillette ProGlide and Gillette Venus. I was with my mom and I was too nervous to grab the Venus ones. But I eventually just went for it, telling her I wanted to know if they'd feel different than the ones I normal buy.

So, I get to the register and it's completely empty. My mother steps over near where the greeter would be (not knowing I wanted her close to me). Anyway, the cashier scans the super pink razors, no questions asked, doesn't even care. I hand her the coupon, but it won't work. Then a woman comes up behind me. I'm thinking ""really? just as I'm having coupon problems?"", but the cashier tells her it might be a while and the lady walks away. 

At this point I'm relieved, but the coupon still won't work. I offer to just pay the full price, but I don't think she heard me (or was just determined to get the coupon to work). So she calls over a manager. After about 10-15 seconds a man walks over, asks what the problem is, fully inspects the coupon, and just tells her to take the dollar amount off of the purchase. She said she was going to do it, but was not sure if it was ok. Anyway, he too didn't care that I was buying women's razors. He didn't give me any weird looks or ask if I was sure that this was what I wanted to buy. She takes the amount off, I pay for them, and leave. That's it. I was nervous for no reason."

For the most part, I have heard mostly positive things about injections. I also like the idea of taking less pills so of course I chose injections. I only knew of estradiol valerate and that's what ai thought I was going to get. When I showed up, it was depo estradiol (estradial cypionate)instead. I didn't even know it existed. I am going to get 10 mg estradiol cypionate once every two weeks. Anyhow, how is it any different? I am guessing the dose is smaller due to it having a longer half life? I wish I asked more questions when I was there, but it kind of took me by surprise that it wasn't valerate and I was anxious since it was my time getting estradiol by injection.

AlabasterNova,asktransgender,Stopping HRT for Russian Roulette,"It's been a really rough and difficult week for me, and to top it off today is the inauguration of a bigot, but nonetheless I need to cut to the chase because I need advice.

I sought out informed consent on my own without my parents knowledge around 4 months back and started taking HRT on September 9th. I was so sick of waiting, just knowing that potential growth is ever-so time sensitive. However due to some bloodwork my parents had done recently I was forced to come out to them earlier than expected. I've been an absolute emotional mess since then and I hurt them- deep, I could tell that easily, and it's made me miserable because of it.

We've had long talks since then, and I have come to realize how grateful I really should be... Even though this is extremely rough on them, all they want is to make sure that this is the right choice. And if it is, then they will support me throughout this transition. Essentially, I'm starting therapy again and I hope it will not only help myself mentally, but also help my parents in being comfortable and confident in that this is what I want and need. They even have offered to search out, i guess, a 'more qualified' endocrinologist than the 'physician' I met through IC.

But here's the problem, we started to talk about relationships, family, attraction and the idea of having biological kids one day. It could have just been the hormones talking, but the fact that my parents entertained the idea of sperm banking and that they would pay the expenses I have since had massive waves of regret for not coming out to them prior. I fear that my impatience has sacrificed my fertility; and I broke down crying just thinking about this.

I have no idea if I am sterile, or if by stopping HRT for a month or two I could regain sperm production since I am 4 and a half months in. But yesterday I decided to stop taking spiro and to wane off of estradiol until my hormones are back in normal male ranges, except I've already noticed strong emotional depression since stopping. This is basically a giant game of russian roulette and I hate to put hormones on pause during a critical period of growth.

Does anyone have any personal experience or advice that could relate? emotionally, I want to go back on hormones as soon as possible and work further towards my goal, but the opportunity of having biological kids someday becomes more and more important the more I think about it. Cause I know, 10-15 years down the road when all my friends are having kids and becoming parents I'm going to feel regret and primarily left out. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, with all the experiences and joys in this world that I have already missed out on for being trans, I don't want to miss out on another.

transmom81,asktransgender,How can I make a support group the best that it can be?,"Hi, everyone! I'm a cis mom of a transgender son, and I've been lurking around here for the past few weeks. I have learned a tremendous amount, and learned that I have so much left to learn.

My son and I recently started a support group for transgender, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people in our area. We live in a small community in Iowa, so we won't have a big group - although we're located near some bigger areas, so we might have people travel to attend.

I've noticed a few posts from people either anxious about going to support group meetings or finding them unhelpful, and so I want to ask - what things can we do to make a support group be welcoming, engaging, and helpful? What kinds of things would lessen your anxiety about attending in the first place? What things should we do to keep people coming back? Any and all advice is most welcome. Thank you so much! :)"

I can continue to live as a man. It's easier, cheaper, No HRT, no reactions, no need to worry about new clothes, learning how to do makeup, less discrimination, etc. 






Transition to female. I'll have to spend loads for HRT, surgeries (if I want to), loads of new clothes, makeup, freezing sperm, voice training, you name it. 







I know it probably sounds a stupid reason not to transition, but it's true. Whereas being female will probably be better, I don't know that for sure. What if I go through HRT and have permanent changes then I regret it? Is it worth loosing my fertility for something that might of just been a phase?

asktransgenmilddys,asktransgender,"Dysphoria has gotten better, and having doubts.","Hi, I'm 17 and I've been questioning since October. 




Gender has been always something I've ways had in my head since I was 12. It started out with me wishing I could wear skirts/dresses, and I'd crossdress in private for that. That was that though. I was attracted to girls only. 



Although I've always noticed how different girls and guys are, especially clothing. But it was more of me noticing the difference more than most people. 



But 2016 was the year that everything changed for me. I realised I would of rather of been born a girl, but it didn't bother me that much. I lived as male for 15/16 years, and its not something I'd change. 


Them we had the school prom, and I had to wear a suit. I didn't question it, because I was a guy and that's what guys wear but while at the shop trying them on I imagined being a girl and trying on prom dresses, and thought that would be alright. But still, not something I was really bothered about. At this point in time I still had no idea what transgender meant. 




Then in October I discovered about gender dysphoria. I easily the null hypothesis and that was Dysphoria. That was Dysphoria related to me so much, it was almost creepy. 



Then I felt so happy I realised I was transgender. At first I was excited as being seen as a girl, but I care about how I see myself and what I wear rather than how others see me. 



But over the past few weeks I've had some doubts about the whole thing. I keep getting in this constant loop and it's impossible to get out of. It's goes like this:


Do I want to be seen as a girl? Don't know. Do I want to be seen as a guy? No. Do you want to be AFAB? Not sure. Do I want to be AMAB? Not really. 



I feel like I'd like to of been born a girl, but I'm unsure still. If I imagine myself as AFAB I see myself being FTM. But then if I see myself as AMAB I see myself being MTF. But I don't know what I want to live as. 




Initially I wanted to be more trans so I could transition with less doubts. Now I don't care if I'd be more cis male or more trans, because either one would cause less doubts. Being cis female is not possible though. 



I feel like maybe I'm pushing myself to be MTF when in reality I might be NB or a crossdresser. I constantly have this feeling that I need to get on HRT and force myself to become a woman, and it feels like every day I'm still running off testosterone more masculinisation I'm getting. I'm starting to grow chest hair and I can't stop it. 


Not sure what to do here. Because of my location, financial, and safety I can't speak to a therapist (unless it was over IM) but none seem to do that. 



Can anyone explain what's going on to me? I'll reply to any questions or anything. Thanks. "
SeleneMarie,asktransgender,Do passports show up on background checks?,"I had this topic before, but deleted and remade to make the question more clear. Odd question I know, but I'm working towards applying for a correct gendered passport. Michigan requires that or GRS to change things, so my hand is kind of forced here thanks to Trump. One issue. I just finally convinced myself to start HRT and won't use the passport for at least a year. 

As someone who is about to graduate college, I'm going to hit a lot of background checks. Will a female gendered passport come up and out me? 

Looking it logically it shouldn't, but given that I need a job to pay for my transition while I present as male, its kind of a huge deal to me."

thelukester145,asktransgender,Help With Self-Acceptance/Anger,"Okay so..this is really the first time that I've tried reaching out to a transgender community per se, and this might be kind of a long/rambling post, so read at your risk lol.

I'm 22, born male, been married a little under a year, with a wife who really wants to have children, and have been a lifelong Jehovah's Witness. I also for as long as I can remember have had crushing gender dysphoria, which has led to a host of other mental illnesses (severe anxiety, depression, most recently type two bipolar disorder), several suicide attempts, and a stint in a mental hospital the week before my wedding.

I have been raised by parents who were extremely unaccepting and intolerant of all LGBTQ-related topics, to the point that they would often change the channel and go on a rant about how perverted or sick the world is when a gay person came on, so you can imagine how it went when I told them the feelings I was struggling with.y mother and father were also extremely emotionally abusive and my father was physically abusive at times.

To make matters worse, the religion I am a part of is very intolerant of LGBTQ people as well. While it does not condemn the PERSON, it does condemn the ACTIONS. Which makes matters extremely difficult for me as someone who is struggling with gender dysphoria because I feel like it's all about action... I have disfellowshipped (or disassociated) from the congregation before because I was acting on my feelings, and kicked out of my house (this all happened when I was 18) but I still worked my way back into the religion because I love it and I do believe in it and believe it is the right way of life. But I still continue to butt heads with the congregation again and again and probably will continue to.

The point of all this... is that I deal with an almost unrelenting amount of self hatred sometimes. I am a big guy, around 6 ft. I've probably put on around 40 pounds in the last 6 months due to depression putting me at around 300 pounds now. I cannot even stand to look at myself in the mirror and go out of my way to avoid them. Almost every action I do, from simple gestures to talking, to walking, to even things I used to love, like playing my favorite video games, infuriates me at myself. I think: oh I should be doing this better, or why would a girl be doing this? Or, you shouldn't be spending your time doing this, spend your time learning makeup, or making up for all the years you lost.

I have played with cross dressing on the side and still do occasionally. My wife supports that fully and encourages it because it has at times made me very happy! And I do love to do it! I have several girlfriends who also support that side of me and encourage me to do girly stuff with them and etc... but anymore, I just can't. I can't will myself to do it. I think, what's the use? I'm just some idiot in drag. I feel like a pervert when I do and I feel gross and disgusting and I get so angry I can hardly bear it. I'm just wondering. Has anyone had this similar experience? If so does anyone have any tips for conquering this? I am at a complete loss. I basically have no hope for ever transitioning and don't know how I will ever make it with the way I am right now."

ax_of_the_apostles,asktransgender,"Is talking about ""assigned at birth"" politically incorrect?","I have a question about whether or not I've been misinformed about how to talk about a friend's transition.

Someone I knew as ""Jane"" for many years now lives as ""John"" (fake names). I was trying to explain to someone that I sometimes mess up John's pronouns if I'm talking about something that happened when we were younger (e.g. - ""In high school, she was always late for class""). 

I tried to tell this person, ""it's hard to know what pronouns to use when talking about things that happened when John was still living as the *sex he was assigned at birth*.""

What followed was a SJW-esque tirade from this person about how I was using the wrong words since people are ""always the sex they are assigned at birth"" because biological sex remains stable. They added that ""transsexual"" is a ""slur"" because all that ever changes is one's gender (and that ""transgender"" is the only term we should be using).

I guess my question is: have terms like ""sex assigned at birth"" and ""transsexual"" fallen out of favour as inaccuracies not representing what it really means to be trans?"

I've always liked crossdressing, since I was 7. Although when I got into my teens it was more of a fetish than anything. I was just a guy who liked to crossdress in their room


I would always say I would rather of been born a girl, but I didn't really care much about it until August time.


I've always known there is something not quite right about me. I got tested for autism and some learning difficulties when I was 4/5, and I continued to have occasional therapy until I was 11. But they didn't think anything was actually wrong with me. 



In august/september the thoughts of thinking something was wrong with me got worse and worse. Although I never quite know what was up.



I then discovered about being transgender. I never knew that gender dypsohira is what was up with me, but I'm thinking my whole life that it has been gender dypsohira, I just haven't been aware of it.


Since then (around september) I've gotten more depressed, I get so angry and just feel like smashing stuff up because I was born male and not female. If I ever go on instagram, facebook, watch a music video. with someone who is female on it, it triggers is so much. I sometimes think I won't be alive in a few years time if I do nothing about it.



But, one part of me says it's just a phase and it will be over soon. One side of me hopes it is a phase, so I don't have this dysphoria again, but one side of me hopes it isn't so I could transition. But what if I transition, then realize I am actually male? 


What if I do nothing about it, then in a few years time I realize I am transgender and I'll hate myself for ignoring it? Or what if I do transition, then just cringe and look back to the 17 year old me thinking I was just a stupid confused teen?


What if I come out as transgender to my friends and family, then few months down the line I have to tell them that I am not trans and I was going through a phase?

It's not like phantom breast. It doesn't feel strange, I can wear t-shirts fine, I look in a mirror and it seems normal, but it's just my my mental body image (or whatever it is called) doesn't agree with my body.


I've always had little manboobs since I was round 10/11 (puberty time), and they have flattened out slightly. I used to be on the chubby side, but since this dypsohira has getting worse I haven't been eating as much and have slimmed out quite a lot.

It makes me think, maybe I'm just overly curious of what it would be like to be a girl. Maybe I'm cisgender, just extremely curious. 


I'd like to live my entire life as female. From birth until I die. I'll always be trans. I'll never be able to get pregnant, I'll always be trans, not cis, and I'll never feel like a true woman. My childhood will be completely male,

I spend every minute of every day of my life contemplating transitioning. On some days, I decide against it, and on others I favour it. I met an acclaimed psychologist soon after my realisation as a transwoman [which has left me elated, terrified and confused since (a month ago)] and he told me that transitioning or not was totally up to me, and if I chose not to, it wouldn't make me any less of a woman. While I agree to him, for me, personally, my decision is never fixed. On some days, I know I won't transition, while, on others, I know I *have* to.

I want to transition. I don't want to transition. I want to transition. I don't. Yeah. No. Yeah. *Fuck*. Is this normal? I keep coming up with excuses not to transition. Then I feel dysphoric and decide there is no other way than getting on hormones. Does one normally come up with excuses? Do/did you? What are/were some of them, and how long did they continue before you finally decided to transition?

Edit: I mainly keep telling myself I won't be able to play soccer anymore as well as I do currently (given the loss of muscle weight, I will lose a lot of essential strength) but, on some days, the dysphoria is such that I know I *have* to transition.

I already have a name that is generally considered feminine but could be considered masculine, so it feels weird to want to change to another one. Plus, I'm a guy, I should have a guy name.

Necronzon,asktransgender,Does anybody have any coming out advice/stories regarding parents?,"Hey guys and gals.

I'm a 23 year old transgirl from the UK, going to be starting hormones quite soon. I've come out to the odd friend, but not my parents, as, frankly, I'm terrified to. 

Although I've always -looked- a bit girly, they've never had any reason to doubt my gender; I like shooting Nazis in video games, Science-Fiction, violent action movies.. Nothing that would be ""Out of the ordinary"" for a guy to like. So, when I do come out I think it'll be a massive shock to my parents. 

As for their personalities, my Mum is.. Conservative, to say the least, and very overbearing. I have mild cerebral palsy (I walk with a limp) and this along with my slow development in my early life have made her very overprotective. I feel like my life has essentially been controlled by her desires for me: Go to primary school, go to middle school, go to high school, go to work, find girlfreind, get married. My entire life has been spent chained to educational institutions, and I never got a chance to figure out who I was. Not only that but considering she called a transgender friend of mine ""It"" a while ago, I'm not exactly finding my prospects of her being accepting of my gender identity very rosy.

As for my Dad, he and I are very close. I enjoy going for a drink with him and am probably more honest with him than with any other member of my family, however, he's always been a huge sceptic, and I have a feeling he's going to be very sceptical or straight up refuse to believe me and tell me I'm being stupid when I tell him. His scepticism has helped me before, like when I escaped the clutches of Christianity, which I joined in a panic as a confused teenager because I thought my dysphoria was some kind of divine punishment that could be attoned for.. Obviously.. I was wrong. But in this case, I just hope he accepts me. I don't want things to change between us but maybe it's inevitable; I want to keep going out for drinks with him and enjoying his company regardless of my gender. He calls me ""Son"" in a paternal way that has so much affection in it, and whenever he says it I feel so guilty. I don't want to hurt him. 

I'm not ready to come out to them just yet.. I will see if I can get access to my hormones first, but.. I'm going to have to do this sooner or later, and the longer I delay, I think the worse it will be.

Any advice is greatly appreciated."
_Amoeva,asktransgender,Less dysphoric now that I planned my transition,"Hi there !

Today I read my personal diary and I saw that this summer, I was very very dysphoric and scared. I wrote a lot about the fact that I was sad and feel miserable, I couldn't do anything but watching series and sleeping.

And in fact I don't feel as dysphoric now that when I felt stuck this summer. Now, it's still complicated to deal with my height or my face sometimes, but since I begun my laser sessions and psychiatry, misgendering experiences don't bother me a lot for example. People calling me by my deadname isn't a such big deal anymore. I don't know what to think about that. 

Do you experienced the same thing ? When you decided to begin your transition, like when you were in a period of progress, did you feel less dysphoric ? Or more ? Share your thoughts :)

LizzyMayara,asktransgender,Riley J. Dennis Discussion,"Heya, wish you all a nice saturday.

I just came across the Youtuber Riley J. Dennis (https://www.youtube.com/user/JustinDennisYT/), who seems to be disliked quite alot. This ""hatred"" comes mainly from the cis, but as well from the trans community.
She does videos about gender, politics, feminism and vlogs and identifies as a non binary transwomen.

Since YT comments dont mean nothing and are mostly written by dumb people, who want to express their hate, i wanted to come here to get another perspective.

I myself think that her videos are very well researched, scientifically accurate, very objective and not discriminating. But i only watched some of the videos by now.
What are the reasons that some (or a lot?) transgender people seem to dislike her?

I just want to know someone else's opinion on it. Anytime I try to get away from it they follow like they're everywhere seeming like they're just making a fool out of actual trans people, I'm a real transman and I get offended but I could just be ""transphobic"" "
TheyCallMeJetG,asktransgender,[Very Long] I need help. I dont know who else to talk to about this (cis male with mtf gf),"So this is not really about my gf but as her status and past has caused a bad breakdown within my family I want to reach out to this sub for some words of wisdom.

I am 23 years old. In June I went to Thailand and while I was out on my last 2 days there I met a girl I liked. She was Filipino. We kept in touch after I left as things had not escalated. We talked and talked and talked. She told me she was transgendered and in fact she was an escort as well, working there.

I got to know her.  I learned her story out of pure curiosity. She was not like most other girls that went into prostitution. I have verified many times from people (please just assume all i will tell you is true) what she was doing. After having been raised by only her grandmother she left at the age of 24 (after working as a cam girl) to make more money in Thailand as an escort.

Throughout this time with that money she started building 1 house for her dad, 1 for her mom and 1 for herself in the province she was from despite being disowned by them. She lived in an ok apartment but she almost had zero money for herself.

I fell in love with this girl and mainly her committment. I went back to visit her in August and we had already started skyping day and night and if we were not skyping, we were texting. I did not like her work but I saw it as a necessary thing.

When I visited her again in August, we completely fell in love with each other. She didn't know about my financial status and I made sure to keep it a secret (I am 1%+). When it was time to leave we agreed I would go and see her again in October if she didnt manage to get visa to come to me. 

Meanwhile after her first client after I had left Thailand, when we went back on skype, we both just burst crying. She felt guilty and I felt like shit but there was no other choice. This is when I offered to help her out a little bit (just enough to not raise suspicion) and she could start working on cam again. So since then I have been sending her about 1200 euros a month because I saw for myself even her obligations were through the roof.

Come October she moves back to the Philippines and I go visit her for 2.5 weeks. I also tell my mom that I found a girlfriend that for the first time feel she actually loves me back truly for reasons that I have never seen before (because in her own words ""im one of the few people that see her and treat her as a true lady and not just a fetish""). I even showed my mom pictures and she was saying how beautiful the girl is and how happy she is.

Anyway... Here comes December. I go back to her while trying to help her get visa. Meanwhile she still only works cam because the only job she found relative to her degree (hotel and restaurant management) pays very little and denies transgirls (Philippines) unless her looks match her sex. I had to tell my mom she is trans because she would see anyway on the passport I sent her to give it to some guy to help us out. 

My mom didnt react well. She was saying she was very disappointed that I hid something like this from her and that she needs to know my sexual preferences. In turn I was saying I was disappointed in her reaction because first she was happy about me and then she just turned into that.

Anyway we had our fun with my girl, we traveled a bit and for some time everything seemed fine. And we reach today. My mom found some of her old escort ads and started mailing me everything and she also looked into my account and saw that I sent her money. She is furious and she just assumes I did not know anything about it. She said something along the line of ethics etc.

My mother has put me in a terrible position and I cant work anymore. I went home and told my gf everything. She is also clueless about what to do now. What am I supposed to tell her, how is she supposed to understand? She just assumes that I am a closeted gay guy because in her old escort ads she used to advertise as an active ts with 7'' cock (and to be honest, she doesnt like topping, her cock is half as big and she hates it). And my mother then says she doesnt believe her eyes and she cant rest.

There is no doubt in my head that this girl loves me. There is also no doubt in my head after a total of around 1.5 months in the Philippines that if she wanted to do what she did for her family she had to sell herself as she was against all odds. But how can I tell this to my mother? My father is also worrying about me so much because he saw I am devastated but I cant open up to him.

I dont know what to do. I want to die. It hurts me to say this and I feel terrible for saying it but now I understand why so many people keep transgirls a secret. I envy those who do not do this and end up happy.

I still love my girl and I am not breaking up with her."

But, when I am actually in public, I am not fussed if people would see me as male or female. Sure, being seen as female will probably be better, but being seen as male doesn't bother me that much. I only want to be born as female because then I would never of been male, and would of been brought up as a girl.



 
Is this actually gender dysphoria, or something else? Am I tricking myself into thinking I have GD or that I'm trans? I don't really know.





I want to see a therapist, but I have no money or anything to do so. I'm hoping to see my GP to get a referral to a GIC, as soon as I have built up enough courage to do so.

I still want to be trans, and I would hate for someone to tell me I'm not. I don't even want to hear that I'm genderfluid. But my desire to be a woman has died down lately, so I'm not sure why I'm still so insistent that I'm trans."

transforlife84,asktransgender,Your thoughts,"I hide in my thoughts, lost in a dream, in a fantasy and then it's over and I awaking sad with reality.

I have gender dysphoria that I try hard to keep secret, suppress it in hope to save my life, my friendships, my family, my work and more. Being transgendered is hard I know this because I transition from male to female and back to male, why did I do a 360 because I was sick of watching the people I love loss me. Watching the pain you see in your loved ones eyes when you transition is hardest thing you may ever see and even the ones that try to be supportive are hurting. 

Now I live as male, I reconnect with most of those friendships I lost, I found a new girlfriend that's love me and understands what I've been through and we are having a baby together but in the mist of all the excitement the wave of dysphoria is back and it's not fucking letting go. 

What do I do? 

1)Transition and risk losing every one including my partner and unborn child, not to mention seeing the pain in everyone's eyes yet a second time. 

2)stay male and keep fighting this what seems to be unbeatable challenge. Hoping for that time when the wave of dysphoria isn't smashing against me. 

I wish I was born a man or a woman because this thing that is so confusing and can't be explained in logic is killing me from the inside. Am I truely a woman on the inside or a man with a mental illness or may I just be addicted to the idea of being a woman I don't know. I don't know but I do know that after 32 years I'm way over it. 

Nothing can help me now, the sickness of the dysphoria is around to the day I die. I can't get rid of it the only thing I can do block it from my mind by thinking of anything but my gender (hard mission) or reset my life by transitioning which is like killing the old me and loosing everything that he worked so hard for, relationship with other people.

PavementBlues,asktransgender,I put together a packet of clinical standards of care for trans minors dealing with gatekeeping doctors,"Hi everyone! I was chatting with a young trans person today who was told by a therapist that most doctors in their state wouldn't prescribe hormone therapy to a minor, and that got me thinking about the important of self-advocacy in the United States healthcare system. Having worked inside of the system myself for many years, I know how hard it can be for anyone to get their doctor to take their issue seriously, much less a transgender kid.

That's why I put this little packet together. While it's true that much of reported early childhood gender dysphoria resolves without treatment, most people (many doctors included) don't realize that it generally resolves as you enter puberty, a process that can start as early as the age of 9. For that reason, transgender minors shouldn't have to wait until adulthood to get appropriate care.

If your doctor is giving you trouble, or if you're worried about gatekeeping, feel free to print out the documents below, whose highlights will hopefully help you get your doctor to take you seriously.

* [Source document](https://www.endocrine.org/~/media/endosociety/Files/Publications/Clinical%20Practice%20Guidelines/Endocrine-Treatment-of-Transsexual-Persons.pdf)
* **Highlight**: ""We recommend that adolescents who fulfill
eligibility and readiness criteria for gender
reassignment initially undergo treatment to suppress
pubertal development...We recommend that suppression of pubertal
hormones start when girls and boys first exhibit
physical changes of puberty (confirmed by pubertal
levels of estradiol and testosterone, respectively), but
no earlier than Tanner stages 2–3...We suggest that pubertal development of the
desired, opposite sex be initiated at the age of 16
years, using a gradually increasing dose schedule of
cross-sex steroids.""

* **Highlight**: ""According to the study, 'Characteristics of Children and Adolescents with Gender Identity Disorder Referred to a Pediatric Medical Center,' in the March 2012 Pediatrics (published online Feb. 20), gender-dysphoric children who do not receive medical treatment or counseling for GID can be at high-risk for certain behavioral and emotional problems, including psychiatric diagnoses...Study authors advocate for early evaluation of children exhibiting GID, but treatment with medications should not be started until they reach puberty. Pediatricians and parents should consult with experienced mental health professionals for children and adolescents experiencing gender-related issues. When patients are sufficiently physically mature to receive medical treatment, they should be referred to a medical specialist or program treating GID.""

###Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People from the American Psychological Association

* [Source document](http://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf)
* **Highlight**: ""Research has suggested that children who identify more intensely with a gender different than sex assigned at birth are more likely to persist in this gender identification into adolescence (Steensma et al., 2013), and that when gender dysphoria persists through childhood and intensifies into adolescence, the likelihood of long-term TGNC identification increases...For adolescents who exhibit a long history of gender nonconformity, psychologists may inform parents that the adolescent’s self-affirmed gender identity is most likely stable (A. L. de Vries et al., 2011)...there is greater consensus that treatment approaches for adolescents affirm an adolescents’ gender identity (Coleman et al., 2012). Treatment options for adolescents extend beyond social approaches to include medical approaches. One particular medical intervention involves the use of puberty-suppressing medication or “blockers” (GnRH analogue), which is a reversible medical intervention used to delay puberty for appropriately screened adolescents with gender dysphoria (Coleman et al., 2012; A. L. C. de Vries et al., 2014; Edwards-Leeper, &amp; Spack, 2012). Because of their age, other medical interventions may also become available to adolescents, and psychologists are frequently consulted to provide an assessment of whether such procedures would be advisable""

* **Highlight**: ""Adolescents may be eligible for puberty suppressing hormones as soon as pubertal changes have
begun. In order for adolescents and their parents to make an informed decision about pubertal
delay, it is recommended that adolescents experience the onset of puberty to at least Tanner
Stage 2. Some children may arrive at this stage at very young ages (e.g., 9 years of age)...Adolescents may be eligible to begin feminizing/masculinizing hormone therapy, preferably with
parental consent. In many countries, 16-year-olds are legal adults for medical decision-making
and do not require parental consent. Ideally, treatment decisions should be made among the
adolescent, the family, and the treatment team.

closet-me,asktransgender,Do you have any tips for exploring who/what I am safely?,"Heya /r/asktransgender,

Throwaway account - hope that's ok, I'm firmly in the closet. 35ish, AMAB. Had my head in the sand for almost 25 years, but recently it started to dawn on me that I couldn't run away from these feelings anymore and that I may be trans? Found a therapist to help me sort things out, but it's going to take a while to untangle the mess I put myself in (married, 2 kids, part-time job ...). In the mean time, I'm trying to explore what I can without getting discovered and at the same time keep my head above the water.

Some of the things I've found that I can do from time to time and that make me happy:

* wax my arms and legs. My dark, bushy body hair is something that freaks me out big time.
* wear feminine garments (tops, tshirts mostly) under regular clothes (I'm careful not to show bumps or straps, thank god it's winter). 
* transparent nailpolish (If people ask - no one has so far - I say it's byte-x to stop nail biting, which I truly have stopped doing now) + trimming, filing my nails.
* relaxing bath with bath salts, oils and other skin care products without the awful ""for men"" smell.

Any suggestions in a similar vein that I may be overlooking? Things that make you happy?

seansuxx,asktransgender,HRT making me suicidal.,"I started HRT in late September right after quitting my job. I smoked weed pretty much every day July-November, that's when I was cut off from the weed &amp; I was completely emotionally unstable from the effects of HRT.

The last two months I've spent inside because I can't cope with anything. I can't go outside without having anxiety attacks. I feel like I'm drowning in my own body. Getting called ""m'am"" makes me feel like killing myself. Then the look on their faces when they see I'm AMAB. wow. Great. Nothing like that. I thought HRT would bring the life back into me but I've never felt worse in my life. I can barely cope. 

My boobs look dumb. I look like an old man with a saggy chest. The heavy emotions and stress are making me age like crazy. The only thing HRT has done for me is bring back bad childhood memories of looking in the mirror and feeling disconnected from my body. 

I feel completely numb to the world and life. I have absolutely no emotions but stress and anxiety. I feel so overwhelmed that I can't do anything but cry and go online and blast music and binge eat until the baseline of extreme anxiety I have is reduced, then it comes back and I want to die again. I want to do things besides stay inside all day (like get a job) but I feel so overwhelmed. 

Nothing feels real. I feel robotic since I was 15. I am 19 now. I am A shell and parody of who I was when I was little. I am A constant escapist that freaks the fuck out every time someone talks to me and reality hits me. This stress is so extreme it feels like its going to kill me but I dont know what to do. 

I just need to vent here because otherwise I'm gonna end my life. "
KrowGirl,asktransgender,I can't stop crying. Or smiling.,"I don't have many people I can talk to, but I feel like I have to share this with somebody. First, a little history. 

I'm active duty military, and about two years now my dysphoria got so bad it led to a suicide attempt. This was before transgenders were allowed to serve openly. I was hospitalized in a psych ward for three weeks and begun the process of a medical separation. Before the process completed, the SecNav (then Ash Carter) announced the policy change and that Transgender personnel could no longer be separated. Then the policy finally took effect.

I just transfered to a new command in Japan a couple of months ago, and this past week I finally talked with medical about being transgender (the fact that my command is doing training on transgender in the military is what gave me the courage). While there are no hard dates or time lines, I've already gotten the word that I'll be able to transition. While my location can't perform surgeries (which I'm kinda okay with, not sure if I even want that yet) I'll definitely be able to start hormones in the coming months. 

It finally feels like after all the struggles with depression, alcohol, cutting, that things are finally looking up. For the first time in years I can smile and not feel like it's fake. But at the same time, I've been crying almost nonstop all weekend. It feels like I'm going to lose this. Like I don't deserve this hope.  I don't know. It's a weird feeling and not one I know how to cope with. I don't talk to a psych until next week and I don't know what to do until then. 

I just felt the need to tell someone. Anyone. Thanks for reading. "

rickycarwash,asktransgender,Transgender games/interactive fiction,"Hi ya'll,

I'm in a speech-language pathology MA program and in one of my classes we're reading Far From Any Tree. I'm supposed to help lead a discussion on the transgender chapter in a couple months.

I haven't read the chapter yet, but when I do I'll come back and want to pick ya'lls brains on what are thoughtful discussion questions to ask a bunch of (cis) people that I wouldn't have thought of being cis myself.

But before then, I was wondering - **are there any interactive fiction or games that really resonated with you as a person who is transgender**~~ed~~? I think it would be cool if a week before the discussion I could send a link to my classmates to give them something, I don't know, somewhat immersive of the experience of a transgender~~ed~~ person? I'm a little familiar with porpentine (slimedaughter.com). I also remember a flash game with all of these psychedelic colors and abstract shapes and you try to move through rooms and you aren't the right shape for the doors while overhearing people talk about you - but I can't recall the name.

Any help would be hugely appreciated!

Thanks so much!! Have a great rest of the weekend!"
Tana__,asktransgender,Need financial advice / camming?,"I'm 21, about 1.5 months on hormones and beginning to realise that I'm going to have financial problems soon. I have $1300 of my own money, I earn ~$450 a week usually but have had to take work off because of physical injury (my job involves a lot of heavy lifting with guys, and I'm 125lbs soo.. -.-). I'm going to be paying my parents $50/week board from now on too. I pay for my own food, fuel, phone bills, hormones, doctors appointments etc. Because of all these expenses, I find I don't save as much as I'd like to. If I go back to uni, I'll be earning even less and be spending more on textbooks/transport. When I come out fully, I'll need to find a new job (long story), which may end up paying less.

I want to be able to afford facial feminisation surgery hopefully sometime next year. I also want to be able to afford to move out if I want to (small town, everyone knows me as my male identity, I want a fresh start when I come out). I just don't have the skills or qualifications for a higher paying job unless I finish a 3 year degree. I'm considering camming as a potential second income, however it would need to be highly discrete. I wouldn't show my face or anything that could reveal my identity.

How realistic would camming be to help pay for FFS or even university? Has anyone else had success with camming?"
Luxiona,asktransgender,"Worried that I'm using a transphobic phrase and I can't find answers on google, maybe you might be able to help?","TLDR down below

Hi everyone! In the quest to offend as little people as possible, and since I can't find an answer on google, I turn to all you wonderful people to ask a question.

So basically, I'm a cis girl. Having grown up with parents who like action movies and a dad that knows how to fix a car, some of my personality traits can be considered tomboy-ish, or even stereotypically masculine, such as liking action- and superhero movies, having a knack for IT etc.

A few days ago I made a joke to my friends about ""being a guy"" considering the above, but later that night it hit me that it might be a transphobic or insensitive statement. I use phrases like man-power and sometimes use a darker voice, never alluding to the fact that I am trans, but just because it's funny to do. It's not that I think I might be trans, it's more so that I want to now if joking about ""being a guy"" is offensive or rude to transgender people.

TLDR; Is joking about ""being a guy"" transphobic or insensitive towards transgender people when I myself am a cis girl?

Thank you in advance for any responses c:"
BaileyTheWhitesican,asktransgender,How do you deal with dysphoria long term and not being able to transition?,"Well I guess I have asked this before, but I guess I just kinda need an answer.

Not really going to be able to transition in my life, and getting by day by day with dysphoria has been getting harder, especially lately. Just a lot of loss of focus related to it. Just kinda need to make it past a few years.

So for those who went long without being able to transition, or present as their actual gender, or really come out to anyone about it, basically having to completely stay inward about it, how were you/are you able to do it? (other than starting transition) What helps?

Katherington,asktransgender,How do I help make my friend comfortable?,"I attend an all-girls Catholic high school. The other day I was staying late and walked in on another student (Oliver**), who I barely know, balling their eyes out. Instinctively, I start comforting Oliver, telling them to breathe, asking what is wrong, and letting them rant if they felt comfortable. He started ranting about not fitting in, Borderline Personality Disorder, and being left.

The thing that caught my attention was when Oliver started going on about hating how the school kept on going on about “the sisterhood”, “changing the girl”, and “big sister-little sister programs” and how they were uncomfortable when you are not a girl. I realized that he had just come out to me. This wasn’t too much of a shocker as I knew that Oliver played the male lead in the fall play (as it is an all-girls school, male roles often go to girls) and he seemed completely natural in the part. 

With some gentle prompting it came to light that the only reasons he attended the school was academics and location. His parents didn’t trust the public schools and wanted him to receive a Catholic education. The co-ed schools are too far away and the boys’ schools don’t take trans-masculine students. It also came to light that this wasn’t his first all-girls school. He was expelled from the other for presenting too masculine-ly and being “Oliver”. 


So my question is how do I help Oliver be comfortable without outing him?

*If this reads awkwardly I am sorry. I am trying to respect Oliver’s proper pronouns, while also trying to narrate the part where I didn’t know his true gender. I settled on using ‘they’ for the part of the story that takes place before he comes out to me.

**This is the name he prefers but cannot use in daily life do to not really being out. I decided to use it since it seemed like the best and most respectful to use."
themg2,asktransgender,Does depression due to lack of progress towards transitioning frequently impact other areas of life?,I'm a college student and I figured out I was trans about a month ago. I already came out to my parents and my mom sorta told me that while she supports me I need to not let it get in the way of my studies. Unfortunately it does anyways. I frequently cannot get done my homework because I'm feeling so goddamn depressed. However I feel that I should be focusing on my homework so I don't make much progress towards transitioning either (still haven't set up an appointment with a gender therapist or anything) or doing things to relieve dyphoria like wearing girl's clothes or even shaving to an extent. Does anybody else have this issue? How do I deal with this?
WhaleTea,asktransgender,"The Wachowskis, what happened there?","Did they both always know they were trans? If not when did they find out? What is the time line of their personal realizations of transness and transition, relative to one another?

Also: It strikes me as somewhat cyberpunkish in both queer and also transhumanist ways to change ones gender at will. While I don't think this is what the Wachowski sisters have done, I wonder if there has been any writing done about  this type of body modification from a non dysphoria oriented perspective maybe?

Would that even be transgender?

Does The Matrix seem to have been intended to explore transness, to you, and if so how?

Last question: is the fact that the wacjowskis are related a clue of some sort to a possible biological / genetic origination of transness? Did they have the same mum?

Sorry if I'm not asking this clearly, if there is something about my question I can clarify for you please ask.

YetAnotherGuitarist,asktransgender,Which facial attributes are indicators of the likelihood of passing (with HRT)?,"(We're talking HRT of any kind - T, E, etc)

/r/transpassing mentioned that hypotheticals should be directed here. I'm not sure if this counts as one, but hey ho.

Forgive me if this has been asked before, but I found it tricky to get the wording right for a search. This is a general question with a somewhat selfish slant; I haven't transitioned, and one of the things stopping me, aside from being unsure on the whole, is that I'd probably only want to do it if I could pull off girlmode convincingly enough. Silly, I know, but it is what it is.

So, what are some facial attributes that might give you a general idea of whether passing would be easier or harder, when combined with appropriate makeup use + HRT?"

lecrazyunt,asktransgender,annoyed with sublingual estradiol,"Okay I know this sounds whiny but I'm pretty sure I'm not taking the pill correctly. I can feel it.

I also can never seem to get the pill to the back of my tongue it somehow always ends up towards the beginning no matter how far I think I end up putting it back. I honestly do feel like I'm taking it incorrectly. Normally it dissolves in less than 3 minutes too. I called my doctor and she said that its normal and not to worry about it. 

I've tried every trick I've seen through these subreddits and I feel so discouraged.

JustKeepOnGoingOkay,asktransgender,"For those that could survive without transitioning, what was the tipping point in deciding to transition?","For those of you who could live on without transitioning what was your tipping point to transitioning? 

I feel I can live life not transitioning but it will be very lonely, boring, and filled with dysphoria. I tried transitioning in early college, but I was too afraid to go through with it. Now I am almost 30 and care less what everyone thinks. 

I find myself working 80-100 hours a week just to keep busy so mentally I am too exhausted to think. My manager even told me to stop working so much and to have a life besides work. He considers even 50 hours to be a lot. 

I feel like I missed out so much on life because all throughout school I didn't fit in with guys so all I did was just try to blend in being invisible. Essentially friends would barely know I was there. Girls just wanted to date me and I dated all the time left and right but whenever things become physical I broke up instead of letting them know about my feelings. I haven't dated in the last 7 years and haven't had much social interaction. 

Sure living life this way isn't ideal, but many people in the world have it harder. "
rasktgthrowaway,asktransgender,What's the point in transitioning if being male is OK?,"So I live virtually completely gender neutral. 


I almost always wear jeans and a t shirt, and often plain t shirts and plain hoodies, with a pair of unisex shoes. 


It does make me wonder, why transition? Like, this way I don't have to worry about passing, hormones, etc. 



I only get dysphoria if it gets triggered. This might be from simply seeing a photo of a girl, or if the thought comes into my head randomly, or I see myself in a mirror, or anything gender related (pronouns, titles, etc.) 



The way I see it is this. Male is like Pepsi, and female is Coca cola. I prefer coke, but if I get given Pepsi I'm alright with it. Pepsi is cheaper. I'd rather the other, but it doesn't bother me that much. 


If I were born a girl I wouldn't be in this mess anyway. I feel like I can transition, but I'd still be AMAB. I'll never be able to relive my childhood as a girl. Maybe I should just man up and be a guy? I don't know. 



EDIT: I sound like I'm comfortable being male here. I'm not. 


Being male doesn't feel right to me, I just can't handle not knowing what to am. I want to be a girl really bad, I'd love to transition knowing that I'll like the transition. But I'm never 100% comfortable with it. I imagine myself as a girl, I see myself as a really feminine girl and who is just happy about everything, life is great. But I just stay closeted, to everyone I am just another cisgender guy, not have to worry about passing, etc. It's slowly taking my life away. See my other posts from the past few days to see what I mean. "
Tantrapurna,asktransgender,How did you decide to do HRT?,"Question:
I'm wondering if some have done MTF HRT as a ""preferred choice"" (even though you felt content as a male sometimes)  as opposed to a life-and-death situation, and how it turned out.

Background:
I've been a crossdresser for over 5 years. I go in and out of feeling male or wanting to feel more female after the emotions I feel when crossdressing. Though I enjoy the fashion aspects of dressing as a woman, I sometimes still feel like a man in a dress when I'm talking with others. I sometimes still enjoy being a guy and feeling like one (having confidence, strength, my voice, etc). At the same time, I almost feel that I'm equal male and female and I could choose either way. It would be easier to stay male, but after feeling the pleasure of being female, even though it comes and goes, I want to have that desire all the time and have no regrets. There's something that I've tasted and I want more. I notice I want to feel more like what a female feels. I just read a post on the emotional effects of HRT. While reading it, I thought ""Yes! That is what I want, to be able to feel emotions more the way a female feels them (being able to cry more if I want, more intense emotions, etc)!"" It would be like having a part of me come out and be present. If I did this, it would seem to be more like a decision to be female, as opposed to something I did because I felt like dying otherwise. Has anyone made the decision to do HRT, because you thought you wanted to experience life as a female instead of a male, even though you were previously content being male at times, and if so, how did it work out? Thanks!! :)"
amalieme,asktransgender,Social transitioning?,"Hi! I'm wondering if anyone have any experiences with transitioning socially, more specifically from being very little socially involved pre-transitioning? I'm still fairly new to accepting myself as a trans girl, but already feel I can have a much more happy and socially involved life if I'm a girl, as I feel much of my lack of involvement is due to general apathy/gender dysphoria? (I had several friends as a child and still into my now mid-20s but gradually let go of everyone) Obviously I can't say it will turn out this way for sure which is causing me a lot of doubts and worries especially as I'm now in the process of getting steady employment for the first time in my life."
CuriousAnConfusedSam,asktransgender,"Decided I Want to Try to Transition, Questions About The Process.","Hiya, r/asktrasngender.

I posted a thread late last night about my decision to want to transition. It was a bit long winded and was posted at an odd time, so the post only got a single response. I'm unsure on whether or not it also had to do with my inexperience with this community. I was a bit discouraged when I awoke to only a single response (thanks u/CoraZin) and actually spent a large portion of today reconsidering.

I may not be feeling dysphoria to the level a lot of people do when they realize they need to transition to survive, but I still want to try. I am inexperienced with this community and I still need to do a lot of research, so I apologize if anything I say seems offputting, rude, or disrespectful. It's entirely unintended. I am genuinely wishing to be able to fully understand my feelings.

So, to avoid putting too much information and offputting people, I'll just link the other thread as a reference point to let this post be independent, and I'll make this post short and sweet. The link will be at the bottom of this post.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So, here are my questions:

1. Where do I start? Is there any specific websites or articles that can explain the process of fully transitioning? Sort of like a checklist or something to organize the process into bulletpoints.

2. Are there resources (videos, articles, ect.) that I can research to learn a bit more about trans culture to help me understand and hopefully be more open to all of this. I'm willing and all, but I'm still in early stages where there is still a lot of information I don't have.

3. Is there any sort of way to look for trans friendly/supporting online communities? I game a lot and it may be a while before I'm ready to come out and explain to the guys I normally talk to. I don't really have any friends outside of the internet, unfortunately.

4. This is a little more specific, but is a Real Life Experience phase required to start HRT? Or are they more hand in hand? I'm not worried so much about passing as I am about my own pre-existing social anxiety. I already have a bit of an awkward time, and having people stare at me and talk makes more more anxious than anything. I read something about a long period of RLE being a big requirement, but I didn't know if that was for the surgery or HRT.

5. Is HRT and counseling unmanageable without some form of insurance? I'm just starting out working for UPS (which, if my research is correct, has supports trans people), but I won't receive benefits for at least a year. In extension, what insurance companies reliably cover health services for transitioning?

6. I currently live in Fort Worth, Texas, but plan on moving to Lansing, Michigan within the year. Should I even bother to start seeking out a therapist or just wait? It really isn't urgent, like I'm not emotionally unstable, but I would like to start the process ASAP.

7. Are there any resources for trans people in Fort Worth? Like recommended trans helping groups or recommended counselors?

8. Is there anything I can do to prepare myself for this change in the meantime? It just feels strange to make this choice and not really change how I operate until I see a therapist.

That's all for now. You don't have to answer to all the questions or anything, just to anything you can help me on.

I'm noticing that I'm most excited for the fact that I'll be more free to present as a woman.

Even when I was a kid I wanted to wake up as a girl so that I could wear the clothes I saw other girls wearing.

I just find it scary that most of this revolves around clothing.  It's very rarely sexual.  I just like the idea of being able to try on stuff at the mall,  going to the corner store presenting as a woman, and things like that.

I've gone out presenting twice in the past two months and those two nights were my happiest nights in awhile.

In any case, my husband and I have asked her to present as male when visiting our home. 
This weekend, I will be taking a road trip with our two boys (aged 2 and 4) to visit my parents in THEIR home. My father asked who he was going to be this weekend, and I asked her again to present as male. 
I know that it's not easy, and if it had just been me coming to see the parents, it wouldn't have crossed my mind to have her not be her. I just feel, with my kids, I don't want to have to explain to them (especially the super curious 4 year old) what transgendered is quite yet. I certainly don't plan on hiding the fact that their grandfather is transgendered from them forever. But I think 2 and 4 is too young to introduce them to it. 

I've told my dad that I super appreciate when she presents as male for my kids, I know it can't be easy. 

I guess I'm just asking if there's another option, or if I'm making a bigger deal out of it than I should, or if there is anyone else who has been in this type of situation.

mrbriyani,asktransgender,"Living in Singapore, hoping to start HRT this year. Seeking answers to so many questions.","Hi everyone! I'm 24, MtF, pre-everything, living in the little island of Singapore. I've searched around for a bit online (I do stress the words ""a bit""), and I don't tend to find too many resources when it comes to transitioning in this island nation, and the little things I do find, my anxiety and procastinative nature have prevented me from following up and finding more. Transitioning seems like such a daunting task, and I find myself overwhelmed often when it comes to thinking about these things. Having lurked here for a while though, I'm hoping some of you could help me out and give some opinions or advice regarding this very big step in my life. Do chime in if you have some knowledge even if you aren't from Singapore, though I do hope that I can get answers from closer to home. But most of all, I just want to be able to make an informed decision on this.

1. HRT

* 1a. So of course, HRT. Where are the places or people I can go to get these fabled happiness-hormones?
* 1b. Any expectation I should have of the price range? I'm a PR halfway through to getting my citizenship, so if you have a clue about any financial coverage from the government (if it exists), do give me a heads up too!
* 1c. What are the requirements for hormones? Do you need to have a therapist's letter or something?

2. Therapy

* 2a. On the matter of a therapist, any recommendations? I've searched (briefly!) online, and I've come across [Dr. Tsoi Wing Foo](https://www.practo.com/singapore/doctor/dr-tsoi-wing-foo-psychiatrist), but any other therapists around who are trans-friendly?
* 2b. Price range for these therapists?

3. Hair Removal

* 3a. What do recommend when it comes to removing facial hair? Electrolysis? Laser? Are they the same thing? And as you've probably guessed, what would either cost?

4. SRS
This is the end-goal when it comes to my transition. I will fight tooth and nail to be able to be alone and naked and feel like everything is right when I look down between my legs. I do not want to settle for anything less than finally having a vagina.

* 4a. So I read up that Singapore used to be quite a center for SRS. Is it still? If so, where here could I look to?
* 4b. Options outside of Singapore? It seems Thailand is an unofficial promised land for SRS with Chettawut. Any other places you guys would recommend? It doesn't need to be in Asia if you really have glowing opinions on your recommendation, but I would prefer it to be in this general region.
* 4c. As always, how much would I be expecting to be paying in these places?
* 4d. I've read around here that there could be long waiting lists. Do include how long I should be expecting (or at least how long you waited/are waiting) when giving your opinion on where to get SRS.

So yeah. I actually have loads more questions, stuff like transitioning socially, how to present well etc. among others. But I don't want to get overwhelmed or anything. Right now, actually getting started on physically transitioning is my priority, so other questions can wait for now. I appreciate any answers that any of you could give me. You don't need to answer everything, but if you do have some advice on any of these questions, you're welcome to do so!"
AprilCD,asktransgender,How can we work with trans people participating in sports?,"There's a thread going on in r/news right now about a trans woman winning a women's cycling event. And as you might imagine, it's sparking a lot of ""discussion"", if it can be called that. It's mostly one-sided, to say the least.

Anyhow, I was curious what there is to be said on a forum that might have other opinions. We know trans women experience some loss of muscle mass on HRT treatments, but can still maintain things like bone density, bigger hearts (metaphorically as well), and whatnot after HRT runs it's course.

Unfortunately, I clearly have no clue what the Hell I'm talking about and am hoping smarter folks on this forum can chime in. Do trans women have an unfair advantage here? How much of a concern is it?"

mrstalin,asktransgender,"[TW:suicide, self harm] Does anyone else crash out of nowhere?","Yesterday I went to work and was having a pretty good day, but I just started feeling super depressed about nothing and got some really intense urges to self harm. I got off work a couple hours later, drive to Walmart, bought some wound care supplies and razor blades, and sat in my car listening to an album I always find myself listening to when I'm suicidal, was sobbing and composing my suicide note in my head, even got out a blade and was heavily considering pressing it to my wrist when a family pulled up next to me in the Walmart parking lot and sat there for a bit. It suddenly occurred to me that I didn't want to die a slow death in the fucking Walmart parking lot of all places, and I called a friend who kept an eye on me for a few hours and took the stuff I bought from me. Now I'm just kinda sitting at home in this weird half normal, half numb state and I don't really know what to do with myself. 

Has anyone else here gone through anything similar? How did you move on from this sort of thing? Is it worth moving on from, recovering from? I mean I'm at a place mentally that's familiar. It's not safe, I'm sure I'll wind up dead from it, but it's familiar and comfortable in a sense. Have any of you been in a similar place?"
LadyLatency,asktransgender,Estradiol Patch Woes,"In the 5 years I've been on hormones I've tried to switch from pills to the patch several times.  The patch makes me feel better, the estrogen flow is apparently more consistent according to my doctor, and I don't forget to take it half the time like I do my pill.  I REALLY want to be able to use the patch.

The problem: Every time I put on a patch, my skin underneath gets swollen, red, itchy, and eventually it even starts peeling.  I can't sleep due the constant extreme itch.  When I put on my next patch, the mark left from the old one lasts for over a month, which means I end up having red marks all over my ass all the time forever.

I told my doctor and he suggested spraying the area I'm going to put the patch with flonase before hand because that is supposed to help for some reason? I tried it, and it had no effect.

So I'm reaching out to you lovely folks - do you know of any tricks or tips or solutions or any way to reduce skin irritation and itchiness that comes with wearing the patch?  It's such a better method of HRT for me than pills, if only it weren't for the itches."
MaxineLevine,asktransgender,Just need to vent.,"When I'm upset, I like to write out why I feel the way I do, and usually it's just for me, but I wanted to post this here.  I don't need anyone to respond, but I just needed to get this out there.

Last March, I lost my best friend to a terrible injury he had been fighting for months.  Almost immediately after, I broke up with my girlfriend.  We said we'd be friends, but stopped talking this September.  She was the only one I told about my disphoria.  I'm certain that wasn't why we stopped talking, but it's just been hard feeling so alone.  I talked to some people online and therapists, but it's still different than having a friend.  And even though I've tried to push these feelings down, I hate what I see in the mirror. (not that it's ugly, just... wrong). 

There's a lot going on in my life now, and I just feel like, even though I'm happy sometimes, that sadness is the baseline I go back to at nights.  And I'm not even sure if disphoria is one of the major reasons, but it certainly doesn't help.

Clarine87,asktransgender,[MtF] Is the Estrogen level (on HRT) in a blood test affected by the presence of Testosterone?,"Something I just got to wondering, can't find an answer.

I'm taking 1mg E (sub) every 9-15 hours (every day between 0900-1200 and 2100-0000. Having a blood test next week. 

Will the E results on the test be the same with my current natural T level as after i've nuked T with an AA if the E doses and ROA remains constant? Assuming perfect continuous administration.

Basically, will my blood results show me how much E i'll need to maintain whatever levels I'm getting now after I've wiped out T?

I realize 30 days may not be long enough on E HRT to establish an effective E level baseline which I am asking about. If this is the case tell me. 

Taking these pills had has changes to my phenotype, but mostly just keeps me from getting down or thinking about suicide.

Also, if the levels are low, should I wait until the AA has taken effect (reduce T by at least 50%) via bloods, before trying to adjust E. Might as well ask this here rather than post another thread in two weeks.

My understanding is to take everything slow, but the truth is i'm actually worried about high E not low E. I know all my target levels, just not what to do while T is still dominating."

I am bigger and more masculine (big upper body, narrow lower body) than every girl my age that goes to this school. I have no friends right now, my old friends want to hang around with guys only. I am so ashamed of my voice, I barely talk. My biggest fear is definitely that I can't get my body to the point I want it to be and don't pass.

I have so many things that are masculine about me and many of them will just go away with surgery. I wanted to impress the people, that trans actually can look like pretty cis girls but I only have less than half a year on this school.

Guessimagirl,asktransgender,MTFs in Spain?,"Hello /r/asktransgender,

I will make this brief. I am a student currently studying in Spain. I am on HRT, taking Spiro and Estradiol, but... it seems like I'll probably run out before I could have any shipped here (if that were a possibility). I'm not super familiar with how the Spanish health system works, but my understanding is that I probably can purchase these medications without a prescription, especially considering that I have proof of a US prescription.

So, if anyone has any insight on how this works (I'm told it may be cheaper with a prescription), how much it might cost, etc, I would be very grateful to hear any information on it.

awavehello,asktransgender,FTM/MTF and those with Dysphoria,"I've posed this question to my gender therapist and more recently my wife. My therapist tells me to stop intellectualising certain things. 

I often question: why does paint make me feel better? Why does a piece of fabric make me feel better? I had my first facial hair removal today and I was euphoric all day. Why? Why does a piece of clothing branded for women (and the male version could be the exact same thing, branded men) make me feel better? 

It just seems too simple. When I'm feeling dysphoric and I grab women's pants and immediately feel better... It just makes me feel dumb or ridiculous because a piece of fabric (or some paint) take it away. 

Anyone else feel similarly? I spend entirely too much energy on these feelings.

Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,MtF SRS Question: Do you need to do the same amount of dilating post-op regardless of which SRS surgeon you use?

One of the things that I was thinking about in terms of deciding on a surgeon is the amount of time that you need to dilate post-op.  I noticed that Dr. Suporn seemed to recommend much less time dilating compared to Dr. Chettawut, for instance (who recommends something intense like 150 minutes a day, holy crap).  But I've had a couple post-op friends now tell me that the amount of time you spend dilating shouldn't vary based on which surgeon you use.

Is this true? The amount of time I should spend dilating should be the same whether I go with Dr. Chettawut or Dr. Suporn or Dr. Metzer or any other SRS surgeon? Suporn isn't a ""less-dilation-needed"" surgeon, and Chett isn't the opposite, an SRS surgeon who advises extra dilating?"

Hello (again) /r/asktransgender!

I'm a pre-everything MtF, looking to **slowly** edge myself into my real gender. I got a city gift card this Christmas, which I'm planning to use a fair bit of this friday, going clothes shopping with a friend. 

I don't want to go for anything extreme (ie. dresses are out of the question, for now), as I want my transition to be a slowly paced thing so people can get used to it. 
I'm looking for clothes that are female, but can also be percieved as androgynous to some extent, but with that being said I don't mind getting the occasional raised eyebrow. 

Does anyone here have experience with this, and what clothes did you go for? I was planning on getting things like ponchoes, cardigans, a nice pullover with turtleneck, things like that.

In case anyone's wondering, I'm skinny, almost 6'3"" (189cm), and square body shape. If you have any questions feel free to ask! :)

Edit: I am not out in any way yet, I've only told a few close friends."

throwaway19949799,asktransgender,Dating Sucks (Vent + Crying) MtF(Men),"Internally I'm screaming and crying about how hard dating is for me. I'm literally watching all my friends get into relationships and being happy with life. Every time a guy walks into my life he sticks around for about a week before making his intentions clear, be it he wanted sex, giving transwomen a go, etc. I've lowered my standards so much to open my pool to more options and I'm still having a hard time(I since then returned my standards to what they were). I am literally at the bottom of the dating pool. I am literally one of the most undesired group of women in the U.S.A

* African American Women are least desired group according to OkCupid. 

* Then you have that I'm Transexual so that's more guys out the window

* Then you have the fact I stand nearly 6ft tall. A height most guys wouldn't like, especially on a transgirl because its a reminder that she's trans or use to be male. 

I don't understand why my life had to be what it is. I'm happy with my self image, I think I look pretty damn good and sexy. I hardly shed a tear or feel sad when someone says I look male (rarely happens) because I know who I am and love myself regardless but DATING IS SOOOOOO **EFFIN** HARD. 

It sucks when everyone around you gets taken by their special someone and your stuck looking like ""Am I next?"" 
New Jersey doesn't seem like a good place and I want to try NYC but its a good 45 minutes away from me and I'm sure any guy would just go for someone closer to them anyway. 

I've been listening to music to help me escape the lonely feelings I get but oh no, no no no no it just makes things worst. However when listening to music I just jump into a world where everything I wanted in a guy is there for me. I am not going to lie the fear of being alone forever makes me want to end it all. It hurts when you think that you're unlovable to a lot of people other than your friends and family. I want to start my own family and find love in a SO. 

I guess that's too much to ask for, recently I just been grateful for any guy that even decides to stick around for a while and looks promising.

X_Kochou_X,asktransgender,What can I do now?,"Hello, first time here. A little back story, sorry for it being  long.

I think it was in middle school/junior high (could be earlier than that but memory is foggy) when I had my first feeling with being trans, don't remember the exact reason it started though, however at the time I just suppressed that feeling due to the fact that at the time I was still being bullied for my weight, which gladly enough ended in the middle of my time at the school I went to. 
Flash forward to high school where I had my second feeling, where my mother reminded me that when I was young (around 3), that other people mistook me as a girl because I had long hair for a boy. That and I've been called ma'am twice while helping out with food shopping, while also being mistaken as my mother over phone calls. Plus I got sick of the facial hair and grew my hair out, but unfortunately it had to be suppressed here too because I was more focused on graduating to get out, due to just not wanting to be there anymore and where I believe depression really started to sink in, since I believed that I wasn't going to make it as an adult.

Yet here I am, age 24. However, I feel like I'm still picking up pieces of my life because after graduating, I just took a year to relax and then dove into video games to make me feel better and not lose my mind. Yet now is where I'm getting dysphoria by looking into the mirror just hating my bits, that and because someone I looked up to came out and just brought the old feelings back and they hit hard, but at this point I said there is no way I can suppress this again. Over the years I've told a certain amount of friends that I didn't feel happy with myself, no family.

I was able to recently snag six pairs (five since one of them can't be pulled of my feet and I'm sad too because they were cute, hopefully I can wear them one day) of slipper socks at a store because I couldn't find any male socks that had the pads on them, so I guess that's a plus in my book, but now I feel like anxiety and depression is eating me alive, because I'm stressing how coming out to my parents would end, cause I have no stable income, or any for that matter so being thrown out in the worst case scenario would literally be game over, since those friends don't happen to be in the same state and I don't speak with the people I've met during my school years anymore. That and it's made me stop walking about to try and lose weight.

I did have a counselor once, but he wasn't very helpful in the end, even if he told me to look for a therapist, but that was when I was in high school, so trying to find one with my mother's help would have been weird.

So what can I do currently? Cause I honestly feel like I've dug myself into a deep hole making it much harder to climb out of, but I want to not feel like complete shit anymore."

confused122222222,asktransgender,Questioning transition,"Hey all, sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this.
So, I started on hormones two years ago, and had a panic attack after 2 months, and came off hrt. I kept seeing a therapist about it, and then a 
psych. After one and a half years of consideration, I went back onto hrt. The first couple months went well enough, but for some reason over the last week I've
been feeling terrible about transition, feeling like it's a mistake, I didn't need it, I'm not actually trans, and all that.


I've become very camera shy, and cringe at seeing myself in pictures, despite being very concentionally attractive when male presenting. 
I'm attracted to men, but am extremly uncomfortable with myself being intimate as a man. I used to be very active, but as I would work out i would gain a ton of muscle, get depressed, and stop.
At work, if put into a gendered situation, I get consistently uncomfortable, and it has caused me great distress. 


That being said, my dysphoria has decreased when it comes to being seen as male, it seems, since I got on hrt. I keep having thoughts of stopping, and that I was fine before. 


My main concerns are as follows:
	I was a late bloomer as far as gender identity problems go. Sure there were some signs when i was younger, wanting to wear dresses sometimes with my sister,
	but I was a reltively masculine, although very sweet, young boy. I started getting identity and gender issues around 15-17, (around 9 years ago). 
	I also have been extremely interested in feminization erotica. I thought this was a way to rationalize my gender dysphoria in ways that absolved me of the shame I felt with it,
	eg. Oh no, someone turned me into a woman, I'm not responsible for this. 
	I've been getting weirded out by people using my ""preferred""(feminized) name, and I like my given name.

I'm afraid that this is a combination of some legitimate gender issues, which I do clearly have, and a fetish, that has caused me to transition. 
This, combined with the fact that all of my trans friends say that once they got on HRT they had no doubts, makes me feel like this might be a mistake. Do you all have any input?"
Zcasfqer,asktransgender,Anyone feel like they have been stained by their experience of living the first part of their life as their asigned gender?,"Been asking a lot of questions on here lately, thanks for being a cool community. 

Essentially, what I am curious about is if living as one thing to all the conformity that society required of you, following by such a dramatic change has effected your behavior in a simingly erriversable way. Like, you trained yourself to have particular mannerisms and have a particular perspective on the behavior of the other gender only to try and change your 'team' and feel like you could never undo what you see in women and men from before. Like you are so devoid of innocence that changing still would never make you feel the same as you could have been."
[deleted],asktransgender,Being the only transwoman in a workspace where workers are 95% males.,"So I got this job last December. I was very very lucky and it's a good paying job (for my situation that is). The only problem though, is that I am pretty much the only one in the company who's of female figures.

Having failed at boymode a long time ago, I decided to go at being boymode again since my job only looked for a guy in the first place (I was able to get the job since my document still says I am a male).

At first, I was extremely scared and whatnot. People definitely stared at me and questioned about my identity and I don't blame them for it because I'd wear a big fat hoodie and am extra cap on all day everyday and it only looks like a girl trying so hard to look like a guy hahaha.

And I am on the 2nd week of my job already and so far, everything is going great. Although my job does require some amount of muscles, people seem to help me a lot whenever I need heavy lifting. And I am very very sure that somebody has a crush on me. He'd always try to talk to me and help me like... all the time lol. And he asked me out for a drink later (he asked no one this but me).

I don't know how this will lead my life to but it feels good so far. But I am pretty sure at some point in the future, it would benefit me the most to come out (although most of my coworkers seem to know about it already lol)

Welp, just 210 more days until I can afford SRS!"
dark_side_of_pluto,asktransgender,[NSFW] MTF deciding on who to get SRS from and am worried about issues from the resulting bodymap each technique leads to,"I am currently in the process of figuring out which SRS technique and surgeon I want to go with. I have a number of things I am trying to weigh, but the one I have almost zero info on is the resulting bodymap.

I would expect that different surgical techniques (including the variations between different surgeons for the same general overarching technique) to result in different effects on the mental body-map because different tissues are used in different final locations (e.g. is the vaginal canal mostly made from scrotal tissue or penile tissue).

I've heard some people who have had SRS say that they had weird bodymap issues, like feeling that something is upside down. As someone who has some bodymap issues and dissociation issues already, this has me a bit worried (dissociation would probably be how my brain would try to react to the bodymap issues). So I want to choose carefully.

Does anyone know about or have had any experience or known people with experience with any bodymap issues after SRS, or conversely not having any at all? What SRS technique and surgeon?"
NoragamiHiyori,asktransgender,I can't do this anymore,"Hello. I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while now, and I finally worked up the courage to post. I feel like I have reached my breaking point. I'm a 20-year-old transgender girl. I've been on hormones for about a year now, but I still feel horrible about myself. I have no friends, a broken family and a horrible life. My only safe space is the Internet, mostly because it's the only place where I can be myself without feeling stupid and awkward all the damn time. It just dawned on me that I probably have no future. No matter how hard I try, I can't possibly be a cis girl. I don't see myself being happy this way. Everyone just makes fun of me and doesn't take me seriously. Dating? Forget about it.

varzovas,asktransgender,Is this a phase of dysphoria or more to it?,"I'm a male, 22 years old now, so it all started at age 15 when my doctor said I had to take testosterone because I wasn't growing as planned due to lack of hormones because I did chemotherapy when I was 3 years old, at the time I didn't think much about it and wondered how it would be, took the first round of testosterone shots (it was half a flask, really small doses just to incentive the production of testosterone), when I started to notice it's effects I started to doubt myself and started looking into hormones, what they do, etc and that's when I discovered what being a trans was, I couldn't stop thinking about it, that's when I had my first dysphoria, I told my mom I didn't want to take any more shots and I didn't for a while that is, I couldn't tell to my oncologist how much I was hating hairs, my genitals which are still annoying and that I didn't knew what I or who I was, so just toon the next dose of shots and it was done... few years later at age 17 to 19 I think, the first year of university I started having doubts again, that was a very difficult time and I started going to psychologist but things didn't work out very well, my dysphoria lasted like 6 months, I was constantly thinking about being a girl and everything (never told anyone) and wrote a 4 page long text about my feelings and how I disliked being a man, that relieved me a lot and might have forgotten it slightly... last time I got drunk with some friends while playing games online, I thought to myself about cosplaying as a female character from an anime and next day forward until today (more than 1 month now) that thought hasn't left my head, and I've been doing this insane amount of research and watching videos of mtf and simply trying to find something to identify as, I might be what people call androgynous? Because I feel like I can be both genders yet more feminine than male.
I still have to wait a full month to talk to my psychologist about all of this, I'm currently taking medication for depression which has lasted more than 5 years now, it made me stop university for 2 years(returned this year) and even though I'm almost out of the medication I still feel something is missing, I also don't like masturbating much nor have interest in sex and even though I think I'm heterosexual, I have had some huge urges to kiss guys but they fade quick, the female body fascinates me so much that that's all I draw, I really need some kind feedback please"
Hodorious,asktransgender,Possible trans woman looking for advice about being unsure!,"Hello all! Long time lurker here. I've been going to a gender therapist for nearly three months to check on my concerns that I may be transgender.
Things are progressing a bit slowly, and I was wondering if my motives for possibly wanting a transition were serious or not. If people could ask questions or leave feedback I would greatly appreciate it!

Background information. I am 28 and a teacher currently in West Texas.

**Reasons I think I may be in the wrong body**

* I have always been feminine in nature and friends have often asked if I was gay or metro. 
* I feel like I relate to and can talk to women a lot easier than men. 
* I have never felt like “a man” I always thought that maybe getting abs, or a beard, or joining the army would make me feel like I was a man. 
* For a long while I thought I was bi but wasn’t attracted to men to figure out who I was 
* I don’t feel any attachment towards my body. I’ve mostly felt the opposite, like I’m uncomfortable with how I look, and have almost my whole life. 
* In games where I can choose a character to make, I’ve almost always picked a female because it always felt right. 
* I’ve clashed a lot with male gender expectations or roles. 
* The idea of transitioning and losing my “manly bits” doesn’t bother me at all. the thought of being a woman sounds great to me. 
* I’ve always been envious of what women get to do for their appearance. the one time I had a friend put on makeup for me, I loved it. 
* I think about transgender related things over 20+ times a day 
* Reading stories of other transgendered people has made me cry because I felt like some stories have resonated with me so strongly.

**Reasons I am unsure**

* I don’t feel like I’ve had serious gender dysmorphia until recently, at least consciously. 
* I’m not sure if it’d bother me staying as a man for the rest of my life. 
* I tend to get obsessive when I think about things related to my life. While I usually obsess about things until I do them (like join the army) I’m not sure if this is me trying to occupy my time with a fantasy or not. 
* I’m not sure if it’s me WANTING to be a woman as a social construct or me feeling like I AM a woman.
* I have a larger fear of not passing if I transition rather than being in my current body.

Feedback would be greatly appreciated!"
henx125,asktransgender,MtF: What to do about lots of hair removal,"So unfortunately I'm extremely hairy almost all over my body. It's one of the features about myself which gives me the most dysphoria of all. 

That said, I hate shaving even just my face because of how often I have to do it and how painful it can be to completely get all the stubble.

As a result, I have never shaved any part of my body but my face before for fear that I will become a prickly mess everywhere unless I do a full body shave every two days.

Laser hair removal seems to cost as much as a nice new car, so that is out of the question as is electrolysis, but what about waxing or epilators (or should I say torture devices)? 

Should I just suck it up and shave with a razor? Do I use a hair trimmer to get the bulk for the first go? Can waxing be done without getting it done professionally? I have no idea about any of this. "

Aefy,asktransgender,Important Reminder: This is a transition,"This might seem like a meme, by the title, but really think about what it means.


This is a transition. For me personally, this means that I'm going from male to female. I'm taking Estrogen. I will slowly change, but the main point here is not really the estrogen. It's that I am going from one side to another. I can't jump this boundary and immediately be female. Yes, I consider myself female, yes I am female, that is valid, but physically my body is transitioning. This means that I will be somewhat male, somewhat female, for several months. I will have some body hair, and boobs, at the same time. I will have facial hair somewhat, until I get more electrolysis. I have that thing down there. So yes, I am still physically not where I want to be one day. 

However, I guess I'm just confused as to when I got so wrapped up in needing it immediately, or why I felt so hopeless and suicidal. I have been depressed and hurting myself because I felt that I would never be good enough, or that I was ""inherently worse than any cisgender girl would ever be"". I don't think anyone can expect to completely change their physical body is the most drastic way in a couple months, it happens, but I shouldn't be expecting that. I need to be reasonable, and put forth effort and positivity towards being who I need to be.

throaway_trans,asktransgender,Could it really be this simple?,"Now that I think about it, the first time I realized that I had gender issues was when I was in middle school. Still I had so many other issues that I was dealing with at that time that I decided to put this little problem on the back burner for a little while. I had always considered things like gender and sexuality as non-essential things. Just something for society to put labels on for easy classification. Something that is very superficial without any real substance. 

Its hardly been a month that I have been out to myself and myself only and yet the difference before and after has been undeniable. I am in some trouble both financially and academically right now but I can't remember the last time I had so much energy or had so much optimism. I thought I could explain it away as its just me being delusional or that its just a placebo effect but that doesn't seem to be the case.

I had one of my friends comment yesterday that "" I don't know whats been up with you throwaway_trans but you seem a lot less depressed lately. Its good to see you like this."" I was absolutely astounded. Had my manner really changed enough to be noticed by people around me. The evidence seems almost undeniable at this point.

Yet, I cannot accept it, I almost don't want to. It seems like a cruel joke. After all the things I have done, after all the things that I have survived. Its all sad, funny and scary, all at the same time, that the thing that was holding me prisoner was also the thing that I trivialized and ignored the most.

Did anyone else go through anything like this? I could really use some advice right now.

TLDR : Had always felt like there was something wrong with me and that I didn't belong anywhere. Survived sexual abuse, bullying and violence. Could be the thing that's hurting me more than any of this is being trans. Having a hard time dealing with all of this."
goodgirlthrowawayacc,asktransgender,Q for those of you with Borderline Personality Disorder,"I've been interested in psychology, particularly personality disorders, my entire life. Lately due to going through treatment for my own mental illnesses I found that a lot of my friends with Borderline Personality Disorder are transgender. I know that instability of self image is a big part of having BPD. I also cannot even imagine how confusing growing up trans would feel, and I assume it would count as childhood trauma to grow up trying to fit into a gender binary and body that never felt right.
SO, my question is: Do you think being a trans kid gave you BPD? Or do you think your gender dysphoria is caused by instability of self? Did your symptoms start before or after you realized you might be transgender?
I want to make it clear that I do not (nor does most of the medical community anymore, according to psychologists) believe that being trans is a mental illness. I'm inclined to think people are born transgender. I also 100% believe that even if being transgender can be caused by a mental illness, it is still a valid identity and should be respected.

I've started coming out to my closest friends, and plan to come out to my family within the next two weeks. I've been doing tons of research and getting involved in lgbt communities on fb, etc., and I have a basis for transition plan, but I'm really unsure what to expect from family and the public eye. 
I plan to spend this year of 2017 coming out, and letting myself and my family get used to the idea. Letting my appearance become more andro, and learning feminine socialization. I'd love to learn to do my makeup and hair before I start my transition, and so far I've a decent start on my head hair.
Unfortunately I also have a great start on my facial hair, as I have a full beard and mustache. As a male, I loved it. Absolutely could not get enough of it. Since realizing about 10 days ago my true gender, I've completely changed perspective and cannot stand the thing. As soon as weather warms up some, I'm going to shave and continue to do so, but depending on what effects HRT has, I may also choose to have electrolysis done. Has anyone experienced this and have any tips/advice? Also pretty thick leg hair, especially in public regions... 
I'm pretty mellow attitude-wise, but have a fairly explosive temper when provoked. What changes can I expect from hrt? Anything I should be wary of or look for in particular? 

What about family reactions... I mean, I fully understand that this is different in literally every story, and I have a decent idea what the reactions will be based off what I was met with when I came out as bi. 
But I'm still so, so scared.

I'm so excited for this I can't handle it... literally cannot wait. I've wanted to be a woman my entire life and it only recently clicked, it took a geographic change for me to understand what my body was telling me. And I'm ecstatic for the change to come. 
But I'm so terrified and worried about everything too, there's so much to learn... what a strange sense of anxious anticipation. "

emilycdcanada,asktransgender,E level dropped drastically--confused.,"I've been on HRT for 4.5 months and just got my 2nd bloodwork results back and there was a huge difference in E level compared to my 1st.

I was DIY for the first month taking 6mg estrofem sublingually and 75mg cyproterone. I was tested after being on HRT for one month and my levels were:

* Estradiol: 1311 pmol/L (357 pg/ml)
* Testosterone: 0.85 nmol/L (24.5 ng/dl)

After these tests I got a prescription from my doctor and took 6mg estrace sublingually (which, afaik, should be fairly similar to estrofem--estrofem isn't available in my country through prescription), and 62.5mg cyproterone. I took this for the next 3.5 months. My bloodwork just came back today and shows these levels:

* Estradiol: 370 pmol/L (101 pg/ml)
* Testosterone: 0.6 nmol/L (17 ng/dl)

In both cases on the test day I took 1mg estradiol that morning sublingually and had the test 2-3 hours later. The first test I ate nothing that day up until the test (as requested by my doctor), the second test I had breakfast as there was no fasting requirement. I cannot think of any other factors that would have caused the change other than the switch from estrofem to estrace, but estrace is also b17 micronized just like estrofem and is the standard estradiol pill prescribed in my country (Canada).
I am so confused and frankly very upset by this. My prolactin levels are also high, but I don't know if this is related to my E level:

* First test prolactin: 30 ug/L
* Second test prolactin: 44 ug/L

My doctor wants me to drop my estradiol dose to deal with the prolactin, but I'm already feeling worried about how low my E level is in the 2nd test. If anything, I feel like I want to bump my dose up to 8mg.

Has anyone experienced anything like this before?"

kahveicerim,asktransgender,How to go about getting SRS covered by Anthem BG/BS in Ohio?,"Long time lurker, first time poster :)

Some background: I've been full-time since start of November '16 and on hormones since May '16. I am in Ohio and covered under Anthem BlueCross BlueShield.

I am trying to figure out how the heck I even go about finding someone to perform MtF SRS and how to get it covered or if its even covered by my current plan. I found this document from Anthem: https://www11.anthem.com/ca/medicalpolicies/guidelines/gl_pw_a051166.htm but I don't know:

1) If this applies to Ohio/ my plan

2) If I need to meet the medical requirements by the time I schedule the surgery or just by the surgery date

3) Where I find what surgeons even perform the surgery and accept Anthem BG/BS

I've been trying to contact Anthem through their messaging system repeatedly and have gotten zero replies. I'm really nervous for some reason to actually call and try to speak to one of their representatives about this situation.

So does anyone have any advice or knowledge regarding this? I'd really appreciate some help!

Thank you!"
Trans_throw_away_,asktransgender,I don't feel genuine or authentic,How do I get over the fact that I can't seem to feel authentically feminine.

Does it get easier over time with hormones I'm pretty early in my transition but idk I just can't seem to fit my expression and expectations of how it once was.

And after only a few pages of images, google gets confused too.

I'll be honest, I didn't expect google to come up with much, but the thing is: it did. I have had unfettered internet access since 1997 and seen images from almost every 18+ category of still image [which can be produced without cruelty to another living creature] [not that I approve of human nudity being one of those categories], and yet I've never seen anything like what I just discovered.

~~While I'm sure many of us AMAB wish we had that level of obscurity the inequality of it makes me sad and I can't understand how transwomen have remained so visible, I'm convinced the patriarchy is to blame, but I don't know if it's sexualisation, protecting society from aberrance in minority (by fear/deterrence), or transwomen retaining their independence post patriarchy which has kept AMAB trans visible.~~

~~I recommend everyone do their own search and consider, whether what you're seeing falls within or without your expectations for both quality and quantity. It's shocking how few pages of images it takes before google gets confused.~~

Addendum:

~~I do consider it's possible that the almost perverse availability of imagery from there other side of the spectrum could be due to transwomen being more proud exhibitionists, but that's easily countered by T driven sexuality being less discriminatory than E in creating a demand and subject for another discussion.~~

**Did you see what you expected to see in this image search? Did you see things news to you?**

Sorry for the wall of text, but I just got so mad when I saw yet another non-inclusive post (which was reasonable) in a thread with an inclusive title, being torn down unnecessarily. I don't see the need to berate inclusion in threads which have inclusive titles.

/endrant



EDIT:
I just thought others making the same search might realize just how disparate the invisibility is by how distinctly unexpected the imagery is from the usual ""shirtless dude with scars"". ~~But **I was a fool** to mix attempts to help with speculation for why in the same thread.~~

EDIT3: Thanks for the horrible lesson in why people make throwaway accounts. Men can be so mean. I will never sink to the level of throwaways because something might cause offence.

EDIT4: After my estrogen fueled **emo-out** I'm back (OP restored)! Not going to let another transgender person induce my first post HRT crying session.

Algaelady,asktransgender,How long does it take to transition to female?,"This is probably a stupid question but I was hoping that someone could just explain the entire timeline to me. My half-brother (he has requested to keep his masculine pronouns until he is more biologically female than male) started hormone therapy to transition to female in November. 

I want to be there to help him and support him through some of the more confusing aspects of being a female (for example, buying bras) if he wants my help with these things. But I don't want to pressure him prematurely. However, i honestly have no idea how long this whole process will take and I want to be more knowledgeable on the timeline of the transition as well as what will happen when etc. 

I know this is probably such a stupid question but I really just want to understand more what he's going through during the hormone therapy but I don't want to make him uncomfortable by asking. "
babeunderseige,asktransgender,Is it normal for the penis to be a bit sore after hours of tucking? Am I doing it right?,"Some nights a week I go to bed with my penis tucked between my legs in my padded panties. It doesn't hurt at all. It just feels so right that it overshadows any discomfort. 

It's just in the morning when I wake up and untuck, it's a bit red at the stem and a little on the ballsacks. My bellend is also usually wet with sperm. 

I basically fold my penis in between each ball sack and then gently push them under my legs to the same level as my bum hole so that I have a flat crotch and can emulate the female urinary system. 

In the morning I retract the foreskin and wash my penis and ballsack with warm water, massage it for a few minutes and by the end of the day it's fine. 

I just worry if there are risks of penile or testicular cancer or something like that?

But I don't wanna stop doing it coz it makes me so happy with my body!"
violaceous_trogon,asktransgender,"How can I deal with my crippling reproductive dysphoria (apart from ""just get over it"")?","I asked this question here years ago, possibly on another account, and many of the answers I got said things like ""a lot of cis people can't have children too, so just tough it out"" and ""get over yourself"" and ""stop being so anti-adoption"" and ""you're lucky you can't give birth, i'd kill to have my uterus out of me"". After that negative reception I suppressed my reproductive dysphoria almost entirely. Until recently. It has come crashing back and is killing me slowly.

My biological inability to bear children makes up a large portion of my dysphoric feelings. For as long as I can remember, my biggest dream (apart from going to space) has been to meet someone, fall in love, get married, become pregnant, and be a mother. I want--i *need*--to be a mother. When I see my friends' and family's pregnancy announcements, I feel warm and happy for them but as soon as I realize that that can never happen for me it feels like I've been stabbed in the belly and I just want to curl up and sob. When my cis friends talk about pregnancy-related topics, I smile and follow along with the conversation but it just hammers in that my dream is not meant to be. I know I could always adopt but pregnancy is so important to me in a way i can hardly describe.

Sometimes I forget that I can't get pregnant. I've been thinking about love and relationships more frequently these days, and it crossed my mind that my wife and I could both have children from the same sperm donor at the same time. My first thought was ""wait, no, that would probably be hell on earth"" and then the realization hit and I could barely bring myself to get out of bed for the rest of that day.

Yes, I'm aware many cis people can't have babies either. I know I may be overblowing how important childbirth is. I could have a bias against adoption. I may even be lucky that my anatomy is the way it is. I truly don't know.

But what I do know is I am sad. ""I am sad"" is the understatement of the year. I'm filled with so much pain and grief over this that I've been barely able to function recently. And I hope that this subreddit has become kind enough to offer me hugs and advice, not kicks to the heart and venomous words. 

If it become clear that i'm wrong I'll delete this post. Possibly my reddit account. I'm sorry if I truly am being over dramatic and vain. Maybe I do just need to ""deal with it""."
The_Oen,asktransgender,I regret coming out to my mother(MtF),"My mother and I have always had a very close relationship. She's also quite progressive on all issues, so prior to telling her I am trans I prepared myself for lots of questions, maybe some tears, but an overall positive reaction. 

Instead I was met with disbelief. She hears and understands what I'm saying, but refuses to accept that I'm transgender, and instead thinks I'm just reacting to lack of a male role model or have deluded myself(???) 

Now her attitude towards me is ice cold, and I'm really worried I might have ruined our close relationship. Also, I'm 100% financially dependent on her, so without her help I won't be able to transition for a long time. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

I grow literally no facial hair, my voice hasn't broke (It is higher than my sisters), i have feminine facial features and most fat collects in my ass. (I also have VERY slight hypospadias..)

I also previously had speech problems, lack of concentration, was shy in my youth, poor upper body strength, slow at crawling and walking as a baby and can be clumsy.

However, things that might suggest i am not XXY would be that I don't have extremely small testicles (around a grape size maybe??) and no gynocomastea. (sorry for being TMI lol)

I would like to ask if any of you have klinfelters, and could possibly point me in the right direction to possibly get a diagnosis? And sharing your own personal stories would be amazing too!!!!

transforcing,asktransgender,"I'm a crossdresser, but I'm forcing myself to be trans?"," I'm MTF, I've been questioning for 4 months but I'm starting to have doubts m. I've convinced myself I'm transgender, which has now triggered some dysphoric thoughts, which I never had 4 months ago. 



The truth is, is that I'm a crossdresser. I like to wear women's clothes. I love to wear women's clothes more then mens clothes. 


I wish I was born a girl, but only because I would of been able to wear female clothes, and I would of forced to grow up a girl so I would of never experienced being male, and hopefully of never had any of this. 



If I wear women's clothes, and if people question it, I could just say ""I'm transgender"" and they will be fine with it. If I say I'm a crossdresser, they will presume its some fetish I have or something. It used to be a fetish, but now I just like wearing women's clothes. 





I don't really know what to think anymore. Maybe life would of been better if I were female, but I don't know that for sure. Maybe because I was raised with parents with strict gender roles I've never been able to experiment with feminine things which has made like this, or the lack of female friends growing up because of my anxiety. 



I don't know what I am, crossdresser, non binary, MTF, or just  a super confused cisgender guy. 



Can anyone give me any advice on what to do? I'm trying to see a therapist, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to for a while yet.

blynng,asktransgender,Came out to my parents a few weeks ago. I need some advice.,"I was on HRT for about five months when I decided the time was right to tell my parents about my transition. I didn't expect anything bad but my dad's a bit conservative and things can be different when it's your own kid.

I talked to them about some other mental health issues I've been dealing with first. The perfect segue occurred when my dad says, ""phew, I thought you were going to say you're changing your gender."" I laughed and explained that in fact I am.

Their reaction then and behaviour since has been perfect. I can't think of anything they could do better. They're absolutely fine with me transitioning and being a woman. Actually I think they're happy I'm doing it because it's obvious I didn't have a life before. They started using my preferred name and pronouns without me asking them to. My step-mom is getting all excited because her own children are boys and now she has a daughter to do stuff with.

I'd love to hear what kind of things I can do to bond with my parents more now that I'm trying to do something with my life.

fykeless,asktransgender,The beginning of my journey,"EDIT: 26 MTF

I have been lurking since 6 month ago and now I decide to tell you, this is my story so far...
Since May 2016 I started to question my gender more than before and I decided to look for help. By the way, in June 2016 a robber breaks into my house and hurts both my dad and my granddad. That incident became a breaking point in my life due to how I was thinking my life gonna be. I thought that crossdressing was a *phase* and when I'll became married I could stop doing it, but the years have been elapsed and the *phase* hasn’t concluded. This worries me so much... I knew that I needed help, so I contact a gender therapist to find out what's going on with me. She's a great person, so kind that the day we first met was so relieving to me, though a little hard to talk to her about my issues even when she's a specialist. It's been almost 3 months when I decided to start a HRT because I have realized that it could be an improvement to my mood and my lack of motivation in life. But there was a huge problem... Nobody, except me, knew about how I felt, nor my parents, my brother, my sisters or closest friends. At that time I started to tell to one by one to the members of my family about my gender issues, with great succeed. The same happens with my friends. Now, each of them supports me and I feel so happy because I didn't believe that everyone I told my situation and my decision to transition, who I consider the most important in my life, were so nice to me.
Today at the hospital my endocrinologist prescribed me the first step of my treatment. One month on Spiro (100mg diary split in 50-50 day and night) before start with Estradiol. I forgot to ask for my T levels, but the next time I'll get it.
Sorry for my bad english =P"

A_Dirty_Cupcake,asktransgender,Not sure if im a crossdresser or trans..,"I'm a straight 23 y/o male
I've cross dressed since I was maybe 8?? And it's progressively gotten more and more serious. I used to do it more as a sexual release, I.e. masturbation in female clothing and then after I was finished I'd immediately take off my girl clothes and hide them. For as long as I can remember when I fantasize when I'm masterbating I'm imagining I am the female and there's never not a time that I do not imagine I am the girl, whether it's porn or my imagination, I never imagine myself having sex with a girl, I always see myself as the woman and I'm usually with a man or pleasuring a man. When I see an attractive girl sure I think about having a relationship with her (obviously since I'm a straight male) but I've found when I look at girls I somewhat envy their bodies, I was looking at this tan white girl in a bikini and the perfect body with this cute belly button ring, and what went through my head was, ""That's a cute dangly belly ring and bikini, god, I wish I had that tan body and those hips and sexy flat stomach, I wish I could wear a bikini on the beach with that brown curly hair"". And recently I've noticed I do that with almost every girl I'm attracted too. I envy her body more than I'd like to have sexual relations with her. And my cross dressing is no longer sexual at all. For example, since I can't cross dress at home or around friends, I went out late tonight and went to target to buy some tight black leggings and a teal spaghetti strap top to wear over my black lace push up bra and my lace hipster PINK panties. I find that I could actually really pass for a girl if I had a wig and shaved, I have a rather feminine body, I don't have much muscle tone, I am VERY skinny, 5'10 and about 140 pounds, and for whatever reason I have a large but, I took a picture of myself (from bra down to my feet to show my figure) and have shown it to people and online and have guys and even friends asking ""who's that?"" Or ""damn she's bad"" and that's my body without hips or fat so it makes me really curious about HRT. it was just a thought at first but now I find myself looking at TG forums and websites and looking up things about HRT and SRS, every single day. If this was just a fetish I wouldn't be sitting in my car in women's clothes posting this and looking at transgender websites, looking at my body and looking at wigs to buy, meanwhile I am not horny whatsoever.

Any opinions?? Is this more than just a fetish..I'm not really gender dysphoric but now I wonder if my social anxiety and depression might have something to do with this..."
dra6000,asktransgender,How does the IC Process Work for Minors?,"Things to get out of the way first:

I'm considering doing the IC process later this year without parental consent, but don't know the process or if this is even possible. I think all I want is a bunch of anti-androgens (1 year supply?). My plan's not exactly thought through. All I have right now is lying my way to a forged signature.

It's probably worth it more just to wait till I'm 18 tbh. Just wondering if it could be possible."

A question for those of you whose transition or coming out led to a difficult and toxic marriage or LTR break-up (with most of the toxicity coming from your ex): have you ever been able to look at relationships the same again and go into a new relationship with an open heart and mind?

Right now, I never want another relationship and couldn't begin to contemplate marriage - if there is even a small risk of having to go through such a difficult and toxic break-up. My heart is broken and  my faith in the goodness of others is gone.

It started with my face, which got... I don't know how to say it, slimmer? Then my boobs started filling out, and at some point I realized that my hips were much wider than they used to be. I get gendered female over half the time, even by voice alone sometimes, and people have even started flirting with me on occasion.

throwawaymightbtrans,asktransgender,Not sure if I'm genuinely trans or just weirdly obsessed with trans stuff?,"I'm currently questioning but it's looking more and more likely that I'm trans (FTM). 

However, I have a huge knack for getting obsessed with stuff - I'm kinda scared that's all that's happening here. I've been jealous of my trans friends transitioning for a while now (...ever since I've had trans friends, in hindsight), but I only recently realised it might be due to wanting to transition myself. 

I'm just scared that maybe I've latched onto transness as some kind of project, I feel mega fake and as though I don't qualify as a guy. But then the more I see of people's transition stories and timelines, the more I get these jealous pangs.

I guess I'm trying to figure out if I'm actually trans or just obsessed with the idea of being trans, and the process of changing to being male. And that just makes me feel seriously ...rude? Intrusive? I don't feel like I have the right to be looking at this stuff if I'm not really trans. I don't even know. 

So, anyone felt like this? How did things work out if so, and can you suggest anything that might help dealing with these feelings? I'm hoping to see a gender therapist in the future but I'm not in a position to do that just yet.

foobeezoobee,asktransgender,"My story, in case it can help anybody out there.","I'm a 16 year old trans girl who's been going to catholic private schools all her life. For some reason back when i was questioning i was never able to find any accounts from people who went to catholic private schools like i did, and never found any ways to cope with the (common) dress codes restricting gender expression. Obviously, I've never been in a public school before, so some of this may be normal and i didn't know but here's my perspective.

I realized I was transgender at age 13 after questioning for ages before that (imagine a little bowl cut kid shyly always asking to be transformed into a girl when we played pretend. yup. ((ALSO I NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THAT KIND OF PRE-REALIZATION HINTING IS NOT AT ALL NECESSARY AND NOT HAVING IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU ANY LESS OF YOUR TARGET GENDER))). I told my close friends about it and waited for ages before gathering up the courage to... write everything down on a piece if paper and leave it outside my mom's door at one in the morning. Now, I'm not one to want to judge somebody's ways of coming out, but that kinda note isn't the best idea in my opinion. There's no chance for a dialogue, and in my case, my parents simply thought I was confused. (They brought up the fact that I played with trains as a kid- if this happens to you as well, please remember that that's the most moronic excuse ever) Terrified of conflict and of disappointing my parents, I shut up about it. For the next two years i explored different identities. At first I thought I may just be a cis male. Those were the times i'd find myself flipping off the mirror and crying myself to sleep. Clearly unhappy, i sought new possibilities. I settled on the fact that I may simply be genderfluid. That diagnosis fell through as I came to the realization that I was always feeling female. One night I found myself speaking to a close friend, tears in my eyes. I talked about how much i hated my name and my body and the 'he's and the 'him's and the 'sir's. That's when he said something that changed my life. ""Okay."" he began, ""Here's what I'm gonna do. You've always reminded me of Alice from Alice in wonderland, so from now on I'll just call you Alice, and if it feels wrong, you tell me, and I'll stop, okay hon?""

It never felt wrong.

I found myself stepping out more online as my authentic self- at first it was difficult as it felt as if i was lying, but I slowly came to be incredibly happy introducing myself as Alice (a girl! like i had been on the inside all this time!!)
(at some point I decided it would be better for my name to be something more modern like Allison, as even with my christian school background (which for some reason was notorious (at least in my area) for having kids with relatively older names) I had never met an Alice even relatively close to my age- the friend who suggested Alice wasn't offended, though he still thought i was like Alice from Alice in wonderland.)

After coming out to all of my close friends, I decided to come out to my parents on June 15th of 2016. A lot of people have asked me why specifically that number, embarrassingly i just thought it looked nice and rounded.. no significance lol

The night i came out for a second time, I prepared a letter and read it out loud to my parents. Questions ensued like a hurricane, but I stood tall. Their disbelief almost drowned me but I knew it had to be done if I was ever to be happy with myself. It took around two months for them to come to believe me, and a lot of awkward conversations have popped up on a random basis. I'd be lying if I said I didn't shrink and shy away from some topics because i believed I just couldn't handle them at the moment- it's important to remember that they know very little about any of this, and are asking because they legitimately don't know. 

About six months later, and I'm definitely sure that coming out was a good decision. Of course, you have to know whether or not your parents are the kind who would accept you. (If they don't then I'm your new mom now we're having milkshakes for dinner)

** catholic school tips and tricks! **
* If you have access to clear nail polish that's always a good bet for undercover expression that people are unlikely to notice
* If your school doesn't mind drawing on your arms/hands, that's a very therapeutic thing to do, though it may draw attention to you if you're not wearing long sleeves
* if you have the ability, you can paint your toenails given that people won't see them through your socks/shoes 
* finding friends that will accept you and understand your struggles is definitely helpful!
* it can sometimes help to think of your present gender presentation as a disguise- i swear i actually used to do this and every time someone called me a he i'd be like HAHA YOU FOOL YOU FELL FOR IT
* find an outlet for expression at home such as a social media account
* music, angsty or happy, can really help. try [8tracks!](https://8tracks.com)
* drawing can REALLY help, it helps you remove yourself from reality in some ways - don't worry about being good.

i really hope any of this could help at least one person!

shatteredtruth,asktransgender,"Progesterone, mood and dysphoria","Has anyone else here experienced an increase in depression or dysphoria shortly after adding progesterone to their HRT?

I've been on Progynova now for about ten weeks, and a few weeks ago my endo added bio-identical progesterone to my regimen. For the first day or two everything was fine, then I fell into a rather extreme malaise of depression and my dysphoria skyrocketed almost overnight.

Now after about three weeks, my emotional state seems to have adjusted and I feel... somehow better. I'm more calm than I was on just E, more relaxed, and my dysphoria has ebbed back down to my normal baseline. If it was the progesterone, the transition was brutal, but worth it now that it's done.

Mostly I am curious whether this was caused in part by the progesterone, or whether I should look into other aspects of my life and transition to find the cause of the emotional upset.

Thanks everyone!"

It wasn't the best timing as she is going through chemo for a rare blood cancer and is getting ready for a stem cell blood transplant. However she is supportive and generally accepting. 

Mom asked me to come out to my sister so that she would have someone to talk to about this. Ok, fine. I wasn't planning on coming out to her until I was ready to go full-time but because mom was generally fine with it, I agreed to as a courtesy to her. 

So when my sister was home for Christmas, I came out to her. Her first comment was ""I knew you were either gay or trans"". Then her next comments floored me. 

""How are you paying for all of this?""  (I answered with insurance)

Then I was lectured about telling my daughter sooner than later. I was taken aback. I told her that my plan with my daughter was to work on the relationship first (my ex-wife did a good job of parental alienation, the part we are working on) then tell her about my being trans. My therapist approved of this route but my sister believes it is wrong. 

My sister claims she is accepting but her reaction to me says otherwise. I told her as such and I got back ""I have gay friends"" When I pointed out that having gay friends is not the same as having a mtf trans sister, all I got was more confrontational attitude. 

So tell me, is she supportive? Can people be supportive but have what appears to be a negative reaction? 

(Background: My sister and I have never been close. We talk maybe twice a year and generally for about 5 minutes each time.) "

TashaTime,asktransgender,for SRS my insurance won't last long enough,"I am 23&amp;1/2. I'm covered under my parents insurance until I turn 26 (for 2&amp;1/2 years.)

So I think I would have to rely on someone else canceling to get mine done in time. Do you think it is worth risking putting down a $1.000 and hoping for the best? Does the insurance pay for most of the surgery?

I just think it's kind of funny in hindsight... because he now has two boys instead of one, we won't really have to worry about that any more.

I wanted to make sure that my wife new upfront before I proceeded any further with medical professionals.

My questions are: how did you manage your excitement now that you were out to your spouse so that it didn't become the focal point of your relationship? What were some really good ways that you nurtured they are needs to show how important they were to? How often did you bring it up, versus your spouse bringing it up?

I'd like to believe that I'm not going to be denied at the last minute, but I can't seem to stop worrying about it. Is there any way I can guarantee that my gender marker change will go through? Or do I basically just have to submit my application, grit my teeth, wait and see?"

LadyTurbo,asktransgender,"How do I deal with hate, and some other questions.","I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to ask these things, but it seemed like the most appropriate one.

So for the past few years I've had multiple accounts online, some male, some female. Let me start off by saying I'm closeted, nobody in my family knows what I really am inside except for my best friends.

But to be honest, I don't know what I am inside either... I don't want to do a physical transformation, I don't know if inside I'm male or female. I've heard the term genderfluid before, so to my close friends I've used that term.

As such, in 2 online communities I've tried coming out as genderfluid, but it was received with more hate than I was hoping. Most of the people who I already had as friends here are still my friends and they're accepting, but not all. Some people in those communities even have the nerve to call me ""it"" or ""one of those Tumblr people"". Sometimes people who don't know would even publicly ""shame"" me for having a different gender after they find some of my other accounts. I just don't know how to deal with this and if it's even a real thing to come out as ""genderfluid"". Am I going crazy with my mind trying to invalidate something that it shouldn't? I'm really anxious about this.

Even though I'm 100% sure my family would be fully accepting of it, I'm not sure the rest of the world would, or maybe even my family deep inside will still think I'm a freak.

I feel like I'm living 2 lives with 2 identities. Though I'm thinking that maybe I'm leaning more towards my female side. I know it's a big question to ask, but what should I do?"

I've called the Los Angeles LGBT Center's Transgender Economic Empowerment Program, and their Legal Advocacy department, multiple times and left messages. It's been a week. No response. Nada. Their walk-in hours are from 12-4 PM and they're located in Hollywood, so going there means taking an entire day off work and HOPING they can help me. Ok, except their automated phone line stated that walk-in services are limited and to call to make an appointment if possible.

HOW THE FUCK CAN I MAKE AN APPOINTMENT IF YOU DON'T PICK UP THE FUCKING PHONE????

Ugh. I can't afford a lawyer of my own, not with the possibility of losing and having to pay for both the medical bills *and* legal fees. So I'm gonna have to take the day off and trek downtown, pay for parking, and hope that someone's actually at the fucking office and taking visitors. It is lovely that the trans economic and legal services are only open 4hrs/day, 5 days/wk, at a time and place where most low-middle income people can't get without spending ridiculous amounts of time and/or money. Shows how much of a shit they give about trans people.

NenaDaconte,asktransgender,Update on my date from today,"He was sweet but boring as hell. We will stay friends with the option of a relationship in the future. He really treated me with courtesy and he was supersweet. It's just that he was so boring.

We ate at McDonald's and omg, can he eat! I had enough with one hamburger, he ordered five. 

I don't have any regrets that I went. He went with me and waited half an hour until my train arrived, he carressed my hand, he kissed me but he told me that I looked so different IRL than on photo and that nagged. You don't say that to a girl. 

He asked me to keep contact and to see each other again each few months to re-evaluate our feelings. 

So all in all not a bad date. I'm just a bit bothered by the fact that he told me that I look in between the two genders and that I look different than in my pictures. He wasn't all that handsome himself IRL. 

So I guess I have a new friend, just not a boyfriend :-)

I'm in high school. My school is very accepting and has great policies protecting lgbt+ students (which is amazing !!). In my school, there are other trans kids (one of which brought a pride flag to school which was so cool to see!). they are in a kind of friend group together and i'd really like to talk to them and become friends

 I dont know how to start a conversation though?? Would it be inappropriate to come up and say ""Hey you're trans !!! Me too wow !!!"" ? that could be read in a whole number of ways and I don't want to offend them. I've never spoken to any of them (but i did hold the door open for one guy a few times in passing)

also, my friend group tends to be around them some times and my friends are not exactly quiet when they talk so theyve called me a lesbian before really loudly (im in the Closet which is soooooooo fun) and I'm worried if i approach them they'd think i was a lesbian trying to make a move on one of the trans dudes when im in fact ?? a trans guy 

not to mention i accidentally embarrassed myself in front of them once so that doesnt help !!!

my question is, do any of you have any tips for approaching other trans people in real life to make friends ?"
Harlick,asktransgender,OMG this is amazing! (Brain changes),"The following is copied from my trans identity twitter account, so I apologize for the formatting. I just had to come share this with you all.

All my life I've heard people talk about getting an endorphin rush from exercise.

My mom would tell me ""you should exercise more, it will make you happier.""

I have NEVER felt any kind of joy from exercising, not once. It has always been a chore that I did because I knew I was supposed to.

Now, 4-5 days a week I do a morning walk with my dog. It's about one mile up the hill behind our house and down around the local school.

This past week I didn't walk him at all. When it wasn't raining I was too exhausted because I wasn't sleeping.

Today is the 1st time I got back on that horse and… holy shit! I felt it immediately!

Before I even hit the base of the hill I was dancing in my step. I danced the entire way up the slope (dog at my side).

I did my usual walk in record time, came down the hill and got to the place where I usually turn right to come home.

Instead I turned left, headed up the street away from my house. I doubled my walk length today.

When I turned around to start coming back home, I started jogging. I NEVER JOG! I am morbidly obese, jogging is not in the cards.

I jogged for at least 30 seconds and I only stopped because my pants kept falling off and sweat was flowing down my face.

When I got home and ditched the dog in the back yard, grabbed a bottle of water, and ran into the bedroom to tell my wife.

She thought I was having a heart attack, I was so out of breath and worked up.

This is what people feel when they work out? This is what was missing in my life? How fucked up was my brain before that I never felt this?

Coming out to myself is literally rewriting my brain, I'm experiencing things I never knew were missing.

Harlick,asktransgender,"[meta] Has anyone done a ""Best of asktrans"" collection?","I've been using the subreddit search for a lot of small questions that I come up with and have been finding a lot of _insanely good_ posts from 1-2 years ago. Stuff like [this long and brilliantly informative guide on voice](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5hgusl/hacking_the_voice_a_physicists_approach_to/).

These posts are kinda languishing in the archives, it'd be great to have a collection link in the sidebar for people new to the sub."
Boob-a-saurus-Rex,asktransgender,"PSA: You can be a self deprecating as you want, but the key word is SELF.","Seriously. I am so sorry that some of us are in life situations where everything seems hopeless or pointless. I understand, and I really do hope you all gain the strength to love yourself or overcome the issue. So although probably not healthy, it's fine to be somewhat self deprecating. 

HOWEVER, that does not give you a right to shit on other trans people. Seriously what is it with these trans men vs trans women vibes going on this sub. 

I'm constantly seeing comments from trans men who don't feel comfortable in this community (their own community) because of some trans women who dismiss them and say shit like their dysphoria isn't valid or that their problems don't matter because they are men. Seriously that is not okay. What the heck. 

And I also see the vice versa, where i see some trans men who've been hurt (possibly by those few trans women) and in turn start shitting on trans women, and doing things like calling them whores and bitches.

I understand we are a community that suffers a lot, and that it's easy to strike a nerve, but in many cases we are each other's lifelines. We cant be tearing each other down like this. So if you aren't able to build others up at the very least, don't cause pain to others and keep your hurtful opinions of others to yourself. 

I know that this isn't how the majority of our community is, but there are still those few who make this sub feel unwelcome. I apologize if I am overacting but I don't know, it just seems like its happening more often now and I want to nip this in the bud. 

TL;Dr: You can be the saddest sap in the world and that's okay. However, It's not okay to be rude and cruel, and lash out on others just because you are down on yourself. This community is here to help and love, not hate. So stop it.

Edit: Words."

Elva00,asktransgender,Tucking,"Just curious if anyone else does this?

I bougth some panties a few weeks ago and nothised the gusset/pouch was a little bit wider than usual.  It reminded me of some gaff panties i had.

So i tried to tuck everything into the pouch then pull the panties back, while being pretty tight fit it is one of the better tucks ive had.
Pretty much impossible for anything to fall out and it looks good. 

Cant buy any panties tho but ive managed to find quite a few now that works well.

Feels a lot better than using dual panties, gaffs or taping to me. 
Maybe not as perfect a tuck as tape but its pretty close and very secure.

Kyriann1315,asktransgender,Has anyone else had a parental figure that's been supportive out of necessity?,"Hey all- this is still one of my first times posting here, but I've been a long time watcher. Convinced that some of the threads here have saved my life a few times. I'm 22, and in the last semester of my undergraduate education. In a week or two I'll be starting the very beginning steps of HrT.

This is my issue that I could really use some insight on- I'm very privileged in that my mother wants to be a part of my life, and when I told her that I was trans she did not immediately cast me away. I recognize that this hasn't been the case for everyone, and do consider myself very fortunate. However, I feel like her reasons for wanting to stay in contact with me are more for herself than they are for me. I notice that whenever I try to talk to her about what's going on she kind of shuts down, changes the topic, etc. It may be that she's just new to talking about it and it's uncomfortable..and I truly get that. 
However, I've always been her main support network. Whenever something is happening with her job, my siblings, my father, I'm the one that she calls to discuss it with (which..probably not the healthiest thing, but you know.) So I guess I was just curious as to whether or not anyone here had similar experiences and/or maybe some additional insight that I'm not seeing? 
I don't want to feel like she's only accepting of me out of necessity, I don't like seeing myself as someone's tool and nothing else. But lately with everything going on I find those thoughts creeping up more and more.

b7d,asktransgender,The Do's and Don't's I Never Learned,"I got ""ma'am'd"" today for the first time and it made me realize I'm moving along pretty quickly in my transition. I also realized I know nothing about the rules of being a female in our society...

What are the do's and don't's of being a female? (I.e. Sit with your legs crossed, bend at the knees, when you go to the bathroom only say you're peeing even if it's something else, etc.)"
catfusion,asktransgender,"TSA, scrips &amp; sups?","So what are the rules and experience of trying to fly with a bunch of meds and things you have to take? 

I have like three\* prescriptions that are my HRT regimen, plus four supplements my doctor's having me take (D &amp; B-complex vitamins, basically), plus tyrosine and glutamine for mood (helps with SADs) plus magnesium and sometimes melatonin for my sleep cycle, and biotin for hair and nails.

I'm flying for the first time (domestic, US) this side of transition soon - I'm not too stressed about myself; my ID and passport are up to date on name and gender marker and photo (kinda excited to use my new passport for the first time, actually) and I know the drill on my body and the scanners and stuff.

But, since I've been hassled and detained pre-transition for having a still sealed bottle of Ibuprofen in my checked bags, and had them flip out about a little personal bottles of hand sanitizer and a tiny tube of lotion in my carryon, I am kinda anxious about flying with a weeks worth of meds. 

I don't want to put them in checked luggage, because what if they lose my luggage? And they've gone through that and not zipped my suitcase back up so my bag came off the conveyor belt half empty and some, but not all of my stuff scattered along the belt behind it, so I don't feel like checked luggage is a safe option for anything I don't want to lose regardless. 

So yeah; like as I asked at the start, experiences, procedures? Does anyone have a protocol to share to help ensure that I don't get hassled by TSA for having a purse full of pills when I go through security? 

(Also, I'm traveling on a shoestring, so 'buy what you need a the other end' is a way less than ideal option, especially if it's buying a bottle of 500 tablets so I can take 6 and leave it behind when I fly back.)

\* Actually four but one's a once every three months shot so nothing to take with me there - although I am worried about the track mark on my leg from that, as I only did my injection on Monday."

YukiCookie,asktransgender,Anyone have some advice with weight?,"Hi, I'm MtF 18 years old (edit: figured out how to add that, thank you!) and I wanted to ask for some advice/tips on gaining/losing weight. I'm on HRT (4 months) now and I heard it helps the fat distribution if you lose some weight then gain some weight again, as in then it comes back in the right places. Sounds logical to me.

Problem for me is, uhm... I don't know how to lose weight? Or how to gain weight either. I've always just been permanently the same, like 30 kg as a kid, then 40 as I grew older, etc.
 
Now I'm permanently hovering around 55 kg. I was thinking maybe I could lose like 5 kg and then regain it? Don't wanna lose too much as I'm slightly underweight if anything. My size is 167 cm (sorry, I only know european measures). Also no matter how much I eat, I don't seem to gain anything at all. 

Does anyone know some things you can do to lose some minor weight and other stuff to gain it back? Would be interested to know about how to gain/lose weight in general, if I ever get too low/too high. I was actually told before HRT that it'll make you gain weight, but that didn't happen for me yet. 

Or is this a really dumb idea and I should just not do it at all? Read some things about transgender fitness here and there and just wanted to maybe know more about it (in general too)."

I love girl's hair and clothing but I've never actually worn any. My mannerisms also don't seem very female to me, even though I'd like them to be. 

I don't know how to put this but- when I'm on twitter and such I often relate to women just... in the way they are? I know that sounds shitty and shallow and pretty hyper-generalizing but I can't put my finger on it exactly. Just kinda in the way they behave- I dunno. The problem is I've only just recently started looking into this so I'm not sure if I'm being realistic or just foolish. I know it's possible to dress very girly and like more feminine things as a guy- I'm not really used to that because most of the guys at my school are pretty jocky or at least not feminine.
I just wouldn't be comfortable with myself if I wore a dress or tights as a guy. Maybe that's sexist, but I see guys doing that and they can pull it off, but I can't see myself doing that except as a girl.

Frankly I think I'm under the false impression that all girls are pretty and graceful- it's just that as a trans girl it seems like I'll have to be as feminine as possible in order to compensate for not being cis. Though I grew up liking cute things, disliking sports and crying a lot, I'm not sure any of those things are indicative of being trans like the clear feelings of dysphoria so many people talk about having since childhood. I take transitioning seriously, and even though it's exciting I want to fully understand what it entails: I read on this sub that you shouldn't transition unless you feel gender dysphoria or euphoria, and I'm not entirely sure if I do. 

What I want to ask is: How confident should I be in my gender before transitioning? I'm not sure if euphoria is enough? People seem to do well for themselves here but I'm not sure if my ideal future as a trans woman is anywhere close to what the reality will be. I'm not sure how my family will react- they might see it completely differently than I do.

Any advice? Like everyone else I'm worried about letting too much time pass...

(Also: I'm 6'2"", size 11 feet, pretty hairy, and my voice is deep. I'm worried about these as well)"
superfastmode,asktransgender,Running away from home ANOTHER UPDATE,"Ok so I'm sorry I've been posting so much, it probably makes it look like I want attention. 
Anyways I have decided I am running away from home. Financials out of the way, I know I can afford this if I try hard. But let me tell you why I have decided this. 
My mom has already compared me being transgender to me drinking. It's not something she supports but she still loves me even though I do it. (I'm 18). My dad is a HUGE homophobe, I haven't told him anything yet, my mom is the only one who knows. He gets weirded out if someone at the gym looks at him weird. He has said several times that trans people are freaks, and gay people are weird. He is not very accepting. My brother I thought would be cool with it, but last night he compared being gay ""to shitting."" He says it's gross, people do it. He doesn't wanna hear about it. 
Anyways I know that alot of you are gonna say ""well you don't know, having a family member who is trans might change their mind,"" and I would say this: I don't want to be in an area doing my transition where I am not supported and people think I'm some sort of freak. I would much rather just do it alone. 
So my question is how do I do it? I have thought about telling them and saying that I am moving out immediately. Also I have thought about just leaving when no one is home, leaving a note, and not saying where I am going. I like the note idea because it will be easier, and they won't beg me to stay. (I know they will) they will tell me I'm not really trans, and even if I am I can stay. I WILL NOT BE IN A PLACE WHERE I AM NOT SUPPORTED. 
Anyways I would love to hear your thoughts on this. You all have been so helpful so far."

NenaDaconte,asktransgender,I love who I physically am after transition but I hate my social life : my whole life is centered around transition. Thinking about detransition?,"I love who I physically became as a woman. I often look in the mirror and find myself pretty and very feminine. Transitioning solved my physical dysphoria. But that's about it. I hate my social life. I don't have a life outside of being trans. I want to center my whole life around transition. I hate trans women who have a healthy, balanced life post transition because I want that too. I hate people who tell me I should consider detransitioning because I love my face and body nowadays most of the time. I hate people who want me to go back to living as a gay male. I don't want to live as a gay male and being envious of women for the rest of my life. I want to be who I am now physically. I just hate my social life. 

I feel that being trans is a too big burden on my life. 
I feel that if I was born with a very feminine body and face I would never have gone on hormones and I would just have had a castration to maintain my feminine self.

I often think about having an orchie and taking just a superlow dose of E to stay healthy. I don't like how estrogen makes me moody and depressed. 

I don't know what to do. If I detransition I will have physical dysphoria returning but socially I would be happier. If I stay this way my social life will keep being a mess but I will be happier with my body than ever before. I have never been so confident, never felt so sexy and pretty since my body is that of a female. 

A last thing that bothers me : I want to be seen as a cis woman, not as a trans woman. I want to be seen as a normal woman, not as a third gender.

At this point there are no real options for me I feel : going back to male will destroy me. Living this way is not healthy either. People call me shemale and all that stuff. I want to be seen as a normal woman, I am not a trans woman, I am a cis woman. I don't want to have anything to do with everything trans. I want to be a woman who is socially regarded as a woman born a woman, not someone's hot fantasy because I was born a guy. 

I want to stay far away from everything LGBT. I am not that. The only reason that I am here is because I am a woman who had to say she was trans before she was allowed to get help being the woman she is. 

Each time a guy on here posts because he is confused about his attraction to trans women it makes me sick to the stomach. I am a real woman, I wish people would see being trans as something medically necessary to treat ( like breast cancer,... )  and not as a lifestyle. "

e_tienne,asktransgender,i need insight on the mind of a cis person trying and understanding queer feminism! help me?,"Okay, so, i'm having an ongoing fight with my primary partner for 3 weeks now:

I'm a genderfluid person well aware of many (queer) feminist (black) movements. He is a cis man who never really cared about my identity. Recently I made him read up on it because he said some really rude things. 

Since then, he still doesn't like me to randomly mention queer topics - for example ""What other word could I use for 'woman' in this context? Hm, maybe 'not male'."" ... he might answer: ""But woman just means the same as not male."" He might also say things like ""I understand the theory, but it doesn't apply to me, so I cannot internalize it!""

Seriously, I'm at loss here. I never had such problems with anyone when I explained queer things. I want to understand why he's so blind to it. I can't help but think he's just violently ignorant. Why is it so hard? Did you have similar experience understanding trans* people? Can you explain your thoughts on it and what inhibits your thoughts?

HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,Do i just want to be a woman because i dont feel free to be feminine as a male?,"Perhaps nsfl stream of ""consciousness"" (self aware pretentiousness), nit just ranting, just lost. Losing is bad. On with it--

I have natural femininity. I think i do, anyway.  And while i lament the binary, i also am (more than) a bit frustrated that its getting torn down. Like, i want to be able to be a woman, where male bodied people cant be! Because i couldnt! Its not fair :( is it wrong to want to be a woman for social reasons? I think i have genital dysphoria too, although i know its not a prereq to being trans; but there are theorists out there saying that dysphoria is a ghost, its not a real thing. I know thats crazy talk but why do i believe it? I feeo like im just a carbon copy of my dad. He loves the hair bands and rock stars, the people who simultaneously take femininity and then reject it. I was raised to do that to myself  or am i trans because of how i was raised? That scares me because then i couldve turned out different. Social things feel more malleable than biology, i cant change my genes but what if i can change my social learbed things? Being trans doesnt feel as real if its not biological. Why else would people be sesrching to see if being gay was nature or nurture? Its not simply curiosity, it cant be! And the control, the control my dad had over me, over himself, restraining constantly. Control or be controlled.  My femininity feels to be just my passivity, my servant-ness. My weakness. I feel like gollum, and i deserve pity. 

*What* am i?  Im being me, and i feel cinfused. But thats why i ask, what am i. I dont feel like i can be a girl if i dont support breaking down stereotypes.  Ive embodied male stereotypes for so long, yet i know its wrong to embody stereotypes when they dont align with ones core being. I dount myself at every turn. Is this me or just ankther reflection of my dad. Or of my mom?  Maybe im just imagining this conundrum. Maybe i should just be feminine and be female because i want to be and not question why. But questioning is what i do. Should i just be genderqueer? Will i regret surgery? Will i die on the surgery table?

I feel like my and his femininity is conflated with being retarded. Maybe thats how he sees it and it runbed off on me.  With being slow, since thats the definition of retarding something, to slow it down. Slow is bad, dont be dumb. Dumb is crazy. Crazy is denial. 

And then theres the problem of how i feel like i cant get close to girls without flirting.  Like ive always associated being close with girls with sexual closeness. Is this a natural male essence or socially ingrained, or both? Its like the converse of my femininity.   Cant get too close with girls as a guy or their guys will feel threatened, this steal yo gurl ish. Its not me but i fear and believe its what i do if i don't catch myself.  Gotta check yourself before you wreck yourself, i tell myself. But im also seeing heteronormatively, surely some guys feel threatened by girls girl friends and vice versa from girls perspectives.  

I feel crazy and dumb, smart with words but dumb with living. Wasted so much of my life because of underconfidence. Cant beat myself up about it.  Trying to control others because i cant control myself, out of overwhelming mind numbing fear.  Viva la vida was playing on the radio at the gas station. How fucking fitting. Fml, yet i actually feel more positive than..i mean happier for the first time in awhile. For the first time in forver, hey, thats a song. Disney.  Now i feel like a wimp.  Argh!!! Thanks obama"
moonstar-,asktransgender,A few questions/some help needed about picking up a name,"Hi everyone!

So, basically, at this point I know I am trans (MtF), but I'm really struggling with finding a new name. I'm from France, and I have a very french-sounding name atm, and so does my whole family. I've thought about picking a name that kind of looks like my current one, but it's complicated because there isn't a feminine version of my name. I've also thought about a few names, but I actually know people named like this (even though those people aren't that close to me), so I thought it would be awkward. What do you people think?

I also wondered if you took advice from your parents. Like, how would they name you if you were born the opposite gender, things like this, but I also thought ""hey, this is my life, it's up to me to choose"". Again, what's your opinion on this?

Sorry if the questions sound a bit biased, but I want to make my situation as ""relatable"" as possible so you could answer as if you were me, while still being quite objective about it. I don't know if I'm really clear right now hahaha

Anyway, looking forward to your answers, and thanks by advance!"

ssstrawberryyy,asktransgender,Question about hormone values,"I'm almost 4 months on HRT now and recently got my blood values tested:

Testosterone: 0.3 nmol/l

Estradiol: 145.0 pg/ml ( internet says that's about 532.2 pmol/l )

I am taking 2 times 2 mg Estrifam and 10 mg Androcur ( cyproterone acetate ) and was told to reduce that to 5mg now. Now my question: I took the Estrifam pill sublingually about 3 to 3.5 hours before I got my blood taken, does this alter the result? Is it possible that my estradiol value might be way lower than it was actually tested and I need a higher dose? Next time I'll see my doctor will be in about 3 months so won't get any answers from him until then.

"
tharjaa,asktransgender,Can I get by without anti-androgens for now?,"Hi!

So for a while on HRT I've had really bad sleep, and also my depression got much worse for a while, but I figured out why, and it was because of the Androcur that I was taking. 

When I stopped taking Androcur the depression got like 50% better and I also was able to get much better sleep.

But I'm a little worried that I may need it still, to keep testosterone levels down.. Although I've taken it for more than 3 months, so maybe it isn't necessary anymore? My estrogen is in a pretty good range I think, like 550+ pmol/l, so I'm hoping that that is all I need to keep my T down.. But I get paranoid because for example, today my breasts weren't very sore at all, although they haven't felt that sore yet.. &gt;.&lt;

I'm waiting to hear from my endocrinologist to hear what she thinks, but I wanted to hear from anyone whos had experience, and if you've discovered that you don't need an anti-androgen after a while.. "
aurakitea,asktransgender,Need Help - Doubt and Pain,"Hello everyone, it's been a few months since I've posted in here, and part of that is that I needed some time away to continue working on myself as I question my gender and move through this process. I'm still questioning - not sure of where on the gender identity spectrum I fall - but I need some help because the emotional spiral I've been in lately is really starting to make me feel ready to give up on everything. 

To make a long story short, awhile ago I came out hard as fully transgender. I'd wanted to be a girl most of my life and finally realized that at least part of me wants to be female in reality. I've never really felt right as male, but I also never really felt what I would call full-on dysphoria either - though I had just admitted to myself that my life was going to be miserable and hoped to be dead by 35 (yeah, okay, so probably some dysphoria there.) 

That said, I also had a lot of doubt and that doubt made me pull back from being fully transgender. Now I'm at this weird point where I know I don't *want* to be cisgender - I don't want to be male, and I don't want to spend the rest of my life as a male... but I also get these days where emotionally I feel like I'm bullying myself into *not* being a cisgender male. 

I feel like there's one part of my soul that's pulling me back and telling me no, the miserable old male you is the real you, and the other part of me so desperately wants to move forward in some way - to a non-binary identity, to a fully female identity - to anything, just not male. I keep going forward and back, and there's just no end to it. 

Has anyone else been here? I remember begging God every night to wake up a girl, I remember buying natural estrogen in college, I remember trying to lucid dream just so I could experience what it would be like to be female... and yet here I am, feeling like I can't move forward because on some level I'm ""really a dude"". I read the Null Hypothecis, I read transgender literature and there's so much of me there, but I'm afraid, and my own gut just keeps pulling me back. I desperately do not want to be a man, but some part of me thinks I am one, and it feels like an internal war to figure out which one will win.

(For the record, I'm already seeing an experienced gender therapist, I just need some help maybe from others who have been here.)

Azorahai90,asktransgender,mtf hrt and hair?,"Hi! I am approaching six months on HRT; however, this is my second go at transitioning. I previously did around 9 months about a year ago, but stopped due to personal reasons, once everything was straightened out,  I restarted HRT. (I've had a doctor the whole time). In the interim period without HRT, I shed a lot of hair. A lot. Scary shedding. I have no bald spots and no receding hairline, but my overall quality of hair is thin and dry. It feels flimsy and it's very hard to style. Word on the street is with time it should grow back and thicken back up. (There's the whole ""hair loss from two years should be reversed"" theory). My question is: at almost 6 months back on HRT with female levels of T and E, shouldn't I be seeing some positive changes to my hair? I am not. My face and skin and breasts are changing beautifully and with makeup I feel pretty confident, but my hair is definitely making me self conscious. Any insights? I've conducted a scary theory that HRT will only work once on your hair. Stupid, but I'm scared. Again I'm not bald, I just look like I need a haircut cuz growing it out makes it more obvious. 

I've seen completely bald men on hrt become women with wonderful locks through HrT- so I know it happens, but at 6 months my hair has not changed.

Thanks for the insight!

So now... I guess I have to find a new doctor, and I have less than 90 days to do it in.

I lied and told him I'm asexual. he felt confused (maybe because I used the English terms, I live in Iran but I can barely speak the language, I have nothing In common with the culture too, I lived most of my life playing video games/online, I actually find it easier to speak English even thought I suck at it) he asked me some weird questions and I just told him I love both genders to just make him stop asking.  he then told me I have to take sessions for therapy, I was quite happy! I asked him if he knew any gender therapists I could visit, he didn't even know what a gender therapist was. then late I asked him what was he going to do in the sessions, he just said ""talk"" I asked him how long would it take to start hormones, he got confused a little, he told me we have to make talk about your body dysphoria (body dysphoria? I don't have body dysphoria I have gender dysphoria, he thought I just simply don't like my body) He told m if he can do nothing about my problem or fix it then I could have surgery, I told him I don't think I'll have that anytime soon, he was confused again. I asked him how long will it take, he kind of didn't answer, until I asked him ""please tell me how long I have to wait, I can't take this anymore, a month? a year? five years?"" he answered five or more years.... I'm 17... I'm already a freak, I don't want to grow up even more, or anything, I didn't ask him about blockers or anything. I got sad and just kind of ended it and said oK i'll come. he also changed my depression and anxiety pills. I quickly realized after (googling and stuff) that transexuals aren't treated well in my country :( All my hopes, just when I stopped hating myself and believing in my self and thinking I'm not crazy, were gone. I can never transition.
I found out he wanted to kind of treat me the same way they treat gay people to be straight :(

SkylineLights,asktransgender,"After finally deciding to come out, I bailed.","Okay, the title isn't the whole story, but I'm new to this and all of Reddit in general, so apologies there. 

I've sorta been doubting things for a few years now, unsure if I really wanted to be a girl or not. As time went on, things got much more clear. Especially after discovering this place not too long ago, and reading through things here. During the holidays I thought about this a lot, even more so during the last few weeks. My head hurt quite often, and I just wanted an answer at that point! After doing some reading, I finally came to terms with the fact that I'm probably transgender. I've denied this fact for a few years now, and when finally accepting it, I was quite happy. Because of this, I believed that I was right, and came out to a handful of online friends, who were super kind. 

After which, I decided to start writing a letter for my mother, coming out to her next. I finished it and everything, and I did more reading to know what I would be getting into, HRT, SRS, all that. The thing is.. The next night, I felt wrong. I went back to my friends, told them that I likely made a mistake, and asked that they would kindly ignore what I said before. I was embarrassed. And that night I felt the exact opposite as I did a few days prior, thinking about how I could ever think that I wasn't a man at all. Now that it's been a while, I'm stressing a great deal over this. I just want to know once and for all. Of course, after reading that most people don't doubt themselves this much, and don't wish that they were born the other gender, but still, I'm clueless. I don't want to make a mistake, and ruin things, or do something I'll regret. I'm not even sure if I have dysphoria, or if I'm just generally upset. 

I don't know why I would be doubting myself so much either, other than a few things. For one, other than the previously mentioned online friends, I don't interact with anyone other than my family outside of school. And I would hate for my relationship with them to be ruined. Another is while I'm young (15), I also am relativity tall (6 foot, last I checked, though everyone insists I'm taller) and I'm told I have broad shoulders, ahead of most of the other boys in my school, I'd say. In other words, I'm worried about passing. Lastly is that all of the time, and possible surgery it takes. That's scary to me. Especially if I don't know if I want to live off of hormones for the rest of my life.. 

There's more to it than that, though. Like I said, I'm not entirely sure if I have dysphoria. And I'm not unhappy being called male and things like that. Though, I'm not sure if that'll change or not in the future.

I apologize if I confused anyone, or if this is something that's been seen thousands of times already. I just want to know if I'm making a mistake or not by bailing last minute. I haven't been able to talk to anyone outside of a brief interaction with friends online about this, either. I suppose what I'm trying to get at here is.. Would it be too much trouble if anyone here could help me out a bit? I'm sick of thinking about this all day and night and losing sleep. I'll pretty much answer anything if it'll help me get this sorted out, at least a little.

(Apologies if this was formatted poorly, and if I made any mistakes here. Like I said, I'm new to Reddit, and this will likely take some getting used to.)"

Why now, when I check out an attractive woman am I also noticing her clothes and nails and hair and wishing I could pull off the same look? This never used to be a thing. Now it'll come for a couple weeks intensely, then go away ish for a while. How long before it goes back to not being a thing ever?

There were isolated moments of weirdness in my life long before this, not as striking as many of the stories here, and nothing that seemed significant at the time; the daydream of being a femme punk rockstar and covering No Doubt; hanging in anonymous chat rooms pretending to be a girl for cybering purposes; the way I would freak out over minuscule belly fat but never had interest in developing upper body musculature. Random things I thought that had no bearing on my actual life, until now when I've gone bonkers and wait until my girlfriend is gone so I can try on her clothes except if I move them she might notice something so I'd better not?

nakedferengi,asktransgender,Has anyone seen the new BBC documentary Transgender Kids: Who Knows Best?,"A couple of things that really stood out to me:

Evidence of a link between gender dysphoria and autism, apparently children with GD are seven times more likely to be on the autism spectrum.

There's a girl called Alex, she overcame her dysphoria, studies show that 80% of trans children choose not to transition, even when there GD is just as severe, and 60-80% if those that desist turn out to be gay/bisexual adults. Yet the focus is more on the 20-40% that choose to transition.

Gina Rippon, a neuroscientist, saying there is absolutely no difference in male and female brains, and that science tells us 'our relationship with the world around us, forms our relationship with gender'.

There was also Lou, a de-transitioned woman, who said she received extreme abuse for talking about her de transition, which I guess is normal these days.

So, any thoughts? I thought it was pretty balanced, but some of this is somewhat troubling. I would love some critical POV's from the trans side.

themaritimeman,asktransgender,Having mixed feelings about to what extent I want to medically transition,"I've been HRT for almost two months - 100 mg spiro and 2 mg E. I *love* the changes that have happened so far - my acne is cured, my skin is a little fairer, and I have some small breast growth. And I feel so much better and I'm sleeping better. Since I've started, though, I've had mixed feelings about how far I want to medically transition - if I want to be fully female, or take on a more androgynous form. As the flair says, I currently identify as non-binary, but I won't be surprised if I decide I want to change that in the future.

The day I got my prescription, my endo asked if I wanted to start on a low dose or a normal dose. I elected for a normal dose because I had waited four months to finally get a prescription, and I wanted to jump right in. Now I'm wondering if I should switch to a low dose, if that's something that's even possible at this point.

The thing is, I don't want to lose what progress I've already made. If I were to switch to a low dose and lose any of the progress I've made so far, I would immediately regret doing it. So I'm not sure what I should do. Really, my only worry is that if I continue medically transitioning at full speed, I'll get to a point where I'm too feminine for my own liking. So I'm really not sure what I want to do.

The worst part is, I don't feel like this all the time. There are days when I feel totally fine and am excited when I notice new changes or more breast growth. Then there are days, like today, when I wonder if I'm doing the right thing. The only thing I'm sure about is that I don't want to lose what I've already gained. I figure it's worth noting that due to a lack of money and free time, I haven't really put any effort into socially transitioning at all. I currently present androgynously, but I do want to try makeup and female clothes at some point. So maybe this is all in my head?

michellebaroots,asktransgender,I just had a huge argument with my maybe-trans friend? Help?,"I'm reposting from the advice reddit because I though you guys might have a better idea, idk.

I have a friend, who I've known for a good six years. Up to those six years, she's never once exhibited signs of wanting to be a boy at all, because she wears dresses and has longish hair and acts like a girl is supposed to, but she told me that she wants to be a boy like about six months ago? 
I was, like, a bit surprised when she told me, because obviously she didn't seem like it before, but I kind of gave her some advice. I told her to trust us, and that I'd see her in the exact same way, so she needn't worry. Like I told her I was feeling down too, and she's get over it - because I'm sure she will. I thought she might be uncomfortable, so I didn't bring it up again. She's brought it on and off - only ever by text. I keep on encouraging her and telling her that our friendship group is supportive, but she hasn't done anything. 
Recently, she's been kind of dissing our squad - by saying stuff like she doesn't like the term ""squad"" and kind of distancing herself the idea of a group, so I asked her about it yesterday. 
Long story short, she kind of got mad, because I brought the trans thing up and she said stuff like ""this is why I'd never tell anybody else"" even though she's told another friend, and she got so strangely defensive but she's only ever scared and not mad. And I'm kind of getting the vibe that she's really embarassed about the whole thing but also mad at us. I told her she's be better if she trusted us, but that really set her off. Basically, she said that I was blaming her and that she was never going to tell any of us, and she'd most likely just cut off all contact when we got to uni in a year, and she said that i was just throwing the responsibility off myself - which i kind of was. she said a good friend would actually be active, and try to research stuff, which i admit i havent actually done, but i have no idea where to start. i give her advice whenever she comes to me, and its not like im brushing her off? but she says she doesn't think i believe her, and i guess that maybe i don't? it's hard for me, and she can't just keep expecting me to be perfect all the time, or have the time to talk. her other friend just treats her like she's fragile all the time, which pisses her off. i kind of just think she's mad at anybody's attempt to help, probably because she's mad at herself instead? i understand i should do more, but she's also being stubborn?
i think she's hinting that i should treat her like a guy. but she also doesnt want others to know? i'm just really confused, y'all. any help would be appreciated. "

I know looks aren't everything. If I end up going from a decent-looking guy to an ugly girl or a girl who doesn't stealth/look natal, I'd still go through the transition process because it's the closest thing I can get to being physically female or even passing in the first place. 

I guess my jawline could be worse, but my nose is too big and my brow ridge sticks out like a sore thumb.

I don't mean to be ignorant or shallow but it seems to me MTFs who haven't started in their' mid-teens or don't at least look a bit girly don't always come out looking too good. 

I'd like to think I can pass, not have people guess my history from my appearance or pushing it slightly be sexually attractive... but maybe that's unrealistic. What do you guys think??

fungusthrowaway,asktransgender,"Have no desire to start hormonal therapy or transition, perfectly fine with my body, but would prefer to have been born as a woman. What am I?","The more I think about it, the more I'd prefer to be a woman. I'm fairly feminine: emotional, artistically oriented, never cared for masculine interests like sports, cars etc.,and generally form much closer friendships with females than males. I've been told that I have a very female way of thinking and analyzing situations.

I like to cuddle with my close female friends, without anything sexual or romantic involving, it's just about being close to someone you love and support. I feel like this is very common among females, but I've never seen and can't imagine any of my guy friends doing this. I like to be close to my friends, and emotionally support, but I feel like there's some kind of a block in most guys that prevents them from being open about their feelings, and I generally find my female friends to be a much better source of support in times of need.


However, I don't feel ''wrong'' about my body, voice, genitals etc. I'm fine with being reffered to as him, or by my (exclusively male) name. I don't want to undergo hormonal therapy or surgery. It's just that... if I had the choice of being born as a woman, and living my life as a female up until now, I think I would be much happier and in a better position in my life.

Also, I'm bisexual if that matters in any way. Not really happy about it, would prefer to be either just gay or straight. I think that bisexuality is generally more accepted in women, but I don't consider that to be a factor in how I feel about my gender."

__its_only_me__,asktransgender,Question about breast growth,"Okay, so as of a week ago, I'm at four months hrt. For the first three months not a *ton* happened, except for like reduced libido and minor face changes and less acne and stuff. And breast pain. Oh, the breast pain.

There was a point where it took so much manipulation to find a comfortable position to sleep in bc of the breast pains. That was probably right around two months, and then it kind of slowed down. I recently noticed pretty much all pain is gone, and have hardly noticed any growth. I know supposedly things are supposed to happen maybe a little quicker after the three month mark, but since then I haven't really seen anything at all.

Am I worrying about nothing? Is this a thing other people have dealt with?

It's worth noting that I started progesterone a week ago today (100mg a night, supposed to go up to 200 in a few more days), and am currently on 4mg of e daily (in little blue pill form). I've been on 4mg of e since a week or so before the three month mark."

I'm hoping to get some advice about timing the start of HRT with surgery. Yes, I will also be asking my doctor, but I'm getting treatment from different countries and it's all a bit complicated.

I expect to have the T (testogel) in my possession about a week before the surgery date. My doc recommends people on T-gel not take it 4 days before surgery, so I figured it would be best to wait until after surgery to start at all. Is this a good idea, or would it be safe to take it for a few days, stop for 4, and then start again? 

Also, is there reason to wait a while after surgery to start HRT? Like, is starting T a shock to the system that I should hold off on until my body has healed a bit? If so, how long?

Since I'm not exactly emotionally smart, and I'm sure others on here have experienced what I'm feeling, anyone have some good explanations?? Any ideas on specific feelings?

Thanks!

BabblingBaby,asktransgender,Non-binary/Transgender friendly doctor in Texas? (FTM),"So, my last doctor turned out to be a bit of a fluke, and now I'm in search of a new doctor who would be willing to give me a prescription for T pretty much as soon as possible. Preferably a doctor without any or very little requirements to get the prescription would be nice. My last doctor kept moving the finish line every time I got closer to getting the prescription. She's like that video game character that gives you a new task every time you complete the old one, and you have to finish all the tasks before you can progress in the game. I'm lookin' at you Fi from Skyward Sword!

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the responses! I wish it wasn't so hard for the trans community to get medical treatment in Texas. It makes my options very limited, but all of these suggestions are extremely helpful."

Nova_1184,asktransgender,Making friends,"How do you guys do it? First off I know it's a pretty vague general question. Here's my dilemma.. my therapist supports my transition 110% and so will the clinic I'm scheduled to see soon, but my therapist is worried about the lack of support I have beyond that. I only have 3 ""friends"" in my life right now. 2 are from high school, and although we've been friends for a long time, we don't talk that much and when we do hang out it feels to me like I'm just going through the motions with them. It's like we've been friends for so long that's all we know how to do, we don't help eachother grow, we don't challenge each other, we don't offer anything constructive, it just feels like wasted time. I've come out to one of them, and since then we've been talking less and less and less... which is to be expected. Parting ways is just something that can happen and I accept that. But the point of all this is, the only other real support I have found has been lurking on here and posting periodically, which has helped immensely but isn't real life support. I'm not sure how comfortable I am going to a support group to meet people. I just want genuine friendship during these times to help with my transition, but I feel like if I make friends now and come out after the fact, people might feel lied too? Another part of me doesn't want to make any new friends until I can present as female/femme 100% of the time so they can see the real me. This of course goes against me wanting people around to help me through it, hopefully you can see the dilemma I'm describing. Has anyone else gone through this? I wish I had someone else transgender in my life further along in transition to take me under their wing almost :/ for lack of better words. It's hard to find comfort, and I've always prided myself in being ""independent"" (or just an introvert) but I'd be lying if I said that ""pride"" wasn't just a mask for the unrelenting loneliness "

PhiloSofie,asktransgender,Social Anxiety: Early Experiences with Trans* Support Groups?,"Hi everyone,

I've been running from my gender issues for probably about 20 years now, but 2016 has helped me realize that the world isn't going to get better on its own so I've decided that I need to face the fear and look to the future.  I suffer a lot from general social anxiety, as I think many other LGBT people do too, but I can see that the best way to work through this is with the help of others.  Which is really, really scary.

Would anyone be comfortable talking about their early experiences with finding or building a support group or network for their personal development as a Trans* person?  I would be really particularly grateful if someone with similar issues with social anxiety might be happy to share their insights and coping strategies, because I really don't know what to expect or how much people are expecting of me, and a little knowledge of support group meet ups would be super empowering going into everything.

Thank you!"

I've seen someone's post that after taking the pill (the new one is sublingual instead of oral, thanks to that I'm less worried about my liver) levels are raising, but after a few hours it tends to drop significantly. When I was on Progynova, my blood was tested 11,5 hours after taking the pill (2mg) and the result was 320pmol/L (87pg/mL).

I'm wondering when we should take the blood test to make results realistic.

Other than that, is there's anything that I should be careful about? Risks etc?

And last, most weird one - I noticed that muscles in my hands are actually bigger (yes, you read correctly) than they were before HRT.

NightvisionMonocle,asktransgender,Parents coming around!!,"Hi r/asktransgender, I just wanted to share with you an update on what's been happening in my life. I feel a lot of you can relate to my story and hopefully it will brighten up your day as well.

I came out to my parents over a decade ago and it was not well received, though I tried to get the transition process happening for a couple of years. I kept hitting roadblocks and emotionally I wasn't ready for it, mostly due to the way people perceived it all and were unwilling to understand that I had no choice - it was either transition or die for me...

Well I did die (metaphorically) for a while, as I repressed all emotion and lived the life others wanted 'simply to make them happy'. I guess after years of going through hell trying to build a life they wanted, I snapped again and couldn't take it any more. I moved out of home very fast and started the whole transition process. Bear in mind, I now have a great job that I can support myself with through this, and a much stronger support network.

So my biggest hurdle so far was my parents. They come from an Eastern European background so you can imagine how difficult it is for them to accept anything outside the cis/het-normative society. They have had a tough time adjusting, and this has hurt as it was when I needed them the most. I only saw damage to our relationship due to this but it appears we've put a stem on that and we're working to repair our relationship.

My dad visited last week (he works a tough roster and I can only see him for a few days a month), which was a big step for him. He left in turmoil as it was tough for him, but the effort shows he loves me and I was so happy I cried.

My mum has been far more difficult, but it's not for a lack of love. She has very strong convictions in her beliefs, even if they're not always right. This is why it's difficult to explain the concept of internal gender to her. The media doesn't help at all either, they made her think you have to be a princess in your childhood to be classified as actually trans female, or butch as hell for ftm guys.

But yesterday she came over and she seems to be finally coming around - she bought me a bracelet as a gift - A HUGE STEP FOR HER! I'm really happy to have a family again and I do feel for those that are not so fortunate :("
MurakamiDelRey,asktransgender,Coming out well before transitioning.,"It's becoming pretty clear to be that there's no point transitioning until I'm at least 18 and have finished school. For me to get blockers and HRT will take at least 10 months because I'll need to go through the court system and by the time I'm through I'll be close to 18 already (which is when it's a cheaper and much easier thing to do anyway). I really don't think transitioning while I'm at school is a great idea because I just don't think it's going to go down well with a lot of people including some friends. 

Is it possible to come out to some people (or even publicly) a year or two before transitioning? I've been thinking that if my family have due warning it will be easier for them to get used to it as well. 

Thanks :)"

Due to a series of reasons, hormone replacement therapy is an unlikely option for me. So I am unlikely to socially or physically transition to a typically female appearance. Just look like a more 'feminine male'.  
If I had sexual reassignment surgery, I would need to go on hormones so my bones don't turn to a fine powder. Estrogen would be problematic, but testosterone would keep me as-is, and I think less of a problem.  
  
So my question is, how difficult would it be to get approved for SRS, if I don't do a 'lived experience' or whatever else the requirements are?  
I'm not debating if 'I'm really a woman', or I just want men to have sex with me or bullshit like that. I know that I'm transgender, and my unsuccessfully medicated depression stemming from being completely uncomfortable with my male body is pretty clear.  
  
Sorry for the poorly worded and/or confusing post, but it was a struggle to even write this as coherently as it is.  
  
Edit: It's not personal choice reasons that I'm unlikely to go on estrogen, it's medical complications."

The hospital is where I started transitioning. I started working there as a guy so everyone knows that I was Brandon. They've seen the changes, day by day. They're fascinated that they get to see it happen in front of their faces. They love the updates. They always want to know what's next, if there's anything they can do to help.

Bsapp13,asktransgender,needing help.,Hello! I am currently 6 months post partum and was diagnosed with OCD (purely obsessional) I'm 22 and have never had any sort of transgender thought before in my life. Not that I can remember. Wel my obsessions change and I initially started having transgender obsessions or thoughts when my boyfriend showed me a video on Facebook of a young trans girl. I obsessed about that for about a week and then knew I wanted to be a girl once I got past that. But that particular theme has come and gone a few times since then and I just started Prozac about 5 weeks ago. I just upped my dosage to 40 mg about 4 days ago and am having a really horrible time. The thoughts are so bad I had constant anxiety yesterday and broke down today about it I had to leave school. I have thoughts that I want to be a transgender gay male. I have always loved being a woman and heron okay w my body but this anxiety has me questioning. I get so upset because I know that it would ruin my perfect little family and it feels more real this time than the times before. I pray that it's just OCD. Because if the thoughts would go away I know I would be happy as a woman as I have been my whole life. I've always imagined being a mother and wife. I try to imagine myself with a penis or as a man and it just makes me do a weird face like it weirds me out but I'm becoming a little indifferent to it and that is what's worrying me.

I'm still messing around with the timing of my spiro doses (taking 100 mg twice a day) to see if that helps, but I'd love to know of any other tips people might have. I know there's a period of adjustment from T to E when it comes to sex drive, but I'm hoping to be able to work through it.

I'm sure at least some of it is due to nerves, too - when we first started dating, before HRT, I was worried about performance issues. Those went away after a bit, but now they're back, and I think that stress to perform is adding to the problem.

Any advice would be great. Neither of us are particularly experienced, so this is throwing us for a loop we don't yet know how to deal with."
g0ldent0y,asktransgender,Traveling into a muslim country? Please advise.,"Hi Asktrangender,

i would like to know if there are trans women here that have experiences with either traveling or living in Malaysia or maybe other similar countries (like indonesia, or other fairly moderate muslim countries like morroco).

There is a possible upcoming business trip for me to Malaysia, and obviously there are some questiosn. First it seems like Malaysia is very opposed to trans people, with trans people regularily getting arested for cross dressing. And there seem to even be laws against cross dressing. Is it really that bad?

The thing is, i pass fairly well, havn't had issues in the last 3 years or so (even before HRT). BUT i havn't changed my documents yet. Its a fairly tedious process here were i live, and it costs me a bunch of money i don't have. I never cared that much about it, since i never had any issues until now. The name on my ID was never from importance to me. I sometimes even use it for fun to mess with people and feel good about myself, but thats just another story. I never had issues getting into other countries, even with my old papers (i mean the person in my passports still looks like me, just a male version of me).

But this would be the first Islam dominated country i travel too.

I really would like to go to Malaysia, since i never been to asia. I don't have much money for leisure travel, so i take the far away business trips whenever i can, and enjoy them a lot. I even would present as male for the week, just to get there.

But i would never cut my hair for it, and to be honest, its incredibly long, and except for hats, there is no way to hide it. I mean i could wear it in a low ponytail that somewhat looks masculine i guess. Is long hair for men common in Malaysia?

The other issue is, that there already has been communication with the costumer (or better, our contact office there, were german people work to help with the communication to the real costumers), and the costumer doesn't know that im trans, and just thinks of me as a women.

So my plan would be to present male for the trip, then once i get there switch back to my normal self, and then switch back for the trip home.

But i have no clue in how much risk i put myself in. I don't think anyone would read me as a male crossdresser. But who can be sure. And i am pre-op too. But i don't plan to go anywhere, where this would be from concern. And then there is the other question on how to present as a women in a muslim country?

Another plan would be to out myself to the contact office, in the hope they don't have a problem with it and then just present as male the whole week. If everything else is to risky, i think this will be the last straw option though. Im not sure if thats possible though, havnt tried presenting male in a while. Luckily my boobs are not existant, so nothing to hide there.

I don't have to take the trip, and a colleague could go instead. But i really really wanna.

I would like to have input from anyone  that has some experiences. Im still undecided if i should go or not. I am aware of the risks, thats why i ask here. I would like to hear more direct expriences. So if anyone can help me with first hand information i would be happy.

shrikeendymion797,asktransgender,"I got some questions. About my gender, and what I feel might mean for me. This is new to me.","So, hello. 

I feel strange, needless to say about my gender ( or not ), I'm honestly more confused I suppose. Allow me to elaborate. 

If I had to fill out a questionnaire now I'd put down Male-Cisgendered. Now why am'I on a subreddit labeled ""asktransgender"" then? It's because for a long time I've been feeling weird, confused, and I have no other place to check out. 

I'll explain what I feel. I feel weird thinking of women. The bodies are attractive, both sexually and romantically. So what's this got to do with anything gender related? Its because when I think about that attraction during..... well obvious times. I feel a longing. I feel like I get it, I start to picture what its like being a women in that way. I've had times where I'll start to picture what I'd be like as a girl. 

This is why I'm here it's because I'm confused.

I already made a post about this topic here, and then somehow found myself here. Its so strange to me. I wonder if maybe I'm just lonely or something, heck I wouldn't put it past me. But I've done things, like twist around in this long shirt I have ( I push it down around my waist ) as if it were a skirt. It feels nice, or maybe just different and liberating as if I'm expressing some sort of feeling within? 

Am'I just weird, should this go here or on some other subreddit??? Am'I ""trans"" or something else I'm missing? I'm not a part f the Lbgt community so I'm missing something?? I don't feel ""trapped"" like I've heard some people describe there own experiences, but I feel something. If I could change for a day or so I would, to see what it's like. 

Like my post up top says I would explore that sexy side. But its not purely some sex fantasy. I'd love to walk around, get coffee as a girl, maybe chat or get cloths. It'd be interesting. It reminds me of this video I saw once where a women learned what it was like to be a guy via acting one out and playing the part for a year. 

Maybe I just want to express my ""feminine"" side more. I believe men and women and all others should be able to wear whatever they want. Heck maybe I need to just confess that? I'd love to wear a skirt or tank top, why not explore that? ( But I doubt I'd look good... My body is really masculine for a lack of a better word ). But yet.

If that were the case then why would I still be curious to what a female body is like to be in? On a note here I do wonder what the sex side would be like, my post up top delves into this some what. But I don't feel like I'm ""gay"" or ""Bisexual"" I think? I wonder if my sexual attraction would change or not? I'm a very curious creative person in case you couldn't tell. 

So I've done as much as I could I think... Thank you if you've read even this far into a strangers random post. I'd love fed back and hope this doesn't back fire on me. Thanks a thousand.

transthrowidk,asktransgender,unsafe in my country. [MTF 20y],"I want to transition really bad but I can't do it from the country I currently live in. 

You'll probably think I live in a third world country, but that actually is not the case. I live in The Netherlands. 

I fear social persecution from my extended family and circle of acquaintances.  Knowing how some of my extended family members think and behave, I truly believe they would be capable of murdering me out of shame if they ever found out that I am a transwoman. I live in an extremely religious environment where people will never accept an LGBT person.

I feel like living in another city in my country is not an option either. The circle of acquaintances is just way too large and I just don't think I can deal with living in this country if I have to be extremely cautious of every step I take.

I've told my mom about wanting to leave, she says that if I decide to go she'll support me. She acknowledges my feelings and fears, and understands that it could potentially be dangerous if I stay here.

What would you do in my situation? And to which country would you go? Does anyone here have any experience with a situation like this? Any recommendations or pointers maybe? 

I hope you can help. Thank you.

kernalmustache,asktransgender,Looking into SRS in Ontario,"Hey everybody :) Tomorrow will mark 9 months since I started HRT (4 months on estrogen). Yesterday I had a doctor's appointment and I was planning on bringing up SRS, but my doctor actually brought it up first! :O (She was even saying that just the day before she had been to a training thing to get certified to recommend OHIP funding.) We were talking about it for a while and I told her that I want to go to Thailand to non-inversion done. If you didn't know, there's only one place to get SRS in Canada and they only do one method which is the most common one. We believe that since people have been approved to go out of country for surgery in the past (including at least one person with OHIP funding going to Thailand) that it should be easier to get approved for surgery outside of Canada with all of the changes they've made to how funding is given. I know things are very different now then they were less than 2 years ago, but does anybody have any tips or recommendations to make sure I get approved? I would also like to know if there's anything else I should be looking into. 

My optimal situation would be get SRS from Suporn during the Summer of 2019, but if I can't get enough funding to go to Suporn I'm okay with going to Chettawut. My doctor says that OHIP will only cover the cost of surgery so I will need to cover the cost of travel, hotel, food, etc. I want to have everything planned out as best as I can so any tips you can give me will be helpful. One question I have is ""Is it okay to wear pads so you don't get blood on your clothes?"" I can't think of anything else at the moment, but I know there's a lot that I'll need to figure out so if you can tell me anything I would appreciate it."
erectiletissue,asktransgender,Post-vaginoplasty: how much erectile tissue was left?,"Hello,

I had a vaginoplasty (penile inversion) 1-2 years ago.

Up until recently my clitoris was too sensitive to enjoy any kind of stimulation, and lack of testosterone has generally killed my libido, so I'm only just starting to be interested in sex/be able to orgasm.

I have noticed that my surgeon has not removed all of the erectile tissue that was in the base of my penis, so when I become aroused it hardens.

I'm not talking 'Hedwig' style stump here, it's more part of the opening of my vagina that becomes engorged and stiffens up. I feel self-conscious about it.

For those of you who have had a vaginoplasty, how much erectile tissue was left? Has it been a problem having a sex life?

I have no experience with 'natal' vaginas; do they do the same thing?"
SlepGudOistr,asktransgender,"Giving Up ""Passions"" to move on w/ Life?","I don't think there is a way I can continue to do some things I do if I want to continue on this journey. Things like video games, playing guitar, etc. I'm unsure if it's the right call... I feel like these things are only holding me back, like I'm using them as a distraction from hating myself. Like a coping mechanism, I guess.

I'm so invested in these things that I haven't the will to move on with my life. I'm **constantly** in my room playing games or guitar or listening to music or watching movies. I know hobbies are good, and being passionate about something could be good, but, the amount of time and effort I've *wasted* on beating a game 100% or rewatching *The Good, The Bad, &amp; The Ugly* for the 20th time could be used to **better** myself... 

I'm sick of it. I just don't know an alternative that will sufficiently satisfy whatever part of my brain that longs for happiness. I'm not gonna turn to drugs or anything, but, I feel like what I'm doing now is no better... I don't know what to do. I don't know what can fill that void. :(

**Not so much a question, just venting, I guess. But, I guess I'll ask if anyone else has given up on their ""passion"" or hobby in pursuit of a better life, either through or alongside transitioning or even just replacing them with something better? Any tips, reccomendations?** 

I *am* seeing a therapist, and I'll talk with her about this next time I see her, as well. "
SevenFates,asktransgender,[MtF] Breast Soreness In Evening | Growth or Exercise Induced?,"So as my flair states, I've been on HRT for about seven months now. I've been having the tender/soreness behind the nipples since about the four month mark. I'm not too concerned that I haven't seen much growth yet [feminization has been confirmed by peers].

Here's the situation. Been on 100mg spironolactone since February last year, where before starting my testosterone was around 12 ng/ml, and at the end of May started at 2mg estradiol (brand at the time). A month after starting estrogen, my testosterone was down to about 6. 

Fast forward to about November, when health insurance decided it wasn't going to cover brand name, and the pharmacy. This happened a few weeks before my next blood panel was scheduled, and so when we discussed my results in the beginning of December, it was nearly 9 again. So we drove my estradiol dose up to 4mg/day and had me do another panel a month from that date. At this point, my estrogen was around 180-200pg/ml. 

It definitely worked, because on my next blood panel, my T was around 2.75, near rock bottom, and my E was around 280. I learned the results this past Friday. This leads up to the situation I wanted to lay context for.

I'm overweight; it's something I've dealt with most of my life but depression generally demotivated me from doing anything about. I decided belatedly that my New Year's resolution would be to work off my belly and the jiggle on my upper back. So I started exercising yesterday. Crunches for ten minutes with five pound dumbbells, and then running up and down the stairs for ten minutes with dumbells clutched up in a prolonged bicep curl until my arms are sore. 

The way I was holding the dumbbells put my forearms where they're basically just shy of squeezing my breasts together (You know, that 'I'm holding up my shirt and squeezing my boobs together look'). My question is is it possible that my breasts were sore simply from working out, or is it more likely that, with my hormones at the bottom of the line for a guy and my estradiol on par with a woman at ovulatory peak, my breasts are finally starting to grow outward?"

I'm like a month away from starting T, and the closer I get the more scared I get. I'm usually really chill and relaxed, but this last month I've just been a ball of stress and anxiety. Every time I take a step closer, the more I want to run away and disappear from existence. 
I'm not sure if this is all my subconscious trying to warn me that I'm making a mistake, or if it's just me being scared and nervous for the inevitable changes and hardships that come with transitioning.

SomeKindOfAGhost,asktransgender,I just need some encouragement. What can I do to get through this dark period?,"Its been a little over 4 months for me, and I'm getting OK results, but life seems to be doing its best to kill me. 

My wife and I recently decided to end our romantic relationship, as she is just not attracted to me at all (Which in a way is a positive. She no longer sees me as male at all, which is amazing, but shes also not a lesbian). We're still great friends, and aren't going to divorce until it becomes necessary for one of us to move on in life. 

Additionally, my parents (and to a lesser extent, the vast majority of my family) are doing their best to make me feel as guilty as possible, telling me how miserable I'm making everyone and how I'm responsible for my grandmothers health problems (things that I know are not my fault and refuse to feel guilty for, but its irritating having people in my life that insist on continuing this behavior)

I'm very quickly realizing how many of my friends were really my wife's friends. Shes always been that BFF for me, but she has several other girlfriends that she's super close with, whereas I have none. 

I'm also in the middle of laser, and as such still have some beard shadow that causes me to stay in more than it should. I can cover it with foubdation, but sometimes I just need to run to the store, and im not going to spend 30 minutes doing makeup just to run out to buy cheese for tacos.

I'm getting very discouraged by my facial bone structure. I have a very defined jaw and I'm worried that it's bone, not muscle, and it'll never go away. I will never have money for FFS so it's become a major bugaboo in my mind when thinking about eventually being fulltime. 

I've always dealt with suicidal thoughts, and I know how to fight them. I would never take my own life when my 3 kids are so dependent on me, but its hard to feel optimistic that I'll ever look feminine enough to go full time, and now that I've come out on Facebook, if I don't eventually go full time I'll feel like a horse's ass.

I'm just not sure what to do. I dont want to fall into a self-propagating cycle of self-pity and harm, but I'm just not sure how to break out of it at the moment. I know in my heart itll get better, that changes will continue and I'll eventually get to where I'm going, but my head is really fighting that right now. Is anyone else where I'm at right now?"

lostpaw,asktransgender,Need help.. I'm a singer or used to be.,"I'm a trans woman pre hormones. I'm 23 and ever since coming out with what has been eating me alive since I was a child, I've been the happiest I've ever been even more then I thought was possible. I've went from a depressed and anxious slob in constant chronic pain, into a beautiful, confidant and happy woman. Life hasn't ever even began to compare to how I feel now. Life is good for the first time in all of my existence.

It's Friday today so I was enjoying my day off just having a blast with everything I was doing. I decided to pick up my old guitar. I began strum my favorite song ( sweater weather - the neighborhood ). As my pick crossed each properly tuned string I felt that amazing adrenaline filled serenity I've always revived from music. Instinctively I drew a breath and started to sing until.. my male voice rang out. I immediately stopped what I was doing and dropped my guitar on its face. I cupped my hands over my mouth almost trying to pull the words back in. There was a moment of pure dread, the type of dread I haven't felt in a long long time. I shortly burst into tears curled over my guitar and it's now broken strings. I didn't know what to do but to cry...

I have been doing a lot of vocal training, waist training, and working out. Basically anything I can do to prepare myself for the day my body begins to develop into whatever form it decides. For some unknown reason this major thing slipped through the cracks in my mind.

 I never thought my voice training wouldn't impact my ability to sing. I thought they would go hand in hand. Needless to say, I'm devastated. My passion, my escape is something I can't touch again if I am to become myself.  

I guess I'm making this post to see if there is anything, even the smallest chance or any resources that I can obtain to help myself become the singer I am.. or was again.. 

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read through this.

While I eventually made it into the room and met some incredible people whom I'm very glad to now call my friends, when I was outside I ended up calling my mother in tears and telling her how scared and alone I felt. When I got home later that night this beautiful possum plushie was sitting on a chair waiting for me. It was honestly the first time since I'd told her I was starting HRT that I felt like she supported me.

So yeah, I'm curious what's the possession(s) that's most important to you? Doesn't have to be trans related."

* Unstable relationships

* Unclear or unstable self-image

* Impulsive, self-destructive behaviors

* Self-harm

* Extreme emotional swings

* Chronic feelings of emptiness

* Explosive anger

I was watching a music video, and there is someone who is female on it. Basically, I saw her, it intensifies my dysphoria. I then thought what if I where like her, then I got really angry, and I just have this really strong urge, almost uncontrollable thing where I tense my arm muscles, and just kicked my leg forward.


I sometimes have moments where I just throw my phone down onto my bed, or I kick my mattress, and often I tense my leg/arm muscles as well. Other times I just tense all my face muscles. 


It only happens on my own, as that is when my dysphoria is the worse. When I am with others and I get it (quite rare) I just tense my arm muscles slightly.


It's almost uncontrollable. Kind of like a reflex almost. It's like instead of getting upset I get angry.

jmyle,asktransgender,I want to start HRT knowing fully well my family would react badly if they found out - any advice?,"*EDIT:* thank you all for the responses. I keep saying this but it means a lot. I'm probably going to talk some stuff through with my therapist and see what options I could have. Thank you so much. 

I've posted on here before about feeling really stuck - I pretty much know I'm trans but I can't do anything about it since my family is blatantly transphobic and I know they won't be on board. But I don't want to wait any longer because I feel like not being able to transition is really eating at me. I want to at least start HRT (for me it'd be testosterone) to see how I feel, and just see where I go from there. Just waiting and doubting myself day after day as I've done for years isn't going anywhere.

I can get on T fairly easily, I've done my research and if I wanted to start T this month or next month I probably could, and I'm grateful for that. The only issue is that my family at the moment pays for my college tuition, and although I'm living in another continent, I fly back to visit during winter and summer break. If I started T now, I'd be at least 3 or 4 months on it when I have to fly back to family in the summer. I know some effects are not too difficult to hide, but I'd be lying to myself if I said that they wouldn't notice something. 

I know they'll be so angry if I told them about being trans after starting HRT myself without informing them, but I also know that if I told them beforehand, they would never let me do it, would basically feed the whole ""you're lying to yourself and we know what's best for you"" card. 

I'm incredibly stuck. I don't want them to cut off my college funding, or pull me out of school, which unfortunately is a realistic possibility. But I don't want to wait until I'm financially independent to start HRT - I just can't stand waiting any longer. I've known trans guys who've waited years and years to start but somehow I just can't continue waiting anymore. 

Should I just start T, to see how I feel and how it goes? And what I might be able to hide from my family? Any advice? It's incredibly risky to just take such a big leap without telling family in any way, but I'm almost willing to risk it all. Thanks everyone. "

zauraz,asktransgender,I have to choose.. Idk what to do?,"By now a year has passed since asked myself if I was trans and came out as unsure of my gender to my best friends and mother.

During this year I arranged so that I will get gender therapy which will take 1,5 years but allow me access to hormones.

But. I have never been secure in this. In private I have wished and dreamt of being a girl. From wearing lingerie and being able to 'find myself sexy' and beautiful instead of looking like a fucking monster to wearing really any form of female clothing in a female body. 

What I just said above is pretty stupid but I hate myself for the lingerie part feeling like I am objectifying it or anything.

I am scared of my own desire to wear things like that. Its like the highest of the list of things I want to do but it feels impossible...

Somewhere I know that I do want a female body. I can't explain why but it seems preferable in everyway imaginable aesthetics wise. And my current body I only see upon with scorn and disgust.

-------

However back to the case. Whilst I did came out a year ago I am too afraid to commit in real life. There is one thing to want in your thoughts and dreams and another to live it out in real life.

I never told my mom truly what I wanted. I still have not and I can't.. I am too ashamed and scared even if she already knows to tell her directly that I want to have a female body. To be a girl.

And idk it just feels like I can't bridge this gap between reality and my thoughts. I can't act upon this out of fear that I am wrong. I am unsure if my choice is right?

I am sorry for this post but I don't know what to do truly. It looks like I am heading down the path of transitioning but the idea and consequences feel weird and surreal. Idk how that life would be and how it would affect people around me... 

On top of it all it feels like I will never really ever be a 'real girl'.. Which I logically know does not exist..

throwaway100097,asktransgender,NSFW post. Advice from MtF strongly wanted.,"Warning NSFW.

I am a cis male and my girlfriend is a transgender preop female. To understand my situation and to properly advise I think you need to know a little about our past.

We met about 5 months ago at a mutual friend's party. We enjoyed enjoyed each others company and joked around so much that we exchanged numbers and facebooks. After a week or so we set up a date and we continued dating. One night we went to one of her friends party and got intoxicated. In our mutual drunken state we went to her place and were about to do the ""stuff"". After some typical ""pregame"" activities She took off her pants and when I saw a penis I was caught off guard (she is on the chubbier side so she has natural breast and curves). At the time I was closed minded and lacked impulse control because of the alcohol so I insulted her (I won't repeat it, but for the sake of giving accurate advice it was pretty homophobic/transphobic words) and left. The next day in a better mindset I realized that I did love her and even though I'm not into penises, i'm into her. I messaged her and apologized and a few days after she apologized too for not letting me know beforehand. We both agreed that us both being drunk/high that night impaired our decision making possibilities. Water under the bridge.

Since then we started back dating and have been going strong ever since. I once asked for a BJ in a joking manner and unexpectedly she agreed. So she has been giving me bj's for a while but has never asked for one herself. Which leads me to my weird situation - I want to have sex with her, but I'm not attracted to her penis nor do I know if she wants anything done to her penis. I've fingered her butt during bj's before, but i've never done anything to her penis. 

How do I bring up having sex with her in a way that makes her comfortable (seeing as how our first encounter was less than ideal)? Even though I'm not into penis i want her to enjoy sex too, but I'm not sure if she wants anything done with her penis. I know from researching online that some MtF consider any touching of their penis a giant turn off yet some enjoy it, do i just ask her what she'd like directly or would that be weird/insensitive? Any MtF reading this, how would you like to be asked about the involvement of your penis during sex? How would you like to be asked to be bottom'd? Should I even ask or should I just go with the flow?

sorry for the weird and personal question. I wanted to have sex with her new years night, but i didn't want to upset/trigger her by saying the wrong thing. I truly care for her so i don't want to upset her in anyway. She's a virgin and I've only ever been with cis women prior so I want this milestone to be special and as least awkward as possible."
Jazz8680,asktransgender,"First day back at college, felt fine in class?","Like during class all of the thoughts and feelings about maybe being transgender disappeared. Like it was only a slight thought. I was able to completely focus during class.

hello_myself,asktransgender,I've been dreaming of myself as a man,"Hey all! =)

So, I never really dreamed up until recently, I guess because of depression/anxiety I didn't remember my dreams. I started on antidepressants around 3 weeks ago, and these past few days I've been having dreams.

My issue is, in these dreams I have my current body. I don't dream that I am a woman, I'm not a woman in those dreams. I'm a man. And while there are other things that point towards me being trans, it seems to be a shared experience that most of us have to dream that we are our actual gender, and not our assigned gender.

In one of these dreams I was buying makeup with my mother, but still, I was a man in this dream. The other dreams are not at all related to gender/gender expression.

Did/does anyone else have a similar experience to mine in regards to this?"

Reon98,asktransgender,Feel Like a Lesbian?,"Okay. I want to preface by saying this is in no way meant to sound offensive so please correct me if I say anything that is.

I have always had little things that could have hinted at me being trans. Thoughts here and there, most of them never took hold until last year when I came out as bisexual.

Obviously, now, I am questioning my gender as well. One of the things I'm having trouble sorting out though is my sexuality in relation.

I entered a relationship a few months ago. I've been in relationships before- good and bad- and I kind of figured that I knew how they generally felt both ways. This one is very different. I mean, in many ways, it's the same. We still do much of the same stuff my last SO and I did, but something feels very different here.

We are both bi, so I wouldn't necessarily refer to our relationship as straight, heterosexual feels more accurate even though I suppose functionally they are the same. The reason I make this distinction though is because I don't really feel like I'm dating someone of the opposite gender.

I don't know how to accurately explain this so I'm going to give it my best shot. Basically, the relationship doesn't feel straight to me. When I'm with this girl, I feel like I'm in a gay relationship. And like, I realize that for all intents and purposes, I am a man (or pretransition trans, not sure).  But for some reason, I don't see our relationship as a man and woman thing- I see it as two girls.

So here's my list of fears and possibilities that do not include me being trans.

-What if I have just fetishized lesbians and the second I end up in a sexual relationship I can only get off from that perspective?

-what if this girl just treats me like she'd treat girls in a relationship and I'm getting confused?

-what if I'm just generally missing the mark and this is what love is supposed to feel like?

I mean, in any case, if this relationship ends up working out and I end up marrying this person, I suppose it doesn't matter because I'll be happy either way. Not that I'm considering marriage heavily right now, but my point is that I have plenty of time to question and query. In any case, it's a large curiosity. So, I guess I'm asking, does anyone have any insight here? What are your thoughts?"

zhurai,asktransgender,Help with deciding VFS options,"Hi. (VFS = Vocal Feminization Surgery)

So I was wondering about VFS options that I have.  I have done my own research and was originally going to go with Yeson, but not so sure bc of one important aspect I need....  Anyways.


So I need VFS because the regular vocal feminization isn't working out, and I also need to have a tracheal shave, as my adam's apple is very prominent... so I can't wear a choker, and have to use a scarf when leaving the house... and have to tie it around the neck which reminds me of a tie, which triggers my dysphoria somewhat.


So I emailed Yeson awhile ago because of the options (vs the one in Bakersfield, CA vs the one in Portland Oregon, vs the one in New York, vs Yeson in South Korea)   Yeson was the best.

However they told me in an email that they do not perform the procedure at all, and if I want to have the procedure, to find a specialized surgeon who can carefully perform this surgery without damaging the muscles.

But I'm leaning towards not sure if I really want to do Yeson (at that travel price point) if I can't also do the tracheal shave there too.

So I was wondering about the other options (Bakersfield, Portland, and New York) or if I missed some 

Thanks in advance x_x, really need to figure this out soon as my parents are asking for more information right now (yes they are accepting about it)

I'll be interviewing in about 12 hours for the same position as the trans-unfriendly mid-management as a replacement for the very person who caused me the most strife (information comes from same director, who is conducting the interviews). 

I am qualified, most over-educated, but I've been kept at the lowest ranks through actions of others. Making the jump to that level and skipping in between steps is nearly unheard of, and most are denied even an interview outright. 

For once, I'm actually feeling anxiety about an interview. If I get this, I'll be the first openly transgender manager for the company in my state, and the whole south, for a multinational corporation.

I'm afraid of surgery not being covered in 2018 so I really want to get it done in 2017. A friend of mine who had hers done with Satterwhite this past summer told me about Dr. Heidi Wittenberg, also at Brownstone &amp; Crane and her credentials are really impressive and I've seen 3 examples of her work and it looks really good.

_Amoeva,asktransgender,Do I have to change of endocrinologist ?,"Hello there,

Two days ago I had an appointment with an endocrinologist. It was a recommandation from another trans girl I met on Facebook (I don't live in very LGBT-friendly place). 

Since hormones make a big part in your mood and body, I want to be sure to be followed by someone who is skilled and empathetic. 

He was 30mn late for my appointment, and ask some questions I didn't know he had to ask. Like ""For how long did you knew you were trans ?"", or ""Did you played with dolls as a kid ?"", and stuff like ""Are you 100% sure you aren't just gay ?""

He gaves me the prescription for the blood test, and I'm going to do it anyway, but did you experienced questions like that with you endocrinologist ? Would you advise me to find someone else ? He's an old man, so I presume he is competent in his job, and he had other trans clients.

But I'm worried about the fact that I know more things on the subject (like words gender that he didn't use, even if it's pretty common in France, 99% use the word ""sex"" for genitals and gender, only activists use the term gender tbh)

Do you have some experiences to share maybe ?

TL;DR : my endocrinologist is an man who seems to have some clichés about trans people, even if he seems skilled in his work. Do I have to find someone else ?"

He hugged me and then went like ""WAIT WHY DO YOU HAVE BOOBS"". And I spoke ""because I'm a girl"" (my voice never sounded that good irl).

Then i had another one, i was standing in a hallway, and i went to the male toilet. It was gross, disgusting, and only urinals. It looked like a torture room. So i got out of there, and went to the female toilet instead. It looked like a some futuristic fancy room, and when i took my pants off, nothing was there. Felt so damn good.

At the end i was in the locker room, probably in a swimming pool. Of course i had way more feminine body than i do irl. I was anxious, but switched to swimsuit and my friend came to talk with me. Then we joined the group (I believe it was supposed to be my class), and our teacher started checking me out and said ""Deadname?!"". I was like ""No..."" and she said that i look kinda manly. I started to cry and someone said ""Damn, it's enough to make her cry?"". That was the end of the dream.

This really freaked me out. We always planned to adopt at least one child but we want to have a kid that is our offspring as well. 

Because I hadn't really thought of this scenario I started HRT 3 weeks ago thinking my sperm producing days were behind me. So far I've been only on spiro at the rate of 100mg for the first week and 200mg for the past two weeks.

They're not many, but it's strikingly clear that I'm not in any photos. But some people do make the connection, and usually it's a little uncomfortable for me. I am really selective about who I show old photos to. I actually have a photo album of almost all of the photos of me before digital cameras got big. And copies of digital ones are hard to come by if you're not me, so it's not likely for anyone to see old photos unless I'm showing them. Or, they visit my parents' house.

Guests have asked, ""oh, who's this?"" and typically I don't feel comfortable outing myself. Thankfully my little brother has come up with ""oh that's just cousin Donny - we don't talk about him anymore"".

It's not my house, and I'm here rarely. I've talked to my mother about it, and for her taking them down would be some kind of erasure, which I understand and respect.

M-Mouth,asktransgender,Gender vs Sex,"Hi r/asktransgender. Question for you.

In a society where gender roles are so strictly assigned to the sexes, is a discomfort with the gender role associated with ones biological sex ever a factor, consciously or subconsciously, in feeling as though one is in the incorrect body? If in future we live in a more androgynous, gender neutral society would more people decide they don't need to change their physical body?

Maybe I am being naive. I know certain people don't transition physically at all at present, but perhaps binary gender roles haven't been so deeply entrenched in their psyche.

I'm not trying to refute the fact that biological birth sex can oppose someones identity btw. I just was interested in gender and it's role (particularly the totally superficial, such as who wears dresses and who doesn't).

OnlyMyCatKnows4Sure,asktransgender,Had my first LHR appointment last Friday. Now a few questions.,"As the subject says, I had my first Laser Hair Removal appointment. And I’m wondering if others have had these experiences.

After my session I noticed when I got home there were 20 or so long and very dark hairs on my face that were sticking out of my otherwise clean shaven skin. I’m assuming they were brought to the surface by the laser. But I haven’t seen it mentioned in other LHR posts. So I’m wondering if that’s just a thing that happens?

I’m a little over two days post treatment now. And the edge of my jawline and chin are still a bit swollen and sore. These were by far the most painful areas for me. So it tracks. But I’m wondering if my experience is typical, and how long it lasts for others? 

Finally. At one point between the sharpness of the pain and the rapidity with which it was happening (thank you chin hair density!) I got this overwhelming endorphin rush and was like two zaps away from breaking down in tears. The tech was really good about stopping when I needed a moment. But aside from that, and breathing exercises, and being hopefully even more numb than I was for this session. Does anyone have any tips for how to get through those moments?

tapukagakoko,asktransgender,a reminder that privilege is contextual,"hey, longtime lurker. i don't really post here that often, but the current conversation on this sub made me feel like i needed to share my views on this. i don't expect most people to agree with me on this, but here goes:

context is incredibly important to the conversation about dynamics of privilege. you can’t dismiss transmens’ concerns (and nonbinary peoples' concerns, for that matter) about feeling uncomfortable here with replies of “oh well you have male privilege so lol”. because privilege doesn’t work like that. it isn’t a blanket “oh men are privileged and women aren’t”, it’s a complex chain of events with different circumstances that happen to favor a certain group over another in the grand scheme of things. the dynamics of privilege skew differently depending on where you are and what situation you’re currently in. 

in the context of this sub, i believe that transwomen have more privilege than transmen and non binary folks, and that the transwomen should do more to accommodate transmen and non binary people, and recognize their own privilege. i don’t want any trans person to feel like like they’re unwelcomed on this sub. r/asktransgender is a sub made for all trans people, not just transwomen, so let’s all act like it."

THROWAWAY-u_u,asktransgender,Coming out advice...?,"Hi. Uh, I'ma give some background information on myself if that's alright with y'all.

I'm seventeen and a senior in high school. I'm openly bisexual but I'm a closeted dude-who-wants-to-be-a-girl. I figured myself out a few years ago and my parents have known for a while. They (my mom especially, who was grew up the missionary life) are weirded out by it but are supportive of whatever will make me happy. 

My dad outed me to my gay younger sister the other day, which was lame in that I didn't ask him to, but is also reliving. She didn't care and it feels good to have at least one sibling out of the way (although, granted, the easiest of the bunch.)

So that's three down and the rest of the world to go.

I *want* to force myself to come out after high school, but the more I think about it the more nervous I get. 

I feel stupid because I feel like a guy. I wanna be a girl, but I still *feel* like a guy. I'm tall, I have broad shoulders and a strong jawline, my voice is deep, I have a permanent stubble that refuses to get properly shaved. I hate it and I want to change it, but it's still the current me.

Suddenly coming out one day, proclaiming to the world that I wanna be a pretty princess and telling all my friends to call me she... It's just weird. I don't want to be a *dude pretending to be a girl* I want to be *passing.* But obviously that's not how things work and I need to be a dude pretending to be a girl first.

So yeah, that's my situation and unfortunate mindset. I'd appreciate advice and insight from people who have gone through this step already... Thanks."

itsmecara,asktransgender,"Selfie filters(snapchat, meitu) making anyone else feel majorly dysphoric?!?",Have been playing around with some apps these last few days and I've left myself more dysphoric the more I've kept editing myself. Clearly stepping away from that now.
CallMeJCYT,asktransgender,What can I do as a person who wants to talk to a gender therapist but can't as it isn't feasible at the moment?,"I want to discuss things like, if I'm a transgender woman, if I am just a gay cisgender man."
GreenWitch22,asktransgender,What was your most awkward moment while transitioning?,"So, I just came from seeing the new resident evil movie, since I didn't want to get up to go pee during the movie I waited until the end. So I go into the men's went pee and came out. I got up early so I could go in and out with no hassle.
Here comes the awkward part, as I walk out a group of guys start to walk in. They look at me, one of the guys said wait is this the women's bathroom they continue to look for the sign that said male. 

They thought I was a female this was validating and awkward. 

What was your most awkward moment in public while transitioning?"
punstressed,asktransgender,god. dammit.,"Every time I build up the confidence to come out to my mom (or both my parents) something ""terrible"" happens to her or something stressful. And she's one of those people that just dumps all of their problems on to you and it's overwhelming and then you feel bad and you don't feel like you have any room for your own problems. I feel like if I come out to her, I'll just be another one of her problems or stressers, but it's killing me. I'm debating whether or not I should just do it or not. Because I don't think I will get anywhere if I don't just take the plunge. Idk. I'm not expecting anyone to respond to this because there's nothing much to say I just. dont have anyone to talk to about this."
carlav29,asktransgender,"I'm kind of nervous, about school","Few months ago, I decided to go to the school with my nails painted (And I was really nervous, but I needed it). Days later, my coordinator told me that I couldn't enter to classes if I didn't take of the paint of my nails, so I decided to talk with him about I am transgender, and maybe his opinion could change; but no, he was kind of comprehensive but still with the same decisition. -I was afraid, so I was like 'Ok, I could paint my nails later'-. Some weeks later, (by December) he told me that I had to cut my hair (And it wasn't long!) or I couldn't make my exams when we arrive of vacation. I asked my parents to go to the school and say that they couldn't do that, but their answer was no (they neither wan't me with long hair), so that night I went to my bed crying, bc I really didn't want to cut my hair. Thinking on more options, I realized that I could go to an organization agains discrimination in my city, so I went, and they told me that they could do something, that they couldn't do that, and it wasn't right. So, yesterday they sent a message to the school, explaining them that they couldn't do that, and that I have some right that they couldn't avoid; my principal called to my mother in order to talk with my and that I take out my complaint. Last night my mother talked with me, that I was so selfish, bc I was affecting to my coordinator, and that I went so far, but I didn't have another option. So, today the principal made an appointment with my mom (and I'm going to go with her) but I'm so nervous, idk why"
tomatoes-comatose,asktransgender,Peripheral vision....,"I had heard this theory somewhere that females had better peripheral vision than males, so I wanted to ask, if you've noticed, how has your peripheral vision changed since transition?"
MissTinaLuv,asktransgender,Am I crazy for considering these procedures?,I don't think I'd ever be comfortable with transitioning unless I could have femoral shortening to make me shorter and clavicle reduction to make me less broad shouldered. I've heard you can get them done by surgeons in Asia.
forlackofabetterusr,asktransgender,"Been feeling desperate for physical affection, need advice (18/MtF)","So for some context, ive just started E and I've been on blockers for nearly a year now. I'm fully out and present female (and apparently I pass really well). I'm a demisexual queer girl.

Lately my physical loneliness has been getting to me more and more, I haven't even hugged anyone near my age in about 8 months. I have a few irl friends, but since they are all pretty new, I'm way too shy to try to hug them. I've been trying like heck to meet potential dates, but it's really difficult. I live in a small town in Canada, and I live too far from Vancouver or Toronto to date anyone there. I'm extremely socially anxious and has Avoidant personality disorder as well. I feel conflicted between wanting to meet someone and rush right away and cuddle, or being friends for some time and slowly moving into things. I feel like my options are extremely limited due to a variety of reasons. Honestly I really want a partner, but it sucks that it will take a long time to find the right person, build up a friendship, hope they like me back, then date them. Heck, right now I'm struggling to make and keep friends. I'd kill to be able to have someone to cuddle with, to hold me, even if  it's platonically.

Now I'm left at the question, what should I do? I'm on dating sites, I'm doing my best, but I still struggle with my depression. I do have one irl friend that I have a bit of a crush on, but we haven't even hugged before, so idk if I could ask them if they want to cuddle, I'm way too scared of ruining my friendships to do anything  :("
mdledl,asktransgender,How can I be considerate towards trans people who can't or don't want to pass?,"I've recently begun to pass regularly, and as someone who was a body building football player a year ago this was not something I ever expected to happen.

For that reason I'm pretty much entirely ignorant towards the concept and controversy of passing and the privilege it grants, and that ignorance has led me to inadvertently say things that hurts friends of mine who have given up on passing. 

I think it'd be more efficient to educate myself more instead of playing whack-a-mole with these hurtful comments. Trouble is, I don't really know where to look.

In short, where should I turn to educate myself on how to check this newfound privilege? What's the ""Between The World And Me"" of passing privilege? Do y'all have any tips on how I can be a little less of an ass? "

NenaDaconte,asktransgender,Thanks everyone for helping me through last night.,"Last night was so painful. Thanks everyone for helping me through. I still feel grief for my hair that's gone but I'm going to fight back. I lost my hair but not my estrogen. I'm going to handle this as best as I can and try to look as cute as I can with short hair. 

I felt so much better after all those awesome words of love and you all were so thoughtful. 

They cut my hair but they didn't cut the woman out of me. In a few years I will look back and be happy that I made it through and fought against my parents bigotry. 

A big hug for you all. Your words of love meant a lot."
tgebw,asktransgender,Who do you talk to?,"I'm 25 MtF, pre-everything. I've come out to my close friends and roommates, but not my family. My problem is that the only 2 people I know who seem to understand and are willing to have a conversation about it are both a thousand miles away. Everyone else has been supportive but they don't really understand dysphoria or why I would want to transition. I want to start planning to transition, but I feel kinda overwhelmed by the amount of planning that needs to be done and someone to talk it over with would be fantastic. That and if I had a girlfriend to teach me how to do my makeup, oh my god I'd be so happy. Anywho, thoughts?

TLDR
Don't have many people to talk to about planning transition, how do others deal with that?"
Ashleytobe,asktransgender,Questions about boobs.,After being on hrt for 3 years my boobs are still tiny. Why? And how to make them bigger?
Seapion,asktransgender,Why the hell do people hate us so much?,"I'm sorry to post such negativity, but this is just eating me right now. [CW: Mention of violence, transphobia, etc.]

I was on twitch, and I see that Narcissa Wright is streaming. Even just looking at the chat in the thumbnail, I can tell it's toxic.

Some examples:

""[Deadname] your being-a-woman thing is really childish""

""hes still a dude""

""if u gotta dick your still a dude""

Those aren't even the worst of them. 

But this got me thinking about all the abuse trans people get all the time. Many of us are harassed, beaten, discriminated against, and berated constantly. Many of us have lost family and friends due to being trans.

Why? Why are we constantly treated like sub-humans?

What have we done to be treated so terribly? I just want to be treated like a person, dammit!

Again, I'm sorry to be so negative. Tbh I'm probably gonna delete this whithin 5 hours anyways, assuming it begins getting downvoted to hell."
anonymous33022,asktransgender,My mom has sent me all these transphobic articles over the past 2 months. She is still sending them. What do you think? I've been so gaslighted by my family I still question whether I'm sane. They act and talk like Leelah Alcorn's psychopathic parents. They terrify me.,"Edit: I updated the post and added things meant to be in it like her texts.

These articles she texted me were also accompanied by texts. But these aren't all the articles she sent me.

And these texts which aren't even 5% of her texts to me in the past 2 months. Also whenever she is nice and acting loving in these texts it's as fake as Leelah Alcorn's psychopathic parents. Any promise made in these texts are false. I've spent a lifetime of being professionally manipulated by these people in all things. They are also good at it because they are business people. They are almost alt-right conservative non denomination Protestant Christians. My mom is a passive aggressive manipulative person. She emotionally abused me thoroughly growing up and controlled everything about me. I've been gaslighted my whole life by her. Also the rest of my family was just as bad they all think alike. They don't respect me in the slightest. Everything they do for me they use inversely for power over me by guilting me. I've been scared of them my whole live. I've know I was trans and bi-sexual since kindergarten. Repressed it in order to survive. I was suicidal from elementary school to high school until I finally moved out. I even attempted suicide under their roof. Nothing she says is ever sincere unless it's a threat which she does all the time. Everything in these texts are in reference to transgender people. They aren't all the text messages and the phone conversations were the worst. She also sent like a hundred photos of me as a boy. Also in phone conversations and other texts not included on here she loves to emphasize on son, boy, man, and whatnot. She's also told me stories of why it's disgusting being a woman like having to have her cervix scraped for medical reasons stories to try and scare me. Also my parents have checked this website and place being r/asktransgender looking for me and I just want to say FUCK YOU MOM AND DAD and get the fuck off of here and respect my privacy. Here are some examples of my Mom professionally gaslighting me in texts and also through articles that were above. Fuck you Mom. Also the texts progressively slightly get worst. If you don't want to read it all then read it from the bottom to the top:

I want you to know we love u!  We don't know what is going on internally, but if you need someone to talk to we are here  for you.  I'm sure u feel alone at this time and we pray that u can feel The Lords peace and love.  No one or thing can make us happy.  People search and search but only God can fulfill our true happiness.  Satan is so sneaky and so smart to know what to do and put thoughts in our mind that he wants us to believe that are lies!  We need to stay away from fire and his evil enticing schemes that look so inviting, but they are like an example of the deadly apple from the evil witch that enticed Snow White!  It looks so good,  but in the end it destroys and kills us.  Please call us and if there is anything we can do please let us know.  We will always love you!  
I'm pretty sure I know whAt u were planning on doing and very confused as to why you are thinking this.  This was never u and I'm not sure who U are turning into,  but it is very concerning.  We love u and always will, but just don't know how you could turn 360 degrees.  We hope that someday you can forgive us for whatever you are so mad at and so bitter about.  We thought we have loved you and done everything we could for you to succeed.  I always fought for u and always wanted happiness for you!  I'm so sorry that you are not happy and having so much internal turmoil.  It hurts me so much and I will continue to pray for you and trust God will bring you peace as you struggle with this internal battle!  I have know idea, but I still love u and always will!
You may want to talk to psychiatrist about side effects of ur meds. 
I love you more then words can explain! I'm so sorry and I want to help you any way I can.  I just want you to be happy!  You have always been such a special kid and so dear to my heart and everyone around you! You have so many great qualities!  I know God has a special plan for you son!
Memories!  I love! ❤️
I'm very concerned and I really want to talk to u!    We can help u and at this time u need support from the people who love u!  Family will always love u no matter what!   We may have always not been nice Or not said the right things because we are human, but we will always unconditionally love u!  Just like Christ love for us!  All we want is to help u and bring back ur happiness!  There is hope in all circumstances.  Sometimes it doesn't seem like it, but we always have seasons in our lives and this helps us to grow and become stronger!  Life is all about learning.  We have to make the choice to be happy!  We are the only ones who can make that choice! Our mind is a powerful tool!  We have to tell our mind how to think! Don't let Satan take over ur mind he wants u and he wants to have u depressed and to control ur thoughts!  U can rebuke him and he will leave u!  Fight (my name) Fight!!! U have so much to fight for and have such a fun loving spirit!  Bring him back!  I love u I love u don't listen to ur thoughts that are the telling u we are lying and out to get u and no one  cares!  It's a lie!! Look back at everything we have done for u!
Dad coach soccer, took u to tennis,  fought for u to be successful!Helped u with hours of school work! Helped You get into College! Paying for College!  Helped you get accommodations!  Bought u a car!  Helped u get a job! Guided u!Loved u! Extremely proud of you! How can u hate us? How can U not want our help?  We want u to be happy!  We are not ur enemy! We are ur parents who love u so much!  It's not a lie!  Please call us! We will figure this out we will do whatever we can to help you figure this out!  
Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
You watching election!! So exciting Trump is doing amazing!!! 
I have done a lot of research on this and I know this is a demonic battle!  Please stop and run from this now before u ruin ur whole future! 
Hormones have cause cancer, blood clots, kidney and liver disease!  Grandma got breast cancer from them!  Women refuse to take them in fear of cancer!  These people don't tell u this!  
I'm sorry u are going through this please run and stop playing with the devil
He wants to kill u he wants to destroy u
It is not too late
I'm taking about This idea that you believe to be a girl trapped in a male body.  This is an occult and they are getting whomever they can convince to think this lie.  God did not get ur identity wrong.  He doesn't make mistakes!  He has a special plan for u yes u have had so
Struggles and sorry we moved and sorry we were hard on u! We were not the best parents but we tried our best and we tried our best with u!  We have always loved u!  Your sister even felt I favored u over her!  Don't u see our family is in spiritual battle?  Satan has trued his hardest to break up our marriage! He has tried to get ahold of your sister and now u!  I have prayed so hard and stayed so close to the Lord!  We tithe we give we try and live our lives as the Bible says but Satan is always there to try and feed us lies I rebuke him I yell at him! And now he has really gone too far! I'm not giving up!  I am not letting him win!  Don't u see he is working so fast because he knows he doesn't have much time!  I fight battles in my head all the time!  U have to read Gods word!  Without Gods armor we are open to the enemy!  Please pray to God and really do you feel this is what he wants of you?  You think this may make you happy but it will bring more confusion! Do u realize how hard it is for us woman to be accepted into this world! Do u know women especially always battle with their looks, weight etc!  We have to have the right clothes the right hair makeup!  Perfect body!  It is awful!  That's why we have anorexia, bulimia! We have to have Botox, plastic surgeries!  It is awful!  We spend thousands of dollars and we still are not happy with ourselves!  Now we have the Kardashians to keep up with! Satan controls our media and now it is worse than ever! It is way harder to be a woman then a man!  
Do u realize 40%of transgen commit suicide!  I do not want u to do this!  
Do u realize they regret that they have done it and it is hard to turn back? Even Caitlyn Jenner
Because they can't change DNA only body  features!  
This explains lots of problems transgen people have!  Cervical cancer! Breast Cancer etc!  This is because if the hormones!  They don't explain that after years of taking these deadly things how they kill you!  So scary! 
❤️u
Please tell me you are not going transgen? You are a good  looking man and you will not look good as a girl!  
When are you planning on talking about this before doing those deadly hormones?  Those therapist don't care about you and what you are doing to your body!  They just want your money!  Do you realize you can get cervical cancer,  and especially breast cancer!  I'm telling u u don't know how badly this is!  I'm saying this because I don't want you to ruin your future!  
You will reap what you sew!  The choices you make you will have to pay a consequence!  I'm warning you and I hope and pray that you stop this thinking!  Please respond! 
Transgender only make 10k a year and are highly discriminated in the world and in the work place!  Lots to think about!  
You have a choice and you will have to live with your consequences! 
If you don't want our help as no people that really love u then go find what u need!  Only family will truly live u and one day u may realize that but until then good luck and finding what makes u happy! 
Well hello again!  
I just want to say we are here for u!  And when you want us please reach out!  We are here and will always love you!  I don't believe you should do this alone.  We all hope you come home next week.  I know this is hard but believe me there is light at the end of the tunnel!  Don't give up!  We are ants in this big world!  Sometimes our minds can play tricks on us!  Don't get sucked into them!  How is ur throat today? 
I love u!  Please go to a counselor if you can about this break up.  They will encourage u and help you thru the pain. I can help you find Christian one.  I would also recommend cognitive therapy also my friend is having her kid do this interesting thing called brain performance!  Very interesting!  Look it up, somehow it changes how the brain works and stimulates it.  Her son is adhd and anxiety and OCD.  Her husband committed suicide a couple of years ago.   You are not alone there are a ton of people going through similar things!  God is the true answer I promise!  My husband nor any friend or parent will always disappoint me but God won't!  We are human God isn't!  We can't put our hope in others and expect them to make us happy.  The quicker you learn this the faster you will get healthy!  I promise!  Yes it is nice to have a companion but we have to realize it   Is someone who makes us a better person and we make them a better person!  The last 2 years I don't believe your relationship was healthy!  It wasn't  happy!  It wasn't balanced!  A healthy relationship only happens when both partners are self sacrificing.  They want the best for the other person!  They never want to see their partner hurt!  They want to do everything for them!  They don't criticize them! They lift them up! Encourage!  Do you believe you were in a healthy loving relationship?  Evaluate what you want!  Look at what you want for your future! You are an attractive man!  You have a loving nature!  You have a bright future!  I love you!!
So how is it going?   I did hear from (my ex) and I told 
Her she could have the crockpot and everything we gave her.  I have an extra crockpot if u want it.  Although u may not use that because I only use it if I'm cooking for more people.  It takes all day and more work then a TV dinner.  I really can't imagine u doing this.  Also,  I know this is a rough time, but I'm sure U will find it does get easier.  I think u should make sure u are socializing with people!  Get some fresh air!  So,  what did u decide about coming home this week?  Everyone really wants to see you.  But it is your choice and we can't make u!  I know u are battling a lot and we wouldn't demand u to talk to us.  We didn't last weekend did we?  We knew some things but didn't bring it up!  We just want to see u!  I have know idea how u feel.  I hope you can find happiness however but I pray that U seek God and his will for U!  Confusion comes at these times when we feel like our lives are falling apart and we feel like we can never be happy, but it is a lie from Satan!  I wish you could talk to us or me.  I will not shun u!  I only want to see you get out of this dark place that u are in.  I know u feel alone and no one understands and maybe we don't!  But we love u!  We may not agree with the choices that u are choosing to make but we do love u!  Just like Christ hates when
We make bad choices he never stops loving us and he is always there for us to turn to!  But we do have a choice and unfortunately sin is in this world &amp; in our bodies and we have to fight against it!  We can choose Our path with God or with Satan! It is our choice and we have to live with the consequences that we make.  Everything we do God sees he is all knowing.  Sometimes we have to go down a rough road before he gets our attention!  And it isn't always fun!  He will always be trying to get ur attention he never gives up!  But remember u also have a choice!  I hope you make the choice to follow God and turn from the evil side. I love u and please run from al evil!  U watch so much horror movies I have always told u not to play with fire and this is fire or Satan and his way to get into ur mind.  Satan is real!  There is evil in this word and so many people will be deceived in the end times and I believe Satan is working extra hard and guess who he starts with the young kids and teens and young adults!  John 10:10
The thief comes only to steal and kill : I have come that they may have life and have it to the full!
2 Tim 4:3-4
For a time is coming when people will no longer listen to sound and wholesome teaching.  They will follow their own desires and will look for teachers who will tell them whatever their itching ears want to hear.  They will reject the truth and chase after myths. 
2 Thessalonians 2:10-12
He will use every kind of evil deception to fool those on their way to destruction, because they refuse to love and accept the truth that would save them.  So God will cause them to be greatly deceived, and they will believe these lies. Then they will be condemned for enjoying evil rather than believing the truth. 
I love you!  I am sending this to show you how the scriptures warns us what will happen in the end times!  Please don't  make choices you will regret later! 
❤️u!!!
(My name) U were suppose to call us!  We are getting worried!  Please let us know how we can help?  (My name) I know weekends are hard!  I think you should come home!  Maybe even tomorrow and stay with us.  Maybe take a semester off !  You need us! Dad and I love u so much and we want to help U!  U can't be alone it is the worst thing u!  Please come home tomorrow?  Please?  (My name) we need a call or a text!  Something or we feel like we need to come get u!!
I don't understand why u don't like us!  We have tried so hard to make u happy and help make u successful !  U should be so
Proud of your accomplishments!  You need to move forward and try and forget about your past and the hurt that u hold in!   (My name) !  I always felt rejected, unwanted, unloved! How could someone abandon me?  I always had a fear of being left!  I was always insecure!  I never trusted
Anyone!  Guess why I was born out of rape!  I don't know my biological father!  I was given away to someone who felt bad and decided to help her sister out!  What else was a sister to do? But i always had to fight my mind!  My deep depression that Satan tried to tell me no one will ever love me!  No one likes me!  Im strange!  I was only an orphan!  But God tells me he is my loving father!  He loves me!  I can trust him and no one  else!  Only he can make me happy!!! That is why I try and explain to u that we need God!  Even with all the love someone tries to give they can't fulfill our happiness!  We have to make ourselves happy!  We have to fight!   
Would u like to call the pych tomorrow so she can possibly meet U this week to maybe get u on a mood stabilizer?
I do think U have a lot to work out.  But also I do  think u need to watch out who u are asking for help
How is it going since u are off ur Prozac?  I'm getting worried about u!  You say u are depressed are  u suicidal at all?  And if u are please get help right away or call 911! U don't know why you are doing this and I just hope u don't make any mistakes or bad choices that u may regret one day.  Please think before u do things and think about how it can effect ur future!  I love u and it is very hard to see u in this state and in so much confusion &amp; turmoil.  Maybe I can go out with (my roommate) tomorrow!  He said he is alone too for Thanksgiving!
Ok but yes it takes time!  And I'm ur mom I love u!  I thought we did the best we could! Obviously ur relationship with (my ex) is not meant to be.  At this time u need to make sure u make good decisions!  I know when ur made and hurt sometimes we do things to get back at people or we feel so hurt that we don't care anymore!  I did things I regretted when
This happened to me!  I can't take back the mistakes i made! I paid severe consequences!  I regret choices that I made!  I can never take them back.  I'm just saying before U make choices think of how it will impact future relationships that u may have!   
Well they say the brain doesn't develop till ur 24. I do believe this!  I think kids do so many bad things while in High school and college because they don't have a developed brain.   They don't realize they may hurt their body or do things that will hurt them or the people whom they get together with.  Also the choices we do we will always have to live with,  we will never forget the things we did the things we watch the things we read!  They will always be a part of us and we then sometimes have secrets and they eat at us they drive us crazy!  We can never tell anyone because of these things!  But if we live our lives as pure as we can without any guilt we don't have to worry.  
The service was so good!  So many people are having issues right now!  People listen to their thoughts and think it is ok!  It is from the enemy and he tells us we feel like this and we should do it!  It is Satans Lies!  He tells us leave our husband!  Watch this and do it! If it feels good we can do it!  He is deceiving everyone because he is running out of time he needs to get as many people he can to deceive and follow him! It is so scary but it is prophecy! Love u please stay close to him he loves u! So do we!
We can help u. U are over stressed!  Please just don't make any rash decisions!  We love u! Always have tried to help u!  U aren't facing reality right now.  U are out of touch.  It's ok!  U are sad!  We love u!  Please don't do this!  It will be a mistake!  It is a bad choice!  It has so many bad consequences! Don't do it!  It's not even accepted. We love u but this is so hard to even grasp and doesn't make sense with u and who u are or who u have ever been. 
I love you! I'm sorry! I tried my best and I know I struggle too!  I know how devastating a break up can be.  I know it takes time.  We don't want to be the enemy.  We are suppose to be your place of security not whom u are anxious to be around.  Please let us be ur place of love and for us to help you.  I know u may want to find people who will understand u, but I'm telling u know one will love u like ur family does.  We may have different views but we still are ur parents who will always love u! Even when u don't think we do or may not agree with the life choices u make.  We only say things because this is what we believe and this is who we are.  But we also want to figure out how we can have a relationship with u.  We do want to help u and love u!  We want the best for u!  I know ur dealing with a lot. I have found a couple of (Christian) counselors in ur area whom I would like u to see.  What do u think? Also, we would love u to come home for Christmas but if u don't want to we would love to visit u sometime soon.  I know ur trying to figure out things. We will stay calm.  I know u think we are out to control u.  U feel like u don't belong in our family and this is sad.  I'm so sorry u are going through all this.  Everyone is praying for u!  Sometimes we have to go through things we live in a fallen world, and it does make us stronger.  We love u! I hope we can restore this Broken and damaged relationship!  I'm sorry we scared u so much!  We just didn't understand and we felt we were helping u to become an adult.  We didn't believe we were asking too much this summer, but because of us yelling at  u it did to u feel abusive and mean.  To us we were hurt because we felt taken advantage of and not appreciated so that is why we yell and may say hurtful things.  It is a vicious cycle.  We believed  that u shouldn't be getting married when y'all were fighting and it seemed such like an unhealthy relationship.  So we tried to help but u didn't understand why we had rules and I think u just thought we were mean. We love u!  U may not believe us or accept our love but that will have to be ur decision.  I can't make u do anything u make ur own decisions.  All I can say is I love u! 
Read this thoroughly with an open mind.  This is exactly how ur treating us.  Do u realize ur the puppet and other people are pulling the strings.  Their sucking u in. Can u see it? Goodnight. I love u.  (She's talking about trans community)
This is a very good article.  
I like the part where it says deep depression leads kids to someone other than who they are.  
And also, psychological disorders can masquerade as gender dysphoria leading medical practitioners to misdiagnose and not provide proper or effective psycho therapies.  
I'm just showing u this because I truly love and care so much for u and i have and always will fight for u!  We have always and will forever love u even if u don't believe it.  We have always helped u and supported u.  We are extremely hurt and sad that you have chosen not to have a relationship with us.  I'm not sure what ur scared about!  We aren't out to hurt u. We want u to be educated that there may be other reasons ur feeling this way and that the root is not dysphoria.  We aren't out to hurt you.  We will not put you on the streets and make you homeless. We aren't going to take away your car or stop paying for college (as long as you are passing). We wanted to explain this to you in person, but you don't want us to come there and you don't want to come here, so we are putting it in text.  Let me know what u think of the article and please keep an open mind when you read it. Let's please just be open and honest starting now.  
I love u!
Mom
This is very enlightening!
Says w/a professional help we must go back to early childhood and begin to unpack pain and find out why we envy the other gender or who it was that gave us such a negative role model of ur gender, Leach continues it is also means unpacking some of the sexually addictive components that cause u to act out sexually.  Therapy is good to figure out why we think the way we do and work out our past hurts. 
This is so good!  I'm actually learning so much about this!  At the end of this article it explains that this is similar to a high on Cocaine!  And it is caused by deep rooted emotional pain.  And people who go this route are no more happier then if they didn't. I have research this to death and it doesn't bring the happiness u think it will!  Please talk to me and I can find a psychologist to talk this over with u.  I know u don't want to talk to us and that's fine but let me know and I can find u someone.  I'm so sorry u are hurting so badly our emotions can be so strong and if you don't find the root u will never get over what u feel.  I love u so much!  You are still young and u can become emotionally strong it just will take healing and some forgiving.  
Also, most people who are trans have been sexually abused and or physically do u really want to deal with those that have this abuse and lots  &amp; lots of extra baggage? U have not been sexually and physically abused. These people have a lot of damage.  You have so much to offer and a potentially bright future. U don't realize it, but u do! I love you!  

Texts to be continued for me starting today.


They have threatened taking me out of college and forcing me to live with them under their roof. Cutting off all financial funds is one of their biggest threats. They've wanted me to get full on testing for mental disorders. So on... But things aren't as bad as they are going to get because the fact is I'm about to send them a coming out letter and right now they are in denial unsure if I'm on HRT or not or pursuing transition or even transgender since my ex was the one to tell them and I haven't told them anything but deny it. So they haven't taken much action yet because they have no clue what is going on because I needed them to hesitate in order to become financially independent and declare independence. But now I'm going to tell them and all hell is going to break loose. Right now they are tip-toeing around me with threats over the phone and demeaning texts. But now they are going to take action. All I have to say is happy fucking new year to my parents. I'm coming out as trans and pansexual to them. I've dealt with a live of being emotionally and physically abused by them. Manipulated and gaslighted. They have discriminated against me my whole life. They are anti-LGBT, transphobic, homophobic, misogynistic, sexist, and my moms somewhat racist. I can't take it anymore. I thought I was going to hell my whole life I thought I was an abomination. I hate them for what they've done and are doing to me. And I haven't even explained the worst things about them on here. But I'll post my coming out letter I send them on here. Also they are coming down to my apartment in 3 days. I'm not going to be there though. "

I'm somewhat worried that this will turn out like my last doctor who was unsupportive and suggested that I just had a Vitamin D deficiency. I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to combat a gatekeepy doctor or someone who is just plain ignorant of trans issues and tries to handwave it away like my last doctor. Of course any other suggestions would be awesome as well."

SierraMura,asktransgender,So ~~im having~~ ive been having second thoughts.,"Hi, Asktransgender!

(Theres a TL;DR at the bottom!)

So right now I have been on MtF hormones for about 3 years but every time I go on them I end up feeling ""fine"" and keep forgetting to take them for a long time until something drudges up that dysphoria feeling and I feel compelled to go back on them. And this is just one of the things that makes me think im not trans.

So I have been dating this girl that completely accepts my femininity and even encourages it, because of this I have been able to stay on hormones for 3 months straight, and sometimes I feel okay and sometimes I dont really care either way.

I feel like my whole Female persona is fake.

I dont want to be trans.

My family has been telling me for a long time that I may not be trans and that it might just be my issues with my mother who only wanted a girl and pretty much rejected the boys when I was growing up. Since then I think subconsciously I have only believed people will accept me if I were a girl.

I think I need more therapy.

But theres another facet to this, I just essentially broke up with my girlfriend because her family, (especially extended family) wont accept her (or me obviously) if im trans. So is this just me being heartbroken and freaking out, or is this me just realizing because something big happened in my life.

If she still accepts me as a guy I dont know if I really have a reason to transition. If I realize that other people accept me as a guy, I also dont know if I have a reason to transition.

So TL;DR: I think my mother issues have contributed to my issues with man hood. Im wondering if anyone else has had a similar situation. Also as stated above, this might just be confusion because I just broke up with my girlfriend but I think it might be more than that.

Thanks for listening to my confused rambling!


EDIT: Thanks for all the helpful encouragement and information.
I think what I will end up doing is going to a therapist (there are no gender therapists covered by my insurance) to try and make sure that this is what I want as well as maybe work on the mother issues that I so happily ignore.

Really though, I was kind of just panicking, I don't really think I want to detransition. I don't know if its normal, but once in a blue moon I will have a really bad panic attack and regret transition and everything, then I will do something like hypermasculinize and relearn why its not for me."
polymnia,asktransgender,Worried about hormone levels and development,"Hi! 

I've been on HRT for nearly 5 years I think? During this time, my doctor has kept me on dosages of various forms of estradiol resulting in levels of 200 pmol/L to maybe 400 pmol/L ish. Mostly the lower end of that spectrum, I would guess. She tells me 400 is probably more than she is comfortable with having me on. 

It's really difficult to find any concise information about what levels one should  be aiming for, but is there anyone here that has an idea of whether this could have stunted my development in some way? And if so, if I increased by dosage after all this time, would I see further development, or am I pretty much screwed? :( Puberty lasts like 5 ish years at the most, right?"

ConnectionIssues,asktransgender,Passport office woes for trans U.S. citizens?,"So I know a lot of us trans folk here in the U.S. are trying to get gender marker changed at the federal level (Social Security and Passport), before the inauguration.

I got my letters from my doctor in early December, and had no issues updating my social security. But... the passport office rejected my letter, insisting it was a photocopy, and giving me a runaround about why they thought it was a photocopy (fyi: It was not. My doctor's fingerprints are probably still on that paper... right next to her signature)

I got my doctor to make another letter, and we made an effort to make the signature more pronounced, but... the passport office would not explain to me what, exactly, they wanted to prove the 'original'-ness of the letter. So it's a crap shoot if they'll take the replacement.

And I'm not the only person having this issue, either. I have one other trans friend who got the same 'rejection' this week.

Anyone else have this problem? Any suggestions on how to solve it?"
12dec2016,asktransgender,"At home I'm MTF, at sixth form I'm agender?","It's so freaking confusing, and it's making me feel so bad. 


When I'm at home, in really dysphoric and I just constantly think about how much I want to be a girl. It's all I ever think about. I want to start HRT, and I feel suicidal and just want to end all of this, because I wasn't AFAB. 


But then at school I feel agender. I don't really feel male or female, and it's just so confusing. I really hate it when it happens, because I have no idea what to do or anything, it creates more denial and confusion, I can't focus on my school work or anything. 


I look in the mirror, it's just weird. Like, the guy in the mirror just seems like some normal guy, but in the inside he isn't normal at all, he's so confused, dysphoric, and suicidal and no one knows that I think this. It's just so strange. "

aurakitea,asktransgender,Help understanding me...,"Hi everyone, I'm back again (again). I'm still going in circles, and I just need some help parsing my thoughts and seeing if anyone else goes through this... 

So, looking back, I have a ton of signs of a transgender identity. I've never really felt 'male', I've never really wanted to be a man, and I used to beg God and wish on every birthday to wake up and be a girl. I kind of hated that I had been born male, I wanted to think that on some level I was a woman, and I did a lot of stuff (particularly during my college years) to prove that I was a woman on some level. Basically stupid Facebook quizzes, stuff like that - I don't think the results are valid, mind you, but the intent (to be told that I am female) says a lot about where I was.

I came out to myself as transgender in April after questioning since October of last year. Since then I've waged an internal war where part of me desperately wants to transition - this part of me has started growing out her hair, removing her body hair, taking better care of herself overall, dressing up in female clothes every night when she can. 

The other part of me (and the part that seems to be present right now) keeps trying to claw me back, telling me that I'm a man on some level, that this is all just an illusion, that I don't want to transition and that thinking that I should is just wrong. You don't ""actually"" want a female body, you just had a fetish for having one. This part of me wins on days when I'm feeling empty, and I tend to be very mean to myself on these days. 

I don't want to let go of being transgender for some reason. I don't want to give up on the female part of me. For the first time in my life I felt like I could have a relationship because I wouldn't be afraid of my SO finding out that I wanted to be a girl. I would be able to be myself and not just this half-present lump all the time.

Now I desperately tell myself I don't want to be male and some days that feels like a lie. And I hate it.

Can anyone help? "
ABC_Bourgeoisie,asktransgender,I don't even feel comfortable outside of trans spaces anymore and I hate it. DAE?,"I had a really bad day today, and I was about to go bitch about it on r/depression before I realized that I would just get downvoted and yelled at if I mentioned I was trans.

I once had my post removed (on a different Reddit account) from r/relationships just for being trans.

Everywhere I go there's blatant hatred towards us or even benevolent transphobia. I live in a very supportive area, but people tend to 'overdo' it to the point that it is patronizing and still makes you feel as separate and different and weird and not even deserving of other peoples' honesty.

I realized that almost all of my friends are either trans or at the very least ""not entirely cis.""

Some days I'm too afraid to go outside because I don't always pass. Even if I did absolutely all the time, I'd still be too afraid to try to make friends or date people. I'm shy around my family. I always feel awkward and out of place and like I'm secretly embarrassing them and they're too polite to admit it.

I can't work or go to school right now, and since I only have friends over the internet, I'm totally isolated. The only places I really feel welcome online are trans shitposting meme subs, and even there I'm still only worth as many dumb upvotes as I can get.

I don't want to be like one of those ""fuck cis scum"" people that don't actually even exist but everybody still hates, but, I feel like a mutant trying to walk among humans and that this is the sewer where I'm supposed to hide away in. Even still, I don't feel like I always belong here, either.

I don't even belong in other lgbt subs because trans people are ""homophobic"" or a trend that's distracting from gay issues. I don't belong on other subs for women because of my male privilege. I either don't understand the problems that women face (or at least don't 'get' them until I hear it explained), or I think totally benign things are sexist and embarrass myself for being an idiot.

It's like, either I go around and keep my identity a secret, but that makes me totally on edge like I might have to lie my way out of something at any moment, or do something that will 'blow my cover'; or, I just be open about it and be on edge anyways because I'll have to constantly be defending myself about everything I do.

I have a therapist and I'm not even comfortable talking about it to her. She isn't a gender therapist, but she's extremely supportive and informed about trans issues, but even still. She's cis and I feel like I'm some sort of subject being examined rather than somebody that can be related to or empathized with. I can't share my feelings with her anyways, because I'm too afraid that she'll hate me and stop letting me come to her at all.

I just feel pushed into this tiny little zone and I want so badly to break out and just be a normal person. I get so afraid from how often I think about killing myself, when deep down I really *do* want to live and try to make things better somehow. I've seen a lot of suicide notes on this sub recently, and I'm trying so hard not to be one of them.

Does anyone else feel unwelcome outside of trans safe spaces? Like generally, just not even okay to leave them ever unless you're *sure* nobody will make an issue about it? I'm feeling more and more like this all the time and I don't want to. I don't even want my transness to be relevant at ALL other than for medical reasons, but I feel like it has to be. Is there anything I can do to break out of this? I feel so isolated... Other trans people seem to live normal-ish lives just fine. What am I doing wrong? Am I just a shitty person that doesn't belong anywhere else anyways?"

thetransthrowawayy,asktransgender,"Ok so real talk, bottom surgery [NSFW-ish]","So I'm starting to think about bottom surgery in a real sense now as a goal with an actual time scale. With that, I was wondering how necessary is electro really? I know people go back and forth on this and (for vaginoplasties, at least to my knowledge) with some doctors there is scraping of the tissue during surgery. 

What's the deal though? Everything that I've read so far has been pretty inconsistent. It seems like every doc has their own thing and some scrape, some don't, some ask for electro, some don't. In any combination. What's the real risk of growth post-op if your doctor scrapes? If your doctor doesn't? 

I'm 100% definitely asking this (and many other things) on consult when I get there. In the meantime though, can anyone give any insight about this, especially anyone who's been through the process? Much appreciated!"

246011111,asktransgender,Feeling self conscious and guilty about typical male hobbies and taking cis women's places.,"I'm a pretty ""stereotypical"" trans woman: I'm majoring in computer science, I like video games, and I'm a bit of a nerd. Those are typical male interests. I'm thinking about this a lot now because [AGDQ](http://twitch.tv/gamesdonequick) is going on, and there was a trans speed runner who sparked some discussion in /r/speedrun where someone noticed there are likely more trans women in the community than cis women. 

I guess I feel really guilty about taking the place of cis women who might be otherwise interested in things like speed running, and for trans women being recognized as ""female"" although I benefit from male socialization in not being deterred from video games. It's the same in STEM. I didn't have to overcome being discouraged from an interest in computers or video games, and it's more significant for cis women who did. What's more, I feel stuck, because I legitimately do like these things but it constantly reminds me that I'm trans, and by claiming womanhood in these areas I'm delegitimizing what cis women actually have to deal with.

edit: I didn't expect my post to be so divisive. I don't mean to offend anyone, and if you're able to accept yourself as a woman that's great! More power to you! I'm trying to share my struggle with self-identification and looking for support and solidarity, and I'm sorry, but ""you're wrong"" or ""this is transphobia, end of discussion"" isn't a helpful response.

transthrowaway53535,asktransgender,"After 1.5+ years on Estrogen, I have seen no breast growth whatsoever. (21 y/o, MtF)","First of all I just want to say that I'm posting this under a throwaway as a precaution to avoid unwanted attention on my main account. 

I have been taking Estradiol for about 1 year and 6 months, and Spironolactone for about 2 years and 6 months as well. My dosage for Estradiol is 4mg a day and my Spiro is 200mg a day. 

Currently, my estradiol level is in the 140s. According to my doctor, this is where I should be and he doesn't want to risk going any higher. He has been very helpful and answers a lot of questions for me, and I trust his opinion, but after doing some reading around it seems that my levels could go a lot higher. I'm not sure what to think about this. I wouldn't want to try anything without a doctors input first, but something doesn't seem right when so many people are suggesting that they have much higher levels than what I have.

I have read a lot about other peoples experiences on here and while I feel that it is helpful to absorb information, I still take it with a grain of salt. Everyone has different experiences and, without trying to sound insulting, I trust my doctor more than a stranger's personal account on the internet. That being said, I have read a number of posts on here that would suggest my estrogen levels are less than half of what some people may have, and my dosages could also go higher. However, my doctor doesn't want my estradiol levels to go above 200 for fear of having blood clots. 

Aside from the lack of breast growth I also feel like the hormones are not doing very much for me. My skin has softened and my butt seems to be showing signs of filling out a bit, but beside that not much else is happening. I feel that this could partly be due to a chronic illness that I suffer from, making it difficult to put on and keep weight. Currently I weigh about 108 pounds (and I'm 5' 6"") and I'm wondering if my current weight may be part of the reason for the lack of breast growth as well as other areas filling out, seeing as my body probably has little to work with. This is just my speculation though, but my doctor feels it could be a contributing factor as well.

I actually had my last appointment with him today since he was part of a children's hospital network I've been going to all my life, and will now be seeing another transgender specialist in the near future. I'm curious to see what their opinion may be on my doses and levels, but until then I don't know what to do. 

I realize everyone is different and some people have to wait longer to see results, but at this point it's starting to look a little worrying and isn't doing much to help my dysphoria. I know I can just get myself some padded bras in the mean time so I'm not so uncomfortable in public, but not being able to have real breasts is pretty upsetting.

Any thoughts/advice?"
thisismalvar,asktransgender,I finally got my first prescription!!!,"Today, i had another appointment with an endocrinologist. At first, I had a really bad feeling because he told me that the indication my psychiatrist had written is not sufficient. then he talked about sex-therapists which i only had extremely bad experiences with. In the end, he started to explain all the tests that would still have to be made and i gave him the papers from a former endocrinologist appointment (back then, i had noone willing to diagnose me) which already included all the test results he needed. 

And then, a miracle happened. I thought I couldn't believe my ears but he really said: Ok, since you already have all the results and they are good, I'm gonna make an exception but you have to promise me to bring a valid indication the next time or i won't give you another prescription. 

Now, i really have a prescription for estradiol patches and androcur. Already gotten the latter from the next available pharmacy but they would have to order the patches, so I'm gonna go to my home pharmacy next and either they'll have it on stock or will get it until tomorrow. 

I still can't believe that I am actually starting HRT now but I'm quite certain that I am not dreaming, haha. 

Everyone still waiting: The last year felt like never ending hell to me but the second I got this prescription, it started looking so unimportant. So, no matter how hard it is, don't give up. Eventually we'll all get the help we need! :) 

PS: I'm so excited to see what those will do to me in the next weeks! haha

YukiCookie,asktransgender,I need help transitioning in Germany,"Hi, I'm an 18 year old male to female on the way of transitioning and I'm asking for help, just any kind of help. Haven't mentioned that I'm transgender on reddit before, but it's actually my biggest problem aside from depression and such. 

I'm sorry for the giant text, but I feel this is something I need to explain well and with many details. If I'm maybe in the wrong subreddit feel free to redirect me, I found many different trans-subreddits and this one seemed the most fitting to me. 

So, uh, where do I start? I don't even know where I'm going with this. I desperately need help. I want to transition but it's made so difficult here. I told doctors I'm transgender two and a quarter years ago, but they haven""t truly helped me since. I didn't even receive any kind of treatments until hormone therapy 4 months ago. I begged for hormones back then, 2 years ago. I can't just go to a doctor and say I need this and this, and then it's seen to it that it gets done and everything is fine. It sucks here. Nobody knows anything. Nobody really helps me at all. 

I want feminizing operations/surgeries, and I know EXACTLY which ones I want. Have an exact list. I even have more infos now recently where to potentially do these individual operations, heard about a ""2pass clinic"" in Belgium that does FFS, a doctor in Munich (""Dr. Funk"") that apparently does like uh, hip area correction (not sure if that has a term), and others that do adams apple reduction but I think it might be included in FFS anyway. 

But then I hear they're all private clinics. And that it might/won't be paid for by health insurance, or only partially. So what do I do? I don't have thousands of euros. I have no idea how to even try for these things at my health insurance. Again, nobody knows anything here, it's not like there's a doctor or something that can guide me with this. I'm all alone with this. They just say I have to propose these things to my health insurance. Like good luck, without any fucking info or guidance.

Does anybody know ANYTHING helpful regarding health insurance in Germany, or maybe has already like punched through operations or something with the health insurance themselves here in Germany? Or maybe knows anything about getting the operations on the way in Germany? I feel lile this country treats this problem horribly. 
I mean just the fact you are forced to go a therapist and such; it's not a mental illness. I've endured going to one for 2 years though and can get like doctor's notes to help my case for whatever they're needed. But the problem is, my therapist and psychiatrist(s) don't know anything about this topic themselves, so they can't really help me at all. My name change process thing has been under way for over a year now, the court keeps stalling. It hurts. I don't want to be called by my male name or be called ""mister"" anymore. Should I maybe flee to a different country or something? Does that even make sense, is that even possible?

I hate this, I don't know what to do. I'm so lost, and close to suicide. I can't just summon up thousands of euros for each operation, that's not something I have access to. I can't even work at all, I'm incapable of doing so, because of this issue! It causes immense pain/stress/trauma and I have psychosomatic issues, my body basically reacts ""allergically"" to all this pain now. If I had enough money, I could actually schedule all operations and have them done. I would know how to. Why. So I could live if I/my family was rich? But now I have to die, because I'm poor? I don't want to die, I want to experience what it's like to live as a (complete) woman. But Germany sucks. I'll never get there. I'll just wind up dead, having ended my life prematurely to escape all the pain. 

If someone knows ANYTHING that could potentially be helpful I would be truly thankful for it. You might even be saving a life, a very young life. "

mw18582,asktransgender,Got green-light for HRT today / why this community is important and thank you all!,"Today has been a good day for me. I received green-light for HRT. I thought it would never come. Time is absolutely weird as of late.

This isn't a goodbye, but more of a moment of calmness where I can reflect and appreciate how important this community has been for me. I would like to express my thanks to everyone here on this channel.

Ever since I figured out what has been bugging me for so long, I don't think I ever refreshed a page or app as much as Reddit. It is one thing to keep googling, but a whole other thing to actually find people around you that share exactly the same fears and doubts as you. Similarities are at times uncanny and it is in exactly those moments that you realize you have *not* lost your mind or sanity. That doubts are to be expected. That it is okay to feel like a fraud and imposter. That dysphoria comes in many shapes and colors. That euphoria is valid. That you cannot even hope to attain 100% certainty and, frankly, doesn't that hold true for almost anything in life?

When it comes to something that can be as illusive as gender identity, it is almost as if absolute certainty is demanded; either by yourself or your environment (how can you be so sure?) 
I think that view is damaging and only amounts to more confusion. Such questions ask for an answer in the domain of reason, but how can one even begin to apply logic if we are nowhere near understanding the full mechanics at work here? Not to say it should be taken lightly either.

It can be really, *really* difficult to come to terms with who you are. I always thought 'being transgender' required this feeling of wrongness that would not only be *unambiguously* linked to gender with full clarity, but also had been there for as long as one can remember. I have come to learn that although that might very well be the case for some, it definitely is not necessary or even normative. I have had many happy moments in my life before this where I would be fine. And many depressed and confused moments I would have never thought to be related. Gender is a complicated subject and there is so much overlap between genders that almost any definition out there is going to be inadequate for at least one person on this world. You can think about your identity, joke about it, question it, but it doesn't hit you until it does. And when it does, oh boy, was I even alive before? Gender related issues came in many forms for me that only now I can tie together. Yet I still doubt the validity of that claim for I am aware of the existence of confirmation bias. I keep regressing in the past and find all the signs that will validate or invalidate it. The voice of reason goes on and on. And I see so many people here in that same endless loop.

But rationality aside. Every day things get a tiny bit better even though it doesn't always seem that way. I feel great imagining myself a certain way and come to trust my feelings more. And for everyone here in that struggle, there will be clarity. And keep believing the day will come when you wake up, look in the mirror and for the first time in your life authentically can whisper: *hey you*

Thank you all! I would never have come so far in this relatively short span of time without you

OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,"If I start transition at 17, will I have a decent chance of having a passable voice?","First off, I know HRT doesn't effect voice. However, I'm not done puberty, and thus my voice can still deepen. I don't have a super deep voice, and it still cracks from time to time. But it's not super high either.

TeaspoonRaccoon,asktransgender,MtF Underarm hair question,"**EDIT: I meant FtM! Sorry, I mistyped in the title ;_;

Hey there! Long time lurker.
I'm a trans male who prefers to keep his body hair grown out, including my underarm hair. However my mother says it's different when AFAB people grow their armpit hair out. It ends up smelling worse than a dude's pits and you HAVE to shave it.
She's insisting I shave, even though I really don't want to. I've begun to shampoo the hair to keep it from smelling, among daily deodorant use, of course. I'm paranoid that if I don't shave I'll stink. :(

So, my question is, is this true? Do AFAB bodies' underarm hair end up smelling worse than AMAB bodies' hair after not shaving for a period of time?

Edit #2: Thanks so so much to everyone who gave answers. &lt;3 I feel so much better now! c:"
throwawayhemk,asktransgender,What can I do to help my MtF girlfriend cope?,"First of all, I should mention that we're in a long-distance relationship. She knows how I look and I know how she looks, but when she's struck by a mood swing I can't offer her hugs or the like. Sadly.  

I've known her for about half a year now and about a month ago I confessed to her and now we're here. I've always talked to her a lot and while I've managed to get her out of her bad mood a few times, I can't always find a way.  

Like you'd expect of someone experiencing gender dysphoria, she self-deprecates a lot. When it builds up and she has a mood swing because of it, I usually manage to talk her out of it and get her in a good mood again. However, there is one topic that really leaves me speechless and that keeps becoming more frequent when she has mood swings: having kids.  

Our relationship is 'fresh', and we like to get ahead of ourselves and think about what our future could be like. Now, the thing that keeps striking her is that she won't be able to get pregnant.  

She can't help but feel bad about it, no matter what I tell her. I'm okay with adoption (and I've thought about it for a long time before confessing to her) and have told her this. I've told her being infertile doesn't make you a ""dysfunctional person"", as she called it, but I can't convince her. She goes on about how she'd be ok with it if I left her for a 'real' girl even though she'd cry and aaa. I know she can't help it, but it quite hurts to hear, along with it just being painful to look at her so sad.  

I'm ranting at this point. I'm fairly certain there's no 'magic methods' for me to cheer her up when she's like that, but I also needed to vent for a bit because it's also been quite taxing on me.

Anyways. Back on topic. What should I tell her or keep in mind when she gets a mood swing with this cause?"

Phixin,asktransgender,How important are hormone levels? Is there anything I should do if I switch between oral and sublingual?,"Hi everyone!
I have been on HRT for roughly 10 months, and currently take 6mg Estradiol(Generic Estrace) and 200mg Spiro(aldactone) and my blood tests, though they aren't bad, are a little less than satisfactory(E is lowish, T is a bit high). I split it up 2mg E + spiro in the morning, 4mg E + spiro at night.

I'm a little worried as when I spoke with my doctor after the last test(I got tested 12 hours after my last pill) and she mentioned not really relying on the blood test results so much, and more on the results (I have been experiencing feminization, but maybe Im being impatient?) The only things off about my bloodwork are the hormone levels... I've only had 2 blood tests so far(Technically 3, but she forgot to tick the box to check for E levels on the very first one lol)

Is this worrisome, or am I panicking? Are hormone levels THAT important? I don't mind waiting for the hormones to work, but it's kind of hard because I don't really know if they're working properly. Would switching to sublingual administration help out my hormone levels? Is this something I need to figure out with my doctor first, is 6mg too much for sublingual? 
Sorry for the bombardment of questions, feedback and help is appreciated!!"
shrikeendymion797,asktransgender,I got some questions...,"So, hello.

I feel strange, needless to say about my gender ( or not ), I'm honestly more confused I suppose. Allow me to elaborate.

If I had to fill out a questionnaire now I'd put down Male-Cisgendered. Now why am'I on a subreddit labeled ""asktransgender"" then? It's because for a long time I've been feeling weird, confused, and I have no other place to check out.

I'll explain what I feel. I feel weird thinking of women. The bodies are attractive, both sexually and romantically. So what's this got to do with anything gender related? Its because when I think about that attraction during..... well obvious times. I feel a longing. I feel like I get it, I start to picture what its like being a women in that way. I've had times where I'll start to picture what I'd be like as a girl.

This is why I'm here it's because I'm confused.
https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/5o1rki/i_have_a_strange_fantasy_that_ive_never_told/?st=iy3co6sm&amp;sh=c2ab878c

I already made a post about this topic here, and then somehow found myself here. Its so strange to me. I wonder if maybe I'm just lonely or something, heck I wouldn't put it past me. But I've done things, like twist around in this long shirt I have ( I push it down around my waist ) as if it were a skirt. It feels nice, or maybe just different and liberating as if I'm expressing some sort of feeling within?

Am'I just weird, should this go here or on some other subreddit??? Am'I ""trans"" or something else I'm missing? I'm not a part f the Lbgt community so I'm missing something?? I don't feel ""trapped"" like I've heard some people describe there own experiences, but I feel something. If I could change for a day or so I would, to see what it's like.
Like my post up top says I would explore that sexy side. But its not purely some sex fantasy. I'd love to walk around, get coffee as a girl, maybe chat or get cloths. It'd be interesting. It reminds me of this video I saw once where a women learned what it was like to be a guy via acting one out and playing the part for a year.

Maybe I just want to express my ""feminine"" side more. I believe men and women and all others should be able to wear whatever they want. Heck maybe I need to just confess that? I'd love to wear a skirt or tank top, why not explore that? ( But I doubt I'd look good... My body is really masculine for a lack of a better word ). But yet.
If that were the case then why would I still be curious to what a female body is like to be in? On a note here I do wonder what the sex side would be like, my post up top delves into this some what. But I don't feel like I'm ""gay"" or ""Bisexual"" I think? I wonder if my sexual attraction would change or not? I'm a very curious creative person in case you couldn't tell.

So I've done as much as I could I think... Thank you if you've read even this far into a strangers random post. I'd love fed back and hope this doesn't back fire on me. Thanks a thousand.

What to do?,"So the story goes, my parents have me at therapy for anxiety and depression. I came out to them (and the rest of my family and friends) two and a half weeks ago. I've said that I am interested in starting HRT (I've found a clinic, I've visited, gotten info and everything except set up an appt), yet they keep coming back to their point about wanting to take care of the anxiety and depression before they even think about HRT. My point that transitioning would perhaps help with the anxiety and depression is out there. I know it will. What I'm asking is, are there any other arguments or points that I could bring up that would further bring this whole HRT thing home in their minds? "
abicustriops,asktransgender,(Male) Taking testosterone to potentially ease dysphoria?,"I realized I had gender dysphoria about 4 months ago. I always knew something was up, but I finally put a name on it when I talked with my psychiatrist of 10 years, (I'm bipolar).

 Anyways, after getting a blood workup, we found that my testosterone is on the very low end of what would be considered normal, which didn't really come as a surprise since I usually only masturbate 2-3 times per week, sometime even less. That's pretty low for a 21 year old male.

 I became enthralled with the idea of transitioning, almost infatuated by it, because I finally had a ""cure"" for what I had been feeling for pretty much as long as I can remember. As my appointment with an endocrinologist approaches though, I find myself more and more hesitant. I have an appointment on the 24th, and yesterday I had a full on nervous breakdown/panic attack. I was terrified of the future, and even though I've been surrounded by nothing but support, I can't help feel humiliated. I know I shouldn't but I can't help it.

I met with another therapist for a second opinion a few weeks ago, and he thinks I should try testosterone first to see if it may help, since my levels are so low. I sort of dismissed the idea since I was really looking forward to female hormones, but now I'm having second thoughts. While almost everything about being a girl appeals to me, I know transition would make my life substantially harder. 

I guess my question is, is there anybody else in a similar situation out there (low T) that has tried T first, or even stayed on it because it helped? I think I'm going to try T for a couple months to be safe, but at the same time I've been waiting for what feels like forever to try E that I'm kind of disappointed by that thought. This is just all so confusing and stressful."
tossawaytransasker,asktransgender,Cis people don’t question their gender?,"I’ve heard it stated often here that cis people never question their gender at all. And while I’m not necessarily doubting that claim, I do like evidence for claims like that, so I was wondering if anyone has any sources or proof that questioning their gender never even occurs to cis people. Because I’ve seen people say ""If you’re asking, you’re probably trans because if you were cis the question would never even occur to you."" and variations of that, but everyone says it like it’s common sense and doesn’t need to be proven. So does anyone have any sources of surveys or some other proof to back up this commonly cited claim?"
feelinqueer,asktransgender,How on earth am I going to shave my girl pouch? MtF HRT (NSFW),"So as I get closer to the prospect of starting HRT, I begin to think more about things that I may need to deal with, and I want to be as prepared as possible.

How on earth will I be able to shave my girl pouch if I can't get the queen to stand tall?! The only way I can effectively shave that spot is if I become erect, because it makes everything tighten up. When I've tried without, it doesn't end well... That's not even considering the effect of shrinkage and what role that might play...

Is this only something I've thought about/have a problem with? Do you go for different types of hair removal? Do you just not have a problem with it because you're some kind of shaving goddess that's gifted with other worldly shaving powers? Am I just overreacting and just need to get used to it/practice?

In the past when I've tried with the queen sleeping, it has ended real rough... And bloody... So I just want to know how others deal with it so I can prepare myself!

SeleneMarie,asktransgender,Ever get situations that are so awkward if only that person knew?,"So I'm transgender, otherwise I wouldn't be living on this sub trying to figure out my life. The reason my transition is being put off, among other things, is my dad. Unfortunately he is a man who could easily go in either direction, and I'm not willing to have 3 months of hell on a 50/50 gamble. He couldn't kick me out, my mom would kick HIM out before it came to that, but considering he is home all day I'm sure its clear what that would mean for me if he wasn't supportive and wanted to make things hard on me.

The two of us are talking, I mention that I want to move out as soon as college finishes. He replies that I can stay for as long as I want to save up some money. The reason I want out of here so bad is obvious, and if I could be sure that he would not give a shit (what I want honestly) I would be almost two months deep already into transition.

So first of all I've noticed everything else felt a lot more vivid, and real and everything just feels. Different. Like my senses seem a bit stronger too.

Emotions come much easier now, and are stronger. The highs are higher and the lows are lower. I can also actually cry now instead of just a drop or usually nothing coming out.

I also have some general questions with informed consent.  I am wondering how long it might take to actually get estrogen.  Its no rush but sooner rather than later is preferred.  Ive been doing some digging around and it seems like I will need 2 appointments. 

 The first is to sign waivers and then they take my blood.

The second is when my levels are checked and I actually get started on estrogen provided things come back fine.

imasayit,asktransgender,Reflections on my dating life before transitioning.,"Hello. I haven't posted anything in a while. I've been busy stirring shit up irl (protests, demonstrations, rallies, etc.) How about I re-introduce myself: I go by Drusilla now, Dru for short. Possibly Silla. Haven't decided yet. I'm AMAB. Id as a bi/pansexual binary woman. Started hormones about six months ago.

[Insert clever transitional sentence here]. Before coming out and transitioning I would only date AFAB people or trans women openly. I couldn't date cis men because of the shame. I think I'll make another post on that later. For now the important part to take away from this paragraph is that for all intents and purposes, I appeared to be a straight cis male (even to myself).

During this period I had an ex come out as lesbian and while I was openly happy for her, I was secretly happy for myself too, but couldn't admit to myself why. Also, I would instinctively always try to sus out whether or not the woman I was dating/interested in was open to romantic relationships with women and when it turned out that they were, and were also interested in dating me, I felt very validated.

So here's the question: Have you had anyone in your life unknowingly validate your gender before they knew you were trans? Anything just generally similar happen to you or did you have similar experiences or feelings before coming out or transitioning? I'm especially interested in the perspectives of non-binary and FtM people, but welcome other MtF people to share as well.

Thanks for reading.

nachobra,asktransgender,whats wrong with me,"i dont know whats wrong with me i have severe depression and just started hrt and the first two weeks were great i actually was optimistic and liking myself a bit and a few days ago i was just talking to some friends and enjoying it. but then out of nowhere last night every negative thought i had about myself came back at once ""you stupid delusional ugly fucking man, you pathetic virgin sack of shit, all your friends secretly hate you, nobody will ever love you you should just kill yourself"" like why everything was going good i thought things would be different now but no im inherently unloveable nothing can fix me god is telling me i should off myself all my friends think i should kill myself. and i mean is it just hormone fluctuations making me feel this way or what. i mean it doesnt matter what the answer is because either way i still deserve to be shot. sorry for wasting your time you probably hate me for posting this here"
RainbowSingularity,asktransgender,Dysphoria over body measurements...,"Hi all, im just about to begin my transition (MtF) and I had the idea to took measurements of my body for looking clothes that fits me, but I measured myself and got a bit sad and dysphoric because I have too much chest and waist...

I have 40 inches chest, 43 waist and 47 hips but with that waist i need bigger clothes I think.

Does HRT makes lose some waist? (im a bit fat :/ ) Im planning to do some exercice too.

Does anyone have this kind of dysphoria too? How to cope with it while trying to lose weight? Thanks"
trefferr,asktransgender,Being pulled in many directions. Don't know whats right for me,"So I was born male but am currently presenting as female. I've done this because when I'm in guy mode Im depressed and irritable because I want to be a woman. After awhile of living as a woman I get depressed and irritable again and want to revert back to being g a guy SO, I have no idea what the fuck I want. I have no desire to be gender fluid because the thought of going back and forth seems exhausting to me, as I'm exhausted right now with all of this flip flopping. So below here are the triggers that make me make a switch and maybe it can make sense to you guys.

Triggers when male that make me think I'm female - clothing, wanting to present with feminine mannerisms, simply feel like myself, having more confidence when thinking of being female

Triggers when female that make think I'm male - seeing a pretty girl and wanting to be her man, the amount of time and money it takes to get ready for the day with makeup and hair brushing etc.

I know that no matter what I do that these thoughts and feelings of being a woman will never go away. Recently I quit my job and moved in with my mom for a little while to focus on my transition and go to grad school. The biggest trigger is me talking to a woman and imagining me being in a relationship with her as a man, it makes me very dysphoric. 

I just don't want to be one of those people that is miserable up until my 60s when I start transition. Anyway. Thoughts? Opinions? Concerns?"
TheWalkinDude17,asktransgender,Did you always know you were trans?,"I'm a gay guy who once had thoughts of transitioning and I was wondering how others experiences compare to my own. So I don't remember ever wanting to transition as a kid or feeling like I was in the wrong body. I remember when I was little I wished I could be a girl a few times so I could wear nail polish and like girly things without it being weird, but I don't think I ever really wanted to become a girl. When I was in high school I actually really did want to transition for a little while. I remember staying up at night wishing so much I was a girl and could do all the things a teenage girl could do. Now that I'm older I've lost that urge completely. 

I never gave it serious thought when I was in high school because I just don't think I could pass as a girl. For one thing I'm way to tall over 6'2 and don't think I have the body type for it either. I've seen how some trans people look and I could never turn myself into that. Sorry if that sounds bad but we're keeping it real on here. I think if I had the option to be born as a girl I'd take it but I could never imagine transitioning now. 

Sorry if that was all over the place but just wanted a bit of back story. Here's by questions.
1. Have you always wanted to transition.
2. Now that you've transitioned do you feel happier or do you feel like a freak? (That's what's always held me back, not because all trans people are freaks but I feel like I'd look like one)
3. Were people supportive around you?
4. Are you satisfied with how you look now?"
LoveIinus,asktransgender,First time celebrating Chinese New Year (CNY) as a MtF transgender,"Mm so the first day of CNY just ended. It's my first year celebrating CNY as a MtF transgender. I went on hormones last year and I'm 5 months into it now. Growing out my hair and out and I'm currently at the awkward phase. 

I did caught a lot of my relative's attention. Like some asked me why is my hair so Long and why I'm not cutting it. My maternal Grandmother couldn't recognise me and thought I was my Sister. Some relatives couldn't recognise me and when I told them who I am they got a shock! Some of my Nieces and nephews called me 姐姐/Jie Jie/Zeh Zeh (how you would address an older young female when they just saw me as a male last year! 

Sadly, I had to dress myself in male clothes because I don't feel comfortable enough and I wanted to give my family this year to get used to my transition first. Next year, I'll be coming in with Long hair and female clothes, ahhh can't wait! "
Possibly_A_Person,asktransgender,I may have accidentally outed myself through my pokemon game. Help with coming out?,"First off, this is my first time posting on reddit, so *please* tell me if I accidentally break any rules here.

I'm 14, turning 15 in a couple months, and currently live with my mom, dad, and 10 year old younger brother, and I haven't told anyone I'm trans. I've felt dysphoria for four years, and only found out a year ago I wasn't just crazy, and that other people felt that way to. Anyway, like the title says, I think I might have accidentally outed myself by my Pokemon game. I played it as the female trainer, figuring none of my family will ever see it anyway. Yesterday I was synching the game ID to my my online account so I could compete in global missions (most of this part is just going to sound like gibberish to anyone who doesn't play pokemon, but that's not the important part :p). My mom was on the computer (for those that don't know what I'm talking about, the game gives you a code which you put in on the computer while logged in to your account on the pokemon site) so she put the code in, and then it went to a page with the information of my game on it. Including a picture of my character. I freaked out, and then said ""okay, I can do it from here"" just so my mom would hopefully go away before she noticed. No luck, so I just grabbed the mouse and hit the ""next"" buttons as fast as I could, and immediately closed the tabs when it was finished. But I'm pretty sure my mom noticed, there were quite a few pages, and the image showed up on all of them. I'm just thankful I still used my male name on it. My mom hasn't brought it up at all though.

EDIT: I didn't really explain that very well, I didn't immediately grab the mouse, I tried to not draw any attention to it, but my mom was looking at it for quite some time going over it, and I really just wanted her to not notice. But I didn't immediately grab the mouse and close the page. Like people have said, I probably didn't handle it very well, but at the time I honestly didn't know what to do.

I'd love to be able to come out, but I'm not sure how anyone would react. My parent's are veery liberal, and aren't religious at all, so I don't have to worry about being told how I'm gong to hell for existing and am completely insane, etc. I'm in Nevada, so I'm not sure if it's a bad place to live in and be trans. My dad has said multiple times he's fine if I'm gay, but he's never said a word about being trans. My mom hasn't ever really said anything, but also would be fine if I was gay. Nobody has ever brought up being trans though, so I'm not sure if they're unaware that being trans is a thing, if they just never had a reason to bring it up, or if they never said anything about it because they are transphobic and don't want me to know that trans people exist.

If my parents reacted badly and kicked me out, I'd have literally nowhere to go, and no hope for any job in the future. I have no friends because being around other people makes my dysphoria so much worse (I go to an online school, so thankfully I don't have to really be around people, though the school complains how I never go to their non-mandatory events and now thinks my family is abusive because I don't go). 

If I did come out and my parents were supportive, or even indifferent, my brother would endlessly mock and belittle me. He is a terrible person, and I've been told by my dad for years to give him many, many chances to prove he's not. He's been hateful and mocked me every day, and he's destroyed any self confidence that my dysphoria hadn't already. Earlier today, he told me ""go die in a hole you pathetic scumbag"" and has often made fun of how I look. 

How would I even bring up that I'm trans? I'm paranoid that if I ask what they think of trans people, they might turn out to be transphobic and go ""how'd you hear about that? I don't approve of it, I want to know where you heard of that"" and take my computer so I couldn't go on the internet any more. It's probably just baseless paranoia, but I still can't help but worry about that happening. I'm also thinking that asking what they think of trans people would out me, especially since it's never been brought up at all in my house, either supportive or hateful.

I don't think I'd ever be able to try using makeup even if they are supportive, because my mom doesn't wear any of any kind I could try on, and I'm not sure I could get any tips on how to wear it from her anyway (apparently she has very sensitive skin and break out in a rash from most things, and I'm worried I would have inherited that). I'm sure that if by some miracle I did get some and could wear it, my brother would mock me even harder. And I'm sure my voice will never pass, every time I speak I want to crawl up and die. I can't practice without anyone hearing it, there's always someone home. My dad is a disabled veteran with back issues due to a car accident he was in, so he isn't able to get out of bed most days, let alone out of the house. My brother is homeschooled, and he rarely goes anywhere. My mom also never goes anywhere except shopping and to take my brother places. But it's very rare they're all gone at once.

I've never really been able to talk about my feelings, it's always been assumed that I'm fine all the time. And the few times I've been asked ""what's wrong"" I've always just said ""nothing"" before even thinking about it. 

If you've read all this, thank you. 

Now that you've read about my situation, how do you think it would be best to bring it up? I'm not sure I'd want to do a coming out letter, I'd prefer to talk about it, but at the same time I'm sure I'd just freeze up and not be able to say it."
-B1ackRibbon-,asktransgender,"I want to start a discussion, so here's my opinion on the whole ""Age-fluid"" / ""trans-age"" thing:","Essentially these individuals believe that they ""identify"" as a different age. The concept of one's age being associated with their identity is a societal construct aside from the natural progression of experiences that might build wisdom or change one's methods of going about living life. If society only focused on that fact, then anyone that, for example, ""identifies as a 16-year-old"" would really just identify as a person with limited life experience compared to say - a 21-year-old. I believe people are allowed to be whoever they want, liking My Little Pony or playing with Barbie dolls does not make you any younger, it just makes you someone who is being themselves and embracing that.﻿

The bottom line for me is that as long as you aren't harming anyone, I don't give a fuck what you identify as, however, I don't believe that age correlates with an identity label."
mrbriyani,asktransgender,How do y'all deal with concurrent arousal and dysphoria?,"I hate the fact that being aroused sexually brings out my dysphoria as well. Whenever I read erotic fiction of girls having their clit or breasts simulated my blood goes all crazy inside and everything, but I can feel inside how much it sends my mood spiraling downwards, because I can't really experience having my clit licked or having my vagina stuffed and my G-spot stimulated, and after masturbating I'm just left alone with my dysphoria. I was reading Literotica this morning and Christ, it left me in this dysphoric state, and seeing other women around me with hot outfits isn't helping.

How do y'all deal with these kinds of things, if you experience anything similair? I don't want to have to just go chastity and suppress my sexuality, because orgasms are fantastic, even if they are male ones, but having to end up deep in dysphoria everytime is just torture."

I'm getting closer to complete social transition in the next 2 months (legal docs, jobs, totally fulltime) and I'm getting anxious (aka also horny) about dating. 

I'm bi/pan, and have way more experience with females sexually (and very little male exp. - but still am equally attracted to both sides). I've specifically been watching a lot of MTF/FTM porn (amidst v. cis girl, v. cis guy, v. MTF), but have been waaaaay more excited about FTMs. 

For those on both sides, how do FTM's feel about an MTF being specifically attracted to you (partially fetishising, I feel I'm bordering) and MTF's how do you feel about your attraction to FTMs? Long story short, I feel sexually I will be totally compatible with one (still enjoy PIV, but also enjoy giving oral to V, but enjoy receiving oral/anal in general) + also the aspect of being with someone very masc to my fem, who will totally empathize with the trans experience is very comforting to me, in theory.

Does any get where I'm coming from? Anyone feel that way as an FTM towards MTF? Should I just relax and get out there? HALP. (p.s. pardon my over-usage of MTF/FTM, just using it to oversimplify and abbreviate)"

I'm 19, I'm almost certain I'm trans. I've been questioning for the past several months, and recently my therapist referred me to an endo he works with.

I just don't wanna come out to her now, when I still feel a bit unsure about whether or not I'm trans, to later tell her I was wrong about it. But I also want to be able to talk to her about it.

Again, I'm sure she'll be extremely accepting and supportive. I'm just afraid of being wrong on this and then having to take it back, I'm afraid of her changing how she views me if I come out.

Come this november i finally accepted that what ive been feeling for years and talked about it with my boyfriend. he's helped me gain confidence in transitioning.

as of now i have no idea where to go next. im ready and willing to start hormones, as im already out at my work and my coworkers are already using my preferred name and correct pronouns.
ive tried finding resources online but everything that ive read doesnt really explain how to actually start the process or who i need to see. i live in bakersfield california, and i honestly cant find any gender therapists here that actually take my insurance (kaiser).

ttywzl,asktransgender,Transitioning with mental illness,"Hi all,

I am 28, live in Aus, am AMAB and identify as a woman. I've been aware that I am trans for a few years now, but took a long time to get over my initial questioning phase and to be sure that this is who I am and who I want to be. 

I was just starting to take action by starting to have conversations with my doctor about who to see to start down the road of moving onto HRT towards the end of 2015, when some horrible, horrible shit from my extraordinarily abusive childhood showed up. I developed extreme anxiety, depression and PTSD. 

I decided at the time to put transition on hold because I didn't like the idea of committing to a major life change in the middle of a giant clusterfuck, and I've read that HRT can be an emotionally volatile time.

Between then and now I've had about three major nervous breakdowns, several trips to the emergency dept because I thought I was going to kill myself, and have clocked up some serious hours in therapy but I still have a long way to go. My initial idea of waiting until I'm ""better"" was under the assumption I would be getting there sooner rather than later, but there's a bit of a catch.

The work I do in therapy to try and get me to feel more connected and safe in my life isn't going as well as it should be, particularly when it comes to suicidal ideation, because a lot of it is trying to build attachments to a life I was about to transition out of.

I'm aware that the ideal situation would be to get my PTSD, depression and anxiety into a manageable state and then transition, but I'm starting to have doubts that this is what's going to work. I need to want the life I'm trying to reconnect with.

I'd really like to get back on with living my life, and this is like some giant detour when I was so close to getting things underway that I don't know what to do with. I guess what I'm hoping for is some advice about:

* What people's experience of trying to start HRT while trying to recover from significant mental illness has been like

* If anyone's been in a similar situation to mine, what they chose to do and any advice they might have for me about where to go from here

Thanks!"

awkwardpegasus,asktransgender,"The ""when was your last period"" question","I just recently moved to another state and don't have a primary care provider that can provide me with help, so I decided to visit a local clinic. Everything was fine, I was getting some vaccination, then the doctor asked me something that caught me completely off guard ""When was the last time you had period""

Just a little background about me, I have been diagnosed with GID as early as 12 years old and have been living full time since I was like 15. I have had all my documents and ID updated by the time I was barely 18 years old. I have been going to the same PCP since I was a kid so they knew about my transition and everything. For the most part, at least in my opinion, I pass really well that I have been living stealthly (hence I'm asking on a throwaway). So when she asked me the question, I was just shocked, I wasn't sure what to say. It was such a simple question that any girl should be able to answer and yet here I am, finding myself wordless and powerless by a question. I ended up blurted ""Uh... I don't get period"". The doctor look surprised, she looked through my medication and saw that I'm on estradiol, she asked if I was taking hormone to surpressing it, so I said ""sure"" in hoping that the conversation would go away.

I guess things would have been fine if I decided to keep my mouth shut, I think I made a mistake when she asked if I was sexually active, in which I said yes, and that lead to a series of question about whether I'm sure I'm not pregnant or not (the reason for that is because the vaccine I asked for is very damaging to the fetus). It got to the point where she told me I either have to explain why I'm taking hormone to prevent period or we have to do pregnancy test in which case I ended up telling her after I struggled with my emotion for a bit that I was a transgender. Needless to say she apologized to me a few time for putting me in this position in which case I told her it's fine.

Overall it wasn't a bad experience or anything, atleast medically I think she acted very professional and good. I'm not writing this out of anger or anything. I was just caught off guard by her question because it brought me back to my younger days. I used to hurt myself and contemplate suicide over the fact that I couldn't have period. I felt really bad after saying it and I keep thinking about it in my mind of what I could have said instead. It had been bugging me my entire day and I just wanted to share and ask if you guys have had similar experiences."

tossawaytransasker,asktransgender,Should I transition? Worth it? Confused??? Please help?,"Ok, so I guess I have a couple questions that have really been burning holes in my head that I would really appreciate some help and guidance in dealing with. I’m sure the questions aren’t unique and I’ve read other answers, but I’m still so confused! 

1 Am I trans or is it maybe just a fetish or me tricking myself? 
2 If I am trans is it even worth transitioning? 
3 If I’m trans should I ever come out or is it better to stay in the closet forever? 
4 And possibly the least relevant, but possibly related, am I asexual? Or do I just not want to have sex as a man?
5 Is there anything I should do next?

I know these are personal and you all can’t give me super exact perfect answers, but I’d really appreciate any guidance or comparison of perspectives! I would really value a perspective other than the one that’s been brewing in my own head for years! This is also the first time I’ve typed or talked about any of this with anyone, so I hope I remember everything important...

So recently (well actually years and years) I’ve been really confused about my gender. So I was assigned male at north and right now I’m 21 and going to university. I’ve been unsure of my gender ever since I was 11 and I thought about about being a girl often. Like I wished on my birthday that I would wake up a girl the next day and sometimes I fantasized about being a girl instead of a boy. It might have been even earlier though because I remember dreaming about being a woman when I was in elementary school. But in my everyday life I didn’t really, well, hate being a boy, I would just have rather been a girl at times. Except for a few moments when I was sad I could pretty much deal with it. I also found out about trans people through the comic Venus Envy in middle school and then there was a period where I was almost certain I was trans and considered coming out, but then became unsure and didn’t say anything. Just because I thought I was in the past doesn’t necessarily mean I am though because I also believed that I had a certain personality disorder for a while before realizing I didn’t.

However before I had fantasies of being a girl I had fantasies of just changing to something different from myself. Like I would imagine becoming a different species or alien or something like that. Then as time went on I focused on only female versions of those other transformations and then transformations that focused on the gender aspect. This makes me wonder whether that was part of being trans or something unrelated that perhaps made me think I’m trans?

This next part mentions sexuality and stuff like that, so skip it if you’re not interested in that I guess. So then as I got older all of my sexual fantasies involved being a woman. To the point where I don’t think I ever masturbated except to some scenario in which I was a woman. This led me to reading many tg captions and stories online. Additionally, in a lot of my fantasies I was forced to become a woman, so it wasn’t my choice. And in my fantasies I would act in ways that I would certainly not act like in real life. Like I would accept new lives pretty easily whereas in real life I would fight hard if anyone did anything to me. This pretty much was continuous since then, with some variations in details, but always I was a woman who used to be a man in my fantasies. The fact that all of this involved my sexuality made me wonder whether I was really trans or whether I just had a fetish for becoming a woman.

Additionally in my fantasies I occasionally had sex with others, but I never really pictured them clearly in my head, the important thing was my image of myself. In real life I’m not attracted to men at all, and I find women pretty/cute, but not like I necessarily want to kiss or have sex with them. Like I wouldn’t really want that especially with my male body, but in my fantasies there are men and women who have sex with me and I enjoy it. Then about a year or so ago I heard about asexuality and thought about it for a while before thinking that I’m asexual. But now I’m wondering whether that’s only because I don’t want sex as a man, but as a woman I wouldn’t be asexual? I’m not sure about that either. And if it’s south mentioning I haven’t really kissed or ever had the urge to kiss anyone, even on a date. There were people I thought I should ask out, but I didn’t imagine myself kissing them or making out, more like just hanging out with them intimately.

I’ve been mildly repelled by things that are ""masculine"" my entire life, like if someone said to me ""man up!"" I’d be much less likely to listen to them. And when people talk about ""being a man"" it was something that I wanted to distance myself from. But I’m not sure if these are because of being trans or just because I have an urge to feel different from other people, so I decide to reject things that other people accept and vice versa.

But at the same time I wasn’t into super feminine things, even if I wanted to. Like I enjoyed being dominant (in non-sexual contexts, like seeking power) and aggressive. I also considered myself fairly unemotional for a long while. Plus I’m not really interested in makeup, which I feel like would be important for any sort of transition?

Then in my first year of college I started it off thinking I might be trans, but as it went on decided I probably wasn’t. I think it was mainly because I became really, really close friends with a girl I met and then I was actually really happy with the way my life was, so I really didn’t mind things the way they were. Like I would say that I was actually happy. Then she transferred to another school the next year and eventually the uncertainty and thoughts came back. I don’t know if that’s a sign I was never trans or if I just suppressed it for that time or what? And when I spend a lot of time with friends and feel generally pretty happy I don’t think about being a woman as much, though it is still something I think about, especially in sexual fantasies. Could this be a sign that I’m not really trans and I’m just searching for something wrong with myself and mistook that for transness?

This year I started doing roleplays with people where I acted as a man who becomes a woman in various scenarios and really enjoyed it for the most part. I don’t know if that’s any indication of anything either...

And now, even if I am trans, I’m considering whether it would just be better to never come out and keep it as a secret forever without transitioning. The reason for this is that I’m fairly ambitious and I wouldn’t want the potential harm to my career due to people being subtly sexist or transphobic could cause. I’m planning on going into a STEM field, so I wouldn’t expect it to be an enormous issue, but it would be another thing I need to deal with and worry about. I’m already doing a double (possibly triple) major and working in a part time job and working in a lab while possibly graduating early, so I don’t even know if I’d have time now or want to deal with it. And I would say that my career is pretty important to me and I’m pretty ambitious, so I wouldn’t want to harm that in any way. And even if I did transition I don’t think I could ever really achieve what I want to look like. whenever I imagine myself transitioning I always imagine a slightly more feminine version of my current face, which just seems really ugly to me. So if I couldn’t pass and the surgeries down below can’t really get me to being exactly a cis woman, then would I even be happier if I transitioned and had to deal with all of the problems that comes with it? If there were perfect equality between genders and I could start a new life I would very likely choose to be a woman, but there isn’t and I can’t, so I’m unsure.

I have pretty much disliked the way my face looked since puberty and I noticed that when I did self portraits even in art class with photo references my face ended up looking slimmer and sleeker, which appealed to me more. And I’ve also always hated my facial and body hair. When I first started to shave I really hated it to the point that I would put it off as much as possible because I didn’t want to remember it, but I was glad when it was done and I plucked all of my chest hairs in the shower for a long time until there were too many and it got too annoying. I don’t know if that means anything either because it could just be a manifestation of dissatisfaction with my body generally and on the other side I wasn’t a huge fan of female beauty stuff or super feminine clothing or anything like that. Like I prefer having pockets to carrying a bag and the idea of makeup as something I need to do every day doesn’t appeal to me. 

Sorry about what is clearly an enormous wall of text, but I just wanted to put down everything I could so that I could get some advice from people with more experience. I also typed this all on mobile, so sorry for any typos. I’d be willing to answer questions about anything not personally identifiable that I left out and thanks in advance for any advice!

TLDR: There are plenty of signs I’m trans, but also alternative explanations I would want to consider. And even if I am I don’t know whether it would hurt my ambitions to transition or if it would even be better for me."
day_now,asktransgender,I'm tired of not knowing who I am.,"Hi everyone, I'm freshly eighteen, and I always assumed I would have figured myself out by now but somehow I still haven't. 

If you aren't ready to read some of my long life story you should probably leave now. Sorry :$.

I have never been able to really, confidently say ""I am transgender."" When I was really young, I vaguely wanted to be a girl and I remember bringing it up to my parents and they just kind of told me ""No, you're a boy. Don't speak of such things."" and I was like ""okaaaaay!"" and didn't think about it for a while, but as I started moving into puberty and I started realizing more that boys and girls were different, and that I was developing into a different body, it sort of came up again to me, and I couldn't just ""forget"" about this vague interest. I would dream regularly about being turned into a girl, or I would fantasize about being a girl and being able to wear/do girly things, and I have faint memories of sneaking into my sister's room to play with her polly pockets, thinking that if it's a girl's toy then if I played with it, I would be a girl, too (Before I learned about Sexes and whatnot).

There was a long period of time where I was almost neurotic about sitting down to use the toilet because I didn't want to acknowledge my genitals, which I remember starting some time around when my sister was old enough that my parents stopped having us bathe together, and I wanted to know why, and they just gave me a vague answer about us being different. I was so confused! How were my sister and I any different!? They told me it had something to do with what's between my legs, so I just stopped looking at it if I could avoid it. I would pull my shirt down over my knees and sit on the toilet, or lean over and stare at the floor, anything.

Some time around when I was 12 or 13 I think I brought the topic to a close by... I think I went on the internet and looked up these sorts of feelings and I just read horrible things about surgeries and saw people who looked like men dressed as women, and I didn't want to be a part of that, so I once again buried the ""non-conformative gender"" ideas.

Well if you haven't stuck your tongue out at my story by now, I'm going to get a little bit more into my sexuality. As a younger sibling I looked to my sister a lot for how to do things, so when I saw her grinding on a pillow or the floor or something when we were watching spongebob (I swear my life isn't as fucked up and incestuous as it sounds...) I copied her, and I first masturbated that way (which, by the way, is called prone masturbation and guys aren't supposed to do that. Woops.) and I would find a way to leave space below my chest, and I would imagine that I had/grew breasts while/by doing this. In my internet travels, I discovered youtube videos like Miss Mako's channel and other TG/TF stuff like Random Transformations (1-100), and I got aroused by these videos and the fantasy of... I never quite figured out if it was me turning into a girl or the concept of a boy turning into a girl.

During all this sexploration and ""TG Porn"" watching I somehow convinced myself that this was normal and didn't mean anything about me as a person, and somehow forgot about my feelings when I was younger. Then a few years back I heard about a league of legends team, as I was a huge follower of the league scene at the time, called Renegades, in the sort of ""b-league"" for pro teams. The big thing about this team was that, they had a girl, and she was pretty much the only female professional league player who was actually good at the game and wasn't just on the team because boobs attract fans. She was known as Remilia at the time, and there was some big secret about her. Every reddit thread had tons of deleted posts, and everyone would dance around some subject, so I looked her up and I thought, wow, she's really cute, WOW, she's done awesome stuff on Thresh! But I never found a scandal, so I kind of obsessed over her for a bit and then I found out- she is transgender.

I was blown away. ""But, she's... cute. She doesn't look like a man."" it was the first time I saw the idea of a real person who was a guy turning into a girl, as a possible reality. This was around 2015 so I would have been about 16 at the time. And pretty much ever sense, it's been nagging me in basically every waking moment... am I trans? For a while I thought it was just some sort of fetish. Like transformation gets me off and that's it, but it seems like there's more to it. There was definitely something there when I was younger that got kinda snuffed out, and that was obviously not coming from a fetish, right? But maybe I just got exposed to strange things with my older sister and that's ""messed me up"" somehow? Did I just stumble upon tg stuff at a formative time in my life and it got ""imprinted"" on me somehow? I just don't know.

I've been 'out' to a few friends for a while now, and played around with asking to be called by female pronouns or a new female name but a lot of my friends wouldn't bother, or it would start feeling weird after a while, like this name is made up, it isn't mine, even if it felt really good at first. I daydream about being able to wear pretty skirts and other stuff like that a lot, but I can't figure out if it's a part of some sort of crossdressing/sissy something or another, or if I actually am a trans girl. I've played around with make up, and some female clothing I got on amazon, and it doesn't really give me any sort of 'thrill', in part because no one ever saw me in person wearing any of it but I sent pictures to my friends, and they would tell me how cute I looked, and it felt really really good. But I really wanted them to say I looked beautiful, even though I knew I didn't. I would have thought that if I were a crossdresser or something I would have gotten a sexual thrill out of the whole thing, and when I first saw the clothes, opened them, tried them on and stuff, there was a bit of a thrill, but it wasn't really sexual. It was a little bit, but the sexual part died down and I was still like EEEEE WHEN I DO A SPIN THE SKIRT DOES A SPIN THING AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THISSSSSSSS. But then that excitement dies down too and I just feel guilty for wearing ""wrong"" clothes, and I see how ugly I am or how masculine my body is and how it ruins the feminine appearance of the clothing. I sort of feel like... this is great, but society wouldn't accept me looking like this. And it's sort of, I don't really care as much about wearing a pretty skirt and dancing and spinning and skipping, I want to have ""society's"" ""permission"" to do things like that in public, or with friends. Like I could be perfectly fine just wearing jeans and a t-shirt like I already do, but I want to be a girl wearing those jeans and t-shirt is sort of how I feel.

When I look in the mirror, I hate my body. But that's normal for teens right? But when I look in the mirror I try to picture what I would look like as a girl, pretty much every time. if my face were a bit cuter, or I had some small breasts, or my hips were a bit broader, or if my butt were a little bigger... and for a while I played it off as ""pfsshtt red blooded male wants to see attractive women DUHHHH"" but I feel like that isn't really quite it. Just a couple days ago I had a dream where I woke up and leapt to my bedroom mirror with my shirt off, like I often do in real life, but this time I actually did magically develop small breasts overnight, and I got so excited! I don't remember anything else and I woke up then and quickly realized it was just a dream.

It's obvious that I'm not some cishet boy, all this in mind.
My big question at this point is, am I just fetishizing the idea of being a girl/turning into a girl? It's so confusing with me actually, you know, masturbating exclusively to stories and things of that concept for years. I saw a therapist... or well, a ""counselor"". She was a MFT which is marriage and family therapy or something like that, and I was always kinda disappointed because when I got the idea of going to see a professional, I wanted to go see, you know, black leather couch, old dude with a bunch of degrees who would sit there and ask me some simple questions and go, ""OH, IT'S AS CLEAR AS DAY TO ME, I CAN SAY WITH ABSOLUTE 100% SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY THAT YOU ARE IN FACT __________"" and I would go on my happy way with that information and possibly some drugs. But she mostly just sat there and listened to me complain and tried to steer the conversations towards my family and my depression, and I was annoyed because I really am coming here, and paying you, to help me figure out my gender identity. And she seemed to be bringing her own bias against it into the picture, she kept using words that made me feel uncomfortable, like she would say ""transgendered"" or something like that, and it just sounded really weird to me but I never said anything and it isn't really relevant to this post, except that she wasn't really a good therapist and didn't help me get anywhere with this and I don't know how to go about trying professional help again if that's what whoever is kind enough to read all this and try to leave a helpful comment. I feel really uncomfortable with the idea of like, cherry picking a therapist who will just greenlight a OH YEH UR TRANS TRANS POWER WOOOOOOO or something because, I have significant doubt about who I am and I know that won't help me, and I don't want to, a few months, years, whatever, down the line, to be like, oh no, this was a mistake. I'm really a man. Oh god. I have this desire right now to be... attractive. I mean I'm a teenager and I want to attract people and be attractive. But, I'm attracted to girls. Which means what I think attractive is, is a girl's body.

God, I just don't know. I live in the deep south and my parents aren't the greatest understanding people with trans* things, but I think they would mostly be fine and try to help me if I came out to them, but it's a really stressful thing to approach so I have been putting it off forever. That's part of the reason I was doubting the therapist-type person, I was maybe incorrectly attributing the typical stances of people around me to her. She would say she was okay with it, but she would say things like ""young men and women ruining their bodies with drugs (hormones)"" that just made me realize she wasn't really open to the idea at all. I hear about ideas shunned by the trans community like autogynephilia and I think, hey that describes me pretty well though! I just don't know. I want to know who I am, that's all. I feel like I can't relate to other trans girls, I never read someone's story and it sounds like this. It's either ""Well I came out of the womb with a big label on my forehead that said trans and my first word was estradiol, and my parents had me on t-blockers before puberty even set in!"" or ""Well I'm 60 years old but I finally found myself and am transitioning and it's hard on my family but I'm happy I found myself and wish I had done this earlier."" Where's the people who were so deep in the closet they mistook the light bulb for the sun and felt like they were free in the outdoors? My friends who are trans are so certain of themselves and I have no idea how. I don't have a label, or a deep seated knowledge of myself, or anything. I feel like I'm just kind of fucked up.

Sorry if I said or implied anything that is upsetting to anyone, I have/had a lot of internalized transphobia because of the years of denial and living in the political climate that I do, I don't mean to make any general statements about anyone, these are just like, all of my deepest doubts."
feelinqueer,asktransgender,Should I be different?,"I have recently come out to my family (at least the ones I still live with) that I am trans and they have been even more supportive than I ever imagined! It feels wonderful! Buuuut...

Now that the horrible stress, anxiety, and fear of coming out has finally been lifted and I have a supporting family behind me I have been able to relax some. It's great to be able to relax, but I feel almost guilty, or that I should still be in constant anguish from dysphoria but I am just not as much anymore, it's like now that I know that I will be working towards what I want finally, I feel like the dysphoria isn't as intense, and I still feel like the same person but just more relaxed/calm knowing that I am not just sitting idle anymore but actually working to fix myself. I will be going to be see a gender therapist soon and trying to get things figured out and hopefully get prepared for HRT while going through this coming semester as I am unfortunately locked into another semester of college before I can fully focus on this for a while because I will not be trying to publicly transition mid semester for my safety and comfort.

I guess what I am asking is it common to have an ease of dysphoria and being almost comfortable with yourself once you know that you won't be like your pre-transitioned self forever? Because I feel like I want to try to enjoy the rest of my male life (I am MtF) before I finally can be myself/a woman. Is this normal or should I be concerned about what I really want? Because I feel like other than me finally stopping my acting/portrayal of what I thought I was ""supposed to be"" aka a masculine male, that I will honestly be a pretty similar person as far as personality goes, is this common?"

IndecisiveDude,asktransgender,Is it possible to be cisgender with gender dysphoria?,"Is it possible for someone to be cisgender and have gender dysphoria?

(Slighty unrelated... I'm confident that I am nonbinary, but now that I'm back at college I've noticed that whenever I'm surrounded by women, I slip easily back into my old performance of female-ness since I tend to mirror whatever is around me. It's frustrating me a little, since I've explained to people that I prefer they/them pronouns and am extremely bothered when misgendered, and yet the only person that keeps misgendering myself around other people is meself. I keep slipping up and referring to myself with feminine nouns, and other people tend to follow my lead. I'm slightly asking this question because I'm slightly doubting my gender again, and I think it would be much easier for me to be a cis woman who experiences dysphoria about their parts that make them be clocked as female. I'm curious of your answer, not in relation to me.)

(Edit: I'm not asking if I might be cis. Because I'm not xD. I suppose I'm just curious about what it means to be cisgender.)"
guiduck,asktransgender,How do you cope with the binary in dating?,"I'm a trans woman in mid transition.  I just started dating in earnest a year ago.  

But so far it just seems that I'm too much of a girl for gay guys (obviously), too much of a guy for straight guys (also they are awful people now), bi guys are flaky and unsure (or taken), bi women don't exist (or are taken), and the lesbians I've met are not enthused by the whole situation (so awkward!) :( 

Also being pre-op has made everything infinitely more challenging.  There seems to be only one demographic that likes that current situation and they like it WAY too much (freaking chasers, *groan)

What's the use in finding yourself if no one wants to know the real you?  There are days I miss the lie.  It was horribly uncomfortable, awkward, and hurt me, but I wasn't all by myself :'(  Does anyone else feel that way?  And how do you deal with this stuff?  "

fuck_the_world13,asktransgender,"""Sob story"" rant sorry if this is long","I'm a ftm Transgender I'm also 15 (irrelevant but maybe it could help with something possibly) I came out to myself as Trans for almost a year not but I only recently came out to my mother. It didn't go well at all she was very hostile and very sure that I was making it up ""your life is so easy you just make up problems"" ""you're being brainwashed because you watching those fucking videos of men putting on makeup"" she's always been aggressive and angry towards me though she won't hit me. She likes to think she knows everything about how I'm feeling because she's been a teenager before and it bothers me because I don't tell her anything about how I'm feeling or my thoughts. Truth is ever since second grade the thought of being a boy and fantasizing about being about to pee standing up and having a penis was always in my mind. I never knew why but the thought of being physically a man made me happy I was quite strong as a child and was often told I hit like a man. Which made me happy I didn't understand why any time I was compared to guys I was happy. Third grade was bad I was forced to wear skorts and I hated it I live where it's pretty warm so it never really gets cold in the winter. In 4th grade I cut my hair but I hated it because it wasn't what I wanted, I wanted a boys haircut I wanted to shave my hair short like my brother but I was only allowed to get a bob. I hated it and thought maybe if I grew my hair out I'd be happy. Then around 5th grade I actually made female friends and I wanted to fit in so I focused on whatever the girls like. Boys and makeup and stuff I tried really hard to fit with the girls even tried to like the stuff my I couldn't connect with girls but no one really liked me. 6th and 7th were hell because I grew my hair out and tried makeup those were my darkest times I was never happy I hated everything and mostly I hated myself I lost lots of weight and was very suicidal but I've always not wanted to be alive. I tried to tell someone but when my mom got me alone she told me that I didn't have the balls to kill myself and I'm just doing it for attention I also had severe anxiety but that too was a lie to my mom so going to 8th grade I finally got my hair cut like a Boys and I was online really for the first time. I was constantly asked if I was a boy and if I was trans. I was confused and angry because as far as I knew I was a girl and I couldn't be anything else and then I learned about being trans and I kept saying and telling myself I couldn't be that I wasn't that it was wrong but I couldn't lie to myself so I finally accepted that that's who I was and how I really felt. I got comfortable with the idea and tried to find good ways to tell my mom and she got me mad and I told her too soon and now things are terrible because even know she tries to ""talk me out"" of it and tells me I cant because I'm too feminine and that I was a girly girl. She once yelled at me that she did everything she could so no one would body shame me and that people would always call me beautiful so I didn't grow up like her and she always talks about how she never felt she had to change her gender even though her family treated her like shit. I don't know what else to say I'm not as mad as when I started. Bye..."

Like whatsoever. I'm not particularly strong, and in general people would ask me if I want to get strong and buff and get muscles when I worked out and I got some, but I hated how bulky it made me feel. After that I had said that my ideal body was sleek and slender. Opposite of what I have now which is kinda chubby. Now that I'm exploring my gender identity I'm realizing that was likely my own dysphoria manifesting itself. "

ejlmca,asktransgender,[NSFW] Lately I've been fantasizing about using my penis and it's freaking me out [Wall of text],"Ever since pre-puberty, I've desperately wanted to be female. Imagining myself as a woman having sex with men was a big part of my initial discovery, but my feelings aren't only sexual. I went for years thinking it was impossible, before finding out that I was allowed to be a woman, and furthermore that transition was real and works. Now I'm impatiently saving up for it.

My sexual orientation is much more complicated. I love the thought of being with men, but looking at guys doesn't do anything for me. Looking at women does. So I've been identifying as bisexual. But the thought of the usual lesbian sex techniques doesn't do much for me. But recently I've found that the thought of using my penis on a woman is exotic and arousing in a deep and animal way. I hate it. I'm scared of how good it feels, better than my other fantasies.

It turns me on so much, but only for a few seconds. I feel jealous of the woman I'm imagining being with, that she gets to enjoy being penetrated. I miss being as aroused by the thought of being penetrated as these moments of imagining penetrating make me. I feel manly, and that makes me disoriented. I know it's possible to be a woman and have a penis, but that's not what I imagine.

I hate this, I wish I could press a button and forget what having a penis feels like. I wish I could push a button and find men attractive, not just their penises. I wish I had been born a cis girl, so that whatever weird fantasies I came up with, my assigned gender could assure me I was still a woman instead of making me doubt.

But, since these sexual fantasies are a part of me, and arouse me so much, doesn't that obligate me to adjust my identity to acknowledge them? Is it really a good idea to commit to a life where I'd miss out on something morally permissible that felt so good? If imagining sex as a woman was among the first steps in the journey that led me to identify as a woman, is imagining sex as a man the first step back? But I don't want to go back.

More than anything, I'm scared that this is going to disqualify me from getting to be a woman. I'm scared  that my dysphoria and ability to see myself as a woman will slowly dry up, and that I'll slowly come to terms with ""accepting myself as a man"" using ""self-love"" and then I'll be stuck living the rest of my life as a guy. How did this happen to me? I had so much confidence in my womanhood, but now I'm doubting and scared that I'll start to find evidence that my transgender feelings were all just a big misinterpretation of my sexual attraction to women, caused by religious repression.

I feel like I'm not actually a trans woman. It feels like I'm just imagining myself as a woman, consciously generating a feminine feeling. It feels right and and comforting, and I've come to generate it by habit, but it's not the plain, bare-bones me. I don't even know what the plain me wants, is it the same as what I want? Mostly it feels empty, and jealous of women, and attracted to women, but then I get back to my generated feeling. I wanted to be a woman so bad during my teen years that I started secretly pretending I was one, and I feel like I'm still just pretending. It's a habit I can do effortlessly, but it's still an act. I want to be a woman for real...is the me when I drop all my pretends still a man? Can I become a different me just by wanting it?

All these feelings are flighty, by the time you read this I probably won't feel like anything at all. Already some of the stuff I wrote at the start seems only half true, but it as true when I wrote it. I'm coming apart. I'm a complete mess, I feel like a factory defect. I wish I had been aborted... I want to go back to pretending I'm a girl and being comfortable and happy, but I feel like it's a disservice. I have to crack my mind open and become the real me

Nothing in my life feels real or genuine anymore

CERES_1943_XB,asktransgender,advice talking to girlfriend about dysphoria?,"For background I'm a 21 year old (dude? I guess? hopefully? biologically at least...) in college. I've never really outright identified as transgender, and don't right now either. I've only told one friend in real life about the following.  


I've dealt with this sort of dysphoria that comes and goes and its caused a lot of anxiety historically. It was particularly bad my freshman year, but I seem to alternate between being disgusted with who I am, and being disgusted that I had ever felt that way in the first place. When it was bad I would break down crying about it, and now its sort of settled into this weird sort of bitterness over what I know can't ever be reality. Or, if I'm feeling great, I'm completely confident in who I am and kinda grossed out over what I was feeling before. Its really difficult to explain properly, and its been confusing as hell. I had been doing alright for a good while, but then I cut my hair short again (it had just gotten to be long and pretty again too) on a whim and lo and behold I'm not feeling great. 


I've been in a long term relationship with a wonderful girl, but I haven't ever discussed this with her and I feel immensely guilty about not having done so. On the other hand, I'm terrified that she'll take it the wrong way or start to think of me differently. She's said things before like ""You'd make a pretty girl"" as playful teasing but she has no idea how bittersweet (and sometimes kind of uncomfortable) it is to hear that. I'm really at a loss as to what to do. Any thoughts? Should I perhaps talk to a therapist or something first?

I mean it already did, I feel it... but just browsing /r/ftm it's like i'm fucking proud as hell of them. They know they're guys! and to do it.. To really go for it. It makes me reflect towards myself positively. I'm a girl. I know it, i'm going for it.

one month, one week is different from the last. I inch towards my ultimate goal every day. I know it's right for me, I know that others know it's right for them. I'm thankful we have each other in this, we move forwards, together, in opposite directions towards the same destination. "
neonfyre,asktransgender,"Orchiectomy, Antiandrogens and Hair loss","Alright, this is going to be a bit weird so bear with me.

So Ive seen Mtfs say that they have reversed hairloss on Hrt. I was just wandering if say, one stops taking hrt and has an orchiectomy, what would happen then?. All blockers and estrogen would be stopped indefinitely.

Would the hair regrowth that was obtained upon hrt continue to grow or would it fall out to pre hrt levels?

I know that women lose hair after pregnancy temporarily because of the oestrogen levels going low, and there is also androgen receptor upregulation in the hair follicle in finasteride users who take it for six months(read it on a hair loss forum). Castration destroys t production but the adrenals do produce some dht and t. Would this be enough to cause hair loss again?

So my question is, can you bald if you take hrt and then have an orchiectomy or decide to just take finasteride after having regrowth on hrt?.

Please bear with my shitty knowledge on the subject. If anyone can answer my questions I would be very happy.

Calypso57,asktransgender,Coming out help!,"I'm mtf pre everything and 16yrs old and I think it's time I finally come out to my mom so I can get help.

I have extreme difficulty talking about my emotions with other people so I feel like I have to say it quick which would force me to keep talking about it. If I were to say ""I want to talk"" she says ""hold on a few minutes"" etc. I feel like I'd back out. 

I feel like the only way for me to not back out is to just start off saying ""mom. I'm trans."" Then following it up with how it's the reason behind the depression I have and hid from her and the time I was in the hospital for being suicidal etc. and the real reason behind me claiming to be sick to take off school days.

Years later I caught myself laughing like my roommate, a deep guffaw with a little bit of a snort.

Now as an adult I have a wide toolbox of laughs for all sorts of kinds of humor, but since I grew up male almost all of them are masculine (there's a few girlish giggles in there, and my maniacal laugh is pure Villianess). Now I'm finding myself smacked with dysphoria whenever I belt out and it really harshes my mellow.

kalegg,asktransgender,How do I stay sane?,"(22 MTF) Two months ago I finally accepted I was a girl and at first it was sooooo great. But now there's so much pressure and complications that I'm terrified I'm going to have to put my transition plans on hold.
I thought I was doing things the right way by going to a gender therapist. When I was told the bill would say gender dysphoria on it, i thought I could bite the bullet so I didn't fight coming out to my mom. Nbd right?

Wrong. She says all right if that's how I feel but that's the only support I've gotten. The rest has been here constantly making me question this decision and pushing her worries and anxieties onto me. Then she makes me come out to my dad something I was not ready for but I felt that I could get that big step over with if I had a week to prepare and did it in therapy. She told him behind my back two days before the session and so I was bombarded with logistical questions from my dad trying to get me to wait till I've graduated and have a career in two years to start transitioning. All while my moms just sitting there only able to say how much they care.

Those words have always rang hollow though. As the second oldest in a family of four, overlooked doesn't even scratch the surface of how I feel. How can they support me when the only attention I've every gotten is when I did something wrong? Like after consistent struggles at college I worked my ass off last semester and got good grades and the only praise I got was how nice of a Christmas present it was for my parents. Other than that, nothing. Also, ever since I the thereapy session my dad has pretty much been avoiding me, I can count the amount of conversations we had these weeks on one hand.

But wait there's more! My college struggles stem from serious neurological issues. Don't worry, I already came out to my doctors and it was so refreshing to hear them say it was no big deal. The problem is that I am trying to get off this iv medicine treatment I get twice a month. The doctors said I could cut it in half if i take this other medicine called methotrexate. Some of you probably know it because in a high enough dose it's chemotherapy. Ill be taking the minimal which is mainly used for rheumatoid arthritis which my symptoms resemble. I'll have to stop drinking and be more healthy which is probably a good thing but I don't need any more responsibilities these days. These aches and pains also get worse in the winter, causing me to have to drop out of school the past two years during spring semester. I'm now in a smaller more appropriate college for my health issues but it's spring semester again so I'm stressing out. 

I also have to find out how to come out to my friends on campus. 

Im terrified of dropping out again and having to remain dependent on my parents even longer. I'm praying that one day will come when they realize that this is something that has always been there. It feels more of me revealing my dearest parts of my identity than changing the fundamental ones. But there's so much pressure and stress right now. I have a new semester, new medications, problems relating and not relating to my gender at home, and a pit of loneliness that is not going away. With so much up in the air, I'm scared I'm going to collapse under all this weight. So I have to ask, how do I stay sane?"

""...Of course, these shows have made transgender identities more visible than before. But they also suggest that transgender people are ‘acceptable’ only so long as they embody established norms of physical beauty. This kind of conditional validation intensifies the historical race- and class-based exclusions that run through makeover culture more broadly. Jenner’s vast material wealth is clearly at odds with the lived experiences of most transgender women, as many critics and activists have observed – particularly trans women of colour, who often can’t afford to undertake bodily transformation in quite such a fast and spectacular fashion.

As far back as the 1990s, the academic Marjorie Garber said we should look to transgender people to understand the meaning of gender categories. Today, the narrative of transgender life embodied by figures such as Caitlyn Jenner – one in which changing the body brings forth the authentic self – speaks to the wider importance that we place on being true to who you ‘really are’. This drive to embody our authenticity and to manifest our potential through physical appearance applies whether you are cisgender or trans, straight or gay, a woman or a man or neither. It’s deeply entwined with the changing nature of these categories within contemporary cultural life."""

I try not to cry in school but it's pretty hard. At home I can finally cry myself out. I actually cry alot when I see girls on the internet from my town or even worse when I see girls that look really good on instagram. Seeing how pretty some trans turned out but they were much more better looking and feminine as a boy than I was so I will probably will not be able to look this good even though it depresses me to not look that good as it is and always be my biggest wish.

I want to hide myself because I hate to be different, masculine and ugly so I almost not talk at all and I am very lonely.

1. Tweezing/pulling hair is a big no-no, because it damages the follicles and makes electro less effective later on.
2. Epilators are a great option, but does their method of operation cause the same damage tweezing does?
3. Does waxing fit in the same boat as epilators?
4. Where does products like Nair fit in? Are they safe to use on your face if you're wanting to get electrolysis eventually?
5. Laser hair removal should be used for first few treatments for permanent removal, with less effectiveness as your hair gets lighter
6. Electrolysis should be used to clean up the remnants left by Laser.

graveldinger,asktransgender,"Can't bring myself to come out/transition (MTF, pre-everything)","(My sincere apologies for the excessive length of this post.) 

Hi everybody,  

I'm fairly certain that I'm a closeted transwoman: I didn't play with dolls or cross-dress in my childhood, but I've always felt feminine, something which has sapped my self-esteem and will to live throughout most of my life. In general, I feel considerably ""distanced"" from my body, my thoughts and emotions, and the occurrences that make up my daily life. In other words, I feel as though I don't ""know myself"" and I care far less about my own fate than I should. I've always experienced confusion and insecurities with regards to my sexuality. I've often obsessed about my weight. I've practically never had a social life (irl, that is) and rarely leave the house. Over the course of the past year, my self-image has steadily deteriorated and I've thought of suicide more than ever before. 

I have, at various points of my life, spent considerable amounts of time reading about the experiences of different trans women and ever so slowly taking steps to assume a female identity (i.e. growing my hair out, shaving regularly, trying to dress in a more androgynous fashion, etc.). However, I've always given up after a few months. I'll turn 25 this summer. I can't help thinking that with every year that passes, it will grow more difficult for me to begin transitioning. As such, I want to start counseling and then HRT as soon as possible. Unfortunately, this would require that I come out to my parents, on whom I'm entirely dependent, and...I just can't bring myself to do it. I don't expect them to disown me: generally speaking, they're not all that traditional and moreover, we already have two openly LGBT relatives whom we see regularly. Still, I'm confident that my dad - the cop, baseball coach and all-around manly dude who's already asked me several times if I was gay - will be crushed. I think that my mother will likely take the news a bit better, but then again she may ignore me, or conclude that I've merely found a convenient explanation for my mental health issues. Regardless of how they react, though, I can't rid myself of the feeling that to reveal to them my desire to live as a woman would amount to saying ""you were right, Mom and Dad, I'm everything that you feared I might be: a pussy, a fag, a complete and utter failure, and a basket case, and not only that...but I only want to get weirder and more fucked up!"" I worry that if my dad sees me dressed as a woman or hears me speaking with a feminine voice, he'll suffer a depressive episode or a psychotic break. I don't know to what end I'm telling you all this, but I don't know what the hell else to do.   "

possiblyProbable,asktransgender,It's back. How do I get in touch with a gender therapist?,"25, AMAB

When I was 21 or so I went through a year's period of questioning my gender. Before then I only had sexual thoughts of forced feminization fantasies, but around that time I began to think that my life would be more fulfilling in all aspects were I a woman, non-binary, just not a man.

I told a couple people but pretty much received only ignorant responses, nothing particularly supportive. I was too afraid to go through with anything transition-wise, other than buying some feminine clothing. But that didn't feel right with my male body, and I don't see myself being much of a feminine woman.

So, I guess I pushed these thoughts and feelings to the back of my mind after that. But recently they've begun to surface again, and I'm afraid that this cycle will continue indefinitely if I don't try.

My plan is to get in touch with a gender therapist to confirm whether this is legit, or simply a manifestation of my anxiety problems. So my question to all of you is, how do I do that? And in an affordable way?"

SeleneMarie,asktransgender,Came out to my dad,"For those who know my story on here I was held back by my dad. I told him because I'm tired of the tension.. And I honestly don't know what happened.

This time I didn't make the mistake I made with my mom. I went into it firm and explained the steps I'm taking. I'm not asking him to understand it, or even accept it, just respect it. I would love for him and my mom to be involved in the process, but I'm moving ahead regardless. 

The tone of the whole conversation is, 'it is what it is'. My dad has the belief that whatever he believes is irrelevant, because while he may see something as wrong the whole country has changed (from his conservative viewpoint). 

I obviously still have a home, but understandably he isn't sure about the new name and pronouns. Out of respect I told him that I'm waiting to begin a higher dosage of HRT to make sure I land something as male, when I feel ready to begin presenting I'll let them both know ahead of time, and of course asking for name/pronouns. 

As for where it goes from here? No idea, but at least my folks can talk and I can be open about this whole thing finally. I still feel scared of ultimate rejection from him because of the statement, 'I don't know how I'll feel about you dressed as a woman, or even having a new name because of 25 years as dead name,' but alea iacta est.

I don't think that HRT can actually give me a body like this nor change my face this extreme. My chin, my jaw and my hairline are really masculine and this won't change. I will not have the money for this for a long time anyway.

The problems with my body is that my chest has a masculine shape even though it is very thin and I have already developed very thin male hips.

I don't know what it is to truly be openly trans, but I feel like I must be. Growing my hair out, shaped eyebrows, pierced ears, women's clothing in most aspects of life (save shoes and work jeans), somewhat perceptible bra and breasts, very noticeable collarbone, no masculine mannerisms (except those stemming from my GODAWFUL voice). Sometimes wear women's glasses when I'm not feeling too self-conscious.

Whatever, could be more. Point is, none of this stuff is obvious enough to the cis people in my life - the ones I'm not out to - for them to get a clue and realize I'm trans. But's it hardly negligible either.

So a kid - somewhere from 16-21. I'm terrible with guessing age. - asked me at my place of work (cashier at Panera) if I was trans. And I've never had anybody actually fucking get that before? So I said, yeah, you are the first person to ever ask me that - how did you know? He said he'd had both a trans bf and gf and that he recognized the signs or something. Any perceptive queer person probably could, given what I listed. He then proceeded to gender me correctly: not with a she, but by saying that I looked pretty. Which is complete bs, but I loved hearing it. So, uh, thanks random guy, for trying to help self-esteem today. I definitely needed it.

Here's hoping he actually reads this subreddit.

That's the first time that a stranger has called me pretty (not that I got ""handsome"" often, I'm just average), and so I'm kind of touched that someone did that. But I'm also thinking that maybe he was just savvy enough about trans people to know when one of us needs the ego boost.

Also, if you do read this subreddit, please come in again. Not desperate for attention, just don't have many non-judgmental people to talk to (in this state).

Reon98,asktransgender,Queer Friends?,"So, this is much more general, but I'm curious. 

A few years back, when I started high school, I made some new friends- as one does. At the time, we were all pretty sure everyone else in that group was straight, cis, not queer in any way. Now we are at the end of senior year, and I'm hard pressed to name one of us who isn't queer. Is this just coincidence, or do queer people have a tendency to find other queer people even before leaving the closet?"

I get these crazy sensations of disassociation, where I feel like I'm both incredibly huge and yet incredibly tiny compared to my surroundings. I get these horrible senses of paranoia when it happens.

I lie awake for hours, every night. I can't sleep. I don't want to sleep. I cut myself instead. The pain both keeps me awake and stops me hallucinating.

I wish that I was dead, but I can't kill myself. I just can't. But I can't make myself do anything else either. Dysphoria has caused depression and massive anxiety, and I can't even function around people I don't know.

I can't even make myself talk to my parents. I'm scared of getting kicked out, and having nothing. Even more nothing than I already have. If they kick me out, I *will* die, and I don't want to die. I want to be myself.

abbxrdy,asktransgender,Why do TERFs support restroom legislation when the only way to enforce it is to submit to patriarchy by encouraging the state to police women's bodies?,"Whether or not someone gets carded under suspicion is going to depend solely on the appearance of individuals and the opinion of somebody who should probably be doing something more useful with their time. 

What's considered socially normative feminine appearance in any society consists of a feedback loop that's heavily weighted by men's preferences and a majority of women who consider it important to live up to it in order to match social expectations. 

Fall out of line and you end up dealing with the consequences. Hair is too short? Maybe wearing the wrong pants? Show me your ID. Now you have male police officers in the ladies room, enforcing dress codes and hair styles. 

The majority of the people likely to be harassed are cis lesbians, and straight women who don't care about maintaining a stereotypically feminine appearance. Trans folk are kind of rare and they typically spend a *lot* of time trying to blend and match those societal expectations. Most will fly under the radar undetected. "

s_feld,asktransgender,"looking for advice about social transition as a non-passing, fem presenting trans-woman","hey folx,

been reading on here for the last few weeks and the perspective it's given me has literally changed my life, so thanks! &lt;3 

i'm a trans girl who came out as gender questioning/ non-binary to nearly all of my communities last year. i've [quite] recently realized that i'm a girl and since then, although the subtle depressive/dissociative feeling that i've had since my adolescence has gone away, my dysphoria is raging and i feel desperate to do something about it. 

i guess this puts me in a somewhat strange position, where i don't really feel prepared to socially transition but i don't think i can handle living with my birth name and old pronouns any longer. right now i'm seriously considering just going for it and publicly coming out tomorrow. 

i've been dressing pretty femme for the last year or so, but not really wearing makeup. i don't pass and i have a pretty low voice (or at least it feels that way lol). although, most of my communities are trans-posi and i'm v fortunate to have received a lot of support, i feel super nervous about living as a non-passing trans woman, specifically navigating social spaces that won't understand that i'm trans. 

so i guess i'm looking for advice, general support or things to look out for with a social transition.  are there specific things i should really consider/prepare myself for before doing so?

Thank all of you.,"It's been a rough road, and it's been filled with lots of resentment but after the holidays and after an awesome party, I accidentally blurted out to my wife that I wasn't sure if I was a girl or a boy and that it changed. And she also said I think you're a girl sometimes too and that she would love me no matter what. This incident was the catalyst to a follow up conversation where I basically said that I hated how she was so ok with many trans people and when I came with the possibility of me being mtf she freaked out and how hurt I was that she couldn't support me or I couldn't talk to her about it. Some tears were shed and she was just saying it's hard for her to handle change in her life and that she was damaged. And that she's understands. She also was worried about me transitioning and doesn't want to get pregnant if I'm going to transition in the near future. Because it would just be too much for her to handle. Then she was scared that I wanted to transition and I told her I'm still not certain myself. And that it comes and goes and that I'm likely genderfluid. She said she can totally handle that and that so long as I take things slow I can continue to explore and that she loves me and will always choose me but to please give her time to adjust and get used to the new things. 

Her biggest concern is that I'll change and stop loving her and leave her for a man. Because I'm a woman now, and we just talked for a while and she just set some ground rules for the time being saying that until I know for sure to stay in the closet with our family and what not.

But basically I should continue exploring and that I should talk to her and she will be as supportive as possible with my genderfluidity. She also said If I transition that we will work it out and go to therapy and that she loves me but doesn't want to lose the person she loved. 

I totally understand all of this and I want to be myself and I'm not 100% sure I want to be a full time female. Given the option I would love to have a switch. Be a boy and a girl. That's my ideal. I'm not 100% sure if this will change but I'm ok with this for the time being. And feel like that's what best describes me right now. 

But I'm so relieved I went from thinking my marriage was close to ending to it being reinvigorated with the magic of Alcohol and subsequent communication. I'm so excited to have this support and any advice for how to continue to explore while not pushing my wife too much would be ideal."
NightBrewess,asktransgender,Best Friend might be trans (spreading the disease lul),"So a year ago I came out as trans mtf to the world. I was lucky to have a group of friends who did not mind at all. To them not much had changed, I was still me. Anyway, one of those friends from my group has been working with me at a brewpub (he's a bartender I'm a brewer). Working with him has really given me a lot of insight into things that make me question that he might be trans as well. 

When we were just out of high school he would say things like ""I mean I'm a person, I wouldn't refer to myself as a man,"" and so and so. Him and I had very similar upbringing's (depressed single mom childhood lol) 

Anyway very recently he's been very restless and sort of depressed, in a very similar way to the way I was just before I came out. In fact even one night him and I were talking and we got pretty in depth about gender (we have a lot of these talks) and he mentioned that ""He wishes he were a girl but he doesn't think he could transition"" I didn't want to pry and I haven't asked him about it since.

RefreshToken,asktransgender,Understanding hormone reference ranges,"I just got my latest lab results back - I'm at 25 ng/dL serum test, 40 pg/mL estradiol, 6 hours after my last HRT dose. I am taking 200mg spiro, 6mg transbuccal estradiol, and 5mg finasteride.

I'm having trouble understanding how to tell whether or not these levels are good. My doctor and various sources around the web cite the ideal estradiol level as about 200 pg/mL, but this is a huge oversimplification - unless I'm on a patch or implanted pellet, my levels are going to swing up and down based on the time since my last dose. It's one thing to say this should be the mean level, but calculating the mean level is unrealistic, unless I somehow get a blood test every 30 minutes for an entire day. Does anyone out there have more exact insight on measuring levels when spikes are known to occur? (For what it's worth, my doctor's position is to do basically whatever without going over 200, and we're more interested in monitoring my prolactin levels for the moment.)

As far as testosterone suppression goes, it seems that spiro works mainly through long-acting metabolites, so timing isn't as important to worry about. I'm interested in hearing from transmasc folks regarding difficulties in measuring testosterone supplementation, though!"

masterFurgison,asktransgender,Can you help me understand a subset of transgender beliefs?,"Hello! This is my first post in transgender. I am not transgendered. Original I have been suspicious of some transgenderism for the apparent bandwagensim of it by certain political groups, but I've been reading studies that have been very convincing of the ""realness"" (I know its that's a bad way to say it). Obviously I want to understand this community and end any ignorance I may have.

Anyways, this is what I'm still struggling with. Some transgender people seem to propose that they literally are male brains in female bodies, or other way around. This has been the most difficult for me to accept. A male brain is different than a female brain because of hormones right? A male brain is basically a female brain damaged by hormones or so I've read lol So that's my premise

Now, some people who have this mindset that they are actually another brain, will take hormones to transfer. This obviously has what they consider benefits on their body. For conciseness, let consider Male to Female. This transition causes loss of muscle, increased flexibility, loss of body hair etc.

Here's the kicker, it also cause changes in personality. Decreased aggression, decreased competitiveness, decreased sex drive and decreased ""alpha male"" behaviors in general. Correct me if I'm wrong on this. This to me disproves the idea that these peoples brain are actually different. It would only be different because of differences in hormones, yet they take the different hormones and then have the same changes associated with someone who wouldn't have a different brain. 

Is this subset of transgender people unknowing incorrect, or am I totally missing something? I would love some insight

I heard back from the P.A who I was supposed to see, and also my therapist who recommended the practice.  As it turns out the woman who took exception to me is known for being a nasty miserable person all around - in other words, it's wasn't personal, she's just a cunt to everyone, which is why they keep her in the back away from the patients. 

I am concerned that none of the other staff spoke up when this incident happened, and that they were complicit in lying about what happened when asked by the P.A why her schedule had suddenly changed.  Had I not spoken up then no one would have admitted to what had actually happened.  

The specific woman in question will be directly addressed, and dealt with, though I assume that *dealt with* just means finding a darker corner to stick her in rather than firing her, which is what *should* be done considering that she's so nasty with people.  

All that said I still don't plan to go back there, nor will I recommend the practice to anyone else - I'm going to try my luck with a Temple office in Ft. Washington, and see how that goes. "

YetAnotherGuitarist,asktransgender,My Ultimate Stealth Trans Plan - will it work?,"Hi all, I was hoping to elicit some opinions regarding an idea I've recently come up with. This may take some explaining, so I apologise in advance.

I'm AMAB. I am, by all accounts, still questioning, but there's no doubt in my mind that there are certain female characteristics I would very much like to have (breasts and a more feminine face, for instance). I don't feel male and it bothers me to be defined as one. On the other hand, I'm happy with my voice and my (masculine) name, and my genitalia don't faze me much. I don't think I would like to fully transition to female.

On top of that, I don't want to upset my family. My mother has a lot of stress due to an ailing relative, so for her sake I wouldn't want to 'come out'. I'd like to keep things simple and remain male.

So, to my plan, in which I hope to be able to present in either direction. I'll get on HRT, remain in 'boy mode' for the most part while still getting more feminine features. If I get any breast growth I'll hide it with a binder. My haircut is fairly gender-neutral, but I'll make sure to have it cut in a way that works for both. And then I can 'girl mode' it when I feel like it/when I'm around friends.

My questions to you - is this an awful plan? Will I be able to hide it from my family, even a long time down the line? Should I even bother, given the discomfort I feel is only mild? Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Shockingpink13,asktransgender,I'm starting to Think that my Pastor is Against me Being Trans,"Pre hormones

Hi everyone.  A few months ago I did an experiment, and what I did was I asked various pastors on their opinion on transgender people and their thoughts on me being trans.  After about a week, I had about ten responses in my e mail account.  To my surprise, many of them (at least 7 out of 10) said they had no problems with it, that being trans is not a sin, etc. etc.

However, there were some who had (shall we say) a different opinion.  Particularly one who said something along the lines of, 'You were born a male'  'Being trans is a sin' and more nonsense like that.

One pastor invited me to lunch, and I went and during the entire meal I kept wondering what his thoughts were on trans people.  I asked him at one point, told him my story, and yet he never offered an opinion.  Instead, he invitiled me to visit him in his office the next Wednesday.

So I went, and eventually it became a week by week thing.  We never talked about me being trans, and at that time I believed that he wasn't trying to condem me, but to try and educate with me about God.

Now, I'm not so sure.

Today, I did bring up the fact that I was trans.  And, when it was almost time to leave, he asked me what God was sating about me choosing to live this life.  He asked me if he told me that what I was doing was right or wrong.  If I was making the right decision.

I told him that he didn't, and we talked for a few more minutes before dropping the subject.  But I have a strong feeling, in my gut, that he doesn't like the fact that I'm trans.  I have the feeling that he's waiting for me to say that no, I'm not trans.  It's just a feeling that I have had ever since leaving.

Am I being paranoid?  Should I keep going back?  Please tell me your opinions."

Turns out it's responsible for a lifetime of mental problems, so that's fun, especially at age 28.

I've seen a couple therapists, ""aced"" the GD test, and now am battling some crippling depression and anxiety thanks to my ignorant bliss fading.

We both love each other and have known each other since middle school. We've dated for over 8 years, and our souls are truly linked.

But she doesn't want a wife. She wants a husband, and has zero physical attraction to women. The idea of me as one is just way too much for her to handle. But at the same time my GD is constantly attacking me now, and I almost daily wear women's clothing at home.

All this time I've been so set on being all in as a woman or being all in staying as a guy. No middle ground.

Could a solution be something I haven't really considered before? Is it possible that it could work for me to do HRT to quell my mind and experience some level of being female, but never fully transitioning, and never presenting as anything but male?

Maybe this way, the hormones can do their thing, but my wife doesn't fully lose her husband? I regain some happiness and love of life, while she doesn't have to sleep with another girl?

Obviously much of this would probably depend on how my body responds to the hormones, but in most cases outside of the breasts (which no females in my family have much to brag about) and some facial changes, I should still be able to present as male right?

This could be wishful thinking, but my wife wasn't completely opposed to me going on hormones for a bit with no intention of ever really being perceived or looked at as a woman.

I appreciate the help, and when my wife texted me ""we can try that"" in regards to trying hormones and not planning on fully transitioning, my heart nearly fell out of my body.

Edit: And one additional question, sorry. How expensive is sperm banking and at what point would I want to do it? We plan on having kids still, which has been a pretty big issue with this whole thing. Thanks!"

KegawaTails,asktransgender,HRT effects,"So I'm a boy and about to turn 19. I would like to know if the effects of HRT would revert if I started taking treatment then stoped after 2,4,6,8 or 10 months. I have a few questions so I will just list them.

Would my fat/muscle groups, hair and penis go back to normal?
What effects would it have on my hips?

 Would they be permantly wider?

What mental effects would I encounter?

If I went on for 6 months the off for another 6 months then back on for another 6 months would that mess up my body?

I'm currenntly not that concerned with fitting in but when on HRT will I become more concerned?

Can you take full doses from day 1?

How would this affect my libido as I'm mostly intrested in this for the self pleasure side.

Edit: whats the diffrence between pills and shots?

theaether,asktransgender,What does it mean to be a woman?,"I have a burning question about transgender women and some preconceived notions as to what the answer may be, but I don't think that's good enough, so here I am. 

I currently have very little exposure to the transgender community, and there's much I don't understand, so apologies in advance if I don't even have the vocabulary to ask the questions I have in the most effective and most respectful way. I do hope it is clear that I am here to learn (and unlearn). 

I attended the women's march today in my city, and I thought it was amazing. There were women of every age and colour, holding up the snarkiest, funniest, most insightful signs, and everyone was so good-natured. Good vibes all around, despite it being a bit chilly and crowded. 

I come home, and I'm flipping through some Twitter feeds, and I see these types of posts and discussions:  

&gt; IF YOUR FEMINISM REVOLVES AROUND ""PUSSY POWER"" AND ""FREE THE TITS"" YOUR FEMINISM IS BORING. DO MORE RESEARCH, THEN COME BACK 

&gt; this isn't a cis women's march, it is a WOMENS march, don't erase the existence of trans women w ur ovary and vagina t shirts &amp; signs please

I can understand that trans women are rightfully part of WOMEN's movements, I can understand that if rightfully we consider transgendered persons, not all women have ovaries and vaginas or 'pussies,' and I can understand the frustration that trans women get low visibility when it comes to WOMEN'S issues writ large (vice being their own topic, aka ""your issues are not women's issue but trans women's issue,"" etc). 

But why is it problematic for a women's march to feature women wearing t-shirts or signs that talk about the female body? Especially if the point is to push back against specific issues or incidents of abuse having to do with those female body parts (ie ""grab them by their pussies,"" reproductive health issues, abortion, the tampon tax, etc)? 

So then my questioning started spiraling: Why are these not allowed to be featured in a women's rights march? If these aren't allowed, what is ""allowed"" in a march that is specifically about rights for women? What rights do women, specifically as women, need and deserve? What does it mean to be a woman, as an entity separate from every other entity in its category? 

If because I am a cisgendered woman, I can't talk about the fact that I have a pussy that was threatened with wanton grabbing, or that I may be forced to carry any future pregnancies to full term despite danger to my life, then what is it I should be marching for? 

Then of course, I wonder -- what is it trans women who marched today marched for? I'm guessing that just as I have cisgender-specific issues (as the above) to march for, they have transgender-specific issues they likely marched for, things I can sympathise with but can't do them the offense of saying I can 'relate' to, like society's callousness for body dysphoria, transgender-targeted abuse and hate crimes, anti-trans laws and regulations, and I'm sure a slew of other issues that deserve attention. 

But if we were to do away with cisgender-specific issues and transgender-specific issues and only focus on what these posts called ""WOMEN'S"" issues -- what is that? 

What does it mean to be a woman? What ""should"" a women's march look like? 

Any and all perspectives welcome and respectfully requested. "
mjperry96,asktransgender,Am I transgender or am I in denial?,"About five months ago I started to seriously question my sexuality after believing myself to be a biological heterosexual male for all of my life. After going through multiple online tests, I eventually came across the S.A.G.E. test and learned that I was an autogynephiliac in addition to being mostly male. Putting the term into Google, I was extremely scared by what I saw; mainly the implication that I might in fact be a repressed transexual. Doing some more digging, I came across the *New Crossdream Life Forums* and was relieved in thinking that what I was experiencing was more *normal* than I originally believed it to be. 

Just a few days after finding that forum, I stumbled upon an *asktransgender* post that asserted that crossdreaming was a dressed-up term coined for the purpose of denying being transgender. And now I find myself once again in a position where I have no clue what I really am. I'm petrified by the idea that in some sense I might be lying to myself. In my first post on the *New Crossdream Life Forums*, I talked about how I was content with who I am physically. However, the more that I'm left to my thoughts, the more I seem to be considering what things would be like and if they'd be any better if I was a girl. Ever since I was a little kid I wondered, but I always just accepted who I was physically and moved on. A part of me feels compelled to transition, but another part is telling me to stay put.

When I look in the mirror, I don't necessarily hate what I see. But I don't necessarily love it either. In that moment, I can't imagine myself being anybody else or looking any other way. And when I imagine myself as female, I have an extremely hard time picturing what I'd look like. When I'm depressed and imagine myself that way, I feel happier, but only for a moment. After that initial glow fades and I'm left with my thoughts, I become grounded in the reality that if I were to transition, I would be leaving a part of me behind that I could never recover. And I fear the idea that If I did go through with it, that I would regret the decision because it was only the result of some sexual desire and not the way that I truly feel. 

I don't want to be anyone other than myself, and I think that by transitioning I would be betraying a part of what makes me who I am. But at the same time, I don't want to sit here and lie to myself and be content with mediocrity. I want to love and improve myself. I want to be a better person. I just have a very hard time imagining who that person is. Whether they're male or female. The future is wide open, and that is what scares me more than anything!

Going back to my experiences as a child and through puberty, I never had many female friends and did the normal stuff any boy would do. I helped my dad build muscle cars, I loved Legos®, and I was a Boy Scout. Later on though, probably around the age of 8, I started to really wonder what it was like to be a girl. Fast-forward to puberty, and while I seemed to be interested in girls, I also seemed to be sexually excited by the idea of *becoming* one. I sought out videos involving people going through an MtF transformation (e.g. - *Dr. Jekyll &amp; Ms. Hyde* and *Zerophilia*) and eventually found porn concerning the subject. So, in addition to watching ""normal"" vanilla porn, I also used these videos as a means of satisfying my fantasy. 

In spite of the fact that I never had a relationship with anyone in middle school or high school, I always considered my attraction to such things a kink and never really brought it to anyones attention. Through it all, I felt and still mostly feel male. I did the things that a normal teenage guy would do. I checked out other women, and although I never really felt a romantic attraction, there was and still is some level of sexual attraction. But all things considered, I can't tell if that's me being envious or genuine. In addition to all of this, I've also been noticing and appreciating guys more often. This is especially troubling to me as I've never really experienced these feelings before. And while the idea of male-on-male sex is a bit unappealing to me, the idea of me being a female and having sex with a male is much more plausible in my mind; almost as plausible as me having sex with a female. I'm not expecting any kind of clear-cut answer. Finding out and coming to terms with being trans is a process, but I just don't think that I fall within the cliche of a woman trapped in a man's body. And while I might experience some level of dysphoria when I'm depressed, I don't necessarily hate my male anatomy. Bottom line, I know that this is something that I have to discover for myself, I'm just looking for some support going forward..."
deveaux1,asktransgender,Trying to figure out first steps,"Hello!  I'm looking into transitioning (mtf), and am currently trying to work out exactly what I need to do to get stuff moving.  I've currently got insurance through work (Blue Shield of California), and while they are supposed to have coverage for this sort of thing, it's unclear how I go about actually getting treatment.  I'd like to get on HRT asap, but also want to try to go about this the right way.

I figure the questions I have are pretty common, but the only answers I've found so far run along the lines of ""it depends!""  What I'd really like to hear is how other people have gone about it, so that I have some idea of what my approach might be.

So, without further ado:

* 1) What were your first steps towards getting medical assistance, and where did you go from there?
* 2) How did you find a therapist?  Were they covered by your insurance or did you pay out of pocket?
* 3) How did you get started on HRT?  What sorts of tests did you do beforehand?  How involved is your GP?
* 4) What sort of hoops did you have to jump through to get insurance to cover things?
* 5) What didn't you know in the beginning that you wish you had known?  What would you have done differently?
* 6) If insurance was involved in any of this, who was covering you (or refusing to) and what plan did you have?

In addition to helping me answer the questions I have, I'm hoping that this thread could be a helpful resource for other people who are working through the same thing.  Thanks so much for all your help!  :)"
Anubis_13,asktransgender,Southern Utah HRT Doctors - MTF?,"Hey there! 
So I came out to family a few months back. I'm 21. At one point in life, I self medicated but the cost and the feeling that it wasn't safe caused me to give that up pretty quickly. Anywho, I now want to start doing things the right way and  I'm wondering if anyone can help me out? I live in Utah and I know Rixt Luikenaar at ReBirth in Salt Lake is good about informed consent stuff but I live in the south, in Cedar City, for 8 months out of the year. I can't really get up to ReBirth to see her. Does anyone know of any doctors in Southern Utah that will do HRT?

I found this post https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/39heey/important_news_for_trans_people_in/ but it's too old to comment on and the author hasn't responded to PMs. I think the doctor they mention still works at the clinic though, so the other question I have is this: how would you go about scheduling an appointment? Just schedule a physical and then talk to her when I get in there?

Any advice is welcome and appreciated. Thanks everyone!

EDIT: Great news! I got the courage to call them and I have now indeed set up an appointment with Karen. So nervous and so happy at the same time."
Dustman28,asktransgender,How to stay strong?,"First off, thank you all you wonderful ladies and gentlemen for keeping me alive after the fallout of a bad coming out to my wife. I owe many of you for the strength to keep going. For those who missed out, I (28, AMAB) came out to my straight wife(26, cis-female) and the first several reactions we very bad.

Well after many conversations, counseling sessions, nights crying and awkward silences. We have made a lot of progress and are living in an almost twilight zone version of our normal life. We still love each other, have great chemistry, strong loyalty and have had very few fights (barring the elephant in the room.) She's finally solemnly accepting that being transgender is not a choice, phase or fad. Also, that taking testosterone to make me more manly may (will) make things worse.

We're avoiding details of divorce right now, but she's made it clear she can't be with a woman. I have accepted that long ago, but in my heart I have a hard time letting go. My dysphoria has damaged me and our marriage enough for me to come out and realize that my need to transition will never go away. However, I feel conflicted over leaving all the life we have built together. We had an almost perfect life with a bright future, but I just don't feel I can be the man who lives it. 

I know that future is built to fail, and that my dysphoria will surge back just when it will hurt the most. But part of me still wants to stay a man and just deal with it so we could make it. I have never had anyone I have ever cared so much for and who has loved me back. I know breaking up is the honest answer, but the conflicting pain seems unbearable. This is made worse as my dysphoria has started recessing as of late and the false sense that I can push through and be OK as a man has returned. I'm not a bad looking guy, but my need to change is still there.

How do I stay strong and end a relationship I don't feel I can live without? How do I keep on my path to become a woman as I burn the strongest ties in my life? How can I keep myself from caving in and giving her false hope that we can somehow make it. I feel like I'm hurting her just to keep myself from hurting her more.

tl: dr; How do I stay strong enough to end a strong loving marriage built on denial?"

bolomi,asktransgender,Is there a time limit on how long hormones will change your body for?,"Although my doctor has been nothing but phenomenal and supportive about my transition, she is quite new to the trans topic and we're both sort've wondering this question.

I'm 24, transwoman, currently on 400mg of spironolactone and 2mg of estrace. My doctor asked me if i wanted to raise my estrace to 3mg for the next few months and I declined because i'm borderline high blood pressure and we both decided it'd be a safer choice to stick to a lower dosage for the time being.

However, i'm worried that if i don't raise my hormone levels to a higher dosage now, that 5-10 years down the road, i'll see less results than what i would've if i decided to do 3-4mg of estrace. Is there a time limit on how long my body will change for, sort've like puberty? Or would i eventually reach the same results just over a longer period of time if i just stuck to 2mg? I've already seen lots of changes to my body in the past year but I'm scared that if i don't raise my levels now, i'm going to miss out on more changes that could've happened.

Should i be going to an endocrinologist to discuss this topic better with? My doctor is saying she believes there isn't really a time limit on how long bodies will change however the older i am, the less results it'll have. So maybe it's best if i just boosted it to 3-4mg while i'm still relatively young?

Also note, i was on estradiol for about 2 months previously and stopped for almost 6 months before starting again and have been on for over 6 months now. i don't know if that'll affect anything."
mprasolov,asktransgender,Can you smoke nicotine 'socially' on HRT without drastic consequences?,"Hello all,

I'm planning on beginning HRT (MtF) in the coming weeks after my semester starts up. I don't really smoke cigarettes, but I do smoke a fair bit of marijuana. From what I've heard smoking marijuana doesn't have any drastic effects or risks with MtF HRT (note: for FtM THC reduces T production but not absorbtion)

However I do occasionally like to smoke a spliff (marijuana with a little tobacco) or a blunt (marijuana wrapped in a tobacco leaf). Obviously HRT comes first in my priorities and I don't need nicotine thankfully so I can kick it if needed. But I would miss smoking a nice backwood with my friends!

If I smoke nicotine very carefully would the risk be low enough? I would appreciate any experiences, and I want to encourage anyone who is recieving hormone treatment (not just MtF) to share their experiences.

Thanks!

WubbalubaTurtle,asktransgender,A walking talking contradiction,"I've started recently posting on AskTransgender after a month or so of looking by and I am thankful for all the responses that I get, but absolutely nothing, on the posts I have done or the posts I have seen are a solid ""Eureka! I guess I am trans"" it's always been ""That could probably mean am I trans... But it doesn't 100% relate to me so I don't think it's valid""

For the entire time that I've been questioning, it's been up and down and that's the problem, right now I am probably at a very low point, if I were asked ""Do you want to be a girl?"" I'd say 'I dunno' and if I was asked ""So you wanna stay a guy?"" I'd always say 'I dunno' but this will probably change from day to day to day, some days I am happily wondering what I'd look as a girl and some days I am wondering what the hell is driving me to question myself as trans. I've only been questioning for two months

The most prevalent sources of doubt is that I am quite far from most narratives and how only at 16 I started even thinking about it, besides the one week of questioning that got cut down by real life stuff happening when I was 15. I know how people say if you are even questioning it, it's a very high chance of it being true but I just feel I am trying to convince myself YET at the same time if I wasn't trans, I wouldn't get to be a girl and that would disappoint me, I am a walking talking contradiction.

I am just concerned about inaction and things like that, I do NOT want to try and ignore anything and try to forget about this to settle down with a wife, then have a family and then have my transgender thoughts come up to my door and be like ""Oh, I see you have quite a lovely family here mind if I TEAR YOUR MIND ASUNDER?""

Even this post I am making won't represent my feelings a week from now as I am like a pinball on the spectrum of gender identity as well, I have had what I would describe as dysphoria but am I thinking I can also at times have more euphoria at the thought of being female and I feel like the reason I MIGHT not be feeling dysphoria all the time is after being a male for sixteen years I accept that I have a male body, but if I did start transitioning, I imagine it would ALL kick in at the same time. And for awhile, even before questioning, I imagined myself in the female form for sexual things but now to think of such things makes me feel guilty as I couldn't say I am sure of anything, dammit testosterone.

I want to see a therapist yet I don't and there is two reasons for that, one I am 16 and I would have to come out to at least on of my three female parents (mother, aunt, grandmother) and it would be quite quite embarasssing if this was all just a phase or something and I had to deal with that the rest of my life.... And the second reason I don't want to see a therapist is that I have only been questioning for TWO MONTHS, that's not a lot to go on and I don't think I'd have a slice of credibility to anything I would say and this isn't that that bad as I know there are very open therapists out there, bad thing is that they are seemingly very rare.

Last thing, my childhood didn't really have any evidence besides that I played with girls toys, tried on a few dresses and then got hooked on my computer which I honestly have to admit as a means to combat negative thoughts by going on my computer from dawn to dusk so maybe any trans thoughts just got sucked up into that.

Did anyone else go back and forth in questioning from one extreme to the other even day by day?

PrincessHina,asktransgender,I need help with MtF HRT from someone who has done this in (Montreal) Quebec.,"So I haven't started HRT yet, but from what I've read, the process of actually getting HRT here is something like:

Get a letter from a psychologist, get a doctor's appointment so that they could make me an appointment with an endocrinologist with a 3~ month waiting time. I have to, at the same time, make an appointment for a blood test to send the results to the endocrinologist, visit them then get a prescription.

foxy1604,asktransgender,How long did it take to get HRT??,"Hi everyone!! 
First off, happy new year!!

*This is a pretty sad topic for me so if you don't want your festive mood ruined, just ignore me*

This being the start of a new year made me think about all the things that happened last year and made me really kinda sad..

It has been more than a year that I had my coming out and I feel stronger on my feet than ever bit at the same time it feels like the appointments with my psychologist aren't getting me anywhere. 
I am even starting to doubt if she even believes me and the things that I'm saying and I come for the attention and sensation and this makes me really sad and insecure. 
I mean, even when I go for a new appointment people behind the desk are saying things like ""oh wow, you already had a TON of appointments"" 

It's probably a bad idea to have hopes for getting HRT anywhere between a year of coming out and I shouldn't have hoped for such thing but still.. When I came out I hoped, I really really hoped that maybe so very very maybe could be the case.

I am getting a bit to sad to write anything further so, just for perspective.

CuriousAnConfusedSam,asktransgender,Need some guidance on where to even start to begin.,"Hey r/asktransgender!

About a week ago, I decided to research into what being transgender meant. I had minimal exposure and was, honest to god, not tolerant to the trans community.

My father raised me in such a way that required me to understand, be empathetic towards, and respect all walks of life. Any of those walks I was not understanding or respectful of, I was taught to seek out the information and come to an understanding. I'm so happy he hammered that mentality into my head. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here on this sub.

So, after a few days of research (and now with even more reflection), I realized that over the course of my life, I'd experienced a lot of big signs of being a trans person.

It started back when I would sneak my moms clothes into my bathroom to try them on when I was in early elementary. If I ever get the choice in a game, I've almost always chosen a female avatar. I've never really felt comfortable in my own body. It's hard to explain exactly, but I've never really felt comfortable in my own skin. I tolerate my body, and that's really it. In more recent years, I've had urges I find difficult to really explain that I can really only describe as the feeling of wanting to be pretty or even just straight out cute. Additionally, during the past year, I've asked myself the question of ""If I had a button that would instantly switch my sex, would I do it?"". Until I researched like I have in the past week, the answer was always ""Yes, but I just need to accept me as I am now because I believe I'd lose my friends and family"". Now that I have really read into and watched a decent of videos on trans people and psychology, I would 100% say yes. A family worth sticking with would accept my choice and love me for me.

Sorry, I ranted a bit.

Well, after researching and realizing some of these things, I made a post 6 days ago asking some questions about the possibility of me being trans. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5ko8wr/sorta_new_to_the_trans_side_of_the_world_where_do/

Long post short: I essentially asked two questions:

1. Could my lack of relationship and/or sexual experience lead to me feeling like I want to be a woman, but it's really just that I'm lonely?

2. Could I actually be feeling dysphoria?

After reading the responses, researching some more, and reading posts on this sub daily, I set out on a bit of a self reflection trip. 

For the past 6 days, I've thought and thought and thought about being trans.

Day 1 was the ""This is silly and I've survived this long."" Day. It was the day where I told myself that I couldn't be a woman and that I had managed to survive this long. The transition would be expensive and time consuming, so I, by the end of the day, told myself that my decision was to keep living the way I had. 

I never lost my want to be a woman at any point that day. I just told myself that it wasn't a possible situation.

Day 2 was the day I woke up and still wanted to research and immerse myself in the trans community. This day was sorta crucial to me. Up to this point in my life, most major changes I've set out for myself to accomplish have been lost within a day or two. The fact that I woke up and it wasn't just a daily phase or something told me straight up that I was genuinely considering the change.

Day 3 was the day I got out of my morning shower and saw my reflection in a foggy mirror and told myself ""I'm going to do this"". I shaved my chest for the first time. I know it doesn't seem like a lot, but I've always been given the impression that chest hair was sort of like a rite of passage for young budding men. Cutting it almost felt liberating. I had a brief moment of happiness before realizing I was getting close to being late for work. One of the coolest feelings was being able to touch my own chest and feel smooth skin. 

Day 4 was the day I talked to my Dad about how he felt about trans people. To give a little pre-explaination, almost no topic is too dark or taboo to make a joke about in my house. We joke about the Nazis, Trump, Hillary, anything topical you can think of. Due to this, I was never really sure how he actually felt about people that are trans, as we occasionally made passing jests about more extremist feminist views and then aggressive/intolerant trans folks. People that honestly believe cis people are inferior simply because they're cis. Either way, I was never given a good idea on how my dad felt. The answer I was given was that no matter what, you should always show respect and empathy for a person. He then added that as far as the bible was concerned, simply put, a sin is a sin. Theft is just as much of a sin as assault. It's better to live our lives justly and accept that sin is a part of life. (As a quick note, he's not really saying that being trans is sinful, but that the sin is something nobody can avoid). So, as far as he was concerned, trans people deserve the empathy of the cis community, and that religion wasn't really ever a good excuse to hate on the trans community.

I finally asked how he would hypothetically feel if either myself or one of my two brothers came out as trans. He essentially say that it's a big choice that shouldn't be made lightly. Simply meaning that making the choice is something that we should reflect on heavily and be sure before we finalize.

Day 5 my family and I visited a friend's house for new years, so no real big things happened on the 5th or 6th days aside from just a bit more resesrch.

I've learned a lot in the past several days. A lot about the community and of myself.

As a result of all of this research and reflection, I've come to the conclusion that I want to transition

My main concern is where do I begin? 
How do I start the change? 
What should I look out for?
How do I progress without the money to pay for psychologists? In my current situation, I have no medical insurance, and it will be a while before I can afford to see a doctor about my feelings.
Lastly, when is a good point to come out to your family?

Thanks for y'alls time!

Pretty important edit:

Also, what does the entire process look like? Like, what will the transition entail? Like, how do the time lines work out?

Stuff like what will I need to do before being able to start hormones, and all that."
androgynousboyo,asktransgender,looking to become slightly more feminine (but not too much!),"Hi there! I'm a guy who's looking to become slightly more feminine, and I was wondering if you guys have any tips or thoughts that could help me. Basically, I like being a man, I like my penis, and I'd like to continue to have them fully functioning (including being able to sire kids). So, essentially, I'm pretty sure I'm not trans (or at least, I might be bigender or androgynous or something, I dunno) However, I'd also like to make my body a bit more feminine (larger hips, mainly). Basically I want to become just a tad more fem, which is why I'm not interested in doing HRT or anything. Is this at all possible?

Also, would pueraria mirifica help for this purpose? I've been reading some of what you guys have to say about it, mainly that it's much less effective than estrogen treatments, but that kind of sounds like what I'm looking for. 

Thanks in advance!

Edit: TBH, I'm also wondering what the hell I am :P Pretty sure I'm not trans... but I'm not sure if I'm totally cis either! Either way, I'm really curious and excited to find out!

Second edit: Let's say I were to get some minor HRT. First of all, how much is ""minor"" HRT anyway? Like, enough to change my body a bit, but not too drastically, is what I'm aiming for. If I didn't take anti-testosterone meds (no idea what they'd be called :P) and only made an increase to my estrogen, how likely would sterility be? And secondly, should I just start going to a sperm bank or something then?"

throwaway26122016,asktransgender,"Fuck, I'm not trans. I'm lying to myself.","Fucking hell. 


It's 5am. I've literally spent every minute since around 7pm going on reddit and reading various trans things online. 



What the fuck am I doing with myself?



I'm not really trans. I'm just some crossdresser who wants to transition as an excuse to wear women's clothes. I'm not really transgender, I'm just saying that to myself, enough that I've convinced myself that I'm transgender. 



I literally don't give a fuck about life anymore. I'm 17, I got no plan what I'm going to do when I leave college, I'm close to being expelled from it anyway. 



I was born male, I've just read so much stuff about being trans I was able to trick my mind into thinking I was trans. 



I'm just some retarded 17 year old who just can't accept that they are a cross dresser. I don't want to be a crossdresser. I only want to be a girl so I can be feminine girl and not a feminine guy. 


 A while back I wished I was more dysphoric so I could say I was transgender so I could transition without regrets. That came, now I feel like total shit about everything. Why did I have to find out about sub? I've posted so much stuff on so many throwaway accounts, sometimes I even purposely triggered the dysphoric thoughts. 




Well, fuck it. As of next week, I'm going to stop going on reddit, this sub, and just accept the fact that I'm a crossdresser and not really a transwoman, as much as I'd like to be. 




I might just force myself to go on HRT and see what happens. Maybe that will kick me in the right place. "
wonderlexey,asktransgender,Am I MtF or a non-binary transgender? What can I do?,"I began questioning my identity about 6 months ago. Back then I thought ""Oh God, please let it all be just a phase!!!"" being shocked and super anxious about the fact that I might be trans. Now it got a bit better...

The problem is I don't know if I am trans at all. I don't feel dysphoric all the time. I would definitely prefer to have smaller feet and hands, higher and more feminine voice, smaller height and most importantly feminine face. However, I like my flat chest and sometimes I like my muscles... Sometimes I wish my shoulders were more narrow though.

I tried to create a female character in Black Desert Online and play it in order to understand whether having a perfect ""doll-like"" female body would feel natural to me but I just ended up making a male character instead. The female one was WAY too feminine with a pair of large boobs and a baby face. 

That confuses me a lot. I remember when I was about 10 years old I used to play another MMORPG and I definitely preferred female characters and it felt very appealing to me when other male players gave me gifts and stuff just because I looked like a cute girl. I didn't realize I might have been transgender at that age. I also texted people in a text chat pretending to be female and it just felt nice. Moreover, in my early childhood I created a fictional character who only appears insie my head. It's a girl, although she likes looking androgynous. I feel like my inner self is very connected to her. Maybe she is my alter ego.

Could it be that I am not a trans girl but genderqueer? If so, what can I do to eliminate my dysphoria? What I want is a more feminine face and body, but not too much... Maybe having a pair of small nice boobs wouldn't be too bad for me, but flat chest is just better...

I feel like the best case scenario for me would be to be born a girl with androgynous features and small breasts. I would love to look somewhat like this: http://imgur.com/GKiEb57
Sometimes I wish I looked like Lisa Hannigan or this girl: http://imgur.com/qFWb1yN

I was always attracted to boys which made me think I was a gay male. Now I have serious doubts. However, sometimes in the past I wish I looked like Colin Morgan from Merlin tv-series. 

One part of me wants to start HRT as soon as things clear up more or less. I am 16 and I don't want to masculinize to the point where I will be looking like a huge guy wearing makeup and female clothes. I definitely don't want to grow beard and get more body hair.

But HRT is extremely serious stuff. What if I will regret doing this in the future? What if I will be willing to have children but won't be able to? These thoughts scare me a lot. 

Do you think I sound like a MtF or a bigender or something? If latter, what can I do to stop this nasty masculinization thing going on with my body or accept it and live a happy life? Should I start HRT or is it too risky?"

ArestoAphrodite,asktransgender,First steps?,"Hi everyone,

Having figured some things out about myself a month ago (am I cis?  99% chance of no), and sent off an email to a local LGBTQ-type organization asking about the quickest way to access HRT where I live (Belgium), I'm wondering what to do next. I'm still contemplating various methods of coming out, and would prefer to have seen a therapist of some variety before doing so. (On the off chance I have an exotic presentation of a mental illness I haven't heard of.)

So my question is this- what were everyone's first steps, beyond seeking access to hormones and coming out?

I'm in my mid-20ies and had the misfortune of being born with a male body, so hair removal and voice training seem to be the things I can work on immediately. My general plan is to present as femme as I can pull off outside a proffesional setting (not all that much, currently), with the aim of going full-time once I'm as close to passing as I'm likely to get. Mix that with starting a first-time job search and you've got a nice package of big life changes.

So if yall are willing to share your baby-trans stories, or throw some advice my way, I'd love to hear them. What should I be asking about?

Thanks!"
mydaddystrans,asktransgender,UPDATE: Is it selfish to ask my dad to present as male,"Hopefully this works as a link to the original thread.....
https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5mbm3u/is_it_selfish_of_me_to_ask_my_dad_to_present_as/

OKAY SO:
I felt I should update and clarify a few things:
1) My dad is the one who ASKED ME  about who she should be when me and my kids are there. She's the one who brought it up.
2) I teach my kids that everybody is the same, there's no problem there.
3) it's my husband's problem mostly, but I still have to respect his wishes because it's OUR kids, not just mine.

So, yesterday afternoon, I called my dad. And I told her that I know me asking her to present as male is super selfish (pointed out by all of you, thanks), and that I'm really sorry. She stated over and over again that she is happy to do it, it doesn't bother her, I'm making a bigger deal out of it than I should. She knows that it's not me that's making a big deal about it, but my husband. But she's not angry, or worried, because my husband will have to come around to her at some point. She respects him, and it's not a huge deal to her if he's not ready.



SO, that conversation with my dad was that. I decided to further this conversation with my husband... (after a few Vodka/Club sodas)
And I asked him, point blank about the kids and my dad and her being her. And his response?
""Whatever, as long as it's not in front of me.""
So, basically, now he has no issue with our kids meeting her, as long as he's not there himself. 
So I just got off the phone with my dad this morning and we chatted for over an hour and I told her that she can be her and nobody has to hide anything. And she wasn't expecting it, but was super grateful and happy also.

Our road trip got postponed until next week, so I'll let you all know how it goes next weekend.

Thanks!

My main reason is I hate my gender role (and no matter how many times people tell me, 'you can still be treated like a princess even as a boy' it still isn't the same compared to if I actually look like a girl.

waytoomanytroubles,asktransgender,Please someone teach me how to DIY stealthily.,"I'm being driven mad. I need to figure out how to DIY without my dad finding out. I need *something.

Even when I do get work done, I am really distracted and more focused on relieving myself through music or videos just to deal with the stress.
Please help. I've stayed awake several nights just because of dysphoria. Even though there's still that small bit of uncertainty about being transgender (like everyone, right) I have to try HRT so I won't regret it later on. I'm in a rush, yes, and I know that I will always have a chance of passing (thank you all for that encouragement btw, seriously), but I need this to help my mental state. I dwell on this subject all the time and I feel like taking that first pill will make me feel much better.

How can a human that were born as a girl know how it feels to be a man?

I mean. Im a guy and i feel like i guy, not because of my personality but because of the ding dong i have down there, and ofc the hormones that my balls are producing.

But how can my sister for example know how I as a guy feel?

Is there a definiton of the mental state of beeing a man/woman?

If i feel like a cat, How can i know what cats are feeling?

That's my question. How trans people know how the ""feeling"" they have of a different gender. "
--harley--quinn--,asktransgender,I'm sick of this emotional roller coaster.,"Like seriously.

Basically spent the rest of the night thinking about makeup. Saturday I felt like absolute shit and spent the night crying myself to sleep. Sunday I felt mostly ok, bordering on happy, was able to enjoy some football and also went back to thinking about makeup. Today, Monday, I'm feeling pretty meh.

Well reddit, after 3 days of trying to get in the same room with her, I chickened out and did something high risk/high reward that could have cost me my job. I did my and her part of the assignment and passed it off to the rest of the team as if we were emailing each other and she was super involved. I kept her in the loop of what I was doing (here's the latest draft on the  (this) report and the (that) report we're presenting. Just emailing it to you so you have a copy. Giving it to the team today and just letting you know ) and just stamped her name on it and lied about what parts were ""hers"". I even lied to my boss, saying we were emailing after hours to work. The team did great. Boss and higher ups very pleased. All of us got praise. No one the wiser.

She emailed me today asking if I wanted some coffee. We grabbed some at lunch and she thanked me for what I did (the project) and said she was just having a really hard time functioning around everyone and didn't want to deal with it. This had been affecting all aspects of her work and if she didn't come through on this project she was going to be fired. I'm just happy I did her a solid during a crappy time.

She's been job hunting in a city closer to her family and is going to move  as soon as she can find a new position, but that's hush hush.  She doesn't blame me at all and she's ' happy to know that the world actually has some people who aren't total shit'. 

I think this was a good outcome. I hate that she feels like she's being forced out, but staying somewhere that makes you feel horrible isn't OK either. I did say that if she needed anything she could always email me.

Sorryanotherrantacc,asktransgender,Did any of you folks hang out in/with toxic sites/friends/communities when you were still Eggs/questioning?,"I know I did, and it ended up being very draining. I was very lonely, VERY young  and scared during my questioning egg days (still am) thus I was very prone to forgiving assholes because ""They're my friends, they care about me, they're just a bit mean."" 

The community was full of gaslighting and blaming each other for things we couldn't even conceive of controlling instead of trying to break the root of the problem. Not one day went by without someone starting some inconceivably stupid and toxic rhetoric that everyone swallowed up. It just made my rapidly growing dysphoria even worse because I  already live in a horrible household where i'm already the family scapegoat and was blamed for big power structures I didn't even know existed until then. it wasn't even a community anymore, it was just a cesspool that people stayed in (because where else would accept us)?

Months later after separating, I found this place. It was a breath of fresh air. You all are so nice and considerate I couldn't even conceive that such a non chaotic community could exist! I was even quite shy to say hi till now! So, thanks so being so kind. I've been deprived of such kindness for bit now :). 

With this information, i'm sure it doesn't take much imagination to figure out what website I used (Hint: It's Blue.).

Anyway, the fact that I had to report to mental health at all to get this process started was already offensive.  I'm not 'mentally ill'.  I am transgender.  I made it a point to repeatedly let everyone in this process know of how offensive it would be to force gay and lesbian people to report to mental health.  These might be the initial procedures for gender transition, but I hope they can change in coming years.  
  
It was stressful beyond belief facing panels of doctors and commanders and convincing them all of my identity.  The fact that people actually have a say in what gender I get to be (depending on how sincere they think I am, and how they feel about all this) is horrifically disgusting.  
  
I can understand that the military might not want us transitioning during a time of total crisis, but the obstacles that need to be jumped through in this process are entirely too much and they are definitely too abrasive.  Coming out and seeking transition is a massive emotional trauma, and the military (as a whole) just didn't really seem to give a shit.  My counselor did at mental health (so in many ways I'm glad I had her) but the process seems almost designed to discourage and thwart as many would-be transitioners as possible.

Couldn't go to scuooo and now I have no emotion to it. I first had the thought after being showed a video of a transgirl by my boyfriend. I had just started Zoloft a week before and then that thought went away about a week after getting it. I just started Prozac about 5 weeks ago and I upped my dose 1 week ago. And started having the thoughts again Bc someone at my school was talking about transgender and I got anxiety and so here I am again obsessing. I haven't taken the Prozac in like 5 days. So my question is. Ssris can't make me want to be trans can they? Bc I know I need them to help w the OCD if that's what I even have but I am scared they will make me want to be trans permanently or have already. I know this is probably illogical but pls help. I've never experienced anything like this before. I was so excited to be a mom and I am still but now it gives me anxiety even calling myself mom and I feel soooo not myself.

I'll still be a guy underneath. I'll still be transgender. I won't be cisgender. I won't ever experience female childhood, I will still be brought up as a guy, and that will never change no matter what, and it's like why bother trying if that will never fix. 



Being seen as a girl won't make a difference. I don't care how people see me, I care how I see myself and the fact is that I'll always be a transwoman not a ciswoman, and for that reason I just don't see why I'm considering transitioning if that's the case. It makes me wonder why I'm bothering to live anymore. 




On the outside I seem like any other cis guy, no one knows that I'm a completely different person in the inside. 



The NHS in the UK is terrible, I'm 17 but will be 19 until I'll be able to get any treatment or even considered for treatment but if this dysphoria continues to get worse as it has done for the last 4 months I don't think I'll be alive by then anyway. "
maccas196,asktransgender,MtF covering legs in Australian heat,"It was 37 degrees celcius today (that is, 98.6 fahrenheit), and this isn't even as bad as other days where it's been hotter and more humid. But 37 degrees is still 37 degrees. I had laser hair removal done on my face yesterday, and was wearing jeans to cover my shaved legs today (still present male), and had to walk around in 37 degree heat, under the sun, for over an hour. Then I had to drive in my 24 year old fucking piece of shit car that doesn't have air conditioning, and sweat like a fucking water-monster and constantly burn my hands trying to keep hold of the wheel.

I can't really complain (there were construction workers that looked like they were dying from the heat lol), but I'm at the start of my transition, unfortunately right in the middle of Aussie summer. I work semi-outdoors and without air conditioning of any kind, with manly guys around my age (21) and constantly get asked why the hell I'm wearing jeans all the time. I don't want to be wearing jeans, it's literally self-inflicted heat torture. But at the same time, I don't want everyone knowing I shave my legs, because that along with other hints, would make it extremely obvious that I'm transitioning (and I'm 6-9 months away from passing). I just want to live in relative comfort and peace without anyone suspecting anything until I can come out looking how I want to look.

If I lived in a country with a cool climate, I'd be SO happy and have no problems. Are there any other MtF's from somewhere way too damn hot like Australia, who tried covering their shaved legs early in transition? How did you survive? Do I just have to suck it up and reveal my shaved legs in order to sweat like 25% less than I already would in 37 degree heat?"

ts_curious,asktransgender,"Anyone here who thought that you would be ok not transitioning once you found out that you were transgender, but then experienced that the dysphoria got worse, leading you to transition in the end?","So, just basically wondering if there are anyone (I guess there might be a few) who thought that after you found out that you were trans that the dysphoria was manageable and that you could keep living as a your assigned gender, but that later the dysphoria got worse, and you realized that you had to transition anyway… if that makes sense…

I am currently coming to the terms of being trans, and though I am not fully comfortable admitting it, I am more and more leaning towards identifying as the opposite gender, in order words as a woman. Been struggling with crossdressing, and envious thoughts of women since I was 5/6, but always put it down to being a crossdresser, because I was interested in women, and never sort of realized that there are lesbian transwomen as well…. duh. Of course there is a lot of internalized transphobia mingled in here as well.

Anyway, I am slowly coming to terms with it, and have told my wife that I am on the transgender spectrum, though not fully ready to admit that I identify as a woman. She is asking if I am able to continue living as now, and not transitioning, and I kind of think I am, but then again I don't know what might happen. Pandora's box has been opened, and though my dysphoria is not bad now as it comes in waves (like many others have experienced) I have noticed an increase, but I also don't want to loose my wife. 

I do feel though that the fair thing to her would be to split up, because even if I would choose not to transition, the dysphoria is still there…. and she will always wonder.

Anyone else who experienced something similar? "

She will be the second person I came out to; as I am making the foundational steps to eventually come out to my mother and siblings. I typed a letter to her and I wanted some opinions on it. Do you think this is okay for a 'coming out' letter? I am literally shaking with fear at the idea of rejection but I know I need to do this and get this over with. I am so ready to live my truth and finally be happy. 

""There's something I need to tell you, something I have been keeping from you, from my family and from all of my friends (well, except one).

 What I want to tell you is that I am transgender and I am transitioning to become a woman.  I know you're probably thinking 'what does this have to do with me?' Nothing! I can reassure you that, but as someone who has made a great impact on me growing up as an adult and being the person that I am today. I thought I should take the moment and tell you.

JJ, whether you realize this or not, you have made such a huge impact on my life as one of my dearest and most treasured friends, You have taught me to always be humble, to never give up and to always be a good human being, and maybe I'm just over-analyzing my 'coming out' and making it into a big deal but the thought of losing you as friend and everyone else scares the shit out me.

PrincessLobster,asktransgender,How has transitioning changed your addictions/vices?,"I've been noticing something pretty cool lately, and that's that since I started my transition, I feel less and less of a need to rely on the vices I had before.

As of today, though, I've had about 8 drinks in the last 3 weeks, and I've cut the green habit to about half of what it was before. Also, when I ran out of green yesterday, it was the first time in years that I didn't have that ""omg what am I gonna do"" freakout, even though it's going to be a full week or more before I can get more. I still like doing it of course, but now it's more of a fun thing to do and not a crutch for all sorts of anxiety and depression.

I've expressed to the therapist repeatedly my fears over giving into my suicidal thoughts and the stress and anxiety created from my depression and being trans which has manifested into self-harm, he hasn't helped with that. He either brushes it off changing the subject or asks a bit and then says ""we'll try not to do that next time.""

I've asked my parents for a new therapist specifically referencing the above but they don't want too. Pile onto all of that my parents don't think I'm trying, and don't think I'm trans.

The clinic she works in does not have a website, so I probably will have to make a phone call. What I don't know is what I would have to say. Do I need to ask to make an appointment with a specific doctor? Or do I say something else? I just want to avoid sounding like I'm 24 years old and have never scheduled a doctor's appointment in my life.

Two other quick questions as well:

* How much could I expect to pay to get approval for MtF HRT with no insurance? (Edit: Worst case scenario for cost)
* Can I get the informed consent stuff done in one visit? (knowing that I will still need to go elsewhere for bloodwork, etc)

Teejsaurus,asktransgender,Anybody lose a friend due to cultural differences because you're trans? (probs a wall of text/kinda just need to vent),"I'm very grateful that I have been very lucky in that my friends and family are all supportive and accepting of me being trans and transitioning. Even my one cousin who voted for trump is somehow supportive of me being a trans guy and also of me being gay.

However, I think I've lost one friend because I'm trans. I have talked to some other people about it online several months ago, and the consensus was that she stopped talking to me and our other friends because I'm trans. I don't know how true that is, as she's not talking to us and if I ask her she just wouldn't reply. 

Myself and my friends live in the US. We met this friend during high school (let's call her Jun...edit: even tho I use this fake name like only once in this lol but whatever). She is from South Korea, and came to our high school and lived with her brother while he was in college there. Both Jun and I went to art schools for college (but to different schools), and both of us struggled with school, and also with both being quite antisocial and having friends at school but never wanting to go out with them and such. In high school we became best friends, like sisters, and continued this friendship into college, and for about two years after college. After college she moved back to Seoul to live with her family. During college and this time after college our friendship was sustained pretty much entirely through texting. I came out to my closest friends about a month before I started T, and they were all fine with it and accepting of it. However, I didn't come out to her at this time. She and I never really talked about lgbt stuff, and I didn't really know how she felt about trans people. She was mostly ok with lgb people, though she kind of thought being those things was a little bit weird, but not really that they were *bad* things. I also knew that lgbt stuff was one of those things that wasn't really talked about in South Korea as openly as it is in a lot of other places (like the US). These things made me really unsure of how she would react to me coming out to her. When I started T I knew I had to come out to her because I was sure that in several years I would probably go visit her, and I needed her to know that I would essentially be 100% a guy by that point. When I came out to her, she seemed totally cool with it, and she did something that made me laugh, and which will be something I hope I will always remember. She sent me a picture of Hagrid (from Harry Potter) and just said ""don't grow a massive beard like this""...I lolled pretty hard at that. After that we would occasionally talk about transition stuff. She didn't like my new name at all, and often asked if she could just still call my my birth name. I explained in detail why she couldn't and how being called my birth name made me feel. She then would sometimes beg me to change my name to just the masculine version of my birth name...which sounds exactly like the female version but with an extra letter at the end. So of course I would always say no to that. She said it was hard to pronounce a sound in my new name because it's not a sound used in Korean language, so I offered her up a ton of nickname variations of my name, and even gave her my middle name, a totally different name entirely, and a name I had actually been going by for 7 years (a gender neutral name, starts with the same letter as my birth name), but for some reason she never seemed satisfied with any of the choices I gave her. She never seemed mad or angry when we talked about the name thing, and she usually dropped it pretty quickly and we would move on to a different topic. She also seemed very worried about me taking T. I don't know if she was worried because it's hormones, or more simply because it's a shot/injection. There was one time where I thought I had replied to her text, but actually hadn't. A few days went by and I got a text from her just saying ""hey"", so I replied back to it and she flipped out and was basically like ""I thought you died! I thought you died from your shot!"" because I hadn't replied to her in a few days. She said if I hadn't replied to her ""hey"" just then that her and her friend were going to call my mom lol. It seemed like she had been really seriously worried about me. After that we continued our friendship and our conversations. Then one day she just stopped replying. We didn't get in an argument or fight. She didn't say anything about going on a trip, getting a new phone, or that she just didn't want to talk to me or didn't want to be friends anymore. A few months before that she had started talking about a health problem she had been having (not super serious, but still something that can put you in the hospital when it happens at the extreme), so of course I worried she was in hospital or in a coma or something. I worried maybe her building had burned down. She was also bipolar, and her depressive states were really bad when they happened, so of course I worried the worst thing, that she had killed herself. I wasn't really in contact with her parents or brothers ever, so even though I wish they'd somehow know to contact me to let me know if that happened, I was also aware that they really would have no way to know that she and I were even still friends. I kept trying to talk to my friend, but she would never reply ever. I even wrote her a letter saying how worried I was about her, and how scared I was that something really bad had happened. But I never got any response to that, or any texts from her like I had when I had written her letters in the past. She wasn't posting on any of her platforms. For months and months there was nothing new on instagram, and the app we used to text said the last time she had used the app was the day she stopped replying to me. Two of our other friends had also tried to contact her, and also got no reply from her ever. Recently she started posting on instagram again and that's the only way we even know she's still alive at least. Knowing she's ok and still posting now has made me feel mad that she stopped talking to me. Before I was just worried and scared about what could have happened to her, but now I'm just angry and upset about it. I might send her a message soon just straight up asking if she has deliberately stopped talking to us and if we did something wrong to make her do that. But I'm positive she won't reply to it. 

When I posted about this elsewhere in the past, people said she most likely dropped me because I'm trans, because lgbt stuff in South Korea is often seen as kind of ""weird"" and if you have friends who are lgbt you're basically ""weird"" by association, and some other people said that Korean girls don't really have ""guy friends"" so she may have dropped me because she ""can't have a guy friend"", which I personally find kind of absurd. I don't think she really ever had guy friends in college, but hung out with mostly other Korean girls, but I see plenty of Korean students come in as customers at my work and they will be in a group of girls and guys, and the Korean students at my college hung out in groups of girls and guys as well. Plus we are adults now (late 20s), I would assume it would be normal for a woman her age to have guy friends. But maybe I'm wrong, I've never lived in Korean culture, so I don't really know. 

I really don't think she would stop talking to me AND two other people simply because I'm trans, and especially since she seemed mostly fine with it during the first few months. 

Does it sound like she stopped talking to me because of me being trans? Do you guys think there's anything I can do to get her to at least reply or something? I really don't want to lose her as a friend, she's like a sister to me and means a lot to me, and I wish I could do *something* to salvage the friendship, but I don't think I can. "

Hello everyone! For some reason, it seemed like posting this took some courage... please don't bite me if I posted on the wrong subreddit, I was unsure of which to post on. Also forgive me if I use terms that might be triggering/offensive.

Currently, I am a 16 year old male. Life is and has been pretty normal for me. I've been doing research on transitioning, however, because someday I would like to become a female or at least feminine. I haven't come out to anyone (aside from internet friends), but I would say that my parents would support me even though they have bitter feelings about the LGBT+ community as a whole.

Like I said, I have been trying to do research, but... it's just really confusing to me. I don't know where in the world I should start. I know that I need to lose weight and then I need to come out to people nearby, but aside from that, I am absolutely lost.

So, what I am here for is hopefully advice on transitioning. Let me know if the information that I provided isn't enough.

emmaeliza04,asktransgender,low-key way to ask/find out whether potential roommate is transphobic or an ally?,"I (trans, AMAB) am closeted to basically everyone at my College rn, and can't see myself coming out before the end of this school year, so definitely not till housing is all determined for next year.

Apartment I'm considering moving into has one guy I know, who's very likely fine about anything queer-related, but there are two others who live there who I don't know at all, or even anything about. Pretty worried about the potential problems of that living situation if one or both of them turned out to be transphobic at all, particularly since I'm slowly trying to take steps to present more feminine, and by a year from now who knows where I'll be at and what I'll be looking and presenting like. I also may have to room with one of these two unknown quantities --either it'll be one of them or otherwise the guy I know.

I don't really want to go into it not knowing about their attitude towards trans people. Obviously I can't realistically expect them to be amazing allies super versed in a lot of trans and queer issues, but I am hoping to find out they are pretty chill and fine with leaving things at ""you do you."" I'm going to be meeting them at some point of course; just trying to think of anything not obvious I can ask, to supplement whatever general impression I get of their ideologies. Only thing I can think of is run through some list of random social issues if I can strike up whatever relevant conversation, and include trans bathroom rights to see what they say.

Also trying to think of anything subtle I can ask my friend who lives there now -- the three of them have been living together with two others for a year now. Don't want to out myself to this friend though either, so also tough :/

Wootle_Bootle,asktransgender,What are some thoughts or literature for insight regarding sexuality labeling?,"First, as a disclaimer, I know not everyone is into labeling things, but it helps me think about things in abstract terms, even if some ambiguity exists. I recognize that some views are thus entirely contrary to the concept. Additionally, this is primarily within the scope of binary transgender identities and needs more thought to be extrapolated outward, but I do imagine such is feasible.

I've long struggled with labeling sexuality with regards to transgender topics. Firstly in the literal meaning of the words: [prefix]sexual implies that it is indeed based on physical sex independent of gender, and I think that's important when undergoing discussion which separates the two. Second, the words are general terms: they apply even in cis folk. This is further examined with respect to people who are not sexually interested in a transgender partner. Regardless of political views, attraction tends to be compulsive, and likewise unattraction. Hence I do not think a person willing to date a cis man but not a trans man is necessarily transphobic but simply has a sex preference, which has been a primary talking point behind LGB independent of T. Further discussion on that matter, particularly of people with a sexuality who may void it for gender (e.g., a homosexual male who dates a transgender man) may relate to Kinsey spectrum variability moreso than the more absolute words.

It is because of this, I've always preferred terms such as ""androphilia,"" ""gynephilia,"" and ""ambiphilia."" However, I recognize these words get a lot of flak, if not in large part due to transphobic persons affixing the auto- prefix. Nonetheless, I think the words sans auto- are important for the reasons described above.

I suppose that, in light of these thoughts and uncertain feelings regarding them, I was curious about a discussion here. Thoughts from users, literature describing various philosophies, etc. To learn more about the topic of words as the relate to the intersection of sexuality and transgender topics would be wonderful :)"

And I guess I was wondering if I charged $20/hr for lessons, what the general interest here would be? If it's something a lot of people are interested in, I'd probably need to make me own site for scheduling and whatnot so I'm just trying to get a good sense before investing my time into something like that.

I've come out to both of my *divorced* parents (but um, shortly after I did that about half a year ago, basically said ""yeah can we wait for me to take the next step"" and they basically thought it was a phase and didn't mention it again), but that's just about it. I have an entire online account that they don't know about that I've been out as ""trans"" for roughly 3 years now, with some.. bumps.. but for the most part, I've been around supportive and great people.

Thing is, that's really bad for me. As a North Carolina resident (need I say more) my whole life, once I found out that I was trans and knew somewhat what it was, I really knew that I wanted to transition.

But I can't talk to people in person about myself.

I'm OKAY at talking about other people, and I think that I have a decent (??) level of empathy for others? Kinda a knack for putting myself into their situation. Anywayy..

I want to go to a counselor. I'm getting tired of having this body, this me, this everything.. It's hurting. My dad (a licensed counselor, ironically enough..), months ago, recommended going to a counselor specifically trained with trans people, but my mom (not the most supportive human in the world) said otherwise.

So um, should I go to a counselor to deal with these problems? I'm not really sure what I'll say because it's basically always the same stuff. Also, is there possibly a specific gender counselor I should go to, to expect better results from? And if they specify in trans-related problems? Ahh, I dunno..

I've been to counselors before, but I can't bring myself to talk about me. I just kinda.. ask them stuff, I guess.. It's really bad and I'm better at typing my problems but I'd rather not go to an online counselor :(

Also thank you to anyone who helps me out or reads this �� it means a lot to me."

TrueHOAS,asktransgender,This is the end?,"I am just completely depressed, I am in my bed and I probably won't get out of it unless I have to eat. 

Not being a real girl is just too depressing. Never being as petite and feminine as they are. I want to look a certain way but this will never be the case even though it is my only wish to be like the cis girls my age, thats probably why I am so depressed because I want to have the life and body of a cis girl but never will get anything near it. I am completely lonely because I am trans and I don't talk much so nobody will obviously ever like me. I have a crush but it's pointless, he will never like me. These feelings are just enough, my life is just shit and everything I do seems to fail. Probably killing myself later this day, I just want to think about stuff and then end it all."

Boob-a-saurus-Rex,asktransgender,PSA: Always demand to have both your Estrogen and Testosterone levels checked.,"So I (AMAB) just found out that after a year on HRT my E levels are still in near male ranges. I am so angry and feel so lied to. 

I've had two doctors so far, the first was great and I had her for 4 months, she checked both my E and T and I was happy. Back then my levels were in male ranges, but I was okay with that since I knew I was on a low dose, and I also just started. Then I had to go to a new doctor and she decided to up my doses, and since then has only checked my T levels. I kept asking her to check my E levels and she always made some excuse, about how it's not necessary or that wasn't common practice at that hospital. It seemed like a load of BS, but my upped doses were double my previous dose, and I stupidly thought that would mean my E levels would also be doubled. So I stayed quiet and complied, but recently I changed insurances and now have another new doctor, who ordered tests for both E and T. I was so happy, and so excited to finally see how close I was to being in proper ranges, and low and behold my E levels were only 15 pg/mL over the male range. I am not even close. 

I knew something wasn't right since I was barely seeing any changes, but this is ridiculous. I wasted 8 months of my life believing a doctors nonsense ideas. 

SO please people, always be aggressive when it comes to your care and don't take no's and excuses for answers. 

TL;DR: I blindly listened to a doctors excuses for not completely checking my hormone levels and screwed myself over and wasted months. So always be proactive when it comes to your trans care."
phoenixfire777,asktransgender,Feelings about being trans,"Hey all. I've been struggling for a while about being transgender. Not in the 'oh god why did i transtion' but more on the actual label. I'm 31 mtf transitioning for over a year now. I absolutely cannot speak for myself, but according to many of my friends, they'd have no idea i was trans. Now heres my rant/question. If it turns out few people can tell by how i look that i am a trans woman, i would honestly prefer for new people to not know. How many think that if someone learns about you, they won't perceive you as a man or woman? Now i know that there are those that may not care or would prefer it but I'd like to hear all thoughts on this. I myself just don't want people to find out, see me and think ""huh, that used to be a guy"". Ugh i may be wording this wrong but thus ends my rant/question :)"
_shinran,asktransgender,What are your goals?,"Hi!

I know the question seems odd, but... I really didn't know what else to ask.

I'm really wondering: when you sort of came to terms with your body and mind being the way they are, what did you figure it would take for you to be happy? Is it just altering your body, putting yourself in one that better suits you? How about with the people around you, does their acceptance mean a lot to you?

If I could rephrase it, I guess I'd ask:

For those who have experienced dysphoria and such, what do you think are the things that would need to change in your life to make you happy?

I ask because there are people in my life who are experiencing it. Not many, but I'm really kind of... new to it. I want to help them as much as I can through what I know are difficult processes, and I'd like to know about what sort of things other trans people have wanted to change about themselves and their lives to become happier with their situations.

Thank you ^^"
swRacc,asktransgender,I think i'm trans. but i'm not sure. I could be something else. could I get some input?,"I don't like to refer to myself as trans, because the word ""transitioning"" makes it sounds like I'm in the process of becoming female--like _boy_ is the start point and _girl_ is the end point.  
But I feel like whatever I am, it's not _all the way_ to _girl_.  

My end point _isn't_ to have a vagina;    
I like my penis, even though I like it to be small and cute an girly.  
I feel like ideally, I'd look female everywhere, but I'd have a penis.  

Being completely male makes me feel absolutely horrible.  
Being completely girl would be much better.  
But I feel like I belong in a feminine medium.

Katie_Deely,asktransgender,Issues with hair removal,"Hey there :D

My beard is thick, dark, grows extraordinarily fast and covers everything between the sideburns and the lower end of my beloved Adam's Apple.

On top of that I have psoriasis and neurodermatitis. That means that a little bit too much strain can cause my skin to turn into a red-yellow goo from blood and pus. Dealing with that once a month isn't a great deal, but it's unbearable if it happens almost daily.

What should I do now?

---

* Shaving isn't an option, because of various reasons. It's only on the surface, which means that the tiniest bit of re-growth is already very noticeable. By now it goes already so far, that I can't even get rid of the beard-shadow, no matter how hard I try. Not to mention that my face resembles the surface of Mars virtually 24/7
* Laser isn't an option, because it's so expensive. My insurance doesn't pay for it of course. On average, I would need between 800 and 1500€ for that. Absolutely not doable for me.
* The very same is true for electrolysis. With the exception that it takes many times more sessions and would most likely damage my skin beyond repair.
* Epilating would be affordable and actually doesn't cause my skin to react badly. I feel like the pain would be way too much to handle, especially in the face. I'm also very concerned about my skin's integrity, given how thick male beards are, how deep their roots are, and how soft the skin is.
* Hair removal creams seem to be horribly violent on a chemical and cellular scale. At least to me it looks like it's simply cauterizing everything off. No clue if I want such corrosive things on my face. Neither do I know if my skin would survive this.

It's super shitty to have started at this age, because I'm not going to know if it's a phase or not for a while, and it would be so much harder to transition while in school. Anyway, I spent a good portion of last year trying to decide if transitioning from male to female would be for me, but I've come to a sort of conclusion that I want to be somewhere in the middle, and lean on the feminine side. I'm not completely sure though, whether it's just a phase or if it's even what I want right now. I'm not really posting for advice, but more for excitement. "
castaway235492,asktransgender,"close to a year, friends and family","so I'm closing in on one year of being out as trans (mtf). At first I was really positively surprised about the openness of my friends and family when I came out to them. I was expecting a small war with family, and no understanding or acceptance from most friends. Instead I got ""okay"":s with few to no questions.  At the time I thought of this as supportive, in the light of all the horrible reactions I've read about here. But as things have been settling in for me, I realize that not caring at all is not at least supportive. My family don't care, they don't ask me how I am (and want to hear a real answer), they are still using wrong pronouns and generally just don't seem to care about me.

my friends act in pretty much the same way, but I don't think that really has anything with my transition to do, they never really seemed to care and ask about emotions - they are all male, I guess that explains it in a way... but what worries me is that I get this creeping feeling that they are slowly and gradually avoiding me more and more. It is all happening so slowly that it is hard for me to know if I'm just being paranoid, or if it is actually the case.  They have movie-nights together without inviting me, and stuff like that. I can't really talk to them about it, because I'm sure it would just be denied, they probably don't even see it themselfs.

so all in all, I thought everyone was nice and supportive, but I'm starting to realize that no one really gives a shit about me. And it fucking hurts, and I don't know what to do about it. Or perhaps I'm just being paranoid and oversensitive, how am I to know?

can anyone relate to this, and what happened with those friendships in the end?

BreezyyBreee,asktransgender,"Is it just me, or is there not a lot of realism?","Before I started my transition over a year ago, I geared myself up for it via these boards and forums, taking in all the information I could from other people to prepare myself. But when I finally started, hardly any of that was useful. It was harsh. Hard as hell (at least more so than I ever imagined). I mean, I guess I pass now, I've not been misgendered in months, but shit it's nothing like how it was explained in the numerous threads I read about it. How it's sunshine and rainbows once you're there. The anxiety I get just thinking about outings I have to make into public is unbearable, and that's just one of the many simple things that are terribly hard to mentally endure now. I'm not going to lie, I prefer this side more than the other, hence why I kept, and keep pushing, but I feel like this community paints a picture that seems a bit unrealistic, especially considering the hell that was this past year.


Maybe people just accept the 'prize' a little better? Is it my personality that keeps me from enjoying it more? Or maybe I just had it bad? I mean, I've seen posters make OPs that showcase their 'now perfect life' then a week or so later they're posting about how they're not sure if they pass or other depressing topics of the sort.


By this point I figure people just try to make the best of where they are, and relish in the little moments of happiness amidst the hell that is transitioning by sharing them with others. Is it unfair to do this though? I'm not going to lie I had a lot of angst for my old, naive self believing posts like the ones described, and I've seen so many friends fall victim to the depression one might get believing that's how things should be after [x] amount of time.


I'm not trying to be a cynic, or discourage happy posts. Without them what prospect would anyone considering a transition have? I guess I just feel a little mislead. Like I finally got to the party, but it's quiet and the music isn't my favorite. Has anyone else felt this way? Or did/do your experiences coincide more with the super happy ones that are often shared?


Again, I'm not saying I haven't had those little moments of sheer happiness or gratification myself, it just feels a little underwhelming considering all the shit that still lingers (dysphoria, depression, fear of public, etc.)


EDIT: Thank you all for the responses. I've spent the better part of my morning reading through them all and it's been really insightful to gather perspective, and also helped me look at myself and expectations from another angle. I wish you all nothing but the absolute best, it just seems like some of us have a farther way to walk to get there. "

For some reason I've been too scared of what the collective opinion will be and for that I've just decidedly stayed in boy mode.

TransgirlInLove,asktransgender,My transition is very back and forth. Any help on this?,"I pretty much did it all. I surpassed my wildest expectations last April when I went full time the first day I went out in public while presenting. I have a family who calls me by my correct name, with my correct gender. I don't know if I've ever /not/ passed - at least, i haven't been misgendered yet. And when I put on makeup and extensions, I look positively gorgeous. That's what I wanted from transition. To be stealth, beautiful, and most importantly: happy.

I went off hormones for a month because I was moving all over the place. I started hormones again a few weeks back and I'm not sure if I did the right thing going back to my full dose; there's no breast soreness or development, it almost feels as if I'm becoming more masculine. I'm not quite sure, though.

I only feel good about myself with straight hair. My natural wavy hair just doesn't look good with makeup. So there are three steps that make me look good/presentable. The first step is straight hair and no makeup, I feel alright. The second is straight hair and makeup, I feel presentable in public and generally happy. The third is straight hair, makeup and extensions. I feel dynamite and ready to take on the world.

I don't really know what's up with me. I feel like I did before transition; I don't think I look that good without maximum effort, my good looks aren't effortless, and even though just last week I looked the best I ever have, I just feel...stunted. I guess it's because it's winter, I have no place to go, so I have no excuse to get ready and therefore I don't present as much as I used to. I simply don't know. I just know that I've succeeded and now it feels as if I'm backtracking.

Any help?"
jlg_94,asktransgender,Am I Trans? How can I explore that further?,"Hello everyone, 

Recently I have really been questioning if I am transgender (male to female). Since I was a kid, I do not know the exact age but around 7, I had always cross dressed and remembered wishing I was a girl. I came from a Roman Catholic family and that was NOT the kind of thing that I could talk to my family about so I never did.  

As I went into my teen years I stopped thinking about wanting to be born a girl (except for an odd time or two) but always kept cross dressing in private.  I have always had mostly female friends and enjoyed doing feminine things but for the longest time was far to nervous to be feminine in public.  

I am now 24 years old and am in a happy long term relationship with a wonderful woman.  I recently told her about my cross dressing on its own (not that I may be trans) and have dressed up around her many evenings.  I absolutely love being able to share that with somebody and after years of not thinking about it I am starting to wonder again if I would be happier living as a woman.  

I have never gone out in public dressed up and I still have a lot of fear and anxiety about what people would think or if my conservative family would find out (I am mostly independent from them but it is still scary).  

Does anyone have advice on how I can explore this further?

Should I tell my S/O that I may be trans before I know for sure?

[deleted],asktransgender,"I've been seriously questioning my identity for about a week now and I'm a nervous wreck, and advice or help would be appreciated.","Hi, I'm currently a 23 y/o cis pansexual male, and for the past few days I've been in an almost constant state of anxiety thinking about my gender identity. I'm not sure what the most revelant details are so I'll just sort of run through of the past few years.

* Up until recently I hadn't seriously considered if I might be transgender. I don't think I feel uncomfortable or disgusted with my male body in the same way that some of my transgender/genderqueer friends have described, or wanted to change my name or be addressed with different pronouns.

* While I might have some traits that are more feminine, I'd always just chalked that up with having a predominantly female social circle for most of my life.

* This is the part though that is really getting in my head: about five or six years ago I started getting turned on by artwork of turning into other things (mostly from the furry community), however about four years ago I came across porn of a male character turning into a female character, and it's sort of just grown from their to the point where while it's not the only porn I watch, it's definitely the stuff that turns me on the most/easiest.

* I don't know if my interest in that is just a weird fetish or phase or if it is a sign that I might not be cisgendered, or if they're all related. And if it is the first one then I don't think it's something I'm comfortable with, and if all of this is just me trying to conjour up some excuse to explain it away.

* Even though I've said I'm ok with my body, I have definitely looked at women wishing I could look like them or be them, but I've also had similar thoughts when looking at guys, and I've wondered if that's just me getting those signals mixed up with just general attraction to them, or if it's both, or something else entirely.

* While I've not considered trying crossdressing, I do sometimes wish that I could ""pull off"" women's fashion, and I can't tell if my not wanting to do is just just geniune not wanting to, or if it's knowing I couldn't do it with my physique. 

* I've also found myself sometimes almost randomly sometimes wishing that I did have a female body, I don't know if that's just part of the stuff that turns me on, or if it's something else.

* I have considered if I would feel more comfortable/prefer having a woman's body, and I honestly can't say for sure either way, sometimes I think yes, sometimes no, but it's not like I can know what that's like?

* Every time I try and wrap my head around all this I just start shaking and hyperventilating, it's taken me half an hour just to calm myself down and finish writing this.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and sorry if it doesn't make much sense but my mind is a bit all over the place at the moment, and I'm sorry if some of it comes across as offensive, which I'd completely understand as sometimes it feels like I'm treating what can be a major part of someone's life as a fetish. I would love to hear some advice, or if people have been in similar positions to this. If there's any part you want me to go into more details for, I'd happily elaborate."

Horsetoothsnares,asktransgender,A confession of sorts,"I'm incredibly sorry for this ramble of sorts. I created a faux profile so this doesn't actually get linked to my normal account. It's just something I've been needing to get of my chest to an extent. It's something I want to tell someone but feel like I can't. I know this isn't confessions of sorts. I guess the question sort of boils down to does it get better?

--------------------------

So I've recently turned twenty eight. Honestly not bad on a lot of levels not great on some others. Pretty short for a guy at one sixty seven, but got the shoulders and jaw to make up for it. 

I've got the standard hobbies really. I like games, I like sci fi, I can get into hour long discussions about the most boring minutae of just about anything that piques my interests, I like women.

All in all I there's really nothing that off with me, to just about anyone out there. At least until you consider that I've imagined not being a guy since I was about six. That not a day goes by without these toughts plaguing my head. Sure I'm attracted to woman, but it's also undercut by an envy. An envy that encompasses just about everything. The way I could act if I were a woman, the way I would look, what I could wear. Hell everytime I see a pair of boots I clench my teeth.

Except for the fact that there's been a female me online for a good fifteen years, consistent and doing pretty much exactly what I do, except you know, not me, but the me I imagine myself to be.

Every day I hope there's some mistake, that somewhere deep within me lies something that's just been hiding. That I'll get an xray and a baffled doctor will come in telling me I've got ovaries and an internal structure that's just waiting to come out. That I'll be allowed to be who I am. 

I listen to a great friend of mine, a woman I hold in high regard, talk about the death of gender how anyone can be who they want to be. But I also see how she can treat the world because she was born a she. 

I have a few things hidden away, a few pieces of clothing that I only put on when I know there's no one around. But that's been ringing hollow every year more. The moment my voice deepened, my shoulders spread...it's hard to even pretend and the only that's left to a certain extent is the pain and knowledge that the figure for those things won't ever be there. 

I enjoy porn, there's no denying it, but more often than imagining having sex with the woman, I imagine being the woman and it builds into the same envy once more. In truth I often find it hard to find a woman I would expressly call ugly. Nowhere in the same way as it is simple to do so for men. 

The worst part is that for a while it all seemed to be better. The thoughts of being an actual woman seemed to go away, they weren't an everpresent shadow that hangs in the background. I didn't have to convince myself to at least take some care about the body I at times dislike. It's what I do a lot really. Convincing myself. You're never going to be a woman, so at least be presentable. At least be somethig I can sort of look up to. 

I actually admire the people that have transitioned. I can see that many of them have become happier. At the same time unless they lucked out on the gene lottery I feel like they'll never get what they want. There's going to be those signs you see, that jawline, that nose. Men who used to be women probably have it easier (heh that envy at play again), since it's easier for a female face to be seen as an efiminate male than for a male face to be seen as a masculine female. 

It's really why I don't think I can ever take the step, why I can't come out (or well that's a lie, I did confess to a close friend while incredibly drunk once). I want to go to bed one day and wake up a woman. Not a facsimile of a woman with my face. An actual woman. One who has to deal with all the bad and good it entails. I don't want to be something sitting on the fence. I want to be either an A or a B. I don't want to be en route somewhere, I want to be somewhere. 

I know that there are many transgender people that don't think that way, sadly for me it's an unsurmountable hurdle I think. 

I know that this will likely never happen, it fills my imagination it will, but I am down to earth enough to realise that that is never happening. Still somewhere in my mind I keep hoping that medical science will allow us to have a desire clone or robot body or whatever into which we will be able to transfer. 

That one day I'll ""try it out"" and tell everyone that hey it's really cool you should try it as well. Makes me comfortable. Completely denying it's been my secret desire every since I had coherent thoughts to have actual memory of my dreams. 

Really this is probably the longest coherent piece I ever put down about it, the worst thing is I feel like it's all hurting just a bit more. 

I've actually had a gynekomastitia, apparently an infection that needed to be excised. I hoped so much that when my chest would be flat as it should everything would go away. 

I'm envious about a lot of people. Particularly those that are what they want to be. Bodywise at least. That are able to be what they are. Who don't have to fake so much. Sure even the female me in my dreams has my character traits. Traits which many would deem as purely masculine. But she doesn't have to fake so much. Sure my faking is successful. I know how to be a man or at least ape at it well enough, but as I grow older I realize there's a rift in how many and I view the world. I am a fake person living in a real body which feel fake trying to act like a fake. I want to be a real person living in a real body able to act as that real person. "

Clarine87,asktransgender,Do many of us get tested for Androgen Insensitivity?,"In the recent [genetics thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5ner2w/in_what_ways_did_you_win_the_genetic_lottery/) there are many people reporting limited torso body hair compared to all male relatives.

It seems to me that mild androgen insensitivity (that's the one with normal genitals) could be responsible for a lot.

I have normal body hair in places which it is present on both males and females, but in those which are male only it is severely short in quantity compared to both maternal and paternal relatives AND my forearm/knuckle and leg hair is not the same colour as the few black torso hairs I posses.

I'm trying at the moment to get my GP to order the test, but he's more interested in XXY despite IAS actually being useful to know.

Incidentally I've always been delighted by the lack of body hair and smooth skin. I don't know if its HRT/cisfemale smooth but I really don't see how it's possible for it to be ""more"" smooth.

I can't personally speak to beard hair because pulling it out for 10 years has severely reduced it."

spinmuffins,asktransgender,Travel to Dubai,"Hi /r/asktransgender,
I may need to travel to Dubai in the next few months for work and am wondering if anyone has any personal experience either as a trans woman in Dubai or travelling there.

My passport indicated me as female, though I have not updated my name, my old one is gender neutral. I have not had srs and have been living full time for several yeats now, passing 100%. I have however not had srs.

I am concerned about UAE's laws regarding ""impersonating the opposite sex"", given news that Gigi Gorgeous was detained and refused entry last year (but that could have been because she is publically out).
If my trans status were to be discovered, I feel I could run into trouble. I understand there are risks in entering dubai as a woman by default, but am afraid I'm rolling too many dice with my trans status.

So, would you say I am relatively safe in entering the country? Do they have body scanners at the air port? Is it possible to discern one's trans status via a body scanner? What about pat downs? Should I wear a gaffe or something?

Body scanning is my biggest concern. I can look after myself once I'm in the country to remain inconspicuous.

I wouldn't travel to Dubai for a holiday, but this is work. Weighing up my options now and looking into whether it's worth disclosing this with HR and asking to work remotely.

Edit: I have flown before, dealing with security in Australia, France and China and never had an issue or asked to be scanned again. Perhaps I don't trigger the body scanners?"

asktragen,asktransgender,"I feel less dysphoric right for the past couple of days, why do I feel worse?","OK, this is incredibly weird, but my dysphoria often changes, it's never at a constant level. 




It's sometimes fine, in the middle, or really bad. 



I feel the best when it's in the middle. Generally, when it's in the middle I'll just dream about being a girl, it makes me feel happy inside. It motivates me to do something about it. 



But when its either completely fine or really bad is when I feel the worse. When it's extremely bad, I get depressed, often have suicidal thoughts. 


But when its fine (like it now) I just feel terrible. It makes me think, maybe I'm tricking myself into being trans, maybe I go on this sub too much, or maybe I've just wanted to be trans. 




I do crossdress. I love wearing women's clothes. Sometimes I feel like I'm only transitioning to wear their clothes, and I only wish I were born a girl because I would of grown up as a girl, which includes girls clothes etc. "

I'm not sure how I'd phrase this, exactly, but -is- staying on Bicalutamide going to rob me of mental changes that I would otherwise experience while on Spiro or Cypro?

Call_me_Cassius,asktransgender,Does anyone else really not like the trans flag?,"I don't like the colors, that they're so ham-fisted and stereotypical. It just feels so weird to me that as a group that challenges traditional ideas of gender, we represent ourselves with stereotypes. And of course you have white in the center, but the fact that only 20% of the flag goes to representing intersex people and non-binary identities rubs me the wrong way, like it was an afterthought. 

I also don't like that they're nursery colors. I don't find it aesthetically pleasing, and I find it somewhat infantilizing. 

And even alternative designs seem to focus on using pink and blue, still relying on stereotypes.

I love the rainbow flag. I love the symbolism of the spectrum, I love how vibrant it is. And I know that technically it represents the entire LGBT community, but the technical use of a symbol means nothing if that's not how it's recognized, and people don't took at the rainbow flag and think of trans people. Plus, being gay and trans I want represent both of those parts of my identity, but they're *separate parts* and I want to represent them separately. So I like the rainbow flag to represent my sexuality, but I want something else to represent my gender too, and I feel like I can't be alone in that. And I don't feel like they trans flag does it.

And I have sort of the same problem with the trans symbol. I appreciate the androgyne symbol but with Venus and Mars, again with the blatant traditional symbolism. Our two symbols are just things traditionally used to represent male and female put together, and it just feels boring and sort of counter to what I personally feel the transgender community represents (a challenge on traditional male and female, not a mashup or embracing of it.) 

Meanwhile the lesbian community has symbols like violets and the labrys and the black triangle. I assume the gay community has more storied symbolism as well, though I'll admit I'm not terribly familiar with it (my knowledge of lesbian symbolism mostly comes from the period where I tried to convince myself I was a lesbian.)

I just feel like our symbols, the flag especially, lack a real connection to the community. And I know there are gonna be people who disagree with me and feel like the symbols are perfect for them, but I can't be alone in feeling inadequately represented, can I? "

privateaccount95,asktransgender,[TW][MTF] I feel sick to the stomach,"Let me start by apologizing for this post, it's probably the wrong sub but I don't really know where else to post it. I'm feeling depressed, crushed, and defeated and I don't know where else to turn. 



I'm terrified of the idea of coming out at high school. I need to come out, at least for next year, as I'm starting HRT within a few months and I can't hide it for an entire year. And with that I know there will be a lot of bullying. In one class there's already a group of students who often make transphobic jokes even when they don't know someone will be offended by them, they certainly aren't the kind of people that will stop if they found out they did. A lot of people already treat me like shit now and I'm too much of a coward to stand up to them so I can't do it now. I don't even have very many friends either (like one, maybe two) so I can't always turn to them for support. 



A while ago I came out to an online friend who was also friends with my best friend. That worked out fine until a few days later when they went and said a ton of really nasty shit about it for a really long time to my best friend. I tried really hard to forget what they said because it made me really depressed for several days. One thing however that I can't stop repeating in my head again and again is chicks with dicks. I hate it so fucking much and I can't stop repeating it. 



I feel like a joke. A shitty thing to be made fun of without any real value. The worst part is I know there isn't a chance I could ever kill myself. I'm too afraid of the physical pain and too afraid of ever hurting another person. I hate how I'm too much of a coward to do anything about anything. I let people hurt me all the time and never speak up for myself and the same is true when something happens to other people I care about. I'm too much of a coward to help anyone even myself.

confusedd92,asktransgender,Does having Klinefelter necessarily make me an intersex or transgender?,"I was diagnosed with Klinefelters about half a decade ago. My thought back then was along the lines of 'oh that sucks, I have some unknown syndrome that explains why I'm always so thin'. 

Appearance-wise, I'm towards that of a male, but I have been mistaken for a girl quite many times, especially when I had medium-length hair. With just light makeup (about 5 minutes of makeup), I can pass perfectly as a girl. I have been on exactly three testosterone shots, which made my voice slightly deeper (around the low tenor range), and I have barely noticeable facial hair. My hands and feet are about women's M to L size, which are also some my insecurities as a guy. 

Social-wise, I have at least thrice the number of female friends as compared to male. But whenever they get attached, I sort of 'lose' that friend in that I would be unable to hang out with them anymore, as their boyfriend would prohibit that (common occurrence in this country), which makes me sad and lonely, considering that I moved here alone. I remember reading a quote from someone's therapist somewhere, along the lines of ""you can't decide whether to be with them or to be them"" regarding his relationship issues, and thinking that it applies a lot to me too.

So anyway, until recently when I discovered that many people deem Klinefelter as intersex or even transgender, I wasn't not too sure of myself. Until I moved out for college, I've always thought of myself as a guy. But now, with my wardrobe having more female clothes than male, and all of my roomwear are floral/polka dotted/pink designed, I'm wondering which gender am I actually leaning more towards? What do you think?"

verasgunn,asktransgender,"A huge fight in my family happened last night, everyone was worked up, and I got emotional. I told them I came out to them and they reacted in a way far better than I ever expected.","I currently live with my aunt, mother and grandmother at my aunt's house. We all pay her rent, but at times fights start about very typical things. There had been a recent fight that had left the house so tense that I had to call in sick from work on Monday to just give myself a day to collect myself after what's been a significant length of depression that has stretched all year long, for as long as that's been. I had to go to work today though and the fight was swelling louder by the moment. I went to do something outside my bedroom before going to bed and I felt the need to join, hoping to end it. 

That did not go as planned. Fight only went on longer, got a bit more heated, ended, started again, ended again, started again. Our emotional state came up a few times, notably how much I've been depressed lately and I learned into it. How there's not been a day for several weeks where I have not wanted to kill myself, which was not so much about my dysphoria, but was perhaps not helped by it. I don't remember why I felt so driven to say it, it really wasn't the time or day to say it, but it came out. 'I think I may be Transgender.' 

The fight stopped, immediately. There was a little tension, but my aunt and mother jumped straight to support. I talked with my mom for a few minutes. 

There were plenty of questions. Why haven't I told her? Because I was afraid, because my family is just about all I have and I can't afford to lose them. Why did I think she wouldn't support me? Well, I didn't know, and my only real reference of what they would was a Transgender male son-in-law my aunt used to have that didn't exactly fill me with confidence . She was wonderful, supportive, my aunt joined, and while much of my anxiety for coming out came from her, she was so warm and encouraging. 

We talked about what I wanted to do, why I hadn't done anything around home, what to do moving forward, how my mom thought I was gay and how I felt about my sexuality in general. We talked for nearly an hour, every single word only offering comfort and love, I was so overwhelmed and relieved when we had to stop ourselves because it was nearly one in the morning I was so worked up and hyped on adrenaline that it probably took me an hour to calm down to get sleep. My mom and aunt were nothing but sweet to each other after that and my aunt kept saying how this was the best fight ever and how she was so happy it happened. She even showed me what her former son-in-law looks like now after having been out for a few years(and oh my God does he look amazing). 

I wake up this morning exhausted because I got three hours of sleep, but I have not felt this good in such a long time. It felt so cathartic, and their reaction was so beautifully supportive that I'm struggling to keep myself from crying while I'm on my commute to work. My silent struggle isn't so silent anymore, I had friends to talk with about ot, but now I have my family. Maybe not everyone in it, but enough, enough that I can don't have to just pine for the freedom to pursue who I want to be. The most important people that matter in my life have accepted me and are going to help me support something that had burdened me, either consciously or unconsciously, for a long time. 

The beginning of the rest of my life starts here, and I don't think I've ever been happier.

GabiCap,asktransgender,Yet ANOTHER crossdressing vs trans question,"I've been seeing a gender therapist and making some progress.

During our last session she said the goal of that meeting was to see if it was what the DSM V classifies as a transvestism fetish or being trans.

I'm pretty sure it's not a crossdressing fetish. Like I told her, when I dress it's mostly to relax. While I used to ""get off"" every now and then while dressing, that was never the goal. It was to escape and imagine myself as a woman. Try to see the girl that could be.

But despite that, I'm comfortable with the equipment I have down there (since she asked about that).

So does it need to be either a fetish or a sign I'm trans? Could it be neither? Maybe I just hate the idea of it being a fetish so the only other option (being trans) sounds better?"
OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,(Meta) Can we have an honest discussion about suicide topics?,"I've been on here long enough to notice what kinds of topics come up very often. ""Am I trans?"" ""Crossdresser or trans?"" ""How to come out?"" all of these questions are ones we all ask at one point or another.

But in my time here i've seen alot of Suicide topics. There aren't multiple every day or anything like that. But I always see at least one every few days.

And most of these end up getting downvoted to hell and a few concerned users trying to help the user. Heck, I've commented on numerous ones trying to help.

But I've come to realize how ridiculous they are. I don't want anyone who has made one to be offended or embarrassed. I don't care if this opinion isn't popular, I think that just like the big push for transmen inclusion recently this is something that needs to be talked about.

I understand why they aren't against the rules, and I sure wouldn't want the mods to ""ban"" them. I just think we should vocally discourage them.

I get why some people make them. You're in a crisis. You need someone to talk to. I'd be hypocritical if I said I've never made topics because of a crisis. But there's a huge difference between asking for important advice/ someone to talk to and announcing ""I'm suicidal. Help me or I'll kill myself"".

Is ""Help me or I'll kill myself"" an exaggeration? Yes. But the pressure that these kinds of topics put on random strangers sure makes these topics seem that way. ""Should I ignore this post?"" ""What if I was supposed to post the words of encouragement that saved this person's life but I ignored it?"" ""What if my comment pushed OP over the edge and they killed themselves?""

Don't tell me some of you haven't had those fears when you see a suicide topic. And it's bullshit putting that pressure on random strangers on the Internet. There's a huge difference between ADVICE for things like Transition and coming out and clothing etc. and A SUICIDE PREVENTION SUPPORT GROUP. This board Is for advice. Not for talking people out of suicide.

There are hotlines to call, certain websites, and other subs to read. I feel that none of the users on here should have to deal with the pressure of preventing someone's suicide.

It's not that I want people to keep their problems in or that no one cares if they die. No one wants people to kill themselves. But there are better ways of finding help then this place. A place to ask transgender people things.

What are your opinions? If any of the mods would like to give input that'd be great too."

My insurance is Blue Cross / Blue Shield of MA, so I'd especially love to hear from someone with that insurance who's been able to get coverage. Responses from anyone would be helpful, though.

If you know the CPT codes that were used in the request, please share. Mine was coded as 31899, which seems to be correct based on the google searches I can find, but coding seems to be a tricky business.

And, really, any info about reversing denials for any sort of transgender treatment would be helpful (or at least heartening).

Edit:

Though this did not get any replies, for posterity's sake I'm updating this. I called BCBS MA customer service and explained the situation. They told me it had been rejected because 31899 is an ""Unknown procedure"" code for trachea/bronchi, meaning it does not specify a particular procedure. The first rep thought this meant it could not be covered, but I insisted that since BCBS MA's Transgender Services medical policy (#189) specifies that it covers another unknown procedure code (31599, for laryngeal procedures).

She connected me with someone better able to answer coding/clinical questions. This person was very helpful, and after I explained that this was facial feminization surgery, which is explicitly covered as a class of procedures in their policy, she took the name of the procedure and promised to consult with others and call me back.

For the first time in my medical insurance history, she actually did call me back the next day. She said the procedure is covered (she used the name ""trachea shave"" for it rather than the more technical terms, so it may help to use that term). They will be sending a new approval letter, and it should be covered.

And no formal appeals needed!"
theone23four,asktransgender,"Why is it always considered ""cross-dressing"" if a guy wears women's clothes, but if a woman wears men's clothes it's not?","I might be wrong but I'm just curious, I've seen a lot of lesbians wear men's clothes and I've never heard of this being referred to as cross-dressing."
GabiCap,asktransgender,"Give me some resources, articles, essays","Earlier today I had a hard time sleeping so I decided to watch the Caitlyn Jenner 20/20 interview. Last time I saw it was when I first explored what I considered cross dressing. It spoke to me a bit then, but today I had to hold back tears seeing myself in that interview. It spoke to me on a few levels.

So after that aha moment I decided to finally read the DSM V entries for gender dysphoria and transvestic fetishism. I still have questions from my reading, but seeing the criteria for gender dysphoria in the ""official"" document and saying ""yep yep yep"" to the points, it made me more comfortable at least labeling myself as trans (at least for now).

So now I am asking for your best resources, articles, essays. Anything that will help someone wanting to delve into ""Is this who I am?"" ""What does this mean for me?"" ""Can I accept this but still not do anything?"" and even ones that look at other explanations.

Would love to have some reading to grow and learn myself because today was an interesting day in my progress and want to keep it up. 

Thanks! (And yes, I've read the Null Hypothecis)"
wafflestealer654,asktransgender,Meeting new college friends,"Tonight and last night I met a lot of new friends. I would have never met these people if it wasn't for a few connections from my LGBT club at school.

At the beginning of the semester, I have been exclusively using my name, Kayla. I also dress the way I want to (partially feminine, partially neutral), and wearing makeup and nail polish.

I'm loving myself! But I do have worries like I'm sure some of you had in the past.

When I met the new people, I was wearing a sweatshirt overtop of my work uniform. Luckily, they all refer to me as female, and the guys even assumed I used the females bathroom when I asked where the bathrooms were!

Now, I'm worried that someone is going to figure something out that I've overlooked. Whenever I look in the mirror, I still see a masculine face looking back at me. My hair and eyes help with that, but something about my face just screams, MALE. I'm using makeup to help feminize my face, but I can't do that forever. I'm also afraid that I may have missed something on my online profiles.

Basically, I don't want anyone to ever see my previous self at all. So I have fears, but the last 2 days have been wonderful!"
WolfyWolfie,asktransgender,I just came out and I need some advice....,"[I originally posted this on r/lgbt and got some great advice but they suggested here would be better]

Okay, long story short, I finally had a serious talk without someone significant in my life about being bi and maybe trans. I'll sum up their reaction:

*    There's nothing they can do but feel sorry for me.

*    I'll never be a ""real"" woman. Just some half and half.

*    They ""know"" I'm not trans and would have known if I was. I could never have hid it.

*    Many trans people become social misfits and lead horrible lives.

*    I will never be happy. I will be choosing not to have children and to have an unhappy life.

*    If I was trans I would have been adamant about it from the beginning and because I wasn't I clearly can't be trans.

*    To stop talking to them about this hypothetical nonsense and if I want to be the other sex to just say it and if I wanted to ""go out tomorrow in a dress and heels"" they're ""not gonna stop me"".


But... they're not talking to me any differently otherwise and they're pretending the conversation never happened. In fact we've been absolutely fine since.

Any thoughts? I didn't really expect this response and I'm a bit unsure as to what to do? They may come around? I dunno. They're very intelligent and pretty quick to adapt to new ideas and yet... well, and yet that list above just happened.

sigh...

I should add... all of these conversations IRL are just confusing me at this point. I don't know what to think of myself anymore. This person has been right about me so often before, maybe they're right this time too? How do I know I'm not just a slightly feminine guy and not trans? How do I know I'm not just affectionate with guys but not bi? I think sometimes ""why couldn't I just have been born a girl, life would have been so much easier..."" but how do I know I wouldn't have just wanted to be a boy then? How do I know I'm not just stubborn and confused....

wowsotrendy,asktransgender,Where to move?,"Ok, I'm going to be graduating this fall (December) in Graphic Design. 

I'm 90% sure I'm transgender (MTF) and I've told my parents about it a few months back. They...were not very accepting. Though it could've gone worse. Gave the whole ""it's your body but think about it"" and my dad straight up told me how he believed gender is determined at birth (ugh). It was one of the most emotional periods of my life, and I've never seen them so shook up. This was last August. I haven't said anything else, and I'll get a therapist soon. I'm not presenting, either. 

I was always planning to move to another city, perhaps LA or San Francisco, so I can find better job opportunities and etc. (I'm currently in Kansas) 

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared. Not of moving, but of the general higher costs of living and being trans affecting job opportunities. 

Are there any places in particular you would suggest? "

Lolidkwhattoputhere,asktransgender,This is all really scary for me.,"So, after a long while of debate with myself and talking with my best friend, I've come to the realization I don't identify as male anymore, and much more identify as female.

Edit: I should mention i am 18 and physically very ""manly"" (lots of body hair, beard grows quick, etc) and my voice is average deep


But, I don't like the idea of transitioning, I would give anything to go back in time and somehow be born a girl but... transitioning is very scary, I don't like medicine and all of that stuff, I'll take what I need to be alive and in good condition but this is a lot.


I don't know if i want to ever be out to my parents, and for those two reasons I don't know if I can ever be out to my online friends, I'd like to at least start voice therapy before I do that.

I'm also really obsessed with sports so being ""fully"" male would help me while transitioning would make it tons more difficult.

Starburst Fruit Chews.  I now love these so much.  What the hey?

Original V8 Juice. Never the low-sodium kind.  The Original V8 salty one.  I drink 3-4 cans/day of this stuff.  It just tastes so good.  Because of the spiro, I can have as much salt as I want.

Men mostly still make me think ""yuck"" but when it comes to people I know who have stuck up for me and been there for me, I now think ""hmmmmm, maybe if I were drunk.""

ScarlettMaeBottom,asktransgender,(Update) I came out to my parents; it went pretty well,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5l4262/came_out_to_my_parents_last_night_it_went_pretty/?)

I just want to go lie face down in the mud. Here I was thinking 2017 was gonna start great, but of course other people need to make it difficult. Today and yesterday my parents wanted to talk about the whole ""estrogen thing."" Which basically came down to them trying to negotiate with me. I don't remember key points form yesterday so most of what I say will be highlights from today cause It just happened. Also as my wife said half way through today ""You're just talking in circles so unless you need me I'll be upstairs."" 

My moms points have been that I should try to do other things to make myself happy. Like get laser hair removal. I try to explain that its not the same because at the end of the day I'm still a guy. Or they why I didn't go my friends new years party in a dress to present myself the way I want to. Because then I'd just be a dude in a dress. Or she said that being happy is a lot of work and she doesn't see me doing other things like taking proper care of my hair or keeping tidy. The keeping tidy thing, when I came out to them I mentioned when I came out how I realized once I started seeing myself as Trans I noticed my place was a bit of a mess and I wanted to make things better. So my mom wants me to explore other things to make myself happy. Like laser, cleaning, working out. 

My Dad talks about how I might lose the love of my life. He talks about how is never seen such an in love couple and if I've really thought about how transitioning might ruin that. My wife is a great person and supporter but she has always said that she doesn't know how shed feel about being with me after the fact. Which I cannot hold against her, its tough and I'd never stop loving and respecting her if she couldn't stay. But he keeps poking at that. Saying that once I look in the mirror and am happy with how I look will I be happy if I'm in that mirror by myself. Do I want to be like Walter White and throw away everything I have to do something for myself. He asks How I know if I'll even look like how I want to at the end of it all, theres no guarantee, and yes I kept trying to show them other peoples before and afters but  ""Thats just one person."" Then let me show you more! 

Oh also on christmas before I came out my mom was talking about how she wants to post a bunch of our wedding pics on Facebook to be like ""the best thing of 2016"" (we got married early Feb). And for Xmas she gave us a bunch of really nice Wedding pic Prints. Yesterday when they were talking about how other people will treat me differently and how this effects the whole family she mentioned that she could bring herself to post the pics. This really upset my wife and I. 

They keep saying they just want me to be happy and that they'll support me no matter what, they just want me to think about everything. But I have and I tell them that. They just keep sticking a knife in my weak points. And I've always had trouble standing up to my parents. I've always been the yes man of their kids. Like in college I wanted to major in Japanese case I loved learning the language and the history. Instead I majored in programming because it makes a lot. I was a C student in programming and now work a low level job that pays low and I mean I like what I do and the people I work with but I'm not good enough to get better roles. I keep interviewing But keep getting passed up. 

They mentioned that if this was my older brother they be diving right in to help him. He's depressed with anger issues and not much job prospects. So if this is what would help him they'd try anything. I'm sorry I don't show my depression or internal struggle to want to be feminine and only show myself as masculine. 

Sigh. I just feel like lying in the mud and eating cheetos until Im a fat man. :( 

end vent

*PS*. I need goo reading material for family/parents of transpeople that I can send their way. 

**Edit: Update:** Things I forgot or want to elaborate on. 

So my wife has been crying for an hour. She hates the way that they are trying to tell me how to feel or negotiate my happiness. As well as she feels pressured now. 

I talked about my brother because I am a happy person. They kept saying how I'm one of the happiest people they now, and I live a life that anyone would be envious of. Thats cause I believe in being happy so I only show happy emotions to help spread happiness. That doesn't stop me from thinking everyday, ""Gosh, I would really enjoy being a girl."" But its hard for me to vocalize that.

I get that they support me and love me and are trying to work through this themselves but its really fucking frustrating. I was planning on visiting the local LGBT health care center and starting hormones this month, since my state is informed consent. But now I just feel like I should visit a therapist first and just take things slow for their sake.

kotourchan,asktransgender,Hrt options Austin?,"I'm really thinking about DIY. I've spent so long holding off on hrt and now I just don't feel like I can wait any longer.

There are a few options, like Downtown doctor, but I'm under the impression that it's not sliding scale. I don't have a lot of money. Literally almost none and no insurance. A consult is 80$ which is a lot for something that might not go anywhere. Right now I have 300$ and that's enough for something close to a few months of HRT including bloodwork if I DIY I should have more money in the future too, but it is a risk.

I looked into another few options but the ones I can get to don't seem any cheaper. Central family practice is another option. Has anyone been to either of these clinics for HRT without insurance?

It seems like DIY would be the only affordable option, but maybe I'm missing something? Having a script would make it a lot cheaper as long as the blood panels aren't more expensive.

I know the smarter option is to hold off and start HRT until I've built a safety net but really I feel like I need to jump for this opportunity at some point.

AnnieHatesMe,asktransgender,Discuss this argument: Dysphoria is a product of social factors and not genetic ones.,"I'm transgender and my partner made this argument to me (likely because he fears what might happen if I transition).  I've been having a hard time refuting it and I was already doubtful about beginning hormones.  I really want to but the argument is compelling.  

Basically the argument grants that being transgender has a biological basis.  However we only feel dysphoria because society treats males and females differently.  Therefore in a society where males and females are treated the same (same everything), we would feel no dysphoria.  So to transition because of dysphoria is to transition because of societal pressure rather than actually being who you really are.  You can be who you are perfectly well without transitioning if you stop worrying about society.

I don't know what to think.  If that were true, I wouldn't have to go through the risks of transitioning.  "

I dreamed of being a girl from the age of 6 or 7. Praying at night I would wake up a girl. Watched the little mermaid over and over, wanting to be her so much it ached. In the bath, praying that when the bubbles cleared from the surface of the water I would be how I always should have been.

I've found the source of my social anxiety. If I just let out my true voice, movements and manerisms, it melts away. I can just say what I think without an ever present filter changing me to be more pallatable to the world.

She would often make a point of saying how such and such gay/cross dressing guy was lovely and that there was nothing wrong with it. Fuck I loved you mama.

BASIC BIO: 19, college student, AMAB, questioning MtF trans

My first (and main) question is: how do I know if I'm actually transgender or just...very confused? I've never been really feminine... The first time I felt (recognizable) dysphoria was only two months ago (election day, oddly enough). It kinda went away, but it's back now! I've also been doing some thinking, and I'm beginning to think that I (may) have had dysphoria this whole time and simply been too damn clueless to recognize it as such, if that's even possible...
I'm just trying to figure out if I'm a legit transwoman or just some cis dude with some weird kink business. (Which seems to be a common concern...)
I suppose I just want to know some things I can do to get this figured out. I put on some nail polish polish the other day and liked it, but it didn't come off nicely, so it kinda looks like my nails are bleeding. (Horrific!) I tried putting on lipstick, but that was a failure; I just ended up getting lipstick everywhere but my lips. Did crossdressing help y'all? I'm not exactly petite (6'3"", 215 lbs.), so I'd have to order some women's clothing online.

My second question (closely related to the first) is whether or not gender therapists are legit. I don't really like or trust therapists, and it seems to me that gender therapists are all either just total cheerleaders (""Everything you say/do is right!"") or weird out-of-touch gatekeepers (""If you were *really* trans, you'd be able to lick your elbow!""). Am I just completely wrong? Are gender therapists worth it? They're expensive and I don't like talking about this kind of stuff (in person, with a stranger), but if they're super good, I'll put my prejudices  aside and seek one out.

My third (tangentially related) question is whether or not I have a snowball's chance in hell of actually passing (If I actually end up being transgender and transitioning). My main concern here is (obviously) my effing height...most guys aren't even this tall, much less most women. Could I just pass as a **FREAKISHLY** tall woman, or would I stick out like a sore thumb?

My final question is a little different in nature, but is still pretty big: how does one go about coming out as trans? I'm just kind of a reserved  person in general, and I'm very private (if not outright secretive) about much of who I am. I'm bisexual, but VERY few people know that about me, and I'm not even publicly out...although I just found out today (by watching a video of me) that I have a moderate but noticeable case of gayvoice, so people probably can probably figure that one out...I digress.
I'm really just worried about my poor mother...I'm worried that she'd have a heart attack or something. I would just want to be as gentle as humanly possible.

Thanks for your help!

hopelessPyromaniac,asktransgender,I am not manly enough and here's why,"So I have a problem. I'm FtM, and I am the opposite of manly.

lynna751,asktransgender,About my face,"I'm almost 21 and I should be starting MtF HRT soon, it can still take 6-8 months till I start, and in the worst case I'd start when I am 22 (due to the slow medical service here), is  it too late to start HRT?

I will ask my doctor for vitamins and stuff, what can I expect from that?

That's a lot of questions, but I am just sick of ""my life"", if you can even call it a life..."
raphmer,asktransgender,[VENT] feeling pretty dysphoric today,"sorry, this is not a question, but I just needed to vent and share my thoughts with somebody.

Tomorrow marks my 2nd month on MTF HRT.
Although I never had any negative reactions while coming out (I´m out to my close family and close friends), I had troubles with my gf. Anyway, we´re still together, but this isn´t about her.

My life has been way better since I started HRT. My breasts started budding (yay) and I´m seeing slight changes.
Anyway, this morning I had to go to university which triggered dysphoria. I had to leave to room because I´ve been so close to crying. It all started as always, I was in a mostly good mood and then I noticed other girls. I compared myself to them, seeing my broader shoulders and arms. The hair, the faces and everything else. Then it came all together, I had to leave before I had tears in my eyes.

Even now, hours after this incident, I´m still having a hard time believing I´ll ever pass. There are days where I think it´ll be only a matter of time, and there are days like today.

Dysphoria has gotten worse since realizing I´m trans, so have my depressions. I´m having a hard time going to public places (like university) since so many things remind me that I´m stuck in a male body and that many people expect me to behave male.

This is it. :-) thanks for reading"
takeitright,asktransgender,[NSFW] Am I real trans?,"I’m 35 years old physical male.

I felt comfortable when I wore those. Until 12 years old, I prayed my genital to become girls’ one before I sleep. Surely, that wasn’t happen.
 
From 13 years old, my desire to be a girl was decreased. When I saw the girl of my age at that time, I felt sexual arouse as like general boys in my age. At the same time, I had a bit weird feeling. The feeling seemed a kind of jealousy. 

From 13 to 18 years old, when I was attacked by the fucks in my classroom, I frequently became victim. I was blamed when I cried. I thought the reason to be victim is because of my physical masculinity. When I attacked and returned to home, I used to tie my scrotum with thread and left it for 1 or 2 days. And I untied them. I didn’t have bravery to remove scrotum by myself.

I have a younger sister. Before I become 24 years old, I wore her cloths secretly. Some sexual feeling arose, but that was not stronger than my feeling of comfort by wearing her cloth. 

From 25 years old, I started my job. And I didn’t fully focus on such kind of activities. 

Now, I used to search some movies about physical changes some trans-girls when I have free time. I seem to have Surrogate satisfaction by watching those. I wonder them! But, I feel little bit jealous. When I try to do masturbate, I regard myself as a woman. And I’m able to get orgasm by stimulating my genital. But, after finish that, I feel a little bit uncomfortable about my erection during that activity

I don’t know why I have done such things in my life. Am I really trans-woman? Or just have some psychological strangeness?

Necronzon,asktransgender,Transgirls: How did your first few months on HRT feel?,I'm going to be starting HRT soon! What were your experiences in the early stages?
addy-Bee,asktransgender,"Was anybody else sort of disappointed with ""If I was Your Girl?""","I just finished ""If I Was Your Girl"", by Meredith Russo, and I have to say how disappointed I was with it. 

The main character is literally the ""ideal trans woman""--knew at a young age, straight, passes with little to no effort, was able to get bottom surgery at age 16 or 17 with income from her single-parent family. The author acknowledges this is basically a trans-unicorn in an afterword, but then why did she write it that way?

And this book is essentially about nothing **except** her trans-ness.  I mean, there's a romance subplot, and a bunch of ""friend"" subplots but the climax of the story and all the character development hinge on the main character being outed. Because in any story with a trans woman, there **has** to be a scene where she gets outed and it's a huge deal.  

I don't want to say it's a *bad* book, because it really has some amazing moments.  The author nails the little things--that sense of ""I can't believe this is happening"" when you first get HRT, the terror of coming out, the struggle of *learning* your real gender.  It gets all of that so right, but so much of the bigger stuff so wrong.

I guess I'm most frustrated with how...*conventional* it all is.  The book's villain basically sums it up at the climax of the story: ""You would be so cool if you weren't trying to impress the normal people."""
pandachoco,asktransgender,PSA Updating an Irish passport,"So a while ago I asked how it was possible to update the name and gender marker on a pre-existing Irish passport if you never lived in Ireland to obtain a PPS number (since you needed a PPS number in order to complete an Irish Gender Recognition Certificate). Speaking to a number of people at the Department of Social Protection in Carrick-on-Shannon, it seemed the only way to getting a PPS number was to return back to Ireland to becoming a full time resident. After speaking to someone high up, I was given a contact number at the Passport Office in Dublin to ask if there was an alternative way to getting my name and gender marker updated.

What I was told was to complete the application form as though I was renewing my passport with the new details. In place of the  Irish GRC I could include a UK GRC (since I currently reside in the UK) *OR* since getting a UK GRC is complete pain in the arse I could instead submit in addition to my application form

* A deed poll or statutory declaration (original)

* Medical letter confirming I am transitioning permanently from gender A to gender B (original)

* UK passport showing new name and gender marker (copy)

* A supporting letter to explain that owing to not being resident in Ireland, it was not possible to apply for an Irish GRC.

With respect to the requirement of having to provide 2 years continual in use of new name, this is waived for gender change applicants.

For non-UK dual citizen readers in a similar situation, I would say supply your own country's updated passport, name change document and medical letter."

GabiCap,asktransgender,"In denial, said something in therapy, and then has a realization thanks to timelines","Am I or ami not? The answer comes and goes often. Most days, I live my life as a cis male and not think about it, and if I do it's mostly a ""Yeah, it would be nice, but that's not me.""

I get hung up on the that's not me. I don't fit the standard narrative. I look at myself and just see a fat hairy guy with a deep who is lonely and is probably fooling himself by entertaining these thoughts.

At therapy yesterday, I said probably the most damning thing someone in denial could say, ""If there were no external factors, I'd gladly take hormones."" Couldn't believe I said that. I still can't and am choosing to ignore it.

Then last night, I looked through timelines. For the first time, noticed all these beautiful women, women anyone would be jealous to look like, and they started off like me.

I'd see them before transition and think ""it looks like a normal stereotypical cis guy"" but then their inner struggle hit me. It hit me that these girls who probably didn't have any ""give always"" or tells, had to come out to their friends and families. 

And then i saw it. I saw their smiles and their eyes. A look I try to fake, and even when I'm happy I don't think I my eyes have that glow.

Did anyone else in denial have this realization of seeing yourself in others? How long after did it take you to accept it."
IAmJuneHi,asktransgender,EU Gender Care Clinics,"Hi Everyone,

I am currently in the process of trying to find a clinic somewhere within the EU where I could get evaluated for and get prescribed HRT.

I am living in a EU country, but everything here is illegal, you can't even get hormones legally. 

Can anyone please advise me on clinics withing the EU (preferably Germany or France, but any options will do really). I have already compiled a list of UK clinics and contacted them, but right before I did that I found an article saying that UK NHS waiting times for transgender people to get to see psychologists that will approve them for HRT are now somewhere around 12 months. That scared the hell out of me as there is no way I will be able to wait that long at this point.

So while I'm waiting for them to respond, I feel like I should start making some backup plans just in case as I really do not want to be self medicating.

Thank you for your help."
twasanotherthrowaway,asktransgender,"How long should I wait before increasing my dosage? (MtF HRT, dosages, and breast development)","Okay, I know you don't like posts about self-medding here. But I have a diagnosis from Poland, it's just that I'm unable to access official HRT because UK's NHS is kind of bummer and they basically told me to f..k off and wait until the end of 2017 for my GIC appointment.

So I would need to choose between saving for SRS and self-medding, and official HRT, but having no money and living with my crazy-ass mother. So choice is oblivious to me.

Now, I wanted to ask you - when did your doctors increased your E dosages? Because my therapist is an idiot, I was 3 months only on cypro, without E. I had some patches prescribed, but they were terrible and my levels were still in a male range.

On 4 months I started self-medding after asking my GP to make a new prescription for me, but they refused. I started with 4mg of progynova which gave me something around 90pg/mL (320pmol/L). I was on 4mg for 3 months, and then I decided to switch to 6mg obliviously. 

I'll have blood test done next month, but I'm sure that my levels will be around 150pg/mL (550pmol/L), since I switched from oral 4mg to sublingual 6mg. If my blood test will show that, I want to add another 2mg - which will give me perfect 200pg/mL (734nmol/L).

But that's the thing I'm worried about, breast development. As we all know, in MtF's HRT need to be upped instead of throwing 8mg or so on your body. I had slight gynecomastia, but after 4 months of estrogen I have an A cup and I feel like switching to 6mg gave me much faster growth. I'm hoping for B or C cup (but let's be realistic, I'll probably end up with B). So do you think that I can increase my dosage to 8mg, just 2 months after I increased it to 6mg?

Thanks as always :)"

Angel7ech,asktransgender,"Dysphoria, Diablo, and the GIC Dance","For the first time today (technically yesterday, but I work nights so my days are off set) I truly felt sick to my stomach while in my guy clothes. I've had moments of feeling uncomfortable but this is the first time I've truly felt it that strong down to my gut. 

I've been having waves the past few weeks and some obsessive thought but I've either just gone girl mode or when that wasn't an option, smashed Diablo 3 until I forget what planet I'm on. 

I'm thinking maybe it's time I go to my GP about a referral and then continue to figure things out. If I change my mind half way, fair enough. If I stick my guns and want HRT etc, I've saved some time. Not quite sure what to do or how to prepare for the doctors though (I'm in UK (England)) and the last time I went to, I chickened out before even leaving the house. Whatever I do, I know it's time I sat and spoke to a therapist or something as I have my up and downs, but I feel myself sliding into the abyss that's depression once again and I've been beating that bear away with a stick for years. 

Just me waffling again. Starting to feel more comfortable talking in these sub Reddits now :D maybe one day you'll get a picture. Depends on when you do horror nights ;p

zauraz,asktransgender,Cold Logic,"First off. This post will cover how I 'feel', not what I believe. A lot of this is internal transphobia and not directed towards transpeople but how my brain tries to convince myself that I am not trans. I believe in equal rights for everyone.

---------

Whenever I seem to discuss me being trans or legitimize it in any way I usually tend to do two things.

1. Tell the people I talk/write to that I am not certain and I don't really know what I want.

2. Try to explain to myself and them that there is no reason for me to be trans and that life ends up being pointless with me only being chemicals in my brain removing free will etc making transitioning feel pointless and that it won't matter,

The second one here have I only argued with when writing, never in person. But whenever someone tries to reassure me that I am trans, that I can trust my own feelings and that none of it is false, I end up in number 2. I start trying to dehumanize myself to 'prove' that it won't matter. Usually this ends up with me going far enough to claim that I don't have free will and that I am just a bunch of electric impulses that means nothing and make all my choices pointless. Worst is. I can't reason against it as I am reasoning against myself as is. I try to remove emotion out of the picture. I try to make the decision in logic and keep ending up trying to tell myself that emotions are just chemicals and are not real.

Considering the things that have happened in my life lately. Especially the rather extreme emotional reaction I had when I learn that my transition would be delayed for years by the healthcare has made me suspect there is more to this. I have always had periods of certainty, where I felt like a girl. Lately I have felt a bit more secure than before. But it always ends up with me doubting again. Putting myself through the same brutal and cold reasoning again. Stripping myself to something less than a human for seemingly no reason except maybe fear. 

I don't know how to live with this anymore. I think I want to transition. To live like a girl. But my emotions and feeling of weirdness at the thought of being one around the people I know pushes me back down the same pit repeatedly. Every time worsening the depression I already had....


--------

Tl;dr I try to rationalize why my choices and being trans is pointless and therefore I should just ignore it and not do anything."
Poop30,asktransgender,"I'm mtf, and though my boss and coworkers don't know about me, I'm considering coming out to them."," I transitioned in grad school and until recently, have just never been in a position where people didn't know about me. I started a job about 3 -4 months ago. I enjoy what I do, and generally, I love the work environment. The problem is my boss is a constant source of anxiety. They're not really abusive, but one of those people who brings their own stress to work and unloads on you whenever they're upset. It's not uncommon for their criticism to make you feel like shit for the next couple of days (especially while you're new).

This has made my communication and performance suffer at times. I'm so nervous about triggering them and it's compounded by my still lingering insecurities about whether or not I'm passing in front of clients. I think I'm at the point now where I just want to eliminate as much stress as possible at work, even if it means coming out so I don't have to worry about who knows about me.

I don't think they'd fire me because of this. I have queer coworkers, and my boss has aquaintences who are trans. I just wonder if outing myself is overkill for a problem I might be able to fix otherwise."

I remember waking up with an erection once or twice immediately following them. I haven't had ""morning wood"" in a while so I was kind of bummed that I was experiencing it, but whatever. 

The thing is, each time it happened I never ejaculated and I had 3 or 4 in a row... does this mean anything? I have never had multiple dreams of that nature before. I was sleeping with a body pillow for the first time that put some pressure on my crotch, I am not sure if that would explain it, or at least explain the erections. They stopped when I stopped  using it.

Ultimately I just really want my testosterone to be suppressed. I have been on 50 mg spiro (per day) for 4 months, then 100 mg spiro for 4 months, and now 200 mg spiro for 1 month. when I do ejaculate it is clear, and I have been experiencing a lot of testicle ache lately.

Uh, im 26 and after doing the whole ""it would be great to have a female body"" thing for years and questioning myself, I have finally accepted that I am indeed trans mtf.

I have to say thanks to /r/asktransgender. Ive been reading all the ""am I trans"" post and the ""why do we have trans and not cis"" article for like 2 weeks straight and its helped me realize a whole bunch about myself. 

I hope to star seeing a therapist here in the next couple of months.

Anywho I'm new on rhe the block and hope to be here more often! "
Acheronta_Movebo_,asktransgender,Would a cis person find tucking unnerving?,"I've been tucking for a while, mainly because I find the feeling of my genitals brushing against my legs particularly unsettling. It has been helpful in the extreme to the extent that I've done it 24/7  from the very day I first tried it - 2 years ago. While I'm relatively confident I'm trans I was wondering (partly, admittedly, for my own peace of mind) whether a cis person would find tucking uncomfortable/unpleasant/simply-unnecessary. Thanks everyone."

But I don't really understand what it means to ""feel like a girl"". Does it mean you are girly or you like girly stuff? Because that doesn't mean you're a girl; boys can be feminine too. So what's the difference?

I'm sorry if I come off as ignorant. I respect everyone's identity and I just want to understand.

Joafie,asktransgender,How to go about getting your HRT at a pharmacy?,"So I'm about to start Spiro, after many months of waiting. However, I'm not legally Jade yet, but my school has my name in their systems as Jade, and as a result put it as my name on my prescription (I went through the school clinic). My student ID also has my preferred name on it (my school knows my legal name, but they have an option to use a preferred name, so I chose that), However my legal ID still says deadname, and I've never really gotten drugs from a pharmacy before, so I'm kind of unsure of what to do. Can I show them any ID? Does it have to be government issued? I also live in the Portland, OR area if that helps at all."
secondaccount42,asktransgender,Is There a Golden Weight to Hold Before HRT?,"It sounds like my counselor is projecting that he'll write me my letter at the end of this school year (June for me). So, time to *REALLY* get going on weight loss!  
I'm really big (260+ lbs), so I'm not starting from an easy point, but I have a fairly easy time losing weight quick (I've managed to drop by 20lbs in a week before), but I've heard that being big *CAN* help in transitioning (don't know how aside from having man-boobs to start with), so I just wanna ask, is there a golden ground to stand at?

Notoremo,asktransgender,Quick question for those on IM injections - has anyone else ever experienced vial leakage? (from the rubber stopper),"Last week when doing my weekly estradiol valerate injection, I noticed that there was a leak from the vial on its top, where I inserted the needle. After looking it up it seems as though the best thing to do at this point is to throw it out and get a new one, but I'm hesitating. This was almost a brand new vial, and getting my prescription refilled is going to be difficult right now. 

I unfortunately put all this off until today (right on time for my next injection! nice) and I'm at a total loss, because getting a new one will be a hassle and I'm not sure just *how much* of a dealbreaker stuff like this is. My health is obviously more important, so if I need to throw it out, I can.  Anybody else have some experience with it? 

Very much appreciated in advance!


(For additional info, turning the vial upside down doesn't cause it to drip or anything. Everything *looks* okay, but that slight leakage from last week is still there.)"

NumericalSphere,asktransgender,Questioning if I really want to be girl,"For about 1,5 years now I have questioned my gender. I did crossdressing earlier than that and dreamt/fantasized about being a girl before this. Idk why but for somehow back then it used to feel like being a girl would feel better. I would probably be able to find myself more comfortable with my own body etc.

But truth is. Lately I have started to doubt if this is what I truly want. I have started my quest towards getting therapy/hormones but lately I question if a girl is really what I want to be. I have already started down the path and idk what to do right now. Those things are still far off and I have heard before that hormones might confirm things but idk what I want really and its driving me insane.

I used to feel like being a girl might be great etc but I can't be sure of that. I am not sure if it is the right way forward and for some reason it feels too strange right now.

I mean being male is not something I ever feel happy about but I am 'ok'/apathy towards it so its not killing me.. still my body causes me to hate myself and feel hopelessness/disgust.

I never had strong dysphoria to begin with and I feel like I am pursuing what might only be a delusion or something..

pinktarts,asktransgender,Medical excuse for taking hormones??,"Ok so I was just wondering what a good medical excuse would be for taking spiroloctone and estradiol without telling doctors I'm transgender?

The reasoning behind this is the discrimination, I've had to go the ER a couple of times, and every time I mention I'm taking hormones because I'm trans, the doctors discriminate agonist me. 

Now with Drumpf in office and republicatards pushing all of the ""religious freedom"" laws, im worried that if I ever do need immediate healthcare treatment, I might just be flat out rejected because of my trans status. 

What is good medical excuse for taking hormones without outing myself as trans? "
[deleted],asktransgender,I could use some advice..,"Here's my story,

I've known I was trans since I was a child, I denied it at first, joined the rugby team for awhile, got into skating etc kinda those sterotypical 'macho' activities to convince myself I was a male. However now at the age of 17 I've realised that if I was a male these feelings would go away not get stronger and I swear I'm going crazy. I look in the mirror and see my body shape and I feel shitty, I see my tight short hair and I swear I really wish I could grow it out. SO I made the decision of talking to my parents. Sadly my mother and father are strong catholics and kinda shut down the whole idea and threatened to send me to 'help' sessions if I didn't cut this attitude, you know the typical its a ""phase"" speech. We moved to Singapore just recently and I just don't know what to do.. I can't start HRT or dress how I want to cause my parents will murder me and for HRT you need consent until your 21.. I suppose I was just wondering what to do from here..? I can't stand the feelings of depression and self-hate. Is there anything I can do? It feels like I'm stuck in a hole .-. thanks for reading my post if you did :) - Nina"
Alice630,asktransgender,How do I stop questioning and move onto transitioning?,"I’ve been questioning for over 2 years, since I was 16. And now I can’t take it anymore. I can’t work and I’m failing university (I’ve lost interest and motivation for everything except for figuring out whether I am trans). I can’t sleep and when I do I dream about being a cis woman or transitioning into a woman. I want to be a woman so badly and I feel like starting HRT. Yet there are times when I tell myself that I could never be genuine as a woman. I’d be acting all my life. Other times I wish that I had more dysphoria so I could transition but unfortunately I am not trans enough right now. Also I am very ashamed of doing anything feminine – for example I bought an epilator and at first could not use it because I was ashamed of others hearing the noise through the wall and knowing what I was doing (in the end I did start using it – best decision of my life). Whenever I see a “passing” trans woman I feel so jealous. I also feel ashamed of my body – I hate my freakishly large shoulders, my broad yet flat chest, my body hair. Ugh.  I hide my body at all times – even summer – with long T-shirts and baggy trousers. In winter I wear large hoodies and coats. One of the few things I like about my body are my wide hips and long hair. However some times I do not feel jealous of women. So I think that I am making everything up and must be depressed or probably just too lazy to get anything done in my life other than stay on my PC all day and read websites about transwomen. Could I have some kind of OCD telling me that I must be trans? Though tbh as far as I know I don’t have any mental illness because I’ve never been to a psychologist or counsellor. Oh also I tell myself that I want to transition in the hopes that changing gender will help with my social anxiety and will give me some friends (I have 0 lol), rather than because I am genuinely trans. Well I could probably write a book on this (feelings of wanting to be a girl in childhood, disassociation/self-hate when a teenager, my dysphoria, mild depression, anxiety at the thought of growing up male) so let’s end this here: I am extremely conflicted about being trans, even after questioning for over 2 years. Sometimes my dysphoria goes away, or I think that I WANT to be trans, in order to be allowed to transition, or I tell myself that I could never fit in as a woman, because my body and personality are too masculine.

For anyone who got through this wall of text I have two questions.
1)Do you think I am trans or am I making everything up?
2)Since this is seriously affecting my life, how do I get this fixed and somehow move on?

Thanks! &lt;3

olivaoliva,asktransgender,My (so far) uneventful transition,"In the last two weeks, I did a few things I would never imagined I'd do:

- I told someone other than my wife (she has known for a while) that I was going to transition. His answer was: ""I would have never imagined. Good for you for doing something about it!"", and that was it. 

- On New Years Eve, my wife decided that we should go out to a bar with me presenting as female, she did my makeup, helped me pick my outfit, etc.. it was very fun, and it was my first time in public wearing makeup, or a dress. I was surprised to not get any stares, even though I'm quite tall and noticeable, I guess I kind of passed? The only downside of the night was that we picked a shitty bar with a boring and loud concert, you couldn't either dance or talk... a couple of old guys smiled at me, and that's probably the only social interaction we had in an hour, so we left back home. 

- Today I did my first laser session for facial hair removal, a Christmas present from my lovely wife. Even though it was a little bit awkward and more painful than I expected, it doesn't feel like any kind of life changing experience. My facial hair feels exactly the same and it'll be the same for months...

These are milestones of my transition, I've spent years thinking about when the day would come so I could do these things, but somehow, they have been very uneventful. Not much drama, not much intensity, no Hollywood movie moments, it has been more like independent Finnish cinema...

Has anybody felt like that? I wonder if it'll be the same the day that I do the two things that scare me the most, coming out to my family and at work."
Kreatio,asktransgender,I have chosen not to transition - for now - because I fear disappointment,"Hello everyone. I have been struggling with my gender identity for a long time. Pretty much as long as I can remember. Several years ago, I was torn over whether or not I should transition (FtM). I have thus far chosen not to transition and I would like to know if anyone has similar experiences (and would perhaps feel like sharing them).

I have a person close to me transitioning and be very happy with the results, but I personally feel that it would probably not... 'be enough' for me. That fear to be disappointed somehow seems harder to deal with than the prospect of 'staying as I am'. It feels like I can shut out reality, so to speak. It is difficult to explain, but without transitioning, I can shut out the fact that people see me as female. It is like I am acting in a play or something, putting on a mask. If I would transition, I feel that that protection would fall away. 

I have two things going for me. First is that I tend to behave in a pretty ""masculine way"" so I feel over time, my friends sort of come to accept me as such, even if I'm not out. Secondly, I have an amazing partner who accepts me 100% as a guy and does not care whether I transition or not. 

The hardest things for me are that I get anxiety attacks, sometimes feel down and alone, dislike my body and tend to avoid/have to force myself to go out and meet people. I would also like to get in touch with other people in the trans community, but I am fearful of the responses that I might get. 

Does anyone else have similar experiences or any tips? "
TheOneUnamed,asktransgender,Did anyone else have a hard time during high school?,"I found out I'm trans a few weeks after school started and it sucked knowing but not being able to do anything about it. 

I knew who I was but no one else did. They all looked at me as a girl but I saw a boy. I was Just always uncomfortable with my body and the clothes I wore, I'd want to just rip them off because it's so damn frustrating. 

I couldn't handle the work, I'd try but I just felt disappointed in myself. My thoughts always drifted away from the work to being trans. Even now it hurts to do homework and I don't know why, I just look at it and want to cry. 

It hurts to live when you're not being true to yourself and others. I'm planning on coming out to my school cause I can't do this anymore but not doing the work really hurt my grades. I'm failing most of my classes and am gonna have to catch up. It's overwhelming and I'm freaking out  but that's the price I gotta pay."

Healfwer,asktransgender,Would anyone mind giving me some advice on juggling?,"So I'm currently at a job I hate and am trying to move out. I've got my resume made up but I still have to use my legal name because I haven't changed my name or gender marker yet. I don't feel right about changing all that at my current job and dealing with the awkwardness but I would like to start whatever new job I get using my preferred name and pronouns. Some of confounding variables are that I am still building my wardrobe and I'm not sure what would constitute appropriate work attire and that my voice still sounds too masculine. I've been told it passes by some and that it doesn't by others. Makeup skills are nonexistent. All of this effects my passability because I really don't want to be ""the transwoman"". I guess my question would be about how I can change jobs while avoiding as much awkwardness as possible but not tank any job prospects by being too complicated to deal with.

I apologize for my rambly-ness."
hohahuhi,asktransgender,Anyone didn't really want to transition because it's too objectively comfortable not too but still did it ?,"Sorry for the long title !  
My position is simple. My current life is comfortable, I have future goals that would be immensely easier to get to without transitioning.  
But I have strong ""embodiment fantasies"" (arousal at the idea of being female), and a ""wave"" pattern of dysphoria which convinced me that I was probably trans.
Basically, if I could wake up as a girl and not flip up everything in my life, I'd do it. But I don't want to get through the hardships of transitioning. It seems extremely daunting.  
Still, I feel the need to take care of it, because I'll regret it later in life.  
I love my gf, I don't really want to lose her, I need money and want to invest it, coming out to my family seems completely unreal. Training my extremely deep voice and trying to pass despite years on this full on testosterone fueled body seems like a giant wall to climb."
FriendshipShield,asktransgender,Why do some trans women dislike trans men?,"I know this is a strange question, I just wanted to understand because I have recently received some hate on tumblr for questioning this when I saw that a trans woman I follow posted this text post: (sorry it's a bit long, it's just something I've never encountered before and I wanted to understand.)


""like where do trans men get all this money then turn around and 90% of the trans women I interact with are in       literal poverty,,, like shit a lot of us would die to have surgery but we also kinda gotta eat and pay rent and we very     much struggle at even that… im just confused as to how every trans dude basically has a transition success story and is always able to make their goals and get the surgeries they want.

And this is why I get pissed off when I see Trans guys make fundraisers for their top surgeries, like a fuckton of trans girls have (often severely neglected) fundraisers for things like basic survival, but sure, Caleb, take up our community’s limited resources so you don’t have to bind and can show off your cool scars…

I guess they’ve adapted to the “living well at the expense of women” part of being a guy pretty fluidly."""

I've seen a lot in the news about the new administration in the US, and tbh it worries me what kind of reaction I'm going to receive. Intolerance seems to be on the rise and I wonder if I should feel unsafe as an out trans-woman wandering around a US city? Oregon seems to be one of the best places with regards to legal protections, but obviously that doesn't account for individuals who've been emboldened by Trump's anti-minority rhetoric. Anything should I be aware of, avoid, etc?

My other question was this: there's probably not enough time now to get my passport updated to travel under my new name. If I arrive in the US on a passport which lists my birth-assigned gender, with an outdated photo of me, short hair and sans makeup, are the TSA going to put me in a little room and stick their fingers up my bum? :o

I joke.

^^Mostly. 

I'm still going, it's a fantastic opportunity for my career. The other option could be to travel in 'guy-mode' and just go to the conference *as me*. It feels so *false* though, and out of principle I *shouldn't have to*.

Looking out for some travel advice, too! What should I visit? I'm going to head up to Seattle for a couple of days after the conference and see that city too, before heading back home."
mw18582,asktransgender,Any insight how people that consider themselves non-binary deal with trans- related issues?,"Despite the fact accepting myself has been very hard, I consider myself lucky in one department. The outcome I am after is binary. The endless summing of past traits and desired outcomes (that were often stereotypical in nature) eventually swayed me to a confident conclusion. As confident as it gets. In my case, ""yes, I am a woman!"". And, ""yes, I feel more comfortable in behavioral and social patterns (that tend to be) associated with this gender."".

This begs the question. How do people with non-binary identities deal with the doubts? Is anyone willing to share some unique insights in this process? 
I can't even begin to imagine how hard the question ""should I transition?"" becomes in this context.
The mental processes fascinate me.

My parents thought I was transgender so they asked and I quicklyn..told.them.No! Which at the time was true. And they were so relieved and told me that i would get killed and that thats so embarresing.. (They also think every gay man wants to be a woman)
My mom is homophobic.. transphobic.. and Also christian.
they thought that once i turn 18 imma move away and come back with giant tits. fast foward to now. Im 17 in a month. 6 months on HRT (DIY) and my mom tells me she would never go to my wedding Unless its with a woman and that if its a man she will Never come. Thats DISGUSTING in her eyes. She calls me a faggot since 6th grade and was my #1 bully since then. Me and my boyfriend are moving in together once i Turn 18 and graduate. should I prepare myzelf to cut off my mother ?

I almost find dysphoria when it's mild is when it's the most comforting. When it's extremely bad, I felt terrible, when it's not there, I feel terrible. 




 I discovered when I'm distracted from my dysphoria, I can almost keep my mind off it and feel fine. I can get reminded of it so easily, it can be as simple as seeing a girl that will remind me of the dysphoria, going past a women's clothes shop, or sometimes it will come to my head at random. All I can think is how the dysphoria isn't there, which I kind of dislike because it makes me feel like I'm not trans. 




Not sure what to do about this. I feel like if I keep distracting myself, in the future the dysphoria will come back, or it won't come back at all? 




I can't see a therapist (financial reasons) so reddit is all I have at the moment.

TransGalacticOzone,asktransgender,My experience coming into myself as trans,"I feel like the purpose of this post is to reaffirm coming out. I want to remind myself this is happening and I want to create connections and bonds with others in the process. I do not create bonds easily.

I am 35 years old, and I just recently accepted and admitted to myself that I am MtF. I've pretty much known since my late teens early twenties, but for various reasons, I figured that it was not my path to follow. I do lament not having started this process earlier, but maybe I wasn't ready until now. Maybe I had so much else to learn first. I am glad for the growth I have made in my lifetime.

I don't have a coherent narrative of my life, but I've started writing a lot of journal entries detailing my thoughts and feelings on the subject. They are very chaotic entries and probably do not make for very good reading.

I want to stress just how big of a source of anxiety has dissipated from my life since I accepted that my gender identity is female. My body is male, and to be honest, it doesn't bother me that much. It's kind of like wearing a costume. It's cosplay :). But I can't take the costume off.. And others don't recognize me as female underneath the costume..

I do plan to start transitioning.

Anybody feel similarly?"
ash886,asktransgender,How difficult was the process of getting HRT for you?,"I finally decided it's do or die, and I'm making an appointment with my doctor (at a trans-friendly clinic thankfully) tomorrow to talk about going on hormone replacement therapy. I'm just wondering how difficult was the process for some other people? I'm in Australia so the law requires some therapy sessions to diagnose gender dysphoria, which I'm hoping don't take too long as I want to start HRT as soon as possible."
Marla__,asktransgender,Yeson VFS,"Im not going to be getting anything done anytime soon. I havent even started HRT yet haha. Ive been looking into it and im thinking that maybe in a year and a hlf 2 years im going to get it done, should i get anything done int he first place. 

But i was wondering if anyone had gotten voice feminization surgery [VFS] with them and what your experience was like. Im from the US so i would have to travel around the world just to get it done. My main concern wasnt the surgery itself, but the cost and the process to getting the surgery done. Do i have to go talk with them in person a week before the surgery? A month? Can most if the sonsultations be done over the phone? Questions like those are what i was hoping to get answered."
AnotherDetour,asktransgender,Work communication after transition?,"First of all, please forgive me if I come off as arrogant or offensive. I don't mean to be, I just don't have much (actually, any) experience with this topic. For the record, I am from Eastern Europe, been living in the US since summer. 

So, last Fall, I was in touch with someone named Jennifer Smith (not their real name) for work. We exchanged some emails and met in person a couple of times. Our communication was brief and purely work-related but very friendly. This morning I was told to contact Robert Smith (again, made up name) by my work supervisor. Robert happened to have the same email as Jennifer and after quick googling, I realized and Jennifer and Robert is the same person. 

My question is, how should go about communicating with this person? I have never been in this situation before so I don't want to come off as rude or hurt Robert's feeling in any way. Where I am from you just don't run into this kind of situation (unfortunately, I wish our society would be more open and supportive to LGBT).

When I write to Robert... Should I acknowledge that I noticed the change? Ask about what pronoun and name to use? Or just write ""Dear Robert"" and write purely about work-related stuff?

I am sorry again if I came off disrespectful in any way... Thank you very much for reading!"
EmiCol,asktransgender,I think an old childhood friend is trans,"We were friends through Boy Scouts for at least 7 years.  Once we graduated we lost contact.  They would post on Facebook every couple of months and that stopped in 2014.  

Thanks to the People you may Know feature on Facebook I found the profile of a woman that looks similar to my friend.  Birthmarks are similar, high school, and we have some mutual friends.  What made me 99.9% sure was that my friends old account and this woman's account both have the same birthday.

I want to contact her but I'm not sure how or if it's even appropriate?  Should I wait until she decides to contact me?  It looks like she's out to everyone.

Advice?

EDIT: I'm still closeted about being trans and would use my guy profile."
AuroraSophia,asktransgender,Cyproterone Acetate + Dutasteride = Liver Overkill?,"Hi all ^^

I'm doing 50mg CPA and slightly more than 2mg (~2.5) Finasteride. The 2 mg is broken into 2 intakes (morning and evening), due to the uber short half life of Finasteride, I'd like to switch to Dutasteride, mostly to eradicate my body hair and restore my hairline, and also because Dutasteride has a half life of about a month and I wouldn't have to worry about doses becoming too low. Now there is a study done on Dutasteride vs Finasteride. And based on that, I'm guessing that 0.2 mg Dutasteride daily would produce better results than 5 mg Finasteride, especially since Dutasteride inhibits both 5ar1 and 2.

Now, I see normal doses being 0.5 per day on top of a full dose of spiro/ cpa.. And I'm like wondering how bad that would be for the liver. I was figuring that half a dose might be enough ( or even less).

Like I said, my main concern is not frying my liver, and I wouldn't to push it too far, especially considering that cpa takes its toll on the liver as well.

Am I on to something? Or should I just stop worrying go for 0.5mg per day? Or what would be a good dose to take to still see results? I know the absurdity of the question considering that cpa nukes my T levels leaving probably nothing for Dutasteride to act on, but I'm still in the beginning and I really don't wanna leave anything to chance.

ash886,asktransgender,Advice for coming out to immediate family,"This is the biggest obstacle for me, right now. I live with my brother and dad so they're the people I'm most concerned about when thinking about coming out as trans - extended family I hardly ever see so I honestly don't care as much, at least right now. (background - I just turned 30 and am pre-everything)

My brother - knows a few trans people through his circle of friends, (though I don't know how well) and seems to be fine with it, but accepting a sibling as trans is a whole other issue. I was thinking of telling him first.

My dad - I'm much less certain how my dad will react if I told him. He's a pretty liberal guy for a man of his age. (he was strongly against the Republicans winning the last US election for instance, and always votes Greens/left wing parties) I have a faint memory of my dad talking with my mom about David Reimer when I was a kid, and he seemed to think trans people are mentally ill. This was a long time ago now, though.

I can't really afford for them to have a strongly negative reaction to me because right now I'm financially dependent on them, though it's pretty unlikely I would be kicked out. I'm mostly afraid of destroying my relationship with them and having to live with it.

Can anyone provide some advice, or maybe some stories of how they were able to come out as transgender? Thanks."

strugglingatlife22,asktransgender,I don't know how to start. I'm scared of what will happen after,"I am 26 and am currently living in California I have a girlfriend who has been by my side for about 7 years. Growing up I've always felt different it wasn't until recently have I really really thought about going through with transitioning. I'm mtf and my girlfriend is very supporting of me changing but I have a list of questions and I'm so confused. I have a very religious very tight knit family we get together for every major holiday and my grandparents are the center of the family. There's on a good day 40 of us at a gathering with about 5-10 children (more at Christmas) but all together there's 60 of us. I made the mistake of telling my mom who just replied ""so your gay now? You want to be with boys?"" And ""if you ever tell your father this you know he'll never speak to you again so just drop this"" it really hurt.... my family are great I love them and I love being around them... but I know I'll be disowned the second I tell anyone what should I do? The next question I have is what are the steps to begin transitioning? Do I see a doctor and ask? Do o go straight to a psychiatrist (was told that I'd have to see one to be diagnosed) and if I plan to do this. Are there any insurances in California I could get that would help cover the therapy, her and anything else I needed done? I currently have government assisted insurance but want to pay for a better coverage but don't know where to start. Third question is. I'm abit overweight and have been trying to work out to lose some weight. Is it better to be in great health before using hormones? (Would they cause my weight to freeze?) what are some good excercise to lose weight but without putting on a lot of muscle since o want to transition. And lastly what about hair removal and surgery. Is the latter completely necessary. Do I need facial reconstruction or gender reassignment to be happy with myself after hormones? And is hair removal expensive or covered? I'm sorry for asking so many questions but I really don't know what to do or how to even start I'm so confused about all this. 

(P.s I currently work as a caretaker for my grandparents so that might be affected if I tell them.)

RainbowSingularity,asktransgender,Why I am being gatekeeped? How do I exit this hole? Im desperate...,"Hi, im from Spain, and i have been in therapy with a psychiatrist and a psychologist for about 1 year and 5 months.

They always avoid talking on the subject of my gender dysphoria. In every session I bring the subject, but they always say ""Just wait X time, and we will see what happens next...""... When i wait to that time, its another excuse to wait more and they say the same argument.

They prescribed me an OCD medication (btw, I dont have OCD), an injectable and another pill... and I dont have any mental illness, I just want to be a girl! 

My family is also not supportive... they say they are ""ok"" but in reality they dont want that could transition and in one time they talked in private to my doctor and im sure they filled up his head to make sure he gatekeeps me

Im considering two things (I dont have much money), one is changing my voice before transitioning to reduce my dysphoria and to have finally HRT, and the other option is going to another doctor, but that would be a huge waste of time, because i already wasted 1 year and half going to that doctor... and im almost 22, I dont want spend too much of my life living in that body... 

Thanks for reading, I wish you nice 2017 :)"
pinkchips,asktransgender,"I'm a month into transition, and there is a beautiful sense of calm that is taking over. So many little things are changing. (NSFW text)","Im MtF, one month spiro/estradiol/finasteride.  Every day I do a self check, and ask myself what I want out of life: is transition making me happy?  Am I sure I want this?  I consider what I used to be, and what I'm becoming - and the answer is always ""this, this, THIS!""  
  
I feel calmer and smile more in the mirror now.  I feel like a whole person - not like I'm just waking up and trudging along to the next fetch quest of life.  I can totally relate and empathize with other people now; what used to be a world filled with cardboard NPCs I didn't care about has suddenly come alive and everyone is so interesting to me.  Especially when a girl smiles at me or chats me up, I suddenly want to know all about her and see if we could be friends.  My relationship with men is changing too - many I roll my eyes at with their clinginess and creepiness.  Some I admire in a way I've never felt before.  This extends to fantasies as well.  
  
I still have a healthy libido, but the nature of it is changing.  I hear it may drop away entirely in coming months (for a time) so I'll enjoy it while I got it.  I no longer look at porn at all, usually my imagination is all that's required.  I am also coming to understand how to express femininity in a positive way sexually, vs the shame I've funneled it into my whole life.  I feel myself becoming increasingly bi, and ok with that.  
  
Physically there's a thousand tiny sparks of changes.  But it would be hard to quantify any of them.  My non-existent boobs hurt.  There is a subtle ache beneath the nipples, kiiiind of like a muscle pain but not quite.  And my skin is SO much softer; self care and Bath and Bodyworks are helping but there is this satin feel to me that I've never had before.  Fat is changing little by little: my cheeks are cuter and prettier now, and my butt has a new pleasant curvature.  
  
The main thing is though when I look in the mirror I don't see an aging and sad man anymore.  I see a homely and hopeful woman, just blossoming into the world.  
  
I wish more closeted and scared people had the courage to start this process, because it really is wonderful in a way nothing else ever could be.  When I think about how I've existed these past few years, it all seems so silly to me now in retrospect.  The greatest gift I ever gave myself was having the courage to come out and begin transition.  "

OliviaOfTheStarrySky,asktransgender,What was your experience coming out to your circle of friends? I'm thinking of coming out but am also scared I'm making a mistake.,"I'm a senior in high school, and I have some real good friends. They're all very open-minded people. And, it wouldn't exactly shock them that I'm not a straight male, although I'm not a gay male either.  The reason I Want come out is because of jokes they make about me that hurt me and cause me anxiety. Jokes about boobs and bras and how I hate my genitals. 

They aren't being mean, because they don't know I'm trans, and thus dont know they actually offend me. So I was thinking of coming out to them. 

But I'm scared. I'm scared to lose the one good thing I have, material possessions aside, Friends. Hanging with them means everything to me, and I dont want to lose that. But I also don't want to spend school days on the verge of an emotional outburst. 

Your opinions would be appreciated."
TotallyNotStealthAcc,asktransgender,I think I am trans.,"Hello to anyone taking the time to read this. Some time ago, I posted here asking questions because I was unsure about what I feel. Now, I clearly know what I feel, but I don't know if it means what I think. I've been talking with my mom about it and she is really supportive, which makes it easier to talk about it for me. I am a 17 years old (well, in some days) born a male, and I wish I was born female. When I think to it, I know I don't hate being male, but it doesn't make me feel good. The reflection of the mirror looks like a picture and I don't look at it thinking it's me, I just think it's someone. I tell myself all the time how easy it would be if I was born female, because I wouldn't have to explain things like why I like feminine stuff or why I act feminine sometimes. I think pretty much all the time to HRT, how it would change me, etc. I am really scared that I would not pass as a female, and honestly do not feel like I would dislike it. I would for sure love being a female, I am only scared of it not working well. But then why am I not hating being male? Is it because my body is already pretty feminine that I don't feel much dysphoria? I started shaving and feel way better now that I do, but that doesn't mean much, I think. Anyway, I know no one can tell me a clear answer of what I am except myself, but I'd just like to know what other people think to understand my situation. Thanks a lot.

Edit: Thanks for the answers, everyone. It really means a lot to me to get support after not understanding my anxiety for so long."

kENTuck,asktransgender,Step 1: accept yourself. DONE!!!,"So after 24 long years of impossibley stupid denial finally I could deny the truth no longer.  I am a women, that makes me trans, and the only way forward I see with a happy ending involves transition.  

It's funny.  You would think that a male who has actual dreams about being a women on a regular basis couldn't  deny the truth for so long.  You would think that someone who spent so much time obsessing with the idea of being beautiful and feminine probably would've caught on by now.  You would've thought that someone who has spent so much money on dresses and make up over the last few years could've pieced together that cis males, not even gay males, spend that much time and money obsessing over passing as women.

But I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here.  I was in the shower a few days ago when I realized I just couldn't deny it any longer.  Huge props to   http://upandoutcomic.tumblr.com/ for being the final inspirational straw that broke the cis denials back.  I read all of your comics, spent an hour crying/laughing like a crazy person, and came out the other side honest with myself for the first time.

I know it's going to be difficult.  I have an amazing family and friends group but I won't lie to myself and say everyone I know is going to accept me.  Honestly I'll probably lose my job.  I'll lose some freinds.  There will be family members I don't talk to anymore.  But it's worth it.  I'm willing to make sacrifices to be happy with myself for the first time.  It's as exciting as it is terrifying.

I know I'm rambling now.  My bad :/  thanks for listening. It's been a crazy few days. I haven't told anyone yet, but I've started taking my first steps.  I'm scared, but I'm so wonderfully excited.  I've been bouncing back and forth between stress exhaustion and full jubilation.  It's crazy, I feel crazy!  But I feel like me.  And that's amazing :D

I really feel like I have girl orgasms now. Like, pre-Op on HRT my orgasms got a bit longer, and a bit more all over. Post-Op though, I swear it felt like a minute or more. If I left my wand there I'm sure it would have been even longer, it was too intense to. It makes it all worth it.

catfusion,asktransgender,"Gender Dysphoria, Mental Health, Treatment &amp; Practice?","Part of a post I made in another thread got me thinking about something. Here's the relevant bit from that: 

&gt;...the way GD is handled is a little different than most other mental health issues (which is ok, as it probably is) in that it's extremely rare for a practitioner to recommend, or god forbid mandate treatment, i.e., you present with depressive symptoms and they'll go, ""I think you're depressed. And I really think you should get on antidepressants."" But I'm unaware of anyone presenting with symptoms of gender dysphoria and having a practitioner go, ""I think you're trans. And I really think you should get on hormone replacement therapy and start wearing a dress (or maybe a suit, as appropriate).""

**So my question is, has anyone had this happen?** 

Where a doctor or therapist has actually prescribed HRT or transitional type stuff, independently of the patient/client requesting or expressing desire/interest in that? i.e., ""I don't know what's wrong with me, I just keep having these intrusive thoughts and fantasies and a feeling something's off...""

I hear about 'concerns' that people are being pressured by therapists to be trans, but IME, GD is not approached with the same protocols:

There seems to be two main protocols for mental health: medicate and the 'talking cure'. 

Someone presents with depressive symptoms and yes, they'll pressure and push for antidepressant meds (ask me how I know).

Someone presents with, I don't know, a phobia or various other things and they'll recommend lots and lots of therapy *until the patient doesn't have a problem anymore*, eg, remission of the phobia, i.e., ""Hooked on snake handling really worked for me!!"" or whatever.

GD and transgender identity stuff is different - and should be handled differently. (Although sometimes the second protocol is still applied, although I think that's becoming less common among *competent* practitioners.) You're not going to medicate the feelings out of existence (tried that - did. not. work.), nor are we going to talk until I don't have these feelings anymore. 

The 'problem' as such, and IME competent professionals will address it accordingly, generally has more to do with self acceptance and maybe commitment to care, and then dealing with all the issues that come up consequent to being trans (whether one chooses HRT and/or 'transition', or some other management strategy for the GD...)

(And yes, I know not everyone who's trans experiences dysphoria, and that's why some people are trying to the get some changes through in the DSM-6, but that's how it's currently listed so that's what a psychologist is going to have to go by, at least officially.)"

AltAcc1274,asktransgender,Therapist wanting me to socially transition before starting HRT. Suggestions?,"Hey everyone. During therapy yesterday, my therapist started talking about when I would be able to get on HRT. She said that I would have to wait until I socially transition to get on HRT. I wouldn't have to do anything crazy like wait a year after socially transitioning to start HRT, but she does want me to dress like a girl, act like a girl, come out publicly, etc. before starting HRT. I asked her why she wants me to do this, and she has a pretty good reason. She wants me to come out socially first because she had another client who went on HRT while also coming out publicly at the same time. The client's depression and anxiety got worse and they ended up going off of HRT. My therapist doesn't want me to get on HRT and regret it. It makes pretty good sense to me, but on the other hand, I would like to get on HRT as soon as possible. What do you guys think of this situation?

 **EDIT:** I've been reading through the replies, and I'm not really sure what to think. There are good arguments both for and against getting on HRT earlier, but I don't really know what to do. My therapist is amazing, and I absolutely do not want to go to someone else. The idea of going on T blockers does sound like a good compromise. Thoughts?"
Zeuphrosyne,asktransgender,How to fully accept the trans part of our lives?,"I feel like the more I move forward on my journey, on my transition,the more I tend to hide my past to people.

Indeed, I'm afraid of being different and be judged that's it, I just want to be seen as a girl like every other ones not ""the trans girl"". I'm trans just like I'm blonde, have blue eyes, love reading, am curious about everything.. it's no big deal and I'm afraid not everyone feels the same way. Now that everyone recognises me the real me, I'm more and more reluctant to talk about this issue with my cis friends for example. I know that many people don't know much about the subject and are uncomfortable when confronted to it so it makes me uncomfortable hence me feeling ashamed maybe of it. Society still tells us that trans = weird so I don't feel comfortable. For instance, I hate when my family says my deadname even if their purposes are not to hurt me but simply reading a legal document with my deadname of it because they aren't changed yet. I don't like seeing old pictures of me. My parents told me I need to accept that I was born a boy and that I can't erase 15 years of my past, so I shouldn't be bothered about hearing my deadname and such, and I know they're right but it's hard.
So how did you manage to be 100% comfortable about everything related to trans issues and your past? Any tips?"

I'm also at a time where its very tiresome and tedious to share how I feel too and when someone asks how I am and I try to convey in some way they can empathize or relate, they always say they have no words or just something nice but short and then I don't want to talk anymore.

Does anyone else do this? I feel like I can't trust anyone or talk to anyone. "

imfreezingmyassoff,asktransgender,"Does anyone else think that being trans is comparable to being an ex-felon? I know it sounds harsh, but let me explain...","Background: I'm a trans guy who is just a bit over five months on testosterone and I am having top surgery in the summer.  Last year, I came out to friends and family and I've come to some shocking realizations.  Since I will be going off to college in about 9 months, the idea of being stealth is seeming more and more attractive to me.  I've been observing people's reactions and the way in which they interact with me both before and after they realize I'm trans, and it is disappointing that there are drastic changes in some people's attitudes upon learning that I'm trans.

Ex-felon background: For this case-scenario, I'll be talking about a hypothetical person who committed a crime in his youth (18-19 years old) and served time.  However, after prison, he attended college and graduated with high marks. He now has a stable job, but he was hit with some obstacles which would not have occurred had he never committed a crime. 

Comparison:  Living stealth in college, in my head at least, seems shockingly similar to the life of en ex-felon.  When meeting a new person, both a trans person and an ex-felon could greet said new person with a smile and a handshake, making intelligent conversation and appearing seemingly normal.  Nevertheless, this new person soon becomes a big part of the trans person's and the ex-felon's life.  Like any relationship, honesty is an important part of it and sooner or later, the past is going to be brought up. This is where it's time for both people make a decision of whether you tell the person about being born female or committing a crime, or chose to be dishonest and figure out a way to cover up the years that were lived as female or lived in prison. 
Hypothetical questions to prove point:
- Would you want to have a friend who committed a crime that would have caused him to serve time in prison? Can someone with such lack of morals really change as a person?
- Do I treat this person as a female because that's what they were born as? I don't know what to say to trans people, so should I bother being friends with a weirdo?
Summary: Both situations would cause others to think differently about the person at hand, whether they're trans or committed a crime in the past.  Being trans can certainly keep someone from getting a job, as can committing a crime.  In my experience, there have been numerous times where I've passed completely and been addressed with the right pronouns with someone whom I have never met before, but an unknown, outside party chooses (for whatever fucking reason) to reveal to them that I'm trans, causing the new person to treat me like a girl, even using female pronouns when I am clearly not a girl. This just makes ex-felons come to mind. If a person who really did turn their life around met a new person and disclosed to the new person that they served time in prison, it would almost definitely cause the person to keep a closer eye out for that person.  Likewise, if the new person learned that a person was trans, the new person would most likely keep a closer eye out for feminine features of the trans man. 

These are just my thoughts and I wanted to see if anyone could relate/if my points are valid. It's a shame that being transgender, which is not a choice, can lead to similar consequences of something that, even if the person regretted and turned their life around completely, was a choice nonetheless.  I'm not trying to prove that trans people are criminals - obviously that's the last thing I want to do. Just sharing ideas and hope to find someone who could relate. "
MurakamiDelRey,asktransgender,I kind of came out but it's left me in an annoying situation.,"My dysphoria yesterday was hitting a low and it was obviously showing. My parents asked me what was up and after trying to get me to talk for a while I told them that I was uncomfortable with who I am. I guess I did a pretty shit job of explaining my gender issues to my parents because now they think I'm just not completely 'comfortable' as a man and that I'm just questioning my gender. The truth is that I'm 100% sure that I'm a trans woman.

I guess I just panicked because they weren't taking the possibility that I could be trans *brilliantly*. They said that they would support me in whatever I do but I could tell that straight up coming out as trans wasn't going to be a brilliant move. I don't think that they will have a problem with my being trans, it's just going to be hard for them to get used to.

I now have an appointment with a GP coming up so I can get a letter of referral for a councillor or therapist. I'm wondering if I should come out to them properly before getting to the councillor appointment (whenever that could be) so I can start actually looking into blockers and (eventually) hormones.

What sounds like the best idea?

On the plus side I came out (properly) to my sister and got a really positive response which was really nice.    "

Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,Anyone have experience with both Estradiol patches and taking Estradiol pills sublingually? Which did you find worked better?,"[My Hormone Levels](http://i.imgur.com/xewXt26.png)

I have been on Climara Estradiol patches for the past 18 months, ever since starting HRT.  For the last 14 of these months, I haven't felt the soreness that I associate with breast growth, and which I remember from the first 4 months of HRT.  It also feels like my body overall isn't feminizing all that much underneath the female clothing I wear.  Looking in the mirror while naked kinda sucks.

As an example of how not-sore my breasts are, if I just wack them with my hand, it feels about as painful as if I wack my stomach in the same way.  Or squeeze them, or pinch them, nothing.  Jumping jacks without wearing a bra? No pain.  Walking up and down stairs without a bra? No pain.  They just feel like any other part of my body.

My hormone levels, measured 6.5 days since I last put on my 7-day patches, and nearly 24 hours since I last took a once-daily 100mg Spiro (so at the trough) are 8ng/dL T Total, 0.7pg/mL T Free, 93.3pg/mL Estradiol.  That means that my T is very suppressed, very deep into the female range, and that my Estradiol levels are at about the monthly median for a cis female adult (which is 92.5pg/mL), but on the low side as far as trans women go (it's been my observation that trans women generally prefer their E2 levels to be &gt;120pg/mL if they pay attention to them).

So, to anyone who has tried both Estradiol patches and taking Estradiol sublingually, was it your experience that sublingual resulted in more development than the patches?

Ideally I would experiment with injections or pellets, but pellets don't seem to be an option when I talk to my Endo, and she is of the belief that trans women who take Estradiol injections will have peak Estradiol levels of ~1000pg/mL, which she believes will result in death, even if the 7-day trough measurement is &lt;200pg/mL.  She might even believe the same thing about sublingual, I don't know."

thisismalvar,asktransgender,TIL: Cannabis drastically dampens Testosterone levels (short-term),"Yesterday, I searched the web for hormonal effects of cannabis because i had read that one of it's active ingredients is endrogenic. Turned out, this is only very minor... 

However:

As I've also found out, medical tests have proven that THC lowers Testosterone levels. Trials on primates have shown that within the first hour after administration, the T levels were down by 2/3!! 

The long term effect seems to be weaker and also still disputed but the short-term effect seems to be common medical knowledge. (My Endo confirmed it too, today) 

Now I'm starting to wonder if the fact that my body hasn't been that masculinized even though I'm 31, might have to do with the fact that have been smoking weed since puberty? 

Also, i think this might explain why cannabis always helped me in a  way no phycho-pharmaceutics could ever replace. 

And i guess it's obvious that this would also be the reason why weed makes people (amab especially) so peaceful. Stupid T! xD"

russkiychic,asktransgender,How do you cope with social anxiety in large part to being trans?,"Hi! So I'm 22, a trans woman, post op, am financially independent, I have cool hobbies, a truly amazing supportive boyfriend, am frequently told I'm pretty, hit on, or get jealous looks from other women. But even with that, to this day I have near crippling social anxiety. While I am happy with my body for the most part and am more confident than I ever have been, I've just been treated so terribly in the past and been through a lot of trauma, faced the worst possible scenario before, that I feel like I can never be ""just another girl."" 

I wish I could just go up and talk to people without being weird, I wish I didn't always focus on the way I walk, I wish I could make friends, I've always been a loner. I came out at a very young age (but didn't learn the word transgender until a few years after) and I wasn't taken seriously, I was bullied, beat up by groups of boys, not allowed to be myself, spit on, dehumanized, sent to conversion therapy, it really took a toll on me. I ran away in highschool, finished that out, then went to escorting, camming, porn which paid for transition and college.

Even in college I faced some abuse until I could move out of the dorms. 
I survived attempted murder from a client, managed to overcome a drug habit and self-improve into the person I am today. Other than SA I have what most would consider a normal, like cis-normative life. I just want the anxiety to leave me alone so I can stop being so alone and get rid of the nightmares. 

When I'm not working, at the gym, studying, with my babe, feeling like forcing myself to go out somewhere, I am just crying at home and trying to find the motivation to go out. I am not depressed or dysphoric at all anymore, just lonely, anxious, wishing I had girlfriends or someone I can relate to. "

I mean, a phalloplasty would be greatly served by all the testicle and erectile tissue that the one receiving the vaginoplasty would discard.

AlolaSandslash,asktransgender,Am I being selfish? (This may get a bit long),"So... this past month I had to be hospitalized and I've been going to a support group since. I've been talking about many of the issues I've been facing, and I just want to know if I'm doing the right thing.

Essentially, I feel like my parents have been enabling me for what has been the vast majority of my adult life. I've never really have been able to move out, and what few times I have did not last long. This has been a source of anger for me, because over the course of the past eight years I was never able to get the help I felt I needed.

I honestly just didn't know how. Ever since I was dropped from my parent's insurance I feel like I'm turning a corner. I'm still learning, and am starting to do more for myself. Yet at the same time I feel like I am just to shift the blame onto others.

The other day I broke down. Was delirious to boot because I've been struggling with the flu. Honestly have felt awful for the past month and a half. I had a panic attack as I was walking into work, and my dad had to call in for me. There was no way I could stand to be around people at the time. I then go home, and begin talking to my aunt about what I am going through. This is when it really went south.

I started to open up to her about how unhappy I am with the spot I am at in life, the body image problems that I struggle with, and the utter fact that I just hate being trans. My cousin walks in and joins in the conversation, and this is when it all blows up. He raises his voice when addressing me, and tells me that he's tired of me acting the way I am because he feels like he and everyone else in the house is walking on eggshells. He tells me he thinks I am just doing this for attention, and that I am just doing this to claim oppression points. He also chides me on how I need to pay my dues along with other shit platitudes that do nothing but piss me off. He goads me with how he has come so far without a GED, and tells me I need to man up.

Shortly after I break out in tears because of the constant dead naming and misgendering that was going on. I bluntly state that they please do not refer to me as he or him anymore. They then begin to talk among themselves about me as I withdraw from the talk. They continue talking about me as if I am not sitting there between them. They stop using my dead name, but sure as hell did not use my preferred name. It was just constant he/hims which only made me feel worse.

Afterwards my cousin stormed out of the room while I withdrew to my room. I decide to finally present for the first time in front of family for some reason, and I just felt so unsure. My cousin sees me, and tells me about some picture he has when we were teenagers and how he still sees me as that guy. My dad sees me and does not say a word. He has suggested to me in the past that I should just try to date girls again, or that it would be easier if I were just gay. It was as if I were still dead name. He still had the decency to grab me something to eat, as I was hungry. That I appreciate. My mom didn't say a thing too. It was my aunt that told me anything that could be called supportive. She told me I was the most feminine looking person in the house, and I should stop worrying and just own it.

Anyways, what I'm trying to get across here is should I try to get away from this? During counseling I am starting to look at transitional housing options and food banks. I don't think I can comfortably transition around my family, even though they say things along the line that they are supportive or that they'll always love me.

I feel like I am flying by the seat of my pants here. I want out, but am told there is no way I can support myself on my own which to I agree. My cousin even insisted that I should not even think about school and just continue to work the job I have right now even though I hate it. It's not like I already have my own doubts, but to hear it from family is just disheartening. The group I am in right now is a complete 180 from what I am experiencing at home, but my dad has said it clearly isn't helping me. He wants me to also ditch my therapist and seek a second opinion on the ""trans"" thing. Mom holds the same opinion too. My cousin claims he is supportive, and he would fight anyone who would give me shit for my lifestyle choices. That doesn't stop him from immediately inviting me to watch Jerry Springer with him on Prime afterwards. I reluctantly accept if simply not to hide, and he then proceeds to point out a transwoman and asks me if I seriously think that he looks natural...

I just don't know what I should do here. I've put in my two weeks notice at work because my health has been deteriorating and I want to focus on school. Honestly should be registering for classes right now, but I cannot stop thinking about this. I'm following up with a food bank later this week, because we never have anything to eat. If we do, you cannot prepare it because the only working appliance we have is a microwave. I am also looking at transitional housing because I just flat out feel uncomfortable at home. The only saving grace it has is that we actually have heat, electricity and water, though that last one comes with a caveat. We also need to move soon, because the house has been foreclosed on and has sold at auction. My parents have not found a place to go, but I don't want to be here when that powder keg goes off.

Anyways, what I guess I am trying to say is that I am trying to pull myself out of this situation, but I feel like I can't. I'm honestly compelled to stay because I can't even afford to buy myself a junker at the moment, and only qualify for rudimentary retail positions. I feel like I'm doing this because I'm being ungrateful and selfish, but I am getting mixed signals from my family at best. At least I think so.

If anyone has words of wisdom for me, I'd greatly appreciate it. I'm trying to find some focus here, but that is hard for me to hold onto at this point. I have so much to do, and still need to work tonight when all I want to do right now is sleep..."

So I'm MTF but still in the closet (for the most part) publicly, only my family and close friends know. Just started the first day of my last semester before I focus full time on transitioning for a while to hopefully come back as the real me. But I am going through the semester still mostly portraying as a boy. But I am growing out my hair, I have long well kept nails that I use clear coat/protection nail polishes on and I am wearing more feminine clothing not full on obviously girl wear but more towards androgynous to make myself feel better and what I thought wouldn't get any attention.

I did get several weird looks especially at my hands because, but I thought it's just in my head or it's just that they're slightly confused but nothing to worry about. But, I sit down for my last class of the day, a talkative girl sits beside me and we talk for a little while before the professor comes in and starts. We have a pretty pleasant conversation, but the direction of the conversation is more like two girls talking rather than what my past experiences have been which are more like they're thinking ""I am talking to a guy I can't act flirty, have to be dry"" or ""I am going to act super flirty"" which feels great honestly, one of the only conversations I've had with a girl I didn't know without feeling like I am being immediately assumed as a possible mate or something. I just figured she thought I was a feminine gay man or some other stereotype people like to assume, but I don't care because I think there's no way she could think I'm trans. But after the class ends I turn to her to say see you next class because she was nice and I like to be friendly with the students around me, she immediately says ""Do you do your nails?"" I just say ""Oh, oh yeah I do."" (trying to be super casual like) her ""So you paint your nails? You clear coat your nails?"" me ""Yeah... Yeah I do..."" her ""Sorry to seem creepy I just saw your nails and thought 'those look way longer than they should be' why do you keep them so long why do you paint your nails?"" me ""I just like to keep them well kept."" her (with a super like wtf/weirded out face) ""Okaaaay?.. Okay?.. I guess, see you next class."" This is in the middle of a cramped class room with students trying to get out all around us and she was very loud...

Are even subtle things like nails that obvious? I'm sure she didn't think ""this is a trans person."" But either way  I was treated a bit like an alien... I really don't want to trim my nails or stop using clear polish because they're my favorite physical thing about myself right now and are a great source of determination/strength for me.

He constantly provides for me and my mother, goes out to get things, helps whenever needed, etc. On the surface, he seems like a perfectly nice, likable guy.

But... he voted for Trump. He opposes gay rights, and laughs as misogynistic jokes. Before I came out to him as trans, I asked him what he thought of transgender people, and he said, in no uncertain terms, that we're all basically liars.
Just recently, on Christmas morning, he said he'd rather a person be a Satanist than a Muslim, coming dangerously close to racism. 

It's painful hearing him spout his idiotic ""views"", especially since he clearly cares about me, even after coming out to him, and to tell the truth, I want to care about him too. I want him to get out of the mire of prejudice he's buried himself in, but I'm noticing more and more that he doesn't seem to *want* to change.

The upside is that mother is both a great parent *and* a believer of equality for everyone. She supports me in full, and I couldn't be more grateful.

She has told me that she's been having issues with my dad as well, that he's not the person she thought he was.

Malki85,asktransgender,Am I getting too intense? + Rant,"Alright. I don't write much, mostly lurking and seeing other transgender opinion and issues but now I need some guidance about some stuff. 

I'm AMAB and came out to myself as transgender non binary at the beginning of november after years of questionning and a strong dysphoric experience last summer which gave me the push of learning more about myself. (This might change, but the non binary aspect, helped me a lot dealing with my dysphoria until now). I open up to lots of my close friends and the support has been amazing. I'm seeing a therapist and things has been going quite well. I came out to my parents and brother and this is where the shit start going. 

Last week, my brother talked to me about real estate publicity here about a family selling their house because the father become a mother. There was a big reaction from a Trans community here in Quebec and they remove it the same day. I told brother it's transphobic cause its a negative visibility and does not help nothing. And it's still something transgender ppl are struggling with their loved one and their family. I explain that to him and he don't agree cause a visibility, good or bad is a visibility so its ok. I was at job and had no energy to deal with that so I just change the subject and continie with my day. 

Then, he came to my place sunday evening as he was going to travel with friends and they can sleep at my place. We were listening to some music where a female vocalist do some death metal growl and he said: 'she must have an adam apple....' I shut up cause I don't want to out myself in front of his friend and they dont need to know. 

I'm very upset he had to do this 'very meaningless' stupid joke. I don't find it funny, especially since he does it in my living room, in the only place where I can be a bit more myself and experiment. I find that very disrespectful. So I decided I needed a break from him and decide to tell my mom about what happen and as a reminder to her that I don't accept that kind of behavior from anyone.
 
She told me I was thinking too much, that I was being too emotional, it was not ill intented, only a joke, that it was hard for them too, etc et. Which made me feel very bad.  

I told some friend who knew and they were all: wtf your brother so weird....

I'm starting to regret coming out to them and should just stop talking to them about this....and whatever happen will happen.

I'm prepared to remove not supportive family or friends from my life if its goes more serious than that. 

So what you wonderful people think about it? Am I being too intense? And how do you deal with transphobic jokes around you when you are with your family? 

Thanks again! Wish everyone a very nice day and remember that you are all loved ♥"
allie-the-cat,asktransgender,CMV: The Womens' March's focus on pussy hats and vaginas was not transphobic,"Ok, so I'm a trans woman. A lot of my friends for the past week have been posting articles and sharing tweets about how problematic and erasing the Womens' Marches were of trans women. Personally, though, I really don't see the issue. 

There was an explicit focus on pussies because of the comments that Trump made about grabbing women by the pussy. There is a focus on vaginas because the GOP is actively trying to make it as hard as possible to recieve proper health care for people who have vaginas. (They're also going to make it a hell of a lot harder for trans people to get the health care they need by repealing the ACA, but attacking trans people is not the explicit aim of that action). 

I guess I see those focuses in the marches as being directly in response to GOP and Trump actions, and so I don't see it as specifically transphobic. Thoughts? 

NB: I don't want to make this about race: I know the problems with the focus on ""peaceful"" demonstration is a function of white priviledge. That's a separate discussion from the one I want to have. "

amabtrans,asktransgender,"My dysphoria is going away, not sure what to do?","So my dysphoria goes up and down, but now it's going away slowly. I'm not sure what to do. I still have this problem where I don't know what I am. Here's what's been happening

* In June I finished school. I didn't have a job, so I was basically at home all day until September. When I was 12 I thought something was wrong with me, had no idea what, then went, and came back again when I was 14.These feelings came back, but nothing to do with gender.


* In September, I realized I might be trans. I had initial happiness, because I realized I might be actually a woman, that made me really happy. I didn't have any dysphoria however.


* In October I started reading a lot (probably too much) about gender dysphoria. I started reading peoples experiences about it. I was almost fascinated about it, but I still didn't have any dysphoric thoughts


* In November I started feeling like how people describing it. I started feeling really angry, and just felt like smashing stuff up. It almost felt like I discovered a part of me I was unaware of.

* December was like the worst month I've ever had. I felt suicidal, depressed, and just didn't give a shit about anything. Especially when I finished sixth form for Christmas. I knew I couldn't live like it. 

* Now it's January, everything is back to normal, and my dysphoria is back to how it was in October. I still have some feelings of wanting to be a girl, but it doesn't really bother me at all. When I'm alone I think how much life would be better if I were a girl, but when I'm actually outside in public I notice how it doesn't really bother me at all.


I'm trying to think what I'd rather live as. When I'm alone, I want to be seen as female to the world. When it actually comes to it, I get seen as male and it doesn't bother me at all.


If I were told that I would be reborn as what ever gender I'd want I would choose female. A few weeks ago I was so depressed I was born male, but now I don't really care

Anyone explain what might be going on? I am saving up to see a therapist, but I'm not sure if it's worth seeing one if this is going away anyway. I have noticed I've been out of the house a lot more, and I've spend more time with friends and doing more work, could it be related to that?

Thymetoft,asktransgender,Question about stopping finasteride,"So I've been taking 2 1/2 mg of finasteride daily for about a month.

I'm pretty pleased with what it's helped do, especially the muscle loss, but I think I'd like to stop taking it once I run out in about a month.

My question is about the permanence of the effects.

turingscurse,asktransgender,advice. where do i fit in in the gender spectrum.,"Hi everyone,
I'm not sure how to introduce myself(gender-wise), and that is why I'm posting this. I'm supposed to see a psychiatrist in two weeks and I wanted to be more clear about my problems as I can be. So here goes my story.

I was assigned male when I was born and I have had some problems here and there during my lifetime of 23 years. The first incident I recall was me trying on my sister's dress when I was around 5 or 6 years of age. I have continued doing that many times during my teenage years and after puberty.
I was a bit overweight (not obese because I have never exceeded 28 BMI) and chubby since I was like 8. So I had boobs since like 12. I have had problems with other kids (and people) because of them. Got harassed (lost count) and even got sexually assaulted (non penetrative) multiple times because of that. Puberty sort of intervened that because I was able to grow a full beard when I was 17. 


Going back to cross dressing, I sort of did that on and off from time to time. 
My sister and I have an age gap of around 7 years, And she's somewhat in the overweight-obese range. 
Her old bras fit me when I was around 15. Now, her 36Ds and 34DDs fit me perfectly. 
Crossdressing was exciting for me, especially during my pubescent years. But now it is not as exciting (wearing a bra as I'm typing this).


I have feared transgender and homosexual people all my life because I was raised by very conservative people. 
Also I went to a boys school for 13 years. Recently, after finishing my degree in engineering, I sort of went through a tough time and got back to cross dressing after 4-5 years. 

I never saw myself as an attractive boy in my life(never had a girlfriend, although I have fooled around with boys sometimes). 
But I do find myself attractive dressed as a girl. And I even created a dating profile using those pictures. 
I began hating my genitals, and started growing/painting my nails, waxing my facial hair, fix my eyebrows, and shave my body. Also did try to kill my testicles (but failed). My realization even made me healthier as I have lost weight and got my blood glucose levels back to normal after 8 years. 


My current plan is to get hormones ASAP but live as man for at least until I pay off my student loans.
Another thing, I am attracted to females. I saw my first porn when i was like 13. I always liked lesbian porn. But I stopped watching porn about 2 months ago. I always pleased myself imagining I am a woman. some people thought it was weird because I had lesbian POV porn in my computer. These were some time ago and I don't have that much sexual thoughts anymore. Now I am sort of disgusted when people point out attractive girls they see and describe what they find attractive/what they'd do to them. Because I now notice what they are wearing, and how cute it is if i wear that /appreciate their nails/makeup. :( 


What I want to know is where do I land in the gender spectrum. Am I a true transgender woman, or a perv with a cross dressing fetish. 

(i know this was a long post so to SUMMARIZE)

1. First began crossdressing when I was 5-6

2. Was used to/sometimes gets aroused by cross dressing

3. Always Imagined myself to be a woman to get off.

4. Was abused/made fun of because of the physical appearance as a child.

5. Was homo/transphobic some time ago out of fear and indoctrination.

6. recently had an epiphany which made positive changes to life.


Thanks for reading and for your input.

ORDae,asktransgender,A Question Regarding Name Changes and Bank Accounts,"Hello everyone! I have a question about getting a name change and how that relates to bank accounts. That said, I feel I need to give come backstory first.

My parents know I'm transgender but I'm worried how my dad will react when I change my name. Specifically my last name, which he likes very much. (I'm sure he wouldn't do anything radical and I live away at university, but I still like having his help with tuition.)

So my question is, when I get a name change, do I have to notify my bank of it? Will they change my name on my account, or can I request they leave it and I just open a new account with my new name and have access to both (the latter being what I'd ideally like to happen)?"

I've always looked at people who were in drag, or people who very obviously couldn't pass, and thought ""That's me. I'm not naturally feminine, I'd look and feel stupid. I can't do that.""  Maybe it's societies norms that scare me, I don't know.

2. I'm bi and I have a really amazing and supportive girlfriend that I love to death, but I've heard HRT can cause sexuality changes. I can really see a nice future with her since we're so loving and supportive of everything the other does, but obviously I don't want to lose her because I start HRT. Do you think it even has a chance of happening?

3. I know breast growth is really YMMV, but I read somewhere that it can correlate with breast growth of cis women in your family. Every woman in my family has HUGE ones. Long story short, how likely do you think it'd be that I can fit into any of my older shirts from my ""male"" days?

4. My dream job is to be a high school history teacher (yeah, its sad, I know). Should I start teaching before or after I've had some HRT done?

5. How much is SRS from a really good, reliable surgeon? Is it usually covered by insurance or will I be paying out of pocket?

[deleted],asktransgender,Question about stopping HRT in order to get blood work done.,"Dear Reddit,

Using a throwaway account just because I feel a bit ashamed.
I am sorry in advance if this is not the right sub or inappropriate in some ways.


**The situation:** It has been quite hard to be patient in the process of therapy and getting a referral to start hormone therapy. It feels like we are getting there, but for all I know it might be months away. Also, the financial aspect is becoming unsustainable (about 6x50$ every month). At some point in the past, I ordered Estrofem (2mg) to ease my mind and at least have feeling I control something here.
So far I have been patient. I don't want to make any silly move and feel medical supervision is absolutely the better road here. It has been increasingly more difficult though.

**EDIT: A bit more about the therapist:** Begin December he basically gave the green-light for HRT on condition I would out to certain people for certain reasons (acceptance from their part was not relevant; just the act of me outing). 
Also in our history he mentioned twice that my case was atypical. Reason is he mostly has had cases of people that were both younger (I am 32) and had years upon years of clear-cut gender-related issues. Now, I were only able to contextualize and apply the word transgender since about four months ago. I did have many, many issues before that and a history of cross-dressing, wearing make-up, *joking* about being a girl, etc. I am very confused about his motives here.

**Here is my the question:** If I were to start taking a low-dose Estrofem (2mg) and lo and behold, my therapist happens to refer me way sooner than I anticipated, is it likely to cause serious complications in the whole process? Or could I hypothetically stop taking pills a few days before (given the half-life) having my blood work done so my base levels can be accurately measured; and resume on an official regimen afterwards?

Anyone here with experience in that department?

I am mostly concerned about impeding the whole process. That would be the last thing I need. At the same time, I really don't function anymore at the moment. The waiting is devastating.


Thank you for any advise

Within the first week of starting i experienced reduced erections and a lower libido, i love the reduced erection part. It was soo annoying having to deal with it and the pain every morning as well as randomly when out and about. It seems like it's now a tulip going into blossom or a grower that shrinks down a lot more. 

There's definitely something going on in the chest region, about a week or two ago my nipples and the tissue underneath them started to hurt but only really when stimulated the areola is also slightly raised. They seemed to go through stages of puffiness and then harness.

 I seem to be crying easier and it's harder to just stop like i could before.

I also had my first laser hair removal session today, it hurt. It felt like a burning or more of a hot object being placed on my face not scoldering but hot and then a smell that seemed familiar, not like i had burned hair before but it seemed like a sulfur odor. 
I also tried out an epilator and omg it takes ages and hurts like hell, i only got 1/4 of a thigh  and a stomach done before i couldn't take it and ran out of time, but i will get there. 

Well for now that seems like it for the moment, but please share your experiences of the christmas break and anything exciting that's going on ;)

yemog,asktransgender,I am having regret after 10 years as a woman,"Hello everyone. I feel regret after living 10 years as a woman.

The beginning of my transition was fine. I thought I had solved all my problems. I was passing as a woman and loving life.

As I have grown into my thirties, I have been having health issues related to my hormones as well as anxiety and depression (both sometimes very severe). I have never felt worse in  my life actually. 

I am pretty sure I had a lot more zest for life when I was a boy. On top of that I had a sex drive and confidence to some degree. I am ""transgender"" and will always be, but I feel I would be less of a mess living in a man's body again and at least have a role of some sex.

This transition has not solved my gender issues-- it has only made them worse. I would prefer to be a man on testosterone therapy (I have no testes so that part is irreversible) than living this dull sexless /depressed/genderless life.

 I feel as if i am lying to the world, and I am tired of the strange stares I am getting (I am pretty sure I have bad days now where i do not ""pass""). The stress of it all is taking a toll on me. I handled everything better as a man, even though I was hiding my true feminine self. I would prefer to just be a bisexual, effeminate man that does not care about gender norms. fuck gender. it is a stupid social construct. I wish i could have come to this conclusion long ago.

I have no idea how to tell my family how I am feeling right now... They have been so supportive of  me and even fought for me. This transition has taken a toll on them. Reversing my transition (or at least what it would seem to be to them( would seem like a huge slap in the face to them).

What can I say? I need this nightmare to be over. How do I approach this. This is harder than ""coming out"" was all those years ago.

And what of testosterone therapy. Do you think it would solve my health/sexual issues? I long to feel pleasure and enthusiasm again. I feel being free of this gender trap i have created would allow it!

AnnieHatesMe,asktransgender,People who transitioned later (30+) how did you feel about transitioning when you were younger?,"Did you feel that you could deal with it when you were younger only to find that dysphoria got too bad to handle when you got older?

I just don't know if I would be happier living as a girl, despite my big desire of girl clothes, desire of being beautiful, having a female body etc...  What if I am romanticize everything? Is it really worth it despite not knowing for sure?

What if the depression wouldn't go away after transition? What if the problem is caused by low self esteem or wrong job choice? I am feeling I have too much to loose to make the tipping decisions to HRT. Still thinking....."

FourMillionBees,asktransgender,"Had a horrible time at the last trans support group meet up I went to, worried about going next time","For the past three months I've been going to the only nonbinary trans group here in my state (Theres a few trans women and trans men groups but yeah, only the one nonbinary one), and for the most part, its been great, I've never felt so accepted and confident in my gender.

That changed last time I went. There were two people there who were really stubborn, talked over everyone and said some honestly insulting and horrible stuff about other trans people. One of them made the most hideous comments about the trans women group thats run out of this gender clinic, and literally says ""I'm gonna get hate for this but I still don't like they/them as pronouns and YES i've seen the articles about it but I still struggle with it"" right after a number of us stated we used they/them.

Anyway, one of those people is a regular apparently, they were away when I started going, and have now come back to the country and started coming to the support group again. While I found the other person just, plain insulting, this person was really frustrating, again, cutting off a lot of us, not allowing anyone to speak, and just making some really condescending comments.

The whole time, myself and another member, (an older nonbinary trans woman), were the only ones sort of, arguing back with this person. At the end of the discussion, the person who technically leads the group, asked how it was for everyone, and I said what I thought, which was that I thought the group had been one sided, and that a lot of people didn't get the chance to speak, and the political topics chosen hit a raw nerve with a number of people.

Person got annoyed with me, and made comments along the lines of ""well i see this group as a Resource, and I want to get the most out of it. If I'm upset that's my problem you know. I don't want to feel like I'm being policed or being censored here.""

I'm still pissed off about this, and it turns out after speaking to some other members of the group, this person often does this, and they all felt upset and rubbed the wrong way by the whole meeting.

The next meeting is in a couple of weeks and some other people are considering not going because of this person and their friend, and sadly, I think I am to.

I don't know what to do, and I don't even know if what I did was right. Has anyone got any advice?

However, I don't feel like a magical spell or artifact is a very useful analogy for our transitions in the real world. I want her transition to come off as a process, not an instant transformation. That said, it also feels kind of lazy to portray her transition as HRT in an alchemist's flask.

She didn't bat an eye and has become one of my most ardent supporters, behind only my wife.

The thing is, she doesn't see me as any less of a woman for it. The other day I was digging around for clothes to get ready and kept looking over my holding garment and I started getting frustrated, so she told me to just go commando as that's what she does.

Here are some of my major clues FOR TRANS:

On the ""am I trans part 2"" YouTube video I identified w/ 5 of the 7 ""signs"" of gender dysphoria

- I've only been able to crossdress handful of times (all sexual, which has confused me)

- age 14-15, would pray to wake up a girl every night, pray for brain transplant machine, want aliens to abduct me and change me to girl, wishing I was put in witness protection so I could get a sex change disguise lol, curious about reincarnation

- always having had sexual fantasies as a girl

- took gender tests and got ""female"" a majority of the time

- fascination by gender bending themes

- majority of time choosing female avatars, including female names on some email accounts

- Seeing attractive girls, wanting to be w/ them and imagining being them at same time

- Maybe felt some jealousy of women 

- most dreams in past few years as female, feeling very happy in them, hoping to go back asleep to continue them. Also lucid dream to try to be female in them

- possibly having ""phantom breasts"", feel something missing in chest area at times



Against Trans:

- not really having dysphoria, at least body dysphoria i think

- enjoy lots of typical ""guy"" stuff

- not depressed/ in fact pretty happy"

superfastmode,asktransgender,Leaving home at 18...:(,"Ok so here it is:
I am 18 and about a week ago came to terms with myself being transgender, gender dysphoria hit me like a train and I was freaking out. I told my mom and she has been looking into counselors that I can talk to about this (while she doesn't agree with it she says she will support me in whatever I do). It is ALL i think about everyday. Its the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about when I go to sleep. If I don't start transitioning soon, or at least have a plan for transitioning I am going to freak out. I believe I will lose most, if not all my friends and family if I come out as trans, at the very least it will be shameful, awkward, and probably depress me even more than if I never did. I told my best friend I was gay and he doesn't even like it when I mention guys I'm into. So my question I guess is should I leave home? 
I see there are a few options:
1 Leave home randomly and never come back, try to support myself.

2 Come out to my dad and brother and pray they don't disown me or cut me off financially (he has said he will pay for my college) and probably be miserable for 4 years.

3 Get a sugar daddy to help me financially with transitioning(many have offered).

It would break my heart to leave everyone and everything I love, but it seems like the only way, and tbh there isn't much I like here, just my routine. I told my mom and I can tell she thinks it's really weird and it's super uncomfortable. 
I feel like I just can't stay here and its tearing me apart, I am almost certain I would be happier living somewhere else, I just don't know where. Should I even consider the sugar daddy angle? I feel like I can support myself but it would be nice to have someone as a safety net at least or someone to keep me company. Obviously I wouldn't do it unless I had a genuine connection to the guy, I feel like at that point it would just be a boyfriend... I graduate high school in 4 months.
Please help :(

zincoff,asktransgender,don't know why I feel this way,"Hi all. 

Long story short, I thought all these thoughts were due to my ocd. A year and a bit later, I decided that if I was worried about being in denial then I just needed to accept the possibility of being trans and see where to go from there. It's been pretty hard since. 


I've never felt dysphoria but as a feminine (kind of) gay man there are lots of instances when I was younger that could be read in a trans narrative. The 'indirect dysphoria' article could fit me. I don't love the masculine things about me, I like being seen as a 'pretty' guy and prefer non-gendered things generally. I hated having my shirt off when I was younger, but grew out of this in my teens. I'm sexually submissive. 


It's been difficult, but I've told my mum and it's been a grieving process (for me mainly) but I am supported. I've been researching transition and I know it is possible. I am lucky to at a young age have the resources and support to make a transition. While passing isn't the be-all-end-all, I am confident I will be able to. All my friends would accept me. In the scheme of things I am so blessed, and the 'barriers-to-entry' for me are low. 


I've been fascinated by the research I've done, but I still don't know if it's for me. I can't imagine myself having sex as a girl. I used to find straight porn hot, because in my head things just 'fit' better (less prep than anal basically) and the guys were hotter. Yet when I watch it now it just doesn't feel as right as gay porn. I feel so sad that I won't get to be a gay man. I really want to be a gay man (or want to want to be a gay man?) but I know that if I am trans then I can't be. I have this memory of being so jealous of this gay couple at a garden party I was at, and I feel so profoundly sad that I won't ever get to have something like that. I don't know if I want a relationship with a man as a straight woman. I've been having dreams about being a trans-woman and I just wake up thinking 'I want to be a man I want to be a man'. I watched this video today (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB8-n4YrWHQ) and just started crying because I felt so sad I'd never be like the gay guys in that video. I couldn't care less about being the girls (but is this just denial talking?) 


I have no interest in being muscular as a man, in fact I actually just want to be skinny and do lots of cardio. My body isn't at where I want to be right now and I feel quite lumpy. When I look at girls in bikinis I just don't know if that's what I want. The look of a beautiful friend's instagram post of her in a bikini (the girl who I think I'd like to look like) actually scared me. I feel like there'd be something seriously missing if I were to undergo SRS. I have horrible images in my head when I think about SRS. I've thought about what clothes I'd wear etc etc. but it all feels like something I have to do to escape my thoughts and I just don't feel excited at all? 


With regards to the 'magical button' question I don't think I'd press it. My life has been difficult, I've struggled with mental illness that I'm learning may be due to being trans. Yet I don't think I'd want to have been born a different way. I'm trying to accept that this doesn't mean anything, and that if I could have a happy life as a woman then transitioning is what I have to do. I just want my mind to be quiet and feel like transitioning is the only answer. I'm scared that doing anything else but transitioning means slipping deep into denial and unhappiness. 


I feel so lost and confused. My thoughts are all muddled. Did anyone have this much trouble letting go of their lives before transitioning?  


I know I have to see a therapist and that's what I'm doing next week. I just feel so alone in my own head.

The problem is, I am not at that point in life when I can say to myself: ""I have nothing to lose"". I have very much to lose, and I have a crush on a girl, I know I can get a decent life with her. But the question is... Is it just a phase or something I am just imagine, the desire of being a girl?

I know people here is saying ""its never a phase"", but I dont know yet...

I dont know if I have the strength to sail into this storm without a map showing me whats on the other end. Is it a island of happiness and warm hugs or a cold waterfall into some deeper ocean?

For years now, my parents have asked me if I were gay, because I like some feminine things, speak in an almost feminine way, and frequently play female characters only on video games, and they see that.

It's mostly been my mother who asks the questions. And I was horrifyingly taken aback when the other day she said that she had a dream about me being transgender.

comprensiva,asktransgender,"my problems with HRT (over 10 years, and post-op)","Hi everybody, I am a post-op MtF. I have been looking for transgendered forums in order to make sense of a very unpleasant situation regarding HRT. 

I had SRS with Dr. Meltzer and I am very pleased with the results. My biggest problems is with HRT, though. I have been on HRT for years and have tried different combinations and approaches. I have also consulted with several endocrinologists who gave me conflicting opinions on HRT. My hope is that someone here can help me find a sweet spot with HRT.  

Because I am post-op, I do not need antiandrogen but I do need estrogen. 15 days ago, I stopped taking estrogen all of a sudden and the changes I have seen in these 15 days are amazing. Without estrogen, my face looks less bloated and more attractive, my double chin is gone, I am starting to have a thigh gap again, my skin looks more radiant and thicker, my complexion is healthier (as opposed to the anemic complexion on HRT), my connetive tissue seems more elastic.My skin on HRT was too thin and the veins were showing. The cellulite and flabbiness have improved in 15 days. Keep in mind that while I was on HRT I was on diet and I exercised even twice a day, however, I didn't see any significant result. I stopped estrogen and bingo, I lost weight and water retention and cellulite.  The reason why I stopped HRT is because I was frustrated and depressed that no matter how hard I worked out and no matter how much I watched what I ate, I still had cottage cheese butt and huge (I mean HUGE hips which are unattractive). 

My question is: how can I find a sweet spot? Before you tell me to ask my doctor, I have already asked several doctors and they only confused me. I have to be my own doctor now.  Plus, there is a conflict of interests and I am a source of income for them. I go to their office and pay money to check my hormones and get refills, so, of course they are not gonna tell me to stop HRT and lose a client. One endocrinologist told me that my weight, bloating, flabbiness and cellulite were due to low estrogen... another one told me it was that I had still testosterone circulating in my blood, since I had just had SRS... too many conflicting opinions. I want to stop HRT but I am afraid I will lose that ""feminine halo"" that HRT gives to your face and makes you pass at a quick glance from a casual observer on the street. 

TLTR: stopped HRT and my body and face improved incredibly in 15 days. However, I am afraid to masculinize so I want to find a sweet spot. "
RisingTaide,asktransgender,"What's the best way to tell someone ""oh yeah btw I'm trans"" after establishing a recurring acquaintanceship with someone?","So here's my dilemma.

Some of the people I play magic with are pretty cool, and I really wanna fit in and be a part of that gaming community, but they were introduced to me and know me as a dude, but aren't quite friends enough with me for me to expect the mostly unconditional acceptance one would expect from close friends.

Does a tactful way exist to come out to people you know you're going to see regularly that arent ""friends""? I really want to express myself the way I identify but I also don't want to be informally and unofficially ""Excommunicated"" or something.

And yeah, I know if they reject me, they ""aren't worth it anyways,"" but it's really just not a situation I want to deal with every week if it happens, y'know?

vampirefeminist,asktransgender,Using both she and they pronouns? (Do I count as trans?),"So I've been thinking about using both ""she"" and ""they"" pronouns. I've seen some people do this. As a gender non-conforming afab person who dresses masculinish on most days (but not all) I feel using the ""femme-side-of-they"" ~area~ of the gender spectrum to resonate with me...if that makes sense? I don't experience much dysphoria; it's more I feel very comfortable in boys' clothes, short hair, and sports bras that flatten my already-small breasts. However I still feel very connected to the idea of being a queer woman and a lesbian. Hm, I'm not sure.

feelinqueer,asktransgender,I just got offered a referral letter from my gender therapist...,"So I had my first appointment with my gender therapist, she turns out to be amazing and I click with her within minutes of talking, we talk for a long while about what I want, what I'm scared about, what things are like in my life, etc.  By the end she tells me that I am so emotionally and mentally stable (this has always made me feel guilty because so many others are going through such a hard time with it all, not that I haven't had rough patches of crying all day or having mini anxiety attacks mostly before I came out but still) that although she doesn't always do this that if I wanted she would write a referral letter to go see a doctor to start HRT/in my case estrogen. The doctor has a ton of very happy trans patients as well, she said that the doctor recently told her that she estimates that about 2/3rd of all her patients are trans. Gives me a lot of confidence!

I was blown away, technically if I wanted I wouldn't need a referral letter to start because I could just go to an IC clinic, but even so I have never felt so empowered in my entire life! I told her that I am glad to know that she will give me a referral letter whenever, but that I want to take it a little bit slow and figure out how I want to do everything as far as timeline, and my other life responsibilities go.

The fact that I can start my transition medically whenever I want with a referral letter/an experienced therapists support means more to me than I can express in words... At this point I'm trying to resist starting right away because I want to do this right.

I know this isn't really a question, but I just really wanted to share my excitement with a community that has given me so much! Anyone's thoughts are also welcome as far as starting HRT sooner or waiting, etc."

transforlife84,asktransgender,Inside the head of my gender dysphoria.,"There's so many aspects that comes together for happiness, as a person that suffers from gender dysphoria it's can being easy to forget all other aspects of your life and simply focus on the one that hurts the most. Family and friends and human contact in general is what I believe is the biggest basis of happiness cause without that no other thing matters, not money, success or self love can make you happy with out human relationships. 

My life is great at the moment I have everything, I have a great family, I beautiful loving girlfriend, a child on the way,  a loving pet, nice house and a great job, I couldn't ask for a better life and I don't want to loss any of it but with one problems that could cause me to loose some or all of the above. I have gender dysphoria and it hurts really bad sometimes, I want my body to be feminine and it's just not, everything about being feminine makes me happy even the stuff girls probably hate and all I want to do in take steps in to becoming a version of myself that just seems more feminine and more me. 

I don't transition because from my previous try I lost everyone that was most important to me I felt like a lone solder on a mission to become me and slowly whipping out everyone and everything in my path. 

What I would love in a dream world is to slowly transition to become me and not loss the ones I love in the process but have them love me for the new me I'll express myself as and have them except me and treat me not different then before but the same while excepting and learning to love me for who I have grown to become.

At the suggestion of some folks, I got my endocrine levels checked.  Turns out, I'm way low on testosterone.  Like, in the low 200's, when the minimum range is about 300+ and up.


So what I'm wondering is, could my feelings be related to low T?  Did anyone who ever had MtF feelings ever try testosterone replacement therapy *first*, thinking that everything was just a hormone issue?


If so, how did it work out?


I'm sorry if the question is insensitive.  I just would like to know how the therapy might affect me emotionally and psychologically, once I start it.


Thanks.

amon_erin,asktransgender,Any guitar or bass players?,"So I've played guitar and bass for years, I'm bad at both, but I've found I have a problem since I started HRT. I've been using the same picks (Dunlop Tortex 0.73mm) for at least 10 years, but now I've found I can't hold onto them worth a darn when playing fast. So I thought trying some thicker ones would help, but nope.

 I'm attributing this to my new skin that is slightly less good at gripping things. I'm not sure how to fix this, but it makes it practically impossible to play fast because the pick eventually shifts and flies out of my hand. Anyone else have this problem and find a way to solve it?

I don't have a car, and haven't been able to find work in Kansas City for some time, so my mother and step-father offered to let me live with them and look for work in Dallas area. I'm hesitant to take up their offer because they've done nothing but harass me since I came out a month ago, but my only alternative is pretty much homelessness.

I had contacted an LGBT friendly attorney before all this about getting documents changed and was quoted $1200 for everything ($700 was their cut), but realized I can't afford this nor to file on my own in KS. I wanted to get a passport but don't see that as feasible either, and am worried about the incoming administration changing the ease of gender marker edits for Federal documents. My birth certificate is Texas, so I figured I was fucked on that regardless of where I live based on what I've read (such as top link on here).

Basically my questions are, do I have to do anything as far as establishing residency if I'm living with my parents rent and utility free? I have a valid KS license, Social Card, etc. Is it at all feasible still to get a gender marker change on a new passport with Trump now in office? I want to pursue a legal name change as well, and from what I can tell Texas is a bit easier than KS since they don't require publication. Would a TX driver's license have the possibility of getting a gender marker changed? I'm afraid even if I could get all this done that because I don't pass I won't be able to find work in Dallas area either, and am disconcerted about living with my bigoted parents.

feelinqueer,asktransgender,Should I be starting Estrogen asap? Or is there no harm in waiting?,"TL;DR: At 21 MtF will it hurt to wait 3-5 more months to start HRT if I want as many benefits as possible? Or will it not make much of a difference because I am old enough that I likely won't see much time sensitive changes? Below is context/rant for my situation if you want to understand my reasons.

So I'm 21 years old, MtF and I am in an unfortunate dilemma. I'm going to lay down some background for context.

I have a  pretty supportive family and about a month ago I told them that I believed that I was transgender and that I have been having these feelings for long time but I wanted to talk to a gender therapist to make myself feel more comfortable and figure out myself. It took a while to get the appointment and only just recently had it, in that gap of time after coming out I felt so much more free, and more willing to accept myself (more that I felt like I could actually do this instead of worrying I was too weak) so I gained the confidence and realization that I will never be happy without transitioning and that I need to transition no matter how hard it is and no matter the risks of losing loved ones. So I see my gender therapist, I have an amazing talk I ask her to challenge me and she does, we talk a lot about how I'm feeling, my concerns about transitioning, etc. By the end, I am more confident and determined than ever, she also offers me a referral letter to a doctor for HRT, I tell her that I'm not sure if I can accept that yet because I need to talk to my family and that I'm not sure if I am in a financial position to start.

I finally get to talk to my parents about my therapy visit several days after I have it. I tell them that I am very certain that I want to transition and that I do want to start HRT in the near future. This is when things get a little tricky... They don't freak out, but you can tell that they were not expecting it and were very frightened. They really are supportive and really will help me through all of this so I hate to say much negative about them, but they are not very well educated in many things to do with being trans and transitioning... They started talking about how HRT seemed a little too big of a deal to start this early in (even though I have been dealing with this for years, but it just happens that I recently accepted that I wanted to try to make it happen and coming out to them), they said that they were concerned I was making rushed decisions... They told me that they would support me if I wanted to start, but that they couldn't help financially (which is true we are a pretty poor family and I'm grateful that I am still able to live with them being 21 for financial reasons). They started saying that there are high risks and a lot of negative impacts of HRT, (again due to ignorance), sure there are health concerns, sure it's not like taking an advil, but unless I have completely missed something in my hours of research, there's nothing horribly dangerous about T blockers and estrogen... Some health concerns that just need to be supervised and for the patient to not be careless. I live in the US so I'm mostly thinking of Spiro, I suppose I'm not sure about which way I would get my estrogen, there's a chance that my insurance will cover me so I'd like to go with patches, but I wouldn't know until I talk to a doctor about it. My step-dad also brought up a time when I had a serious talk with him about some disturbing sexual fantasies I had (about 6 years ago, so I was 15 and they originated from being exposing myself to very dark porn habits at a very early age, not a good idea...) and that when I talked to him then I didn't indicate any signs of wanting to be a girl or feeling like one. He kept saying ""All the things you had described were all from a very male perspective, a VERY male perspective."" Which really upset me, like who fucking cares? How in anyway does that effect me as being trans and wanting to transition? It was a very disturbing and depressed time in my life in which I was addicted to disgusting and dark porn and guess what, a huge percentage of porn especially violent porn is from a males perspective... -_-

So with all of that said and done, they still said that they would support me, but that they thought it would be better to wait until after I finish this semester before deciding... That plus the fact that my biological dad is transphobic and provides my insurance, I am not sure if I will be able to afford HRT until after the semester anyway because after I would be able to work more.

So here is my actual question, I am 21 and have some relatively feminine features considering and still don't have a lot of facial hair or body hair. If I want the possibility of hip growth, and I want to get as much benefits from HRT as possible will it hurt to wait 3-5 more months to start? Or will it not likely matter much? I could push the issue of starting now, but it would add a lot of extra stress and difficulty to my life, but if I started in 3-5 months it would be a lot easier... I'm trying to figure out if it's worth it to push for starting now or not?"

Throway111123,asktransgender,But what if I DO become a misogynist?!? I'm so worried,"this question has been bugging me for the longest time now. So, so long. It's been holding me back from touching transitioning since like... foreveer. I think about T, blockers or practically anything and then:

""What if im one them that becomes a misogynist?!??""
and when I think that I instantly cower away.

It's hard to explain this situation, but i'll try. When I was an uninformed person I used to hang out with the.. erm.. ""I hate men so much"" types? I think that's how they're classified. So they would go on and on about cis men but especially trans men and how they chug male privilege by the bottle once they transition and they're  misogynists and traitors and despite leaving them long ago I still feel that ideology creeping up on me and it drives me up the wall. I didn't understand how the moment a trans guy started transitioning he grows a misogynist bone but I didn't dare say anything. I'm very confused and puzzled how to go about this and what I should do. I've heard it  actually happening before and i'm so scared that might be me that I think I wont transition at all and try and forget about this trans thing, I hope.  Context or advice from anyone would be appreciated. I may repost this on FTM as well to see what advice the folks there have as well, thank you all for reading all this, even if it didn't make much sense.

throwaway013012017,asktransgender,Estradiol -&gt; oxytocin -&gt; I fell in love - Did this really happen?,"Last month, following my three month check-in, my endocrinologist doubled my estadiol.  The effects, particularly on my emotions, were noticeable almost immediately.  

Soon after, I realized that I was in love with my best friend, who I have known well for 5+ years.  He is the first man I ever fell in love with.  I remember it feeling as if I had consumed a magic potion.  I was head-over-heels and the feelings of longing were so intense, they literally brought me to tears on several occasions.

A few days later, I told him.  To my complete shock, he also had feelings for me!!!  It was one of the happiest moments of my life.  We have been together for about a month and it has been wonderful.  

At the time, I assumed that I must have had feelings for a long time, and had only recently discovered them.  Then, I started reading about oxytocin, the ""love hormone.""  This hormone is released following intercourse and also after child birth.  It is thought to cement bonding either between romantic partners or for a mother and child.

[From Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin) ""For women, a single dose of estradiol has been found to be sufficient to increase circulating oxytocin concentrations.""

So... is it plausible that my feelings of love are largely a product of the hormones?  If so, does this have any implications? (i.e. are the feelings more likely to go away?)

It's very hard for me to believe that this could have happened.  It sounds like something from a cartoon.  But the timing is so exact.  I'm not sure how to feel about it.

Thoughts?"
akemi327,asktransgender,Problem with appearances [vent],"Dumb weird feels vent, but here goes

Everyone says I look like a pretty girl, and most of the time, I generally accept this. I even see it sometimes. But then a lot of the time, I hyperanalyze every little bit of my face until it seems weird, androgynous, non-passing, etc. Almost like that feeling when you repeat a word so many times the word feels like jibberish. I'll take pictures at the worst angles possible to confirm I'm a hon, and there's absolutely no point.

This seems quite par for the course for trans women. But for me, it also applies to other women too. I'll do this to every cis woman I see until they look androgynous, awkward, non-passing. It's like through all of the family abuse (some of it looks based) and self doubt stemming from that abuse, I've basically lost my ability to uncritically appreciate feminine beauty, wherever it is. My family was always really awful about judging women on appearance and nothing more, and that got dialed to 11 after I came out.

I was wondering if anyone has coped with these feelings before and found a way to stop it? I feel like it is harming my quality of life, plus it gets in the way of my attraction to women (I'm bi)."
phrygiansaz,asktransgender,"Has anyone come out to a parent(s) with a personality disorder? (cw- abuse, mental illness)","Hi :)

I'm trying to navigate telling my parents about my name change. Here's the problem...my mother possibly has BPD or NPD tendencies and abused me emotionally throughout my childhood (with my father enabling her), forcing me to move out. This was before coming out as queer, and they know nothing about my trans identity as of now.

It's been two years since I moved out and although we generally stick to safe topics when talking in person, I often get abusive messages when I haven't done something she wanted. It's really hard to heal psychologically when the abuse never stops.

I think when I tell them about wanting to change my name my parents are going to say I jumped on the trans ""bandwagon"" because of my SO and I'm changing my name purely to spite them, and it might incite more serious abuse or even violence. This occurred when I moved out and when I told them I was seeing a psych and when I told them I was still with my partner (who they hate). Those times were the worst in my life...they even tried to get my welfare payment cancelled when I moved out so I would move back in with them, which was super scary.

So I'm thinking considering that my mother has taken no steps to improving our relationship (I've been working at it for two years) and the reality that my family will never accept me as who I am (queer and nb as fuck) then the best way forward (and least painful way) is to go non-contact with my entire family. But I am scared shitless about this and want to know if anyone else has tried coming out to parents with a history of abuse? Or did you just let them find out for themselves?

tl;dr my parents are abusive and I don't know how to tell them about my name change and it is making me consider going non-contact, anyone experienced anything similar?"

Presumably the milk duct would need to be developed to facilitate this - I also know there's often some changes to the nipple shape and size (as well as changes in the breasts themselves) associated with lactation in cis women, particularly when that occurs soon after the onset of puberty, i.e., pregnancy at 15-16 yo.

I could probably ignore it. If I go off reddit, forced myself to go completely offline for a couple of days my dysphoria would probably be not as bad.

""I don't know if its any consolation, but I used to feel the same way in elementary school, really wanting to be white.
But now I'm very much the opposite and proud of my skin color. I think being in an environment where there are some people like you is something a lot of people take for granted, if they're white and grow up in an area with mostly/all white people, especially since thats also reinforced in movies, people in power, etc. I don't think every minority feels this way, but certainly the vast majority I've talked to have struggled with it to some degree and everyone has had their own path to being proud of who they are, and some are still trying to find that.
I think being open to conversations about it is important, and being in a diverse area certainly helps too, but ultimately there's only so much you can do beyond being loving and supporting parents, and its his journey to make.""

Essentially I think the message, that being a minority and wishing you were the majority, happens. I see a lot of cis envy, hell I have cis envy. But I'm also proud. Proud to be trans, and not only trans but a woman as well. Proud to be a minority. 

Regardless I thought this might be a sentiment that might help all you wonderful people here to rember that it can be so extremely difficult being trans, but it doesn't mean we should be ashamed of it. I can still say I wish it didn't happen, or that I wish I was cis (because it would be just as harmful to ignore those feelings), or even that I hate being trans. At the end of the day though I have pride in it as well."

I don't want to be that girl who wears a patch, it is just uncomfortable to me. But what i'm really concerned with is my dosage, the patch delivers 0.1mgs of estrogen to me a day. 0.1 mgs. Are you kiddding me!? EVERY single trans person I have ever heard of takes at LEAST 1mg of estrogen a day, even at the beginning. I know i just started and i get it, but 0.1 mgs of Estrogen a day is WAY too low, I did not wait my whole life to be punked by some doctor, when there are many others i'm sure can prescribe me higher dosages for better results. ALSO he puts me on birth control pills. wtf? This doctor does not seem to know what he is doing, but he claims to be such a proffessional with all these trans patients. I know birth control can block your testosterone, at least partially, but why does everything this doctor is prescribing me just seem so wrong?

xqkz,asktransgender,Frank Discussion about the mental illness aspects of being transgender,"So I'm here, a FTM trans guy, and lately I've been realizing how much my dysphoria is a mental illness and how it affects me similarly to my other MI's. It makes me realize how upset I get when some people say you don't have to have dysphoria to be trans, because sure that's your experience and everything, but it doesn't make sense to me to claim an illness as a lifestyle. It is so hard sometimes to think about having been born a female and having to live with the fact that I'll never have a Y chromosome. I respect non binary people in the way that their mental illness is worse. It seems to be two conflicting identities in the head when one identifies as genderfluid or bigender. It really isn't normal or trendy to have a mental illness caused by a hormone imbalance or whatever, but after gay marriage was legalized everybody had to jump on a new bandwagon. I just don't know why we're pushing for people to accept our mental illnesses as normal. We're not normal. We're abnormal and that's okay. I just feel as though the mainstream trans rhetoric says you have to believe certain ideas in order to not be called transphobic or a TERF, but nobody is ever open for discussion. Am I alone in feeling this way? I sure feel like it. "

zauraz,asktransgender,The Question of 'Why?',"Realizing the potential that I am transgender was at first a relief and something that excited me. For years I had found myself fantasizing about being a girl.

Then came weeks of depression, anxiety, uncertainty. The pressure of it seemed to be crushing me. I came out in a half assed manner dodging a clear answer and got therapy.

Therapy did nothing but ease the troubles. No progress made me start to ask myself why I did this? What did I want? Was it what I really wanted?

I lost sight of the goal. Of myself. Of what I wanted.

More anxiety, constant questioning. Unhealthy obsession. Desperate search for proof to prove it. Started trying to approach my self-hatred towards body, maybe it was dysphoria? How can I be sure that anything pointing towards me being trans actually is because I am trans?

I keep pushing on. I start searching gender therapy taking up months. Plans for the future put on-hold. Once more anxiety. Feeling of despair and melancholy seeing people with an appearance that I would want. Realizing that such a body and gender was never meant for me. Desire for turns into alienation.

Mind making me feel like being a girl is too far off. Too weird. Can't understand how it is to be girl as I have never been it. Will always be different. Yet again why do I feel like this now?

Too many questions. No answers. No real way forward. Lost...

Sorry for writing this in such a weird way but I don't know how to present my feelings. I am tired of the confusion. Conflicting thoughts. Internal attempts to talk myself out of both sides. I don't know what to do. This made me consider suicide more serious than ever a few months back. "
Hanaweber,asktransgender,I need a convo,"Ok so I'm like a 29 year old man married with three kids. I got bills and work and family obligations/responsibilities.

Kinda like every year at first but now it's every other month. I want to transition, HRT, but should i? I know it's something I have to decide but how can I destroy what I have because of all these feelings. Will I be able to ignore them? Won't playing a man like I've been doing just be enuff?"

themizukitty,asktransgender,[MtF posting but kinda for everyone] Anyone have nightmares? (CW maybe?),"I don't usually remember my dreams, but this one made me burst into tears immediately. 
I also wouldn't normally put something like this out there, but I kinda need to get this out...

Since this is a dream, a lot of the details are kinda hazy. Now I've never had a dream where I've been a cis girl, that I can recall. Any time I'm in a dream, it's always been how I look in my current state. I'm nearly 6 months on HRT, and I'm not close to passing, just as a preface. 

I don't exactly remember how it go to that point, but I'm in a strange 1 story version of my parents house (currently living there, but moving out soon), and I'm running from room to room trying to get away from my parents and my older sister. No matter what I try, I can't seem to get into a room where I can at the very least be alone. Each time I go into a room, one of my family members is there. They deadname me and say things like ""You'll never be a girl."" or just saying my deadname over and over again. I'm desperately trying to find a place to hide, be alone, and just cry, but no matter how hard I try I just can't get away and I'm holding back the tears as hard as I can. I manage to get to the washroom which is small, so no one should be in there. I open the door, and my fiancee (the most supportive person in the world to me) is doing her makeup, looks at me and says in my sister's voice ""Your name is -deadname-, not -preferred name-"". I kick her away from me and keep running. Presumably I never get away because I must have made myself so depressed that I woke up not long after that and immediately started crying.

Now my parents aren't completely transphobic, when I came out to them a year and a half ago they didn't kick me out, but they do deadname me and use male pronouns around me. My dad and my older sister have both tried using my preferred name, but it sounds like complete and utter contempt when they say it or like they're playing along with a childish game.

What scares me the most about this nightmare is that no one has ever said ""You'll never be a real girl"" to me, or anything like that, and I'm worried that somewhere in my mind  don't believe that I'm a girl. Maybe I was in a really dark place immediately following this nightmare, but I tried saying ""I'm a girl"" a whole bunch in between sobs, and it just didn't feel right. 

I'm scared and emotionally fragile asktg. Help."
lyaa55,asktransgender,Should I get SRS while I can?,"I'm thinking the answer is probably not to rush it, but here's a consideration:

I'm at school and my student health insurance apparently covers SRS.

I started hormones 4 months ago.  I've had a lot of life improvements since then but am still in a stage of petrified disbelief (I kind of had a holy shit i'm trans moment ~7 months ago and went on hormones rather quickly after) and so am trying to take things slow-ish, go at my own pace, etc.

In the meantime, I'm living pretty most-of-the-time as a girl, even though I don't pass at all, and don't have a high femme style, so it's basically just me telling people.

I don't have terrible genital dysphoria, just sometimes when I'm thinking about or having sex I get frustrated that my parts are what they are.  This doesn't halt enjoyment for me, but kinda does make me aware that things are less than ideal.

So SRS would be something that would be far far far off my radar, but given that I have only about 5-6 months left during which it may be covered by insurance...
Obviously I won't base the decision of responses, but as I think about it a bit, what do people think?  Would I regret it if I missed this opportunity and decide srs is more important as I try to go full time and possibly stealth?"

Imyoursecretkeeper,asktransgender,Hi! I have a dilemma.,"Hey there!

New here with this account at least. My name has morphed over the years and I have finally settled on one but I'll be going by Cat. I was here a few years ago contemplating getting on HRT and now go figure, I'm on HRT! I'm MTF, 22, and way too skinny. Seriously my doctor is telling me she won't increase my dosage again until I gain weight. 

Anyway, to my dilemma! In about 5.5 months a good friend of mine is getting married and I'm going to be in the wedding! The dilemma is that I just hit 9 months on HRT and am hoping to switch to injections in two weeks so by the time the wedding comes around I'll be at almost 14 months and around 5 months injections if things go well. 

So going by all that, I am having serious trouble deciding how I should attend the wedding, whether as male or female. He needs to know in the next week or two so I can be listed in the pamphlet thing under the correct name for how I am presenting. I just don't know if I'll be ready, how I'll look, if my boobs will show through the tux (they are already a 34B), how far along my electrolysis will be, and how goo my voice will be by then.

I'm trying to get in that head space of the future me but I am not succeeding. So on to my ultimate question for you lovely folks here. How would you all go about approaching this situation? 

Oh, also, if there is any info you need to ask that I haven't given I will provide, I just seriously need help deciding whether to go as me or old me."

HelloRainClouds,asktransgender,Is it normal to be envious of other girls like I do?,"This is bit confusing to explain, I'm terrible with words but if I see someone I'm attracted to, it tears me up inside, and I get anxious. I get hot flashes, I feel nauseated, and like my heart is being ripped out of my chest.

These are also the type of girls I want to be, especially if they have matching personality, like girly, care-free or happy-go-lucky, talking about memories/adventures with their friends, while planning new ones. That also bothers me because I don't have that. I never had friends growing up, never had close friends, or BFF.

I think I'm bothered to an extreme because I'm jealous of how beautiful they are, and wish I could be beautiful.  That being said, I know beauty is different for everyone and everyone is beautiful to someone. I'm talking for me personally, if that makes sense.
I'm also envious that they are female, can express themselves the way I want to, but can't because I'm physically male and it would come across as weird or creepy, if that makes sense, like wearing femme clothing (spelling?), and being able to be girly, be yourself, etc.

It's like I see myself in these girls.
I've been robbed of my life, if that makes sense?
With me, everything is offset, which is a totally different thing/story.

My doctor seems to think it's going just fine and everything is looking good. But I'm really not sure. But I'm trying to balance these concerns with the fact that this is a slow, subtle process and I'm probably the worst person to judge my progress to begin with.

ChanelNumberOne,asktransgender,Anyone use the cover of being a gay male or lesbian female to cover your transition in a workplace?,"I also want to edit this post and say that I understand many transitioning people are straight so this would not be as big of a deal and I understand that.

 So just to put some info to this I'm definitely not saying being gay or lesbian is easy in the workplace and I have a family member who himself is not openly out at his workplace even though he has been in a relationship with a man for ten years.

At my personal workplace I feel like the company pushes really hard for diversity and inclusion and has lots of great inclusive pushes and insurance. My company is amazing but that does not mean the people I work with are. Although all of them or at least most of them are very accepting of homosexuals or at least try to be, many are openly against trans people. Just today I heard someone say if they will never consider Chelsea Manning a woman. ""He will always be a he to me"". (Not saying I think she deserves to get out of jail but at least put in a jail of the correct gender)

Since I openly got married to a woman not long ago I can't pass my changes off as me becoming what a lot of these people would consider a ""traditional gay male"". I'm really happy I have a supportive wife and having a wife may be cover enough lol but I'm curious if others have used being gay or lesbian as a cover. 

I also want to make clear that I feel like this might be exploitive and not morally okay so forgive me.

I've been questioning for 3 months now. Initially when I discovered about transgender things I had an initial relief that I (thought) I was a girl. It was almost like ""yay, now I can wear women's clothes"". 



I've always noticed how different men's and women's clothes are since around age 12. How girls had the option between trousers and skirts, and that bothered me a bit. I would of loved to wear them, but it never could. When I was at the year 11 prom last year the whole time I was there is how the girls could wear them dresses, makeup and everything, and us guys just wore boring suits. But I was a guy, it's what I had to wear and it didn't really bother me. 


But as time moved on after that, I finished school at the end of June and went back in September. I fell out with friends, and spend nearly all of the summer holidays at home. 


When I was 9,  I knew something was up with me. My personality, it was very different from others . I forgot about it until I was 12, and started having the same thoughts again. I looked into it on the Internet, and thought I might of had ADHD, as I seemed very like that. However, I never told anyone about it because I feared no one would take me seriously. But then I made friends, and completely pushed that out until I was 16, when I fell out of those friends. I started having these feelings that something was up with me. I looked into it a lot, I had some symptoms of several things, however I never quite fit into any of them. 


I then discovered gender dysphoria. I looked up about it, and I couldn't quite relate to it, but for some reason I could really imagine what it would be like to have it. But what I imagined is what I'm living now. It's almost like I've tricked my mind into having it, and I'm actually fine. 


I have crossdressed in private for years, since I was 6 (when I had the chance to) but then when I was 13 I started again whenever I had the chance to because women's clothes felt so much better than others. 





I've gone from being really happy to being trans, to depressed, then suicidal, and to now with not bothered by it in the space of 3 months. I was absolutely fine with being male 4 months ago, but now I'm not. 



I've been calling these thoughts I've had as ""dysphoria"", but weather they are or not could be debatable. When I'm alone I cannot stand being male, but when I'm out in public I don't really care what I am as I'm distracted. I feel like I need to start HRT, weather that means doing it legitimately or by DIYing it as it feels like time is running out as to how effective it can be. 




I hardly ever experiment, I just don't feel like doing it. I don't crossdress in private anymore, nor do I try to look more feminine. I'm growing my hair out (past cut was 7 months ago) but I'm considering getting it cut short again. 





I don't know if I'm MTF, NB, crossdresser, non binary, or just a cis guy that is a bit feminine. and it just annoys the hell out of me. 



A month or so ago I was more like ""I wish I was more trans, then I could be a girl"" but now like ""I don't care what I am"". Can anyone relate to me or tell me whats going on? I can't see a therapist for months yet, my family won't be supportive. "

My parents on the other hand want to use my deadname, which I bregrudingly accept though dislike it. This is because they want me to choose a name and be sure of it before they make the effort to change from one thing to another.  I really like lily.

[deleted],asktransgender,"Why can't people see the difference, between how Christians are treated, and how trans people are treated?","So I've heard a lot of talk from people on the right saying that it's expected to see a push back from the right, because their rights have previously been targeted (Christians). I'm wondering why they can't see the difference in how we're treated. 

For example.

I can't fire a Christian for them being Christian. A Christian can fire me for being trans. And I can't refuse service to someone for being Christian. While a Christian can refuse to serve me for being trans. 

Trans people are fighting for the right to not be discriminated against, Christians are fighting to preserve the right to discriminate against Trans people. 

They also seem to be ignoring the fact that Christians are a majority in large parts of the country, where as, excluding transspaces, trans people are the majority no where. It's not reasonable to think of a Christian being denied services for being Christian all throughout their local area. It is reasonable to expect in certain areas trans people will be denied service throughout their local area. Couldn't we have made the same argument about Jim Crow?

AnAltForConfusion,asktransgender,Am I trans? A ramble from one of life's dissatisfied customers.,"I’m going to preface this with a somewhat neurotic apology.  This is long, rambly, and it might not be worth your time.  If I’m wrong, this might even be offensive, and regardless of what people say, I know I need to talk to a therapist, as hard as it is to find one.

I’ve been having a hard time with identity lately.  For some reason, I can’t stop thinking that I might be transgendered.  I know why I started: It feels more natural to write female characters, a lot of my writing seems to suggest something subconscious (my personal favorite and most loved character is a woman who pretends to be a man until she can’t take it anymore, comes out, and winds up figuring out what she wants out of life; an older character was a painfully serious and moral man with a female ghost that haunted him and pointed out his insecurities), I don’t like my body very much (For as long as I can remember I’ve tried to cover basically every inch of skin I have besides my arms, my head, and my feet; I wear shirts and cover my legs with a towel at the beach; etc), I sometimes really want to wear women’s clothes, and I sometimes fantasize about having the ability to just transform into a woman.  They have this button test, where you think about pressing a button that instantly transforms you into a woman, and I know I’d do it, but I’m hesitant about the real analogue.  I don’t think I feel very dysphoric, and I worry that I’d become dysphoric with a female body and regret it forever.  I don’t want to ruin my life.  I’m also scared of everything I could lose.  I have a hard time connecting with new people, and I fear I’d lose my parents if I transitioned, or lose my friends due to judgment if I started then detransitioned.  Plus, if possible, I should really just hold onto that cis male privilege.  Sexism is horrible, and transmisogyny is even scarier.  Also, the whole process is expensive and medically risky.  I think I’m fine as [removed], 19 year old straight man.  Still, I keep getting pulled back to the same articles, the same subreddits, the same thoughts.  I even took the same quizzes, but I’ve mostly abandoned those.

I think the biggest problem is I don’t trust myself.  At all.  I feel like I’m trying to sell myself on being transgender.  I want some struggle, some adventure.  Some deep desire to be unique and different and troubled.  I’m scared there might be some sexual feelings involved too.  Through my teenage years I’d thought about it intermittently, squeezing my chest together to look like breasts, feeling up my butt, pulling up my boxers too look like panties in the bathroom.  But sometimes, I think I might have done those things because I was fantasizing about how they’d feel on a woman.  That’s one thing I’m certain of: I’m attracted to women.  There is absolutely no doubt about that.  Even when I doubt my sexuality now, it’s questioning if I might be slightly interested in men (a little romantically, not at all sexually, I’ve concluded), but never do I doubt how much I like women, romantically and sexually.

I got sidetracked.  Sexual feelings.  I fantasize about sex with my characters too.  I don’t actually feel guilty about this, although I’m far too ashamed to admit it to any of the people I write with.  I do wonder if it’s healthy sometimes.  I wonder if it stems from some desire for control.  I’m really into being sexually dominant (not violent, aside from spanking or something, but never anything hurtful.  I’m a lot of things, but I think I’ve got boatloads of empathy, and I could never do anything like that to someone).  Maybe that’s because I’ve never had any sort of intimacy.  I’ve never kissed anyone, or held hands, much less had sex.

I think I’m losing my train of thought again.  I have some things in favor of the whole trans theory and feelings and what not.  In fact, I’m going to make a sort of pro and cons list if you will.

Pro:

* I feel very connected to my female characters, and I instinctively think that I don’t want to write male characters.  It just seems… weird.  For some reason.

* I basically always play video games as female characters.  Don’t know why, but I’m pretty confident it isn’t the stupid “so I can stare at their ass” reason.

* I want to wear women’s clothes and have women’s haircuts.  I don’t want people to feel like they can connect to me with macho stuff like gruff handshakes or casual sexism or sports or any of that nonsense.  I want to be able to cry in public without feeling like I’ll be ostracized for it.  I want to not feel like I’m creepy and that my attention is part of a cruel male gaze that makes women uncomfortable.

* Sometimes, I relate to my characters more than whoever they’re having sex with in my fantasies.  I’ve also enjoyed POV porn where it takes the women’s perspective, but it’s hard to put myself in her shoes so to speak.  I want to, but I just don’t have a vagina, and it doesn’t line up with my own, uh, ministrations.

* More importantly, when I’m stressed, I’ve sometimes fantasized about being my characters, being spooned or spooning their partner, and it calms me.  I don’t know if it’s the intimacy, or the feminine role, I just feel better.

* Me and the people I write with, who I consider friends, have joked about how I’m a lot like my main character, [removed name], and the thought has made me feel good.

* Often, when writing, I’ll mimic the facial expressions I’m imagining my characters having.

* Similarly, with the sexual fantasies, sometimes I’ll wind up positioning myself, moving, and making expressions in line with what I expect the woman would do.

* I would press the button.

* I told my mom I was considering it, and when she told me I was confused, it made me feel bad.  I thought she was probably right, and she explained her reasoning fairly well (this isn’t the first time I’ve gotten fixated about my identity) but it might mean something that her input made me feel bad.

* When I visualize myself with a female body, I don’t feel bad about it.

* I hate my body hair.  I pull it out sometimes.  I always shave my face, and had to will myself not to when I tried to grow a beard once.  More recently, as these thought have become more recurring, I shaved my legs and the hair on my stomach and chest, and I liked it.  I would shave my butt and my armpits if it didn’t itch so much, and if I thought it was safe.

* I don’t like my kind of boxy jaw.

* I don’t like my thick legs and big knees.  I don’t like the feeling of my Adam’s apple.

* I’ve felt dissatisfied with my life for a long time.

* I viscerally hate being called Daniel by anyone but my immediate family, but I’m comfortable being called Dan.  Honestly, I actually usually just go with whatever anyone calls me and get comfortable with it.  My best friend calls me Big D, and now it feels weird if he calls me anything different.

* I resent whenever my dad tells me to be a man or something along those lines.

* A friend compared my look to Marceline (female character from a show we watch) and that felt good.  I’ve always sympathized with her, and connected with her songs.

* I tend to connect more with female characters than male characters, excluding some crotchety favorites like Nick Miller and Ron Swanson.  One “male” character I connected with deeply, Marco Diaz from Star vs the Forces of Evil, turned out to have a whole giant theory about how they might be trans based on a lot of supporting evidence.  I think that turned me onto this whole thing recently too.

* I had a talk with some of my cis friends and they said they never even really considered it.  They were a man/woman and they wouldn’t change that, even considering relative perks.  Me on the other hand, I wasn’t so sure.

* I hate public bathrooms, but I liked my dorms Co-Ed bathroom.  That might just be because they’re disgusting though.

* I fucking love musicals and Disney movies and cooking and rom coms.  I know that’s a stupid reason, and that men like feminine things too, but there it is.

* I wish I didn’t have such a high sex drive.  I wish I didn’t get spontaneous erections or morning wood.  I hate associating with a gender that is responsible for so much rape and being on that side of the prevalent rape culture.

* I hate my own anger, and for some reason I feel like less testosterone would mean I would be less angry.

* I’ve never really had role models.  Even as a kid I’d say things like “I’m my own role model”

* I like tucking in my genitals when I sit in a shower where I can.

* I hate mirrors.  I’ve been staring at them a lot lately because of this whole thing, but I generally don’t like seeing my face.  I consider myself pretty ugly, even with outside validation.

* I’ve never really felt ‘castration anxiety’.  I don’t really like the idea of never being able to have sex, enjoy that intimacy with a future loved one, or masturbate, and I obviously don’t like the idea of bleeding out, but it just… doesn’t make me feel anxious.

Con:

* I told my best friend I wanted to be referred to by them/they pronouns, and I felt like I was having a panic attack immediately after saying it.  Shortly afterward, I asked him to forget it and pretend I didn’t say anything, even though he was super supportive.  I think I might have been anxious that I was being too vulnerable (even though I trust him more than anyone and have opened up to him more than anyone in my life) and trying to steal the trans narrative and struggle to cope with my own depression and identity issues.

* Above: I feel guilty and afraid that I’m a bad person, trying to steal the whole trans narrative to feel unique.

* I don’t hate my body.  Generally I have a modest to loathing impression of myself, but I have complimented my own appearance.  I’ve been positive about my penis (length and girth or whatever) and my muscles, and especially my deep voice (which I’ve likened a little excessively to Frank Sinatra).

* When I do hate my body, it isn’t just the gender related stuff.  I hate my posture, and I hate how barrel chested I look.  I sometimes feel like I’m fat even though I’m obviously skinny.  I hate my big, crooked nose and my wide, thin, crooked smile.  I hate how thin my hair is.  I hate seeing pictures of myself from any angle besides head on.

* I’ve naturally reacted to being called “she” or being asked my gender by saying “I’m a man” or something to that effect.  I’ve felt comfortable being called a Grandpa.

* I didn’t have any intuitive idea of what a vagina looked like.  Hell, I thought it just looked like an anus in the front until I saw one on the internet.

* I’ve been disgusted by the thought of a vagina.  Not even one on me, just the thought of a vagina.  I’m not sure why.

* I’m comfortable with a male sexual role.  Thrusting and what not.

* I’ve felt comfortable being [removed name] my whole goddamn life.  That’s me.  I’m a dude I think.  This whole debacle has me confused, but I wasn’t confused before.

* Before I got stuck on this whole thing, I didn’t give a hoot about gender.  I would talk about how gender roles were bullshit, and philosophize with my best friend about whether progress towards equality and transgender identities were at odds with each other.  Like they were validating stereotyping.  In retrospect, I was being an idiot and hadn’t exposed myself to enough people’s stories to actually understand.

* Transitioning is dangerous.  Physically, emotionally, socially.

* What if I regret it?  What if I was never feeling dysphoria, and then my stupid actions make me feel it?  Isn’t my life hard enough as it is?

* I love showering.  If I really felt dysphoric and wasn’t just making this up, shouldn’t I have not loved sitting around with my own naked body?

* I’ve put stuff under my shirt, trying to mimic breasts, but it just looks weird.  That might be because it looked lumpy and not real, or it might be because it looked too big, or maybe that was an inkling of real dysphoria.  I have no idea.

* I don’t trust my own judgment or my own feelings.

That last one deserves some explaining:

I’ve been depressed and suffered from social anxiety for a long, long time.  Through this time, I’ve had a lot of time alone, and I tend to over analyze and obsess over things.  I sell myself on feeling things, and then I doubt myself and wind up questioning all over again.  I’ve done this with crushes (eventually collapses), with career plans (ongoing), with Myer Briggs types (ending only when I decided it doesn’t matter and those boxes weren’t really meaningful to me), with mental illness (almost always ends with a false diagnosis petering out), with emotions, with philosophy and the meaning of life (was briefly a nihilist until my best friend kind of helped me see some meaning in life), and, now, with gender.

I’ve seen a ton of posts like this on this subreddit, and I know a therapist is the best course of action, and I know at the end of the day I really need to make the call for myself and see what I’m really feeling, but I have to ask a question I figure some people will groan at:  Am I trans, or am I just trying to convince myself I am?

For anyone who made it all the way through, thank you.  I know this was long.

NicoleTheVixen,asktransgender,How can I tell if I'm passing or people are being polite?,"I live in the south and a trans woman I am speaking to mentioned that people in the midwest are far more upfront and likely to call what they see.

I'm really not sure what exactly to think here and I'm already pretty eaten up with insecurity."
RevengeOfSalmacis,asktransgender,"[meta] binary trans women of /r/asktransgender, can we get our shit together?","I've been here for a while. About three years of consistent activity. I've transitioned during that time, gone through enormous changes, watched the world change for good and bad. 

Every 2-4 months, we binary trans women, the single biggest demographic group on this sub but by no means its owners or sole intended userbase, have predictably been reminded as a community that we're not making /r/asktransgender welcoming for trans men and nonbinary trans people, primarily by *just not listening*, erasing their experiences, and just not taking the time to realize we're not alone here. This is our sub because we're trans people; belonging to the biggest and loudest demographic of users confers no additional rights, but it does mean we can make this sub unwelcoming if we don't do a better job. 

Yet we have this conversation 3-6 times a year, frequently more often, and nothing really changes. *Right now in multiple threads*, we're seeing people leave, seeing people explain how we've made them unwelcome in a sub that *they have an equal right to*. 

If I have any clout here, I'd like to help change that. I want everyone who uses this community to have the same support and help I got--help which fucking saved my life. I think it's possible people have suffered, been hurt, or worse because they couldn't fully access a resource that binary trans women can usually take for granted. And I'd like you to help me.

We can start by just actively reminding ourselves this isn't somehow particularly our sub just because there are more of us. We can actively remind ourselves that many people we read and respond to aren't binary trans women. We can write posts that are more inclusively worded, not through simplistic inclusive formulas, but instead by actively reminding ourselves to *talk toward and listen to all the trans people here*. We don't need to have an argument in every thread about this, just make more space. and *ask* for more perspectives when a question is needlessly narrow, not because we're the hostesses of the sub with any special right to invite, but because this isn't /r/asktranswomen, and as /r/asktransgender users we have an interest in hearing from more members of our community and in everyone in our community being equally safe in it.

We can also just plain marginalize rudeness and stereotyping against trans men and non-binary trans people in our community. It should be about as respectable as shitting on the floor in the middle of a well-traveled hallway. We all have to walk there. Don't shit in our hallway. Tell people who shit in our hallway to get a mop. 

I don't want to be reading a post about this in six months. I want us to solve this once and for all *as a community*. If you want this community to be the best possible resource for all trans people, or if you want to keep people from shitting in our collective hallway, or if I have any influence with you, please do the following:

* upvote for visibility; this isn't going to change if anyone avails themselves of the excuse of conveniently having never thought about it. (There's still crap to clean up.)

* post to commit your support for not shitting in the hallway. :P let's get ourselves on record. 

* in every thread hereafter, treat erasing trans men and non binary trans people as the intolerable behavior it is. 

Join me in making it socially unacceptable. We're not going to get patted on the back for not shitting on the floor, and that's how it should be; this is a minimum standard we should have met long ago, and a common resource is degrading because we haven't dealt with this shit.

If you absolutely must post just to trans women, there's always /r/MTF.

PS."
transtacos,asktransgender,When did you start to use the right bathroom?,"I've been on hormones for awhile, but I'm still working on my appearance. Most of the time, I still look more like the old me than the actual me. That said, trying to pick which bathroom is killer. At work/school, everybody knows, but I always worry that if I use the right one then I'll get a stranger or someone who does know will still be weirded out. So I usually only go in the right one when I know I'm alone or if I look like the actual me.

So when did you start using the right bathroom and how'd it go? Should I just go in and say fuck it, regardless of my appearance? And no, I'm never by a neutral bathroom, otherwise I'd be riding that train for a while."
aalexaaa,asktransgender,I'm Freaking Out HELP (mtf),"Hey everyone, i really need help. I started taking estrogen exactly 20 days ago, i'm on a patch 0.1mg per day, and also 0.35mg pills once a day, they're birth control progesterone only pills. I'm very confused because my biggest issue has always been my body, it's like a stick, i'm soo skinny. Of course i'm starting HRT to feel myself, but gaining weight below my waist is so much of the reason why i need the medication. since i've started the estrogen, i've actually lost a bit of weight, and I'm starting to look even more boy-ish than before, i'm losing the little curves i had even before as a boy. why is this happening to me? The opposite of what i'm expecting is happening, why would the medication make me look more like a boy? i'm very confused and scared. "
mjollnir82,asktransgender,"""So you never liked anything in your life? When you were a child? You don't know what you like? You are a so sad person"", ""You have got everything a child can have, and you are not happy. You do not deserve all this"". Does anyone identifies with these sentences?","I am struggling with this since I was a child. I kind of had no passion, nothing that I really liked (or I could feel deep satisfaction with), and from my primary schools I started to pass my days in front of the television, or playing videogames. 
I never knew why it was like this, but now I am kind of wondering if that was the fact of hiding many parts of me and substituting those with ""acceptable"" parts, plus my dysphoria.

I think I developed a over-necessary sense of guilt about myself (not being happy was my fault), which shaped the rest of my life, until I felt to be transgender for the first time. The first moment I was really happy, to the point I could have also died that day: I was happy one day, doing simply NOTHING.

Anyone had the same experience? (Yes, it is rhetoric :P)"

QueenCuttlefish,asktransgender,What do you think of the edit I did of the trans flag?,"Hello r/asktransgender!

I wanted to know what you thought of [my edit](http://imgur.com/3MqMqhz) of the trans flag (didn’t want to say redesign). And I also wanted to share my story.

I’m a 21-year-old cis-female who fell in love with an old friend when I was 9 years old. We grew up in the same town, stayed friends when we went to separate high schools, and gave each other our virginities even when we went to separate universities. One day, he sent me a text message. It only said, “I realize why I can’t be with you come this fall.” I never asked why. I was just so heartbroken. That text was the final straw (I’ve got a hella lot of other problems) and the beginning of a long period of deep, dark, suicidal depression.

Over time, I had some therapy and learned to bear with losing the person who was my oldest, dearest friend. I deleted all of my social media and lost contact with anyone who would know the both of us. A year passed. Began nursing school, had a few crushes, roommates moved out, and new ones moved in. Now one of these new roommates became someone very close to me. All she knew about the guy I fell in love with as a kid was that he broke up with me through a text message, that we haven’t heard from each other in more than a year, and that I still loved him. As far as she was concerned, this dude was an asshole who did not deserve how much I loved him; but, she knew what I needed most was closure and so she found him on facebook and contacted him.

About 8 months passed when my roommate told me that he finally replied to her and I gave her permission to give him my number. Personally, I thought he’d never have the balls to actually confront me. One night a few days later, I was woken up by text that said, “Hey, I’m probably not the person you wanted to hear from, but your roommate told me you weren’t doing so well.” We agreed to meet in person that next Friday.

I came several hours earlier than the agreed time. I figured studying beforehand would help calm me down. It didn’t, of course, but hell, I got shit done. Someone called out to me, “you’re here a lot earlier than I thought you’d be,” and there he was. This person who I’ve been in love with for the past 11 years and who broke up with me through a damn text is sitting in front of me after 2 years of absolutely no contact.

I told him that I was still in love with him. And that was when he came out to me as transgender. My initial thought was, “oh shit, he’s actually a woman. I can finally move on!” But when she told me she was still attracted to women, my initial thought became, “oh shit, I still have a chance!” We spent the next 10 hours catching up and it felt like time never past, like those years never even happened.

In those 10 hours, I saw this new side of her that was hidden in all the time I knew her. Guilt ran over me for not realizing who she truly was. In retrospect, there were so many things she would say or do that should have tipped me off. She also told me of all the struggles she had. How she came out to her sisters, how her mom outed her to her dad, how nervous she was when she first put on some lingerie she ordered online, and how sexy she felt wearing it. She thought the best way to handle her realization that she was a woman was to burn all of the bridges she could and so she cut everyone she knew before college out of her life. Including me. She told me that at the time, she thought she was saving me from the grief of being with someone who was trans, especially because of who our families are. 

I love her exactly the way she is. She is beautiful and perfect to me and she is the reason I thought of the whole flag thing. For what seemed to be like eons before we reunited, I hoped my feelings would resolve. I found strength in believing everything happened for a reason. We both needed time to find ourselves before finding each other again. (Pretty sure this will be a question, but unfortunately, we’re not officially together. Why? Beats me. You’ll have to ask her)

**TL;DR** – Person I fell in love with as a kid came out to me as transgender. Wanted to contribute to the trans community somehow. Edited/redesigned the trans flag.

**Edit**: Thank you everyone for all the lovely comments. I realize the flag wouldn't be able to represent everyone. It's hard to find something that would resonate with everyone since every person and story is unique. At the end of the day, everyone can individually decide what represents him/her best. ��

It's because of her I've been a lurker on r/asktransgender and r/MtF for the past few months. I've learned so much about your struggles and resilience just by creeping around these subs. 

**So now, another question**: She doesn't express her feelings well, but I've known her long enough to know when she's concerned about something. We're located in the United States^((SO MUCH INTERNAL SCREAMING. SEND HELP. SLAMMED THE PANIC BUTTON TOO MUCH; IT'S BROKEN.)). She's pre-HRT and still goes by her male name. We also live about an hour's drive apart. How can I best support her?"
NicoleTheVixen,asktransgender,"A year and some change on Estrogen, missing physical contact like crack. Anyone else have similar experiences?","So I started estrogen well over a year ago and around the end of June I got into a relationship that lasted till the end of November.

I really miss like having someone to lay my head on or to hold or be held. I mean I've been on HRT over a year, but sensations are different and it feels like I'ms till getting use to that by a long shot.. but it's also like holy hell, I really need more of that..."
mjollnir82,asktransgender,"When I discovered to be transgender, I was in the very middle of a race with my peers for demonstrating who was the coolest/most successful/intelligent guy. I immediately saw the non-sense of all that, and now I would rather disappear.","I was even in the middle of a PhD, and now I am not sure that it was what I wanted. 
I ran away as soon as I could, and I am now so ashamed that I would rather work in another area (I was in computer science) for the rest of my life.

Do you think that a gender therapist can help? Or I should start moving to South Pole? (Actually, that would be nice)"
Jessica1978,asktransgender,Finally sat down with my mom to discuss my transition. Really need some advice...,"Decided that tonight was the night and spoke to my mom about my need to begin transitioning soon (MTF). I'm 37 and still living at home for various reasons and knew full well this wasn't going to go down well.

My mom has always wanted a son. I was an only child after my mother miscarried my twin, and was also the only grandson in the family. As such, I had it hammered home I was the golden boy my whole life (which I hated). I'd mentioned to my mom that I was trans a while ago but it's not been mentioned since that time. However, I started counselling this week and am already being advised to look into hormones which I really feel is right for me.

Mom has basically said she could never accept me as a woman. She is only focussed on losing her only son. My relationship with her has always been incredibly close but as she told me tonight, ""I'm killing her"". The way it feels to me to hear this is that she lives or I do, but not both. Big point here though, there is no way in heck I would consider suicide. Been there, and worn the t-shirt. I want a life, not an end to one that I don't feel has begun properly yet!

So, for now, I've figured all I can do is look for my own place, move out and move on, praying that she'll come round. Losing my mother like this would smother me with guilt. I've already put all this off for 20+ years as I was terrified to hurt her, but I just cannot face hitting the big 40 and not truly being myself.

Any advice at all would be so valuable to me right now. I'm sure this is a standard parent response for a lot of people so how did it turn out for you? Do you just have to hope it all works out or do I have to start grieving for losing my mother?"
Sariac-,asktransgender,Maintaining career while transitioning,"Hi there! I'm still new to the community so please let me know if there are any misunderstandings I may have. 

I recently came out to myself about my identity (amab, mtf), and I know I want to transition eventually. However, I'm concerned about what effect it will have on my career. I work in the entertainment industry and I can't go stealth at all without starting from the bottom again and losing all of my contacts/colleagues. Not to mention, I am afraid that sexism and transphobia will hinder my job opportunities. I'm okay with not transitioning immediately, but I'm also afraid that the transition will be more difficult later if I continue working and moving up the ladder. Already on Monday, I am meeting an executive at a renowned company for an assistant position, and I'm worried, if I get the job, how my transition will be perceived months down the line.

I guess I'm just curious about how to handle this when I decide to start presenting full time since I can't see a way to go stealth."
2Toned,asktransgender,"Physically and socially transitioning has been tough. I'm looking for similar experiences, advice, and kind words. How was it for you?","Physically, mentally, and socially transitioning has taken a huge toll on me. I first started socially transitioning about 4 years ago. I've been bouncing around, living with different family members, at one point a friend (in their car, and later their room), at one point in a dorm (I went to a university for a few months ;)) and a girlfriends room. School became too difficult, as my dysphoria caused so much stress that I could not focus, and socializing became a chore. Also during this period I began looking to drugs and alcohol for comfort, guidance, and to ease my social anxiety. I haven't had a drink in about three weeks. I haven't done drugs in months. I'm piecing my life back together, as my new-found confidence (albiet shaky at times) is finally giving me the freedom to do so.
I lurk the web, listen to music, read, play video games, and have begun painting. Unfortunately these things get old after a while, and I find myself struggling from isolation. I'm taking one class at the community college, and I've been reaching out to old friends to combat this. It's painfully slow starting, but I'm trying to look up.
That's why I'm posting this. I was looking for people with similar experiences, advice, wisdom, or just kind words.

out_taway,asktransgender,"26m having sudden dysphoria out of nowhere? really confused and in shock, not sure what to think anymore","i don't even know how to explain any of this.

i'll try to make it as quick as possible but will hang out around here to reply. 

let's just say, the idea of wearing my gfs clothes turned me on, but i felt really ashamed by the idea of it. told my girlfriend, she was great about it and told me to relax and just try it on my own. and i did, and at first it was a huge turn on but after a couple of times it was a little bit more than a turn on.

when i wore her clothes i felt great, calm and relaxed. but when i saw myself in a mirror, that was a huge blow. i was stupid. it felt so fucking bad to be honest. 

and then i started to think about how i could try to nail it, like... if i could shave all my hair and try on some make up, will i still look stupid?

i had these kind of thoughts. and i was happy with them. until i realized what i was thinking and got really scared. 

am i thinking about being a woman way too much? is this why i don't want to do those masculine things that people are expecting from me?

started linking things from buried memories of the past and since then, it's just been an awful week of what i think can only be called dysphoria.

i don't really feel like a woman, but i don't feel like a man either. i feel like i've always had to be a man because i was supposed to, but i don't really feel like one. and i feel like this explains so. much. shit. about myself. about stuff i did or thought in the past.

still the dysphoria feel like waves, sometimes really strong, but its still here and doesn't leave me. starting to wondering if it will.

and i don't have any childhood memories like almost everyone shows. i did fantasize about being a girl as a teenager way too much, but nothing really early. but being honest i barely remember any of it.

i don't know what to do, you people. im feeling lost about this, and i've been thinking about talking to my girlfriend about it so i can go to some kind of therapy of counseling, but im really afraid of what she might make in her mind about how im feeling right now.

can anyone guide, help, support me in any way? anything from your experience?"
mel2mdl,asktransgender,Question about my child changing name and gender markers?,"My 21 year-old daughter (now legally) successfully changed her name and gender markers in court.  She's working on driver's license and social security card this week.

cazafex,asktransgender,Questions about Laser Hair Removal,"Hey all,

So yesterday I had my first laser session for getting rid of this ugly hair on my face, and I was hoping that some of you that have gone through it already could share some info.

For starters, when the technician was using the laser she didn't do everything, in fact she kind of did a checker board pattern all over my face. Probably only directly hitting 30% of my hair total. Is this normal for a first session? I tried to ask her about it but I don't think she really understood what I was asking. 

Second question would be the marks, if you had any redness or swelling after the session, how long did it last for?

Also OMG the pain. I was able to get through it but damn, I thought I knew what I was in for since I've been waxing/epilating for a year. The face is like 5 times more sensitive I swear! Any advice in regards to that? Maybe take a couple shots before hand? :D

Thanks!"
amabtrans,asktransgender,"After living as male for 17 years, I'm only starting to dislike it"," I've lived as male fine for the past 17 years. I've always had a hidden feminine side, but never actually did anything feminine as I was too anxious to.



For the first 16.5 years of my life I've lived as male fine, it has never really been a problem. If I go back to when I was 13 I'd probably say I wouldn't mind being born a girl, but it didn't really bother me.



When puberty started, I actually liked the idea of becoming more masculine, I thought growing facial hair would make me look more grown up, and be more attractive etc.


During my teen years I used to look at girls and want to wear the female school uniform, I really disliked guys could only wear trousers, although never really cared about having their bodies until more recently.


But I'm now 17, starting to get more body hair, and I have quite a masculine body shape and I hate it. I don't bother shaving it off as it will just grow back anyway. 

...but I only feel this way at home.


When I'm with anyone else or anywhere else it goes away more. I've been out of the house more over the past couple of weeks and these feelings have just gone right down, but only really come back at night. Sometimes I completely forget about transgender, then I get reminded of it and boom.



Being male just doesn't feel right, whereas 8/9 months ago it was fine. All of these feelings just started randomly about 4/5 months ago. The build up before that I was thinking ""I might be trans in the future, but at the moment I am completely cis"". Back then I didn't really know what gender dysphoria meant or what transgender meant altogether.






Could it all be a phase? Could I just be a crossdresser is a little over the top? I don't really know. I can't see a therapist unfortunately "

meetmario,asktransgender,Does dysphoria push you to seek numbness?,"About two years ago I started exploring female gender - first as a sexual thing, then slowly realising it goes much deeper. I have since felt dependent on porn - something I had always enjoyed without feeling it had taken over - and when I manage to stay away from it I'd trade it for anything really - to keep myself distracted. I never felt ""dependent"" on things before. I feel like my feelings are numbed, and I feel like I look for ways to numb them down. I feel like I am wasting a lot of my potential by silencing my emotions, through means that also waste a lot of my time and energy. This reminds me vaguely of my adolescence, which was an endless nightmare of loneliness and violence during which I learned to fully appreciate the company of computers. (IT work, anyone?).

This has creeped up in the last two years and it's getting out of control. I have recently come out to a supportive (or at least not-hostile) loving family but things seems to be getting no better on this front. 

I have also realised I'd rather work with people now that with machines, and that it was a wrong choice to begin with, albeit a financially rewarding one.

Can dysphoria do that to you? I never considered myself much dysphoric, just a bit. But if this counts, oh boy, do I need to make some changes quick.

WantToBeKim,asktransgender,Porn addict or Trans,"I've been torn on if I'm trans for 4 years now I'm now 24 and 6 months old and  in 2016 I started and stopped hormones thinking I was just addicted to porn and I think I was afraid of losing friends I was so anxious from everything. I would rather be a woman but it turns me on, and after masturbating I feel like I'm fine like I am for awhile. But given a few hours I start thinking about it again and I end up masturbating again... Also after discovering the trans subreddits I've lurked a lot. 

I remember when I learnt how to masturbate I became interested in animal transformation stuff. Then I found gender transformations etc and was very superstitious and punished myself for masturbating to anything but ""normal"" porn.

I also remember when I was very young the other boys in swimming class were pushing their chest together feigning having boobs as a joke and I started doing that occasionally. Also I remember a few times years later I wanted to turn into a girl and a few nights in a row prayed very hard for it though I was bullied a bit and felt jealous of them. As I've gotten older I only masturbate to woman I find men ugly and trans females and to feminization porn. I have talked to a clinical gender psychologist and he thinks I am trans thats how I got a letter. Since I stopped hormones I slowly over 3-4 months began regret it I would be 5 months in now I did sperm storage and a little laser I remember I was so afraid of what my friends would think and I was traveling 1 and a half hours to see the therapist laser people and doctor I was also worried about clothes shopping makeup and everything else I knew zero about I have anxiety and am a very indecisive person. I've never been into cross dressing I never had the chance when I was younger and now it makes me cringe a bit I font want to be a man in women's clothes.

If I am trans I've wasted so much time and won't get any hip growth any more which breaks my heart I'm not he most masculine person but I worry i'll look awful.

When I stopped hormones I promised to do nofap for awhile and failed miserably I wanted to try it to see if it was just the addiction to masturbating.

So please give me your opinions am I trans or is it my addiction out of control?"

But I'm a trans woman and/or non-binary trans femme, and I don't think I want huge breasts from HRT.  I think I'm having a little trouble parsing out how much of this sentiment comes from fear that breasts will put me in an ""awkward in between stage"" and how much it comes from my possible genderqueerness and dykey-ness and desire to have a fully feminized body but not with a huge chest please!

I probably don't have to worry about that outcome.  I know the ""one-size-smaller-than-closest-genetic-relative"" rule of thumb.  But I figured I'd ask these questions:

Do I want to be a guy? Not sure, probably not. 
Do I want to be male my entire life? No
Would I rather of been born female? Yes 
Would I be happier as a girl? Maybe
Do I want to be female for the rest of my life? Not sure 
Do I want to be seen as female? Maybe



All I do is just get into this loop.  Literally all day, when I'm trying to sleep, everything. 


I used to like the idea of wanting to be female, it fasinated me. I've been calling these thoughts as dysphoria, but weather they are of not I don't know. Maybe I'm being too pushy on myself to be trans? Sometimes it feels like if I were more trans I'd be slightly happier because I'd feel more feminine and want to transition, but not knowing what to do scares me. 



I don't really experiment. I have this dress, but it's a short black mesh one, that is kinda too small for me anyway. I do love the way dresses feel on the body, I love putting stuff onto my t-shirt and imagining they are breasts. But that's about it.

pm_me_your_dresses,asktransgender,"RE: The difference between being trans, gender dysphoria, and transitioning.","Firstly, I need to make a distinction about what the difference between gender dysphoria and being trans is. Gender dysphoria is a feeling of discomfort with your gender, and 'being trans' is a label that trans people use to express that they are transitioning, have transitioned, or feel that they have gender dysphoria.

Transitioning is currently considered the best treatment (by almost every reputable medical association in the UK and US) for most people with gender dysphoria. To try and distinguish how transitioning, gender dysphoria, and 'being trans' fit together, I'm going to use a parallel that is slightly off in places (disclaimer: being trans has nothing to do with losing limbs), but mostly explains the situation quite well.

Compare 'being trans' with 'having lost a limb' - replace phantom limb syndrome with gender dysphoria, and replace using a prosthetic with transitioning.

Now imagine you've lost an arm, and you're using a prosthetic. Imagine how insane it would be if random people attacked you, called you a mentally ill child predator, for the very act of 'choosing' to use that prosthetic. And inside, you're just thinking, 'All I'm doing is treating this problem that I think would have otherwise eventually made me kill myself.'

Gender dysphoria is insidious. In my experience, it poisons every relationship, every encounter, every conversation, every thought. It eats away at you, it makes you hide parts of yourself, and it rips you apart.

And transitioning, and the things that come with it? It's so relieving and life-changing that I can absolutely say that - despite having had kidney stones and the norovirus - the last month and a half have probably been the best month and a half of my life. Hormones take a long time to act, but after 7 months there's been enough progress that I can look in the mirror and see a body that for the first time I can think of as 'myself'. I can have a conversation with a friend and know that they're talking to *me*, not the fake personality that I had built to hide who I actually was."
Razzmytazz,asktransgender,"Skinny HRT, am i screwed?","So i'm finally getting started on HRT (100mg Spiro, 2mg E to start out) after a year of therapy this February (it's HELL getting it in Australia), and i'm a little worried about my height, but mostly weight, and metabolism. 

So i'm 6'3, barely 140LBS. I find putting on weight REAAALLY difficult, even if i eat like crazy. And i mean crazy. Like, i once went on a 3500 cal diet. Managed to put on 4 kg's in 3 months, just barely. 

Came straight off in a couple of weeks after stopping ):

On top of that, because i'm super skinny, my muscles show through, giving me pretty defined arms, pecks, and kind of abs? 

So i suppose what i'm trying to ask is...

1. Would HRT slow down my metabolism, and make putting weight on easier, or that's also totally YMMV?

2. Would i still get noticeable changes the way my body is, in terms of fat redist. currently? Or should i just go on a high cal diet, then lose it/repeat for bests results? 

3. Will i lose majority of my current muscle ''definition'', or am i doomed living as either a tall, manly mtf, or as a plank-y girl?

Ambiguous_me,asktransgender,Has anyone else become virtually unable to experience much sexual pleasure after starting HRT? (NSFW),"Prior to starting HRT, I had a normal male libido, I guess.  I would masturbate 1-3 times a day, and found it enjoyable.  Now that I've been on HRT for a medium amount of time, masturbation is more of a routine maintenance sort of thing.  I have to drink water to avoid becoming dehydrated.  I have to take a shower for hygienic purposes.  I have to masturbate every few days or so to ward off genital atrophy.  Sometimes I try it for a few minutes, get bored, and then do something else, maybe read an article in the Washington Post.  Orgasms felt explosive pre-HRT.  Now they feel only about 1/10th as strong.

Folks said get a Magic Wand, Magic Wands work great on trans women.  So I bought one.  It feels nice for a couple minutes (it doesn't do much for me around the breasts, which have absolutely zero sensation in general, or the head of my penis, but it feels okay against the perineum), after which I get bored and either try to masturbate, or do something else.  I don't bother with the Magic Wand anymore.  I still use it, I just use it exclusively as a back massager for when I feel achey.

It's very frustrating.  I know that I'm an outlier.  Trans women tend to talk a good deal about how great orgasms are on HRT, how they're so much stronger and more pleasurable, and I went from having a normal sexual response to being almost sexually anhedonic.  Just unlucky, I guess.  I read [an article](http://www.heyepiphora.com/2017/01/a-trans-womans-orgasm-savior-the-hitachi-magic-wand-rechargeable/) in which Zinnia Jones talks about how great the Magic Wand is for her and other trans women, and it just made me feel sexually broken because my experience has been the opposite of that.  On the bright side, feeling sexually broken isn't anywhere near as disconcerting as it would have been pre-HRT, because my libido is so reduced."

I have literally no female friends whatsoever, I've pretty much lost any interest in female friends, but maybe I should try presenting a bit more feminine? 



I don't have any makeup, clothes or anything (I don't really like wearing women's clothes, they remind me that I'm a guy). 


Do you think I should at least attempt to be more feminine in public? Maybe have some RLE as a girl before transitioning? Maybe become friends with some girls?

and [one using it as an aside / punchline](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubehaiku/comments/5ph4xl/meme_im_medically_diagnosed_as_a_male/).  
  
I was curious if anybody else noticed this, if it's just me overthinking random posts, or there's any correlation with the current world context (women's protests, etc)."
Stacy_Lane,asktransgender,Ubiquitous LHR Questions,"So, I just finished my 8th appointment and - maybe I'm just naive - I though i'd be more hair free than I am. My cheeks are doing well with some large splotches of clearing, but my upper lip and chin are proving pretty stubborn. The last session, the tech went nuclear. Felt like a cigarette being put out on my upper lip each time. (Brand new 810 machine.) 

Anyway, when did everyone start seeing the hair on their lip an chin start to surrender? Also, I start HRT in 3 weeks. Will that help?"

so my question to all of you, if we were to do a short youtube series, are there any particular questions you want see answered? Is there anything in particular you think that would be helpful to the community? we are open to input, and always interested in what could help the community, though the focus in this case is what kinds of questions the community has, and what they think will help.

6yyyy,asktransgender,I got a bad cold 3 days before VFS with Dr. Yeson and here's how the center handled it.,"I landed in Korea 5 days ago, a day after landing I was hit with a bad cold from what I assume is from the plane ride.

The person I was with strongly suggested against me emailing them and telling them, fearing they would cancel my surgery right then and there, he thought maybe I would get better. I was scared because at the very top of the pre op check list it states *""IF YOU HAVE COLD SYMPTOMS, YOU WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR SURGERY.""*


I emailed them anyways... explaining how I felt, they had me come in 3 days early and gave me a prescription for super strong cold meds, they pretty much nuked my system. The cost of the extra meds was around 12 USD. I have the green light for surgery and I go under in 5 hours, I thought maybe this post would help others in the future. If I never would have said anything, they may have turned me down or delayed it.

**TL;DR:** If you're having voice surgery and you catch a cold, tell them asap and they will fix you. "

I begun my HRT yesterday and I'm actually living in my parents house, without them knowing what is going on. I want to be sure they won't find them. 

For now I'm hiding them in my bag, but I thought of a better solution:
I'm also vegan and take multivitamins supplements everyday. I want to put every pills in my supplements case. So, if they will open the box, they will see only 3 different kind of pills, with the wrong name on the case's sticker. 

Anyway, I know they won't do it because I take this pills for months now and they never approach that box. 

My questions are :

1 - Is doing this will damage the E and AA pills ? I only have enough supplies for 2 months, just in case.

2 - Would you want to share your own ideas ? 

As always, have a nice day !"
GabiCap,asktransgender,Thinking of coming out to priest (Do I have not home?),"So, I'm a religious person and honestly, no matter what, that will never change.

When I first started exploring whether or not I am trans,  I decided to move from a small conservative Catholic church and attend the local Episcopal church (luckily I had just moved for a job so I have no strong ties in this small midwest farming community). I told the Episcopal priest during my first time at that church that I'm considering moving over LGBT issues. She said she understands since many Catholics join because of that.

I'm supposed to start catechism with her husband soon (which shouldn't be a problem, a life of Catholic school has taught me well).

I know she wanta to talk to me since I'm the newest young person and newest active person at church. During the meeting I will probably tell her 2 things: 1) when it comes to ritual, I love liturgy and 2) I am joining because I am bi and questioning gender.

She has been kind so far, but I'm terrified. I live in a small community and since I'm a traditionalist when it comes to ritual, if this goes wrong, I will have no spiritual home for a year and that hurts since faith a major part of me and Episcopalianism is the last hope for this mostly conservative trans girl."
sfkcd,asktransgender,Past tense name use?,"Hi Everybody!

I'm having trouble finding the appropriate answer to this question:

Chelsea Manning's sentence was committed. What was the name of the person who committed the crime?

If I say Chelsea I would be dismissing the choices, thoughts, and aspirations of Bradley whose actions brought Manning to national attention.

forty6_and_2,asktransgender,I just hung myself in my kitchen,"I'm sorry. This isn't the story anyone needs to hear right now, but I don't know who else to tell. I just hung myself in my kitchen.

I wasn't trying to kill myself, I just wanted to see how much it would hurt. I put my head in the noose and tied the other end to my freezer handle. I sat myself down beneath the fridge and suspended myself by my own weight. It felt constraining.... but it wasn't painful. It felt like nothing was happening. And then nothing *WAS* happening. 

I don't know if the momentary hypoxia or the pressure on my carotid, but something caused me to lose awareness for some short amount of time. Without realizing I had lost it, I remember coming to. I ""awoke"" to the sound of static with no external source... and the feeling of gasping. My eyes adjusted and I saw my kitchen, netflix paused in the other room... My dog Ozzie... only then did I realize I was choking. As soon this realization came I could feel it fading and I felt unconsciousness racing back. As the static grew louder, I remembered I was hanging. I knew I would die if that empty toneless noise got any louder. 

I'm so tired you guys. I'm just exhausted. So fucking tired of convincing myself it's gonna be okay. Every day is a battle and for fucks sake I only have so much strength. I've been waiting for 15 months now. *Fifteen* fucking months of HRT, and people are still *shocked* when I tell them I've been on hormones. I am still so unequivocally male to them this idea that I've been feminizing myself for over a year is *unbelievable* My changes are laughable. My progress is pathetic. My patience is almost up and I just want this cruel mistake of a life I was given to stop hurting me so much... 

But I can't die in front of my dog. I can't let him wine and howl next to my blue-faced corpse until my upstairs neighbor starts to smell something funny. If it wasn't for Ozzie staring me in the eyes inquisitively as I hung I wouldn't have squirmed up and frantically loosened the noose. I would still be fucking hanging there, at this point dead beneath my freezer. What the fuck is wrong with me? Why can't I be happy... Why isn't anything working out? Why can't I see this ""potential"" that you people say I have? I post on r/transpassing and get thumbs up, but when I take myself outside in skinny jeans and makeup I get scares and derision. I don't want to hurt anymore, but I can't end it all like this.

I might not make it in the end. But I don't want to die today."

I would prefer to have the body of a woman, not just for sex but for everything. I did self medicate for a short period  of 3-4 months and it was like living life with color from a black and white world. Taste was stronger, smell was stronger, touch was more sensitive. A sense of calm just came over me and everyday was a beautiful day. I stopped it because I was too afraid of coming out to my family at the time. 

I dated a lot of women in high school and college, but never had sex because I was just not comfortable in my body. I would always try to get them to dump me before that or dump them if that didn't work. I am the ideal guy in the view of many guys and girls (ripped body, went to top university, smart, great high paying job, comes from money, has a house, cars, lots of hobbies (from ballroom dancing to sharp shooting).

tatsmazzers,asktransgender,Am I nonbinary or am I overthinking it?,"Hiya everyone :) 



So I’ve IDd as a trans woman for a year and a half now but in the last few months I’ve been wondering whether I might be nonbinary and I was wondering whether anyone had any thoughts.



Basically being perceived as a woman is approximately a million times more comfortable for me than being treated like a man, in fact having anything I do come off as masculine is a big fear of mine. I’m sure my gender is not ‘man’ or male/masc spectrum nb.



Nothing in my physical dysphoria suggests that I might be nonbinary. The body shape I want for myself is if anything exaggeratedly ‘female’. I’m getting srs (though I swear that’s 20% because I want a vagina and 80% because I hate worrying whether my tuck is good enough) and I badly need ffs cos my brow is a huge dysphoria trigger.



But I still don’t know whether I ‘identify as a woman’. I don’t know what feeling like a woman feels like. 



Some of the feelings I’ve been having remind me of when I was questioning. Like I remember feeling really drawn to transitioning but not being able to make the ‘identifies as a woman’ part work for me. I guess that didn’t change as much as I thought it did.



Something I tell myself about my gender that makes sense to me is that society gave me two options, man and woman, and I just happen to find the woman box warmer and more comfortable.



And idk what that means. Like either a) I’m binary because that’s a binary view of gender or b) I don’t actually understand myself as a man or a woman I just see myself as having moved from under the man tinted skylight to the woman colour skylight and preferring it there which would make my gender something else entirely.



Apologies if this is nonsense, I was just wondering whether this sounds like anything any nonbinary person has experienced or alternatively whether this is pretty normal for binary trans people."
Sublime99,asktransgender,how to take 6mg of Oestradiol in 2mg tablets?,"So I just got word that I can up my dosage to 6mg due to it being dangerously low (I can't get the results till monday but I was told over the phone), but I only can get 2mg tablets for the time being of Oestradiol Progynova (I get my prescriptions through the NHS so if you UK guys know a better system of administering E on the NHS I would be grateful). Do I take each tablet every 6 hours or more than one at once? a bit confused there.

Furthermore I did get told that my T level has gone up a lot from something like 2.3 to 4.5 pmol/L (possibly on the non cis female level?) so she advised me (the lady at my surgery) to get in contact with (what I assume she means) an endo: this was formerly Dr. Seal from Gendercare in the UK but Im pissed off with him trying to milk me of money for appointments (when I've already been seen once at the GIC in London and received previous correspondence via the NHS with him) and so Im using a doctor at a place called Clinic T whos Trans and can advises on hormone levels. So my second question is what should I ask her to do? previously I was on 3 month Decapeptyl shots but if thats not working might I have to go back to cyproterone (grrr) or what? again, any advice with what I can get on the NHS would be great.

drtyuiklnbvcdft,asktransgender,Struggling to cope with sibling's (FTM) new gender identity,"So, my sibling has been presenting as male for about a year now, and I am very uncomfortable with it still. I've read a lot of posts from siblings with similar feelings, but the responses don't seem to line up with my experience of my sibling. I know it is a possibility that they have been struggling with this for a large portion of their lives, and they have just been hiding it. They have a serious problem with lying and claiming traumatic things have happened to them when they have definitively not (they have made very serious claims and one time the authorities had to get involved and they eventually admitted to lying- this is not an isolated incident, and they have also been caught red handed plagiarizing). They now claim they always said they were a boy as a kid and wanted to be called by a traditionally masculine name and always played with ""boy"" toys growing up but that is so blatantly false-their interests have always leaned stereotypically feminine up until recently, and it sounds like they are appropriating my childhood because i hated the expectations and roles that came along with being a girl and resisted them in every way possible.

 I know i sound like I just want to be told they're just doing it for attention, or they're trying on a new personality just to feel unique and define their identity. But it just seems SO contrived- the putting on a deep voice, the complete denial of their former interests and latching on to stereotypically masculine things (lego, cars, math, video games, sports). it seems like they're doing this horribly stereotypical imitation of what they think a man is like, and it bothers me. I have several good transgender friends and i just see them as humans who happen to be transgender, because their gender identity is not this contrived performance, but just a manifestation of who they feel like internally. Im open to the possibility that I'm just bigoted from growing up in a transphobic society, but i just can't get over the fact that it seems like my sibling is troubled and lost and acting out in attempt to remedy deeper issues. I would very much appreciate some feedback and i apologize if this is insensitive. "

Muslims i know i have no problem with, its the fear of being attacked that goes through my mind, i don't care about comments or slurs i can ignore that.

I hadn't though. The last while she's been so distant (we still live together because we don't have the money for separate apartments and it's made coparenting our 3 year old easier. I miss how close we used to be. I miss how I could talk to her about anything. I miss our cute little family. I miss my best friend. I miss being able to cuddle her. I miss talking about our future together and thinking about how we'll grow old together. I miss the certainty of knowing that *this* is the person I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. Knowing that come hell or high water, she'd be there by my side. 

I've been dating another girl for a while, and I really like her. But I just can't see myself growing old with her the way I could with my wife. I don't want to hurt her but I also need more time to grieve my marriage.

I think back to when our son was born. Supporting her through labour, holding *our* precious kiddo. Watching him grow. Watching him take his first steps, learn to talk, say ""swing me"" as we were out walking as a family. I miss our family picnics. I miss all these little things that we had together. I miss us all falling asleep together on our family bed. Our cuddles. Our kisses. Our little inside jokes. I miss how she would always come up with new plans on how we'd live our lives.

blynng,asktransgender,Are the pharmacokinetics of oral estradiol the same in both natal male and female bodies?,"The studies referenced in Kuhl's *Pharmacology of estrogens and
progestogens* use post-menopausal women.

Would this effect happen in the natal male body as well?"
henx125,asktransgender,Is 3 months an unreasonable wait to see a doctor to get started on HRT?,"I'm getting pretty antsy at this point not having had started HRT so long after deciding to transition. Took about two months alone just to get the recommendation from my therapist and now that I have to wait so much longer just to get a consultation with a doctor I feel like I could be making faster progress.

I have a few options, some less convenient than others. The one I already booked is said to be a great doctor in trans-health and happens to be close but if the wait is extra-ordinary for her I don't mind going to a consent clinic or another doctor farther away...

Also, since I would expect that she would want a blood test before prescribing anything, should I or can I get some kind of test done for hormone levels prior to my visit? I saw that there seems to be a company that can check hormone levels with a saliva sample which would be great if that would work. "

cuttincows,asktransgender,Dysphoria spiking after coming out,"First time poster here - I've been struggling with the thought that I might be a girl (MtF) for about the last four years, with some signs of as much ranging back a few years beforehand.  
  
However, I didn't have have the in-the-moment dysphoria until I admitted to myself that I'm trans, after which it came out in full force; looking up all of your descriptions after it started, it exactly matched the ""small panic attack, brought on by both bringing attention to my body, and by those around me using the incorrect pronouns (although most of them didn't know, it still hurt a little)"".  
  
Before all of this, I was generally dissatisfied with my life, especially my body (I recognized that I had an attractive male body, but still didn't like it), and had been having issues with emotional range / was diagnosed with depression. 

I guess my tl;dr question is, is it usual for dysphoria to not emerge in the traditional sense until you come out to yourself?"
AlikiVougiouklaki,asktransgender,"Afraid I won't like being a woman, will be forced to be a man for the rest of my life (irrational fear)","I'm MtF, pre-everything. My fear is that I'll begin to transition by fulfilling my vision of womanhood: wearing a dress, makeup, growing out my hair, beginning hormone therapy. I'll expect it to feel amazing and *right*, but when I actually go through life like that for a little, it'll simply feel ""eh.""

So, by the Law of the Universe, I'll have to become cis again: cut my hair, wipe off the makeup, take off the dress, stop HRT. And I'll have to live the rest of my life as a man, knowing that I had a try at what I thought was true happiness, and it didn't work. And I'll be saddled with dysphoria forever. It's terrifying.

I know that fears like this are soo common among people who are just starting out. But it keeps haunting me."

LoveIinus,asktransgender,Am I weird? MtF but trying to look male after almost 5 months HRT.,"So I'm MtF transgender, 21, almost 5 months on HRT (8 more days). I think I have several weird notions and I would like to share with you guys and maybe tell me who I exactly am?

So since young I knew I wanted to be a girl. When puberty hit me and I started growing leg hairs I knew something was wrong. I lived the next few years being extremely depressed and even attempted suicide twice because I want to be a girl. Do or die. 

I finally got on HRT almost 5 months ago and through these few months I think the results have been very kind to me! I'm very sensitive to estrogen so I got undetectable testosterone level after 37 days on HRT. Major changes came during the 3-5th month on HRT, I started to male fail almost 90% in boymode. Let me break it down.

Boymode Long hair - 100% pass.
Boymode current hair 80-90% pass
Boymode ""look as male as I can"" aka hiding all my hairs inside a cap. - androgynous looking female - still gendered female

A Friend of mine really encouraged me to try full time since according to her I look like a girl (although my self-esteem doesn't think so) 

I tried and started visiting the female's toilet even. I haven't got clocked even once! Once a cleaner was cleaning the toilets and she saw me and guided me to the female's toilet. I was shocked! 

Btw I'm a lesbian, and I only have eyes for girls. I'm a femme, and I like femme girls only. But why is it that I like getting attention from males? Although I don't lead them on after that. I feel really happy when a guy asks me for my number (which did happen), but I'm not interested in them? 

Why do I have a strong desire to dress up and look like a cute Korean boy as of this point in time? Partly because I'm still growing my hair out. My ideal girl image is a feminine girl with Long hair and that's not who I am now, so I don't want to be read female and people possibly thinking ""yeah girl but not pretty"" I also feel like presenting as a boy isn't so bad anymore because I'm considerably more feminine looking, no more facial hair, thick body hairs and my voice is female sounding already. 

But I know I want to live my life as a pretty, feminine young looking girl. 

So, who am I really? "

PrincessLobster,asktransgender,"A few questions for transwomen regarding hormones, food to avoid and gaining weight","Hi all! I've been on hormones for about 3 months now, and I have a few questions regarding those and a few other things as well. Thanks to anyone who can answer any or all of them!

Alright so first, I'm taking 6mg of E and 200mg of Spiro daily, and I usually split the doses up as followed. E: 8am 4pm 12am and Spiro: 10am and 10pm (usually within an hour of these times for both). I swallow them all because I tried switching to sublingual E about a month ago after reading about it giving more estrogen, but I felt a whole lot more mood swings and anxiety when I did that, so I went back to oral. Also, I just had my first blood tests done about two weeks ago, and they came back as E at 114 and T at 17. Like pretty much every other transwoman, I wanna maximize how much E I'm getting and get that number up higher (200 or so is highest safe amount, right?), so a few questions. 

First, should I start taking one E pill in the morning and two E pills at night instead of my current spread out schedule? I read that it could be better to take two at night because that way you get more while you're sleeping and growing, but would it make that big of a difference or am I fine taking them the way I am already? Next, has anyone ever tried mixing sublingual and oral doses, and is it a good idea to do so? Oral E has a half life of 12+ hours in your system while sub only has 3-4 IIRC, so I had the idea that I could take two pills at night, one oral so I don't get those nasty mood spikes and one sub so I get more E that way. Also, if I did keep my same pill schedule as now, would it be better to split up my middle pill into two sublingual doses about 4 hours apart (like 4 and 8pm)? Lastly, how long does sublingual E show up on a blood test? Asking because I stopped the sub about five days to a week before my blood test, and I want to know if the test could have been off because there was more in my system than now (because I switched back).

Next just a few questions about nutrition and things to avoid. Zinc, vitamin D and magnesium are three nutrients that are linked to extra testosterone production, and I've been taking a magnesium supplement for years that amounts to about 80% of my daily value. I just learned about the testosterone link yesterday and I take it to help with muscle stiffness and cramping. Anyway, is it okay for me to keep taking it because I'm on a T blocker, or should I abstain until I get an orchiectomy? I'm planning on getting one as soon as possible and paying out of pocket for it (sucks but I live in a red state with no trans health coverage, so I'd rather get it done sooner and not jump through any stupid hoops later). Also, once I have my orchi, can I eat those nutrients normally because I don't have any testosterone production in my body anymore, or should I still be careful about them?

Lastly, do any girls here have any experience with gaining weight? I have the metabolism of Sonic the Hedgehog (or a pet tapeworm, we may never know) and I just have a really hard time gaining weight. I've been around 140-150 for the last ten years or more, and nothing I eat or drink seems to make much of a difference. So, what would be some good, clean (nothing artificial) and preferably dairy free foods to help me gain weight faster?


Thanks again to anyone who helps out, and I hope I wasn't too wordy."

waxpaperclip,asktransgender,[NSFW] Non-op/pre-op post-HRT MtF sex questions,"I'll try to keep this concise as possible while including everything.  

I'm currently pre-everything, and part of finally admitting to myself that I'm trans has included finally admitting to myself that I'm really not a big fan of being in the top role during sex. I was initially concerned with the inability to obtain/maintain a decent erection on T-blockers, but I'm not sure what I'd really use it for anyway. I have a very low (almost non-existent) sex drive right now (I think as a byproduct of SSRIs), and while I'll likely have no sex drive at all on HRT, I'd still like to know a few things beforehand just in case.    


As it stands, I don't really have any bottom dysphoria (mostly top dysphoria/issues with body hair and stubble) so I figure it might be easiest to just hold onto my penis. 

My main questions are essentially  
* How do you (personally or what you've heard from others) have non-penetrative sex?  
* Are orgasms still obtainable even without having an erection?  
* Is receiving oral sex still pleasurable in a sort of *getting eaten out* type of way? (again with the absence of an erection). 
  
I'd still like to have the option to have pleasurable sexual experiences with women, even if that means mainly through oral stimulation while flaccid. Though my girlfriend is quite attached to my penis, and doesn't seem too happy about the prospect of not having penetrative sex anymore.  
  
Thank you so much for your time!"
johnnybucks72,asktransgender,Gender Dysphoria or Something Else?,"Throughout most of my life I would say that I was happy just to dress up as a women part time and go back to living as a guy in the real world. Sure, I had days when I hated going back to work as a guy on a Monday morning after spending the whole weekend dressed but that was all I suffered from. That was then, now I'm beginnning to think things are changing in my mind. For example, I hate being called ""Sir"" or ""Man, Fella"" and male pronouns. If I see a cis women wearing something nice or just looking attractive I become envious. I don't have a problem with my male body or genitals, so what's going on? If I was truly transsexual I'd be dead by now."
Hahaimtrulyinsanelol,asktransgender,Transitioning and Trump?,"I'm 28 and have recently learned of my gender dysphoria. My wife has been brought along slowly, and still doesn't appear to like the idea of me in a dress or women's clothes but she accepts it does make me happier.

I'm on an SSRI currently to deal with general depression that I believe is caused by my GD. It sounds like hormones like estrogen would be beneficial to me and cure a lot of the mental issues I've had my whole life.

My wife however is very hesitant to go with the hormones because she wants to first see if the SSRI I'm taking (citalopram) will make me better. And secondly she is afraid of what Trump's administration will do to transgender laws.

My workplace has an anti discriminatory policy, and is lead by some great people, but she is still terrified that I would be fired and unable to land another engineering job as a half male, half female weird looking person.

She's also concerned with the insurance policies and general discrimination his regime could bring.

My workplace's insurance (BlueCross BlueShield) in Minnesota appears to cover the hormones generally used in MtF HRT, but without more investigating, my wife will just put off me taking these until she can be sure I won't be lynched.

I appreciate the help!

Also I have one other random, odd, separate question.

Gender dysphoria can't be caused by me having low testosterone can it? Like I've seen lots of commercials about guys feeling depressed and it's because their testosterone is low. There isn't a chance that I just have low T and by getting it medicated I would all of a sudden not feel GD right? Just wanted to ask to make sure.

Thanks for the help! "
cd_confused,asktransgender,"Cis-male Crossdressing, or something more?","I'm sorry in advance for the wall of text and all the likely TMI, but I feel that I need to get as much information out there as possible. Sorry for rambling...

Some more background to start; when I first started doing wearing girls clothes it was exclusively sexual for me. The first time I remember wearing a dress by my own choice was maybe 5 or 6 years ago when I was with my ex. I would wear panties, a dress and sometimes long socks or other things that I would normally find sexy on a woman. It would make me feel sexy. At that time, the term Trans never even entered my mind. When that relationship ended I completely stopped wearing any female clothing, and in fact didn't even have the urge to do so. After I got together with my current girlfriend, I didn't really wear any of her clothes till 1.5 to 2 (&lt; 1 year ago) years into our relationship when I saw one of her dresses in my closet. It started out as just sexual again. 

Things started to escalate when I started to get the option to work from home one day per week around 3 months ago. I had the urge to wear a dress the whole day while working and it felt great. I started to get excited for the next week when I could do it again. After maybe a month or two of this I finally convinced myself to talk to my girlfriend about it. She was a little worried to start (about maybe it was more than crossdressing), but has otherwise been really accepting of me. I told her at the time that I had no feelings of transitioning at all. It was just something I liked to do since it felt nice. That was the honest truth at the time, but now I'm scared that maybe I was wrong?

My girlfriend has been amazing though, she helped me pick out clothes, she has no problem with me wearing girls clothes when I get home from work most days. Recently, as things have been escalating for me, she painted my nails for me (I just wanted to try and see if I like it... I did). Yesterday she helped me pick out a razor to shave my legs, which she said looked nice on me. I've been buying more and more clothes trying to find a style, and in my experience with my Amazon shopping my ""style"" seems to be things that I think look sexy on other girls, thought lately I've been loving the feeling of wearing tights. The happiest I have felt in dressing up was when I was wearing a [short skirt with long socks (not me)](http://orig13.deviantart.net/dec6/f/2010/038/c/f/cfa3f91a7c22fc520e7fbf939056f111.jpg). Whenever I saw myself in a mirror I would get giddy. I am also wearing almost exclusively ladies panties now (Victorias Secret thongs and Cheekinis fit really well). I get a rush wearing them at work.

I've been spending some time on this sub reading posts hoping to find one that would help me understand if there is more going on that even I know. None of the posts I've read seem to really suit my situation (as I'm sure is normal). I've never been depressed, or really felt any disphoria that I can remember. Up until I was in my mid 20s I never had a desire to wear female clothes (I am 29 by the way). Even now, I like my genitals and have no problem with them, and in fact the thing about HRT that scares me most would be potentially losing the ability to get erections. 

The primary reason that I am questioning myself right now is that I can't get the idea out of my head of dressing fully female out in public. I have asked myself the question: ""If you could press a button, and you would suddenly be female from birth with no downsides, would you do it?"" My answer is a hesitant yes. So hesitant that even typing that ""yes"" scares me. My gender has always been more in the Androgynous camp, and recently I've let myself accept that. I did some random quizzes online (I know, I know, these are terrible) and they all said I was mostly 60/40 (towards female in some cases, and male in others).

I guess I should get to the point... I'm scared since I seem to be diving deeper and deeper into my femininity at an alarming pace. I've only really accepted my gender as something other than ""male"" within the month. Is this going to keep going further and further until I am no longer happy being biologically male? I also have the tendency to ""go hard"" when I get interested in new things. When I start a new game, I spend all my time not playing researching about the game. I go hard until I get bored of it and it falls out of my mind. I'm worried I'm starting down this path with this. Maybe my brain is addicted with the idea, and my reading /r/asktransgender has been guiding me deeper and deeper subconsciously.

Has anyone here found themselves in a similar situation? Any thoughts on proceeding? I feel that talking with a Gender focused therapist might help, but is that going too far already? I'm also worried about scaring my girlfriend by bringing this up since she has a lot going on with school and stuff. I will probably show her this post if I am brave enough.

Thanks for your time.

My face is a big problem too. As I have a masculine hairline and already a receding hairline I am really anxious about the wins blowing the hair away to make it visible etc. and I don't know if finasteride and estrogen could actually give me a female hairline. I have a rather big forehead and I hope that the female hairline could make it quite smaller but this probably won't be the case.

barginbrand,asktransgender,Testosterone 10ml vial comes up short. What am I doing wrong?,"Hey gang, 

I used to order from Stroheckers but on GoodRx (check it out) Walgreens sometimes has testosterone on for $50 some weeks.

I do 0.5ml every week. So a 10ml vial should last 20 week, correct? For whatever reason I keep coming up short about a week or two of that 20 week supply. Walgreens really hassled me last time I got it filled with them, Stroheckers never had a problem with the script being a week or two early. 

What am I doing wrong to keep coming up short? I ordered 1ml syringes to keep a closer tab on it. Every week I'm injecting about 0.48ml. There's always the tip of the syringe - right before the dosage lines start - left of testosterone every week so I started saving that last bit, just to keep track, and it looks like that little tiny bit extra every week ends up adding to about 0.45ml after 18-ish weeks.

It'll happen. It's coming. The next ten years are going to get weird. But in a good way."
mjollnir82,asktransgender,"Who got obsessed trying please parents, before discovering your ""gender dysphoria""?","Short answer: me :)

--- TRIGGERING WARNING ---
**Parents**: ""Why don't you like anything?"", ""You should be happy"", ""Is it possible that you don't like/enjoy anything you do?"", ""I don't want to waste any more money buying you things you don't enjoy"", ""Have you got no dream in life? I was a so huge dreamer when I was our age""
**Me**: ""I don't know what to do, I am a sad person"". 
""Why I don't enjoy anything"", ""I don't enjoy even this... I am broken"".

I had the huge fear (that became bigger and bigger), to upset one last time my parents for not being ""happy"". As the time passed, I got an **obsession** with ""not enjoying things"", trying to find *the ultimate thing I enjoy, I like*.

**Who else have experienced such an obsession?**

I started trying ""being happy"" and trying ""enjoying things"", since very young. I lived all my life (that is, about 12k days...) saying to myself that **I SHOULD ENJOY** things, with the fear of saying, again and again ""I don't know, I don't like this..."". Today I am 34, discovered to be transgender at age 32, and... only two days ago I started realising that the fact that I never enjoyed anything was given by the fact that I didn't like the fact I am a male (also, I never had the courage to see ""the other side"", for this I got stuck), and I could not enjoy things being considered a male. I got the first memories of this at age 3-4.

That is called ""gender dysphoria""."
kaitlinthewildling,asktransgender,What were some truly unexpected changes that happened on HRT?,"Hello everyone. So, I have been on HRT for a bit over 6 months and just noticed a change that I hadn't expected or even considered would happen. I used to hate small talk, only talk when I had to, etc. After going back to college after winter break, I noticed that I was calling my mom much more just to talk. I eventually realized that I really enjoyed just calling my mom and chatting, something I wouldn't have done before. I also noticed that when I'm having anxiety or anything else like that, my first instinct is to call my mom or a few others and tell them about it and talk through it with them. But, even when I'm not having anxiety, I have almost like an instinct to want to call my mom and just tell her about my day. Long story short, I have noticed that I have a desire to communicate and talk through problems with others that I didn't have before. Did this happen to anyone else? Did the opposite happen to any ftms? What happened to you that you didn't expect?

Edit: to clarify a bit more, my mom is who I call the most, but I'm more chatty overall. Not just that one case. And, others have noticed it. In fact, my mom noticed it about a month before I did. 

Edit 2: Wow, I never expected this to go this far. Thank you for the gold!!!! "

shelbon22,asktransgender,Has anyone else used social gaming to help emotionally while transitioning?,"Something that's happened recently is I've gotten back into an MMORPG. I haven't played any in years and I'm liking it again because I get to be a female in game and with other players. I have a guild and they all treat me like a girl and it's great. Probably helps that we voice chat and I've done enough voice work to sound feminine.

I've read multiple times from other people stating how they would always play the opposite gender in video games before they came out but I never did that. I tried so hard to be a guy and masculine that it never occurred to me.

I'm still pretty early in my transition though and can't pass as female without a lot of effort so I'm finding this to be a really great way to act and feel accepted as a woman without having to shave my body and put on a ton of makeup.

Just curious if anyone else has done this and how helpful it was to them. And to anyone else in a similar situation, mtf or ftm, strongly recommend it."

cazafex,asktransgender,How to deal with friends who just don't seem to get it?,"So I'm having a bit of an issue right now. So I have this really close friend of mine, let's say her name is Sara. Sara was the first person I ever came out to last summer when I first started questioning. She has been very supportive and even took me shopping for the first time. For some further background I'm currently renting a house with Sara and 2 of our friends. I'm out to all of them and normally dress as myself around the house, but out in public I'm still presenting as male.

Even though she seems to be supportive of me, she still says things that just baffle me. Now I've never asked her to change pronouns for me, because I don't think that's fair to her to have to be aware of what she's saying depending on if we're in the house or not. But other things like CONSTANTLY referring to me as bro. Or telling me when I'm wearing the most feminine clothes that I own (that she helped pick out might I add) that I don't look very feminine, or the thing that just happened tonight: We had plans to hang out with a few friends but then I had to bail, so then she said ""O well I guess it's going to be a girls night now instead!"". WTF?!?!? 

I realize I'm not out in public, my voice is still horrible, I'm super tall, large shouldered, big handed, and all the other fucking things I've been cursed with. But the lack of even an attempt to recognize me as who I am is really depressing. I get the feeling she's almost just faking the whole support thing tbh.

Any advice r/asktransgender? I'm thinking I just need to sit down and talk with her but I'm not really sure what to say. Like I said I don't want to force her to change pronouns since I'm not ready to be out in public, but I feel like even without changing pronouns she can atleast be a little more sensitive."

janerowdy,asktransgender,"Came out to my parents and sister yesterday, all is well.","I woke up this morning thinking ""holy shit I did it.""

My dad didn't care, he just wants to make sure I finish school and get a good job. ""Same as before, nothing's changed as far as I'm concerned.""

My mom was supportive, and I thought she'd have the worst reaction. I asked what about when you said if (my gay uncle) gets married, you wouldn't go to their wedding. She replies with ""yeah, I said that, but then I changed my mind and went there."" Followed by my ""wait, when did they get married?!""

My sister had known something up was up, and had actually suspected me of being gay for a time, but recently began to think ""is he trans?"" So she's happy for me too, she told her husband and he's happy as long as I keep playing computer games with him.

I did NOT expect everyone to be so cool. I guess after ~30 years of keeping a secret and building it up in my mind, I was my own worst enemy here. I know that I'm lucky that everyone is so cool, that not everyone has this kind of reaction, but I was convinced that I'd receive hate.

It's a guilty pleasure of mine to squeeze myself a little to see that clear stuff come out, it's an affirming thing to remind myself of the changes in my body. But today blood came out of my right nipple, but not my left one. 

Now I am scared I have breast cancer when I don't even have a breast to begin with! I'm gonna call my endo's office tomorrow, which is a chore in and of itself seeing as I'll be on hold for 45 minutes. I've only been on hormones for 5 months and soon I'm gonna lose control of even that!

I'm FtM and I've been on T for just over a year. I am STILL getting periods, because my T dose is super low, and my doctor will not increase it. (I'm in the UK, so my care is on the NHS which means, in short, I must play by their rules in order to receive my care and my hormones.) 

I suffer from endometriosis and it makes period pain so bad that I can collapse from it. I mentioned this in a forum I am on and put the following:

'I was sent home from work AGAIN today, because of collapsing from the pain of my period. I hate my periods and I hate endometriosis. I also hate how all the products I need are super floral and girly and expensive! T seems to be making my periods worse, but I can't do anything about it, and it's really distressing. I think I shouldn't be getting my periods after a year on T, but my dose is too low and I think this is the culprit. Does anyone else just really hate themselves and their body when they get a period? I mean, really loathe yourself? When I realise I've started a period, my dysphoria manifests in this intense disdain I feel for my own body. I mean, absolute disgust and loathing. I can't explain how badly I suddenly hate my body when on a period and how I feel like it's not my body. It's such a strange feeling. Nothing against periods, I know they don't bother some people but mine really distress me.'

and the community flipped out. I was suddenly called transphobic for mentioning my periods and saying how much I hated them and was told the reason for this was because I was upsetting trans women, and reminded them they can't have periods. It got so bad the admin of the forum had to remove my post, because someone found out my real name and threatened to post my personal details and tell my manager at work that I'm trans. I'm stealth for very personal reasons but out to close friends and family, and him finding out could of cost me my job. Thankfully the admin banned this person and told me the person in question admitted to only finding my name out, and not where I work, but wanted to 'scare me'. I did think for a time that I was on low T because of being stealth and my doc was trying to help, but I am due to move to a new job soon and they already know I'm trans and I never mentioned to my doc that I'm stealth, since they're pretty scorning of that on the NHS when you're trans. I just can't let my current manager know, because he's really, really transphobic. And I can't afford to be out of work for two months until my new job begins. 

Did I do something wrong in mentioning them? I did put a warning in my topic post about it, and I definitely didn't sit there making fun of trans women for not having periods, I was just grumbling about my own. Is there some kind of etiquette when it comes to periods and mentioning them in the community that I'm unaware of or something? I've only recently began branching out into the community and after this experience on a forum and some really horrible experiences on Tumblr, I'm not sure I even want to look much further for support. It's making me pretty miserable being so isolated, but after that, I half wonder if I'm better being isolated and miserable, than engaging people and being treated like crap. Even some of the Reddit communities seem quite cold and rude when I've looked at them. This is the first Reddit I've posted in and I'm half expecting similar backlash to be honest. :S

myandril,asktransgender,Where to go for hair transplants in Europe? And related questions.,"Hi /r/asktransgender

About 3 months ago I came to this sub with a couple of questions because I was questioning. A couple of you told me to go to a therapist. I did, and here I am, wondering why I did not admit it to myself all these years.

At least now I know and I'm lucky to have the support of my family and some friends. In other means I wasn't that lucky, mostly in regards to balding. I still do have hair, but it's noticeably thin on top and my hairline has receded a bit.

I'm thinking about getting hair transplants, but I'm unsure where I should go, as they are very expensive in my country. Do you have any suggestions for within Europe? Price-performance ratio is more important for me than getting them as cheap as possible. I'd rather save up for a couple of months or get a loan from my family than getting a bad result.

Also, is it possible to get a consult remotely? That is sending in some pictures and getting an opinion on what is possible and an approximation of how many grafts are needed and how expensive it's gonna be.


Thanks! :)"

KBunnyDeer,asktransgender,How to get hormones in an EU country?,"Okay so here is the story, I'm not an EU citizen, but I have prescription and medical history written in Spanish/English; at the airport they only allowed me to pass meds for 3 months, but the duration of my stay is way longer.

Due to a very complicated situation I'm not allowed to leave the country or use medical services (unless emergency); but I need my hormones, now I have money stored for this, not much, but enough; but as it seems I can't buy.

Worse my hormones are messed up naturally, in fact without HRT my T levels are low as they become DHT (Other type of T) because cortisol raises the fuck up and TSH gets crazy. Somehow when I take estradiol, blockers and levothyroxine; it just works.

Now I don't know if you know what happens when you stop taking hormones in a abrupt manner. I have experienced that, and what it happens *to me*, is that I throw up constantly, get aggressive, the genitalia hurts so much that causes insommia and get depressed. After the aggression and genitalia pain settles, the depression and throwing up state remains (even with HRT I have problems to keep my food but lower cortisol keeps it in check as vomiting seems to be my natural response to stress), then dysphoria kicks in, until it becomes an emergency, and I'm fucked.

I asked about this to the authorities and they told me that my medical process is deemed unnecessary by law, that they were sorry.

I need this because I don't plan to go throught that again, much less then to be forced to detransition, I rather die, not again, and I'm not fucking kidding, because I'm sick of all this shit."

VVM258,asktransgender,Was anyone else relatively cis before puberty?,"I'm still in the questioning phase of things but something has been nagging at me recently. Of course, for many trans people they may not recognize their trans feelings or ""come out to themselves"" until their teens, or adulthood.

For me though, I legitimately think that if someone was to pull aside 7 or 8 year-old me and ask if I wanted to be a girl (I'm AMAB), I would have said no with all sincerity, and not out of repression. At that age, I firmly identified as a boy because I liked typically male things like Pokemon and video games, and wanted to be like my dad when I grew up and not my mom, because my mom was the stay-at-home caretaker variety and I wasn't interested in that lifestyle, and I preferred the male gender role of going to work and being the breadwinner. ""Yeah, being a boy is obviously right for me! All girls grow up, have babies, and only want to take care of the kids!"" I didn't ever wish I had a girl's body either.

Nowadays, I have a more enlightened self. I sometimes joke and say my childhood self identified more with the patriarchy. Once I reached puberty, I immediately began to get jealous of girls and didn't like my body hair. My sexuality revolved around being a girl literally the moment my sexuality began to develop, even without ever being exposed to porn or the internet. It was never anything else. And I suddenly developed this ""I want to know what it feels like to be a girl"" desire which over time evolved in my late teens to an ""I want to be a girl."" I would then dress in my sister's one piece bathing suits, shave the tops of my legs in secret, give myself boobs make of tissues under my shirt, experiment with tucking, the works.

Does anyone else have a similar experience of having literally no problems with gender before puberty, even in hindsight? I'm not talking simply about late realization, but whether you had a similar experience of not wanting to be another gender in childhood? The fact that I not only had zero problems with my gender but embraced being a boy as a kid bothers me to no end and makes me feel like all of this is sexually driven.

For the record though, my therapist is awesome when it comes to all this. I've been very upfront with him about my sexual side and we even have talked about the book Nevada together. He's totally onboard with the idea that this is more than a kink, and has told me that regardless of what my ultimate conclusions turn out to be, I have gender identity issues that need to be sorted out. I only wish other people here on this sub had therapists that weren't as judgmental when it comes to this subject.

However, I'm confused. Consider trans women. Trans women constantly insist that they are ""real"" women, that there is no substantial difference between them and people born with female bodies. So, if there really isn't a difference, should it be perfectly find for a born-female actor to play a trans character? After all, female actors are usually unrealistically beautiful anyway. No normal cis woman really expects to resemble them exactly. "

ThrowAwayAcct201701,asktransgender,"Question about dysphoria, (possibly) MTF","Since I was a teenager I've had a vague feeling that I would have preferred to be a girl, but in an abstract sense rather than a direct desire to become one (i.e. I had that feeling in the same sense I might also say I want to be a millionaire; true but that desire to be a millionaire doesn't drive me to want to do anything different in my life). This past August though, I began having a much stronger feeling of wanting to to be a girl and felt a pretty strong anxiety over it for a few weeks (to the point that it was basically all I thought about) and even when that strong feeling of anxiety passed, I still have a much stronger feeling than before that I'd prefer to be a woman, like I'll pass women in the halls at work and think ""ooh I'd want to look like her"" or ""I'd want her face but I'd want my hair to be more like *this*"" etc while with men, I might recognize a guy looks attractive or has potential but just needs to do X, but I don't ever tie that back to wanting to look like that myself. I pretty consistently think about wanting to be a woman, if I became a woman what I'd want to do with my hair/clothes/name/etc, how I'd handle telling the people in my life/work about it, etc every day.

I've been interpreting these feelings as possible dysphoria, but my problem is when I read experiences of trans peoples, I see common themes of a desire to cross dress from childhood, actively disliking their body/genitals as they are, a feeling of total disconnect with what they see in the mirror, anxiety so strong they develop a powerful depression, etc. I can't really say I've felt these things.

I don't really have any memory of wanting to wear my mom/sister's clothing and even today I don't really want to wear women's clothing (though I think a large part of that is the fact that I simply don't have the figure/appearance for it, like if I had a woman's body I'd absolutely have a list of things I'd want to try out). I don't really hate my genitals/body, if anything I actually feel a fairly strong indifference. I've never really cared how I looked or dressed beyond just ""appropriate for the situation I'm going to"" and ""as comfortable as the situation will allow"", and for most of my life my haircuts have always been ""as short as possible (without being noticeably bald) so I can put off needing another one as long as possible"". And outside of those weeks in August/September, I don't really feel a regular anxiety nearly as powerful as I see others describe.

My question for the sub would be, can dysphoria be experienced as a general apathy to ones body/appearance, or does this sound like I'm describing something else? I think I have enough to go off of to at least talk to a psychiatrist about it, and I'm aware mental health can vary a lot from person to person (i.e. two people can experience the same condition very differently), but I guess I want to get an idea of if what I'm describing sounds like dysphoria enough to bring it up to a psychiatrist or if this sounds like it could be something totally unrelated.

Thanks for reading my word salad."

Shadowchaos1010,asktransgender,Am I an asshole for having trouble thinking of a transgender friend as their preferred gender?,"Greetings, people of reddit. I apologize if this might not be the most appropriate sub for this topic, but I'm not sure where else it would go. If anyone knows of a sub that would be more appropriate for this, I'd like to know about it.

Anyway, onto the question itself. I'm 16, and have never really thought much about transgender people before in my life, until July of 2016. I went on a wilderness retreat for an after school program I joined, and one of the others was a trans boy. As the question says, I have a tiny bit of trouble viewing him as such. In social situations, I have no problem, and when I think about him, my mind defaults to calling him he.

I feel like my problem is the fact that I have a crush on him. I'm straight, and he's physically female. We get along well, have things in common, I care about him as a person, and I'm physically attracted to him, but at the same time it makes me feel guilty because of his gender.

Truth be told, I'm just rambling at this point; I feel like what I wrote has practically nothing to do with the question. I guess what I'm trying to ask is this: is the guilt I feel 'normal'? "

* Do i have multiple personalities in my head?
* Is this really me?
* Do i want this?
* Would i be passable?
* Who am i?
* What am i?
* Will these feelings fade?
* Is this just a phase?

So, that said, I do have family problems regarding transition and other things. Back in november my brother had a drug overdose, he's all right, but I had to stay in dad's house to keep an eye on him, the problem here is that me and dad are not in very well terms, I just cannot stand him, he mocks people for their skin, height, sexual orientation and every time I confront him, he just says I'm too immature for being mad at his sense of humor, the worse is that he does it in people's faces.

So long story short, he just can't accept me as his daughter, for him I will be always his son and that really enfuriates me, because he always plays low, on the defensive, everytime blaming me for tearing appart his precious family.

I love my brother and my mom, I guess I have affection for him, but I just can't stand him, the worst part is, he thinks he has the right to call me ""son"" becuase the great childhood he gave me, and to be fair it was great, but the later half of my life it's been almost hell for me because of his transphobia, I hid so many years in the closet because I was so affraid of him, and my mom always says he's right, becuase it's soooooo dificult for him to overcome his beliefs, well I'm sorry, but it wasn't exactly a smooth ride for me either, you know? I've already spent more than 15 000 bucks on transition, and that's only counting medication, and mom ann my brother already accept me for who I am.

So, if I go away, it's my fault family is torn appart, if I stay either I have to deal with the bullshit beliefs of my dad or confront him, wich he always supposedly wins because of the great childhood he gave me.


I want to live my future life, be happy with the life me and my SO are building together, and my family is holding me back, becuase I have to deal with my dad, and I don't want to live brother and mom behind because I love them, but they drag me with my dad every time.

I'm sorry for the long post, in part it's rant, and in part I need an advice on how to deal with this."
TransThrowaway3419,asktransgender,Being trans without childhood memories?,"Hi all

I've been questioning my gender for about 4 months now, and one of the things that's making me doubt this the most is that it seems like for everyone who's trans has some form of memory from childhood pointing to it. Whether it being realizing they're trans, or trying on clothes/make up, or playing with toys of the other gender. However, I can't seem to remember anything like that for myself. The earliest point which I had what I consider a trans memory was only a couple of years ago, in my last year of high school. 

It's not like the options wouldn't have been there for me, as I do have sisters. And it isn't that I don't remember things from that time, as I definitely do have memories from when I was younger. It's just that none really point to being feminine when I try to remember. I've been raised up as a guy the entire time and I've had no problem with that until recently. I was rather defensive of myself when siblings would effeminate me when I was younger. 

Sorry if this is yet another common question or if I'm not providing enough details. Thanks in advance. "
MissPurpIe,asktransgender,Not being able to get pregnant is killing me,"Hi I'm new here so I will start whit a bit of my back story, sorry for the wall of text. I will get to the topic in the end. I have all way felt in some way that I'm not a boy but a girl, when I was a kid I didn't know the implications of that, or even that it existed. When you are a kid you are more focused on the world around you than you're gender identity so it didn't effect me that much. Untill I got around 5-6 years old. My dad always whanted a boy and wasn't afraid to tell me that. When I was born the telegram on radio read ""It was what you whanted, it was one whit a dick""(it rimes better in Swedish) sent from my dads coworkers. When I was small I mostly played whit other girls. Not by choice, it was just natural for me, kids alike play the best or something. But I got gustions ""Don't you play whit any boys?"" and stuff like that, Mostly from my dad and it really got to me after some time. I switched my favorite color to blue from my real one, purple because of the reactions I got from other kids. ""Purple is a girl color so it can't be that""
and I was shy and just whanted to fit in. And favorite color is important business when you are 6-7. And I stopped using my purple nail polish mom bought me. And when I started fourth grade, I got enough of the ""why don't you play whit boys questions"" so after summer brake I remember standing in the school yard picking out a new friend and a boy this time. 

A few years later when I was around 12-14 and got a bit more self aware and I started looking up what was ""wrong"" whit me. I didn't know any transgender people and had never bin in contact whit it at this point. So it was like fumbling I the dark. I was so scared of 
someone finding out. Finally I found the information I was looking for, and that I was not alone. But I decided to never tell anyone, because if earlier comments was hard to deal whit it was nothin compadre to what this was going to be. So I decided to ingnore it, and as we know that always works great.

And now to current time and the title. After feeling like shit for several years and it just continued to get worse I hit rock bottom this last summer. I had long thought about suicide and the reason I'd didn't do it earlier was because of my family. I know they love me and I could not do it to them. But around June even that reason was not enough. I also drank a LOT of alcohol at this time to dampened the dysphoria, did not work thou.

My mom saw that I was more depressed than ever and started talking to me. And finally I decided  to tell her, and it was definitely the right choice. It was such a great relief finally. 

The day after I stopped drinking and contacted the local healthcare to get a referral to a special transgender treatment unit. 
  Knowing that there was long waiting time to get there I ordered HRT online. Staring HRT is the best thing that ever happened to me. The physical and mental changes has bean amazing even if I have long to go after just 5 months on HRT. And a lot of a other good stuff have happened since summer! I have changed my name, I have told all my relatives(they are not that many luckily) and they took it good, I have lost 34kg or 74 lbs and finally got the first contact whit the transgender care unit just before Christmas. So in all I feel a lot better now, that half a year ago. And now to the title sorry for my ramblings 

I have never really liked kids and I don't think I want any. So when I started HRT I knew that ship had sailed. But HRT for me is mutch more important than kids. In Sweden there is no private option to freeze sperm or eggs. And if I wanted it from the healthcare I would have to wait a year at best. Something I'm not willing to do. And stopping HRT for 6 months is a big no. And I'm fine whit that sacrifice or at least I was more fine whit it earlier.

After about 3 months on HRT I started to get really sad at times, mainly becose I can't get pregnant. Something that I didn't really think about mutch earlier. But now it's on my mind daily. And it starts to get real crippling at times whit anxiety attacks at random. And that's why I'm writing this att 5am. I don't know who to talk to about these strong feelings and its eating me up. I have mentioned it to my therapist briefly but I don't think she really got it, and I don't what to say anything that can jeperdice my gender ""investigation 
"" and delaying me getting SRS. But is it so weird to whant to carry your own child? What I can see, it's so rarely talked about when it come to transgender people. Yet pregnancies is sutch a big part of life even for us. I know that alot of cis women can't get pregnant. And that knowledge can destroy people, and lead to a lot of therapy and depression in the strongest of individuals.
I just feel like dealing whit that and gender dysphoria might be to mutch at times. What's your experience and thoughts on not being able to get pregnant? If you feel the same how do you deal whit it. I don't know how to get over it. Ther might be hope in the future but it looks far away.
Sorry for the long read and horrible English but I have to talk to someone as I'm having a really shity night..

amon_erin,asktransgender,Hormone levels?,"So my regular doctor has been out, but my psychiatrist did me a favor and ordered labs for me yesterday because I was concerned about my levels because I've been feeling better lately. I wanted to make sure it wasn't because my T was back up, thus invalidating me being trans. Which would crush me.

I'm at 16 weeks as of yesterday and my T is up and E is down from my last labs in November. In November my T was 22 ng/dL and as of yesterday it's at 35 ng/dL. In November my E was like 94 mg/pL and now it's down to 71 mg/pL. Those numbers are similar to my first blood test in September at two weeks of HRT.

I don't have a prolactin level from November, my doctor didn't order it, but in September it was 25 ng/mL and now it's at 44 ng/mL.

I'm kind of freaking out that this is invalidating me. It doesn't explain the dysphoria I feel. I know hormone levels will fluctuate at first, but I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick here. And I can't talk to my doctor until like next week if he returns my call. 

Any thoughts? Do these seem like they're okay numbers?

Edit: For the record I'm on 4mg sublingual Estradiol and 100mg Spironolactone a day (I take 2mg and 50mg twice a day). And my doctor said my numbers looked good in November."

Adrian52298,asktransgender,I don't think my mom will ever accept or see me as a girl or her daughter.,"My mom has been very weird at handling the fact that I'm transgender. My whole family too.

My family is okay with me being gay but not really okay with me being transgender. Weird right?

My mom constantly tells me to ""get over it"", ""accept yourself for what you were born as"" and ""just be a gay guy"" -_-

She's rather have me be a feminine gay guy than to transition into a female.

Mom - Look at this guy on my phone.

*Looks at MannyMUA on her phone

Me - Okay and?

Mom - Why can't you be like him? Still be a guy but wear makeup and everything?

Me - Really? -_-

Last night at the dinner table, she told me that I'm a handsome guy but I would make an ugly girl. 

""You're not ugly! I'm not saying your ugly but I mean you BE ugly as a girl.""

And I've been the constant butt of every joke around my house. Especially on my hair.

To sum it up, I've been growing out my hair but it's naturally curly and wavy. So my family pokes constant fun at it because it's ""nasty"" 

And when I straightened my hair and make it look nice, they say I look like ""Pasty Cline when she takes off her bandages!""

I honestly get the feeling that they just don't want to deal with it, or want to lose me in a sense. 

Money seems to be an issue too as my mom stated that ""we don't that have that kind of money to afford your surgeries and stuff""

But yet she brags on about how she wants to build up on our house and make another room or fix up the garage real nice and everything.

This whole transgender thing has really got me down. Especially on the lack of support that I'm getting."
Conflicted123456,asktransgender,Interpreting sexuality,"So, all my life I've felt attracted to females (combined with a LOT of envy tangled in there).  And while I can objectively identify good looking males, I've never felt any attraction towards them (though I do think fondly about interacting with dicks).

That being said, why do I seem to think about my future with a man rather than a woman? Is it some kind of internalised homophobia? Do I just not understand what attraction actually feels like? Something else?


The only conscious negative though I have about a lesbian relationship is that the concept of being equals feels weird to me, I wouldn't feel safe, I've hated to live up to the dominant male role to feel safe, but I'd feel uncomfortable I'd that sense of safety wasn't there (from someone else).

Sorry for so many questions. I don't think I'm willing to take any other AAs, since cypro worked out so well for me. When I was self-medding I used spiro due to my regimen basically being 'prescribed' by an American trans friend and the side effects were literally hell, and I have this gut feeling that Bicatulamide would be inneffecive and weak compared to cypro, and it hasn't been studied thoroughly so I'm scared of putting it in my body."

jdnfe,asktransgender,"Marx, and gender as a relation of production","I've just been thinking about this for a while and a bit about capitalism and materialism as it relates to the social construction of gender. Specifically, how the increased number/visibility of non-binary trans people in the last few decades indicates a change in production as it relates to gender.

  So, by ""relations of production, Marx and Engels meant the sum total of social relationships that people must enter into, in order to survive, to produce and reproduce their means of life. As people must enter into these social relationships, i.e. because participation in them is not voluntary, the totality of these relationships constitute a relatively stable and permanent structure, the ""economic structure"".""

  Obviously Marx is talking about class relations, but economic class is only one relation of production along with race, sexuality and gender, among others.

  Gender is (or at least was) a necessary social engagement in order to survive and reproduce a labour force. as a result men and women had very different relationships to production. Men were directly involved in producing value in factories or farms, while women were primarily involved in reproducing and maintaining that labor force at home (although I'm aware that there are plenty of exceptions to this rule in other modes of production).

  But in the last 100-150 years, technology has allowed that gendered differentiation in our relationship to production to break down. We have socialized education, daycare, food preparation–basically you name it. Even household chores like doing the dishes and laundry are automated with machines. The family became such an incredibly efficient unit that it has ceased to be necessary.

  And sexuality as well. under feudalism (and in previous modes of production) families needed to make a dozen children (labourers) just to ensure a basic existence because of how inefficient it was as a mode of production. But capitalism has become so highly developed that we have waaaaay more workers than we need, which has freed us with the ability to explore sexualities that would not have been previously possible/condoned due to the need for said sexual relations to result in reproducing children (a renewed labor force) for capitalism.

  Anyway, that shit blows my mind.

  TL;DR:  taking for granted that gender is a relation of production, the emergence in the acceptance of non-binary transgender individuals in the last ten to twenty years, and an increase in their numbers generally, shows us that women’s and men’s relationship to the production process became less discernible, thereby setting the stage for the dissolution of gender as a whole. What this increase in the visibility and number of non-binary trans people means, is that gender is becoming unnecessary as a social relation (as far as production, and reproduction is concerned) and that this may be an indicator that in the future–as capitalism becomes more efficient–gender will eventually cease to exist. So: a) The differences in women’s and men’s relationship to the production process is becoming no longer differentiated in a meaningful way, b) The differences in women’s and men’s relationship to the private property is also becoming no longer differentiated in a meaningful way via a slowly closing gap in wages, and c) Either efficiency in capitalist production in the west has become highly developed, we have had a sharp increase in our population, or a likely combination of both of these factors. THE COOLEST FRIGGING PART HOWEVER is that in the struggle for emancipation, women are performing what Frantz Fanon envisioned for POC, and Marx predicted the working class would accomplish–the oppressed liberate themselves via their self-abolition. Every step forward for the advancement of women is simultaneously a step towards the liberatory self-abolition of womanhood itself, and the increased number and visibility of non-binary trans folks in recent years is the prelude to this super cool and historic event.

ThrowawyOn,asktransgender,Do I sound trans?,"I don't think I want to be a man in makeup (not that there is obviously anything wrong with this, because there most certainly is not! But I'm just not sure if this is something I'd like because of discrimination, etc.) But I'm not completely sure if I'm a woman either. For example, in a relationship I'd like the woman, I think. I think I'd like to be the one who stays at home and does wifely duties, whilst my significant other is at work or out or something. I prefer women's fashion sense, I love skinny jeans, pumps, oversized jackets, leggings, jeggings, short shorts, things like that. I naturally have VERY long hair. The other day I imagined my life as a gay feminine man and it was literally me just virtually dressing in women's clothes, catering to all my significant others needs, getting laser hair removal on my face and MAYBE on my legs and other parts of my body, but definitely my face.

I know I'd prefer to be in the female gender role as it fits be better. I can express my femininity, but as I grow older, get more masculine, I don't know how I feel about being a VERY feminine gay man then!

MonicaRising,asktransgender,Transitioning in your 40's?,"So... I've searched reddit for feedback from other folks who have transitioned or who are transitioning in their 40's but there doesn't seem to be much. I'm aware of Jenny Boylan doing so at 42, but what about the rest of you? If by transitioning we mean coming out, then I guess I started at 42 by getting my nails done routinely for over a year which was definitely shocking for all who knew me. That was the first way I tried to create a disconnect in people's minds between who they thought they knew and who I actually am. About 9 months after first getting my nails done I started seeing a gender therapist. 6 months after that I started HRT. And now it's just about 3 months on HRT.  Now I'm 43 and will be 44 later this year. I'm married to a cisgender woman who is my heart and soul mate and she is beyond supportive and encouraging. 2017 will mark our 18th year together. We do not have nor will we be having any kids.

I am out to everyone i know as trans - both friends and family. The only person who hasn't been given the news in no-uncertain-terms is my wife's father. I seem to have lost my best friend of over 30 years as a result of being trans and our fundamental disagreement over a certain facist  president-elect...

And that's a super-simplified snapshot of my journey so far.

I could get into what finally motivated me to come out and start actually transitioning but I'll save that for another post or reply. 

The feedback i want to hear from you all is - who among you also started transition after 40? It doesn't matter if you have a similar situation as mine. I'm more curious about your personal success  [or not] in your transition. 

I hate to simplify things down to things like blending but that is part of it, obviously. I am told I blend on appearance pretty well but my voice and plenty of other things can quickly give me away. Anyway here is what I'd like to hear from you all on:

Do you blend?
Are you content with your transitioning?
How were you able to transition at work? [It feels impossible to me even though I work remotely. I still have colleagues and bosses like everyone else]
How did your family handle it?
How did your friends handle it?
How did your in-laws handle it?
How are YOU handling it?

Since starting HRT I feel much much better but that just makes me more nervous / concerned for my future because I know I cannot go backwards and be a content and healthy person. And so I feel like I am at a crossroads. Continue transitioning and face unemployment and unemployability? Or never publicly transition and be miserable?

I look forward to and welcome your feedback. Thanks for reading if you even got this far!"

blue_sword456,asktransgender,"since when was i privileged? ive never felt like i was, so why am i?","~~before i start, these are my genuine thoughts and concerns on this matter and i feel like i should make my opinion known. i also might sound like a broke record in some parts.~~

i feel like i owe an apology now, with all these posts telling me i have a privilege as a MtF on this sub. 

i havent been on here as long as some people have, so that may be why i didnt know, but since when was i given more importance over someone born as a female, with the same pain i feel, who happens to identify as male? since when was there a way to quantify this?

telling me that i have more privilege over someone with the same ailment is like shooting me and someone else, then telling me ""you were shot first, so youre going to be treated before this other person"". okay, maybe that wasnt the best analogy, but thats how i feel this is. we all have the same form of distress, and we all experience it in a different way. 

until i started feeling i wasnt meant to live as a male, i had never really experienced the 'straight white christian male' privilege that im now told i had. i actually feel like i was the underdog in my own story. my grades through middle school werent all that good, i was almost constantly bullied or picked on up until about 9th grade, i was a socially awkward mess with hardly any friends, i was the weird quiet kid in class, and i was called 'gay' a whole lot throughout my early school life. i look back on my middle school days especially with much disdain and resentment, which is normal for most people tho. 

but i never really saw myself as better than other people, unless there was a way to objectively prove that i was, like being in a higher position over someone on a leaderboard in a video game. theres no 'trasgender leaderboard', so why am i suddenly better than my counterparts? ive never felt better than any FtM, even if i sarcastically poke fun at the group every so often. 

if this privilege is from the mods putting issues from MtFs higher up than issues from FtMs, then its a problem with the mods. if its a group of MtFs putting themselves higher than FtMs, then theyre the problem. i dont think ive ever put myself above FtMs, at least, not knowingly or intentionally. 

so where is this privilege coming from? what did i do that has made me more privileged than my counterparts?

emveesprelude,asktransgender,Anybody have experience with acne and blockers?,"So I've got an appointment to start hormone blockers next month. YAY! Hopefully this will pave the way for beginning estrogen and actually starting my transition relatively soon which is unexpected, but exciting! 

One thing I've been worried about lately is my acne. I've had pretty bad back &amp; chest acne for the past 4-5 years, even after taking dairy out of my diet and eating vegan. It looks pretty much like [this,](http://www.acne.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/04292015-GETTY-481112395-MED-886x560.jpg) but maybe a few less active pimples.

A year or so ago my doctor prescribed me accutane but I ended up not taking it because of my previous depression and also insane fear of the hair loss, nightmares, and generally crazy risks that go along with it.

I've done some research and heard that high testosterone could be a primary source of acne, and that Spironolactone is even used to treat acne in females! So I'm wondering if any trans women could share their experiences with acne and HRT (specifically blockers). Did it help? Make it worse? I want to be able to wear cute clothes that don't cover my whole torso. :(

LucidDusting,asktransgender,"How much do you believe your gender expression/behavior/mannerisms, (not identity), has been impacted by gender norms?","I grew up in a rural environment in a conservative area, and went to a country school with all of 500 kids across 9 grades. TV was strictly monitored and limited and I didn't have regular access to the internet until I was 14. I didn't know trans people were a thing until I was 15. I went to high school in a large city but I never met anyone who really strayed at all from gender norms until university.


As a 'guy' this resulted in the curious case of me being the most gender-nonconforming person that I knew existed for a huge chunk of my life. And I'm not even that feminine. Every not-manly thing I did received push-back from my parents and peers. As I move further into my transition I feel like I'm relaxing a little from the social pressure, (I'm even being pushed to be *more* feminine), but I'm still trying to figure out where exactly I'm at. I'm sure one day I'll get there but I can't help wondering how much of who I am and how I act is shaped from my own experiences rather than natural inclination.


So, what are your experiences with gender norms like? Were you pressured hard to fit into a role that was alien to you? Were you gender-conforming as your assigned gender but now suddenly face being gender-nonconforming as your true gender? Does your gender expression feel completely natural and comfortable or is it a puzzle you have to sift through? 


Disclaimer: I firmly believe gender identity/subconscious sex has no real bearing on gender expression. This isn't even strictly trans related, but I was curious how other trans people feel as I'm sure it's something we all think about from time to time."
crazymyass,asktransgender,i feel so empty,so no i realize that i was literally born in the wrong body and im freaking out. i have no idea how to even begin taking the first step. im googling vancouver gender therapists so actually i do have a first step but thats it. family. work. my career. everything is up in the air. not having anybody to talk to about this is the most frustrating aspects. i have no idea if i will even pass but im even more freaked at the prospect of being alone forever. its 99.5 percent guaranteed that i wont be able to date or have sex in my current body form and it will sill be 90 percent chance i will be able to do those things once i transition. the real issue is that i dont think i can continue to exist in my current boy form.

twasanotherthrowaway,asktransgender,I have a question about removing a facial hair,"Okay, well, I have a small problem. My facial hair is mostly between my nose and upper lip, and a little bit on a chin (so I'm going to electrocute it). But I also have light, short and soft mesh on my cheeks. I'm curious if HRT will get rid of it, or I need to do an electrolysis on my cheeks as well?

I mean, they're like 0,5cm at worst, I can't even grab them with my fingers and barely visible from a closer distance, but when I'm touching my face it feels just bad. I know it's a common problem even in cis women, but I'm not okay with it.

Someone at my work has just come out as trans and is starting the process of male to female. This couldn't be a better job to do it, our GM is very socially liberal and has already changed her name to the name she wants to be called on the schedule.

Catoosie,asktransgender,"How do you take care of your hair? Any tips? Medium and long hair question, I think!","Hi.

I try to wash my hair with shampoo every other day if I have to go out regularly, then I use the conditioner. That however is not the case because I tend to wash my hair every couple of days in practice.
  
If I use only shampoo then it's very dry, puffy and hard to manage because it's straight like a pencil but it stays ""clean"" for like two-three days. If I use shampoo and conditioner it's nice and soft... for about a day or two MAX.

My hair becomes greasy really easy and conditioner makes it worse, obviously. Another thing is my hair falls out when wet and I mean a lot of it. More than of my mother, sister, step sister - you get the idea. I do not use hairdryers, I take out most of the water by gently squeezing my hair and then I use a towel, then I leave it to dry on its own.  
So, generally, what tips would you have for me, if any? 

Thank you.

DecadesofSun,asktransgender,"How can you tell if a person is trans, autistic or both?","I'm just posting this here with the realization that many people here won't really understand this issue, but I think there might be a few on here who do. As some of you may be aware, there have been assorted press releases lately about a possible correlation between transgenderism/gender fluidity, and autism spectrum disorders. Some people believe that there is a link between the two and that if a person lives with ASD in some form, they are more likely to experience latent trans feelings and vice versa. Now I'm not here to dispute whether these reports are accurate or not, although I do think it is something worth talking about.

The reason I ask is namely for myself. Ever since I was young my family suspected I may be on the spectrum, and to be honest knowing what I do now, I can't really blame them and have had the same suspicion for quite some time. However, there are a few things which also make me believe I may be trans and I don't want to conflate the two and mistake the symptoms of one for the other. Realize also I'm not here to speak ill against anyone   living with either autism spectrum disorders or transgenderism, and I'm simply here to try and understand my own conditions.

Reasons I think I might be trans:

My understanding of this came fairly late as far as trans people on average are concerned- I didn't start realizing what I may or may not be until right after my 21st birthday (I'm almost 23 now). After a medical crisis which cost me a lot of weight in a very short amount of time (I lost 20 pounds in a month thanks to an infection), I was forced to deal with the fact that I've never been comfortable with my body and have done a lot to fight against it. When I was a child, I often preferred my mom's clothes to my own, but seeing as I lived with a pretty conservative father, the closest I could get to cross-dressing back then was wearing her long shirts and robes to bed (she knew and wasn't bothered by it). When I was in first grade I asked to be a monarch butterfly for Halloween, which she agreed to and made me a costume for. Occasionally in the bath I would pretend that a washrag was a piece of girls' underwear (sorry for that image but it's relevant), and have been tucking ever since then when I'm alone (although I can't be bothered to do so in a normal social setting). As I got older I took an interest in LGBT issues and film, although at the time I just attributed that to believing I was bi and it was a secret pleasure in a pretty restrictive social environment. But only being bi didn't seem encompassing; there was something still missing. Around 16 I began shaving my body, which was something that started off only once in a blue moon, but has since become a habit performed several times a week. I hate the feeling of my body hair; it makes me feel much more ""manly"" than I'm comfortable with. And along with my changing body as a teenager came depression, partly because of that and partly for external factors, which never really went away. It hit a point where I simply wasn't taking care of myself at all, and that led to the infection. I didn't really care whether I died or not because life didn't feel worth living, although I didn't fully understand why until after it passed and I began regaining my health. Not long after I went to a trade school in the hope of masculinizing myself into a ""real man"", although that backfired and I ended up hating myself even more until graduation. It was only after I got away from that environment and began experimenting with more thorough shaving techniques, makeup and crossdressing that I began to feel natural about myself and who I want to be.

Reasons I think I'm probably autistic:

Unless you count Celtic music, art, cheesy romance movies, musicals and shopping as entirely girly things to enjoy, most of my interests until 21 or so have not been stereo-typically feminine. I've always had an affinity for machinery, particularly trains and ships which are common interests for people with Asperger's Syndrome. I was the kid lining my toys up in rows, taking immaculate care of them, and drawing blueprints of various pieces of mechanical equipment for hours on end. I was the kid who memorized useless information that no one else really cared about, something which has continued even to this day. I was always rather shy around most people, although my family generally attributed that to some traumatic events that happened in my infancy. Even still I've always been the odd one out, not quite fitting in with others around me and spending the majority of my time alone. I've never been particularly good at keeping relationships going, mostly because I get bored with others easily, though I've become significantly stronger in social interactions since high school. Then I managed to get into MLP as a teenager right when it became big, before it was also discovered that people with spectrum disorders are more likely to become fans of the show than those you might call neurotypical. Point is, I met a lot of the criteria for ASD but was never properly diagnosed, although by now it would be hard to tell at first glance because I've learned to hide it for the most part.

What concerns me now is the risk of getting the two issues mixed up. I haven't been able to see a therapist or counselor yet to get this sorted out, although I hope to do so later this year. I do think I have legitimate reason to believe I'm trans, but my dysphoria fluctuates so much that it's hard to gain a concrete measurement on it. Some weeks it's all I think about, other weeks I think I'm just fooling myself. And I'm a bit worried that since issues surrounding both ASD and LGBT issues have made such a splash in media and pop culture these last few years, there's a chance I might have bought into someone else's rhetoric and not noticed. I don't want to self-diagnose just because these sorts of things are being talked about elsewhere; it's more important to me to know the truth from an outsider's perspective whatever that may be. 

Sorry for letting this go on so long, but I figured there might be something to go off of with a board filled with people (hopefully) more knowledgeable than I. If anyone here has any input they'd like to contribute, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this."

PM-YOUR-FAN-THEORIES,asktransgender,Taxes and making the most of your Transition related deductions,"Hey everyone!

It's tax season and if you're as excited as I am about the new year, you've already gotten a head start on adult-ing and doing your own taxes.  
The most important thing I've learned this year is that if you are transitioning from one gender to another your HRT and/or surgeries considered *medically necessary* by the IRS are deductible up to a percentage from your Adjusted Gross Income! So exciting.

**Often-overlooked medical deductions:**

* **Travel expenses to and from medical treatments.** The IRS evaluates the standard cents-per-mile allowance each year. For 2015 taxes, the medical travel rate is 23 cents per mile. For 2016, low inflation pushes it down to **19 cents per mile.**

* **Insurance payments from already-taxed income.** This includes the cost of long-term care insurance, up to certain limits based on your age.

* **Uninsured medical treatments**, such as an extra pair of eyeglasses or set of contact lenses, false teeth, hearing aids and artificial limbs; This also includes necessary therapy costs to be diagnosed as MtF/FtM transexual.

* **Costs of alcohol- or drug-abuse treatments** can be counted on your Schedule A.

* **Medically necessary costs prescribed by a physician.** That means if your doctor told you to get a metabolic blood panel done the appointment -- and the cost of drawing blood itself -- could be at least partially deductible.

* **Some medical conference costs.** You can count admission and transportation expenses to the conference if it concerns a chronic illness suffered by you, your spouse or a dependent. Meals and lodging costs while at the seminar, however, are *not deductible*.

*""But /u/PM-YOUR-FAN-THEORIES, I already paid for my transition related surgeries years ago.""*  Not to worry, You still may be able to deduct some of the cost.  As long as you kept clear documentation of what you spent for the procedures and that the procedures were the right course of treatment for you, you'll be able to deduct them as long as the expenses come out to be ""more than 7.5% percent of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income""

More info can be found [right here](http://www.bankrate.com/financing/taxes/deducting-transgender-medical-expenses/) and [here as well](http://www.transequality.org/issues/resources/federal-taxes-and-transgender-people-faq).

Iyelexi,asktransgender,Washington no insurance cheapest mtf hrt.,"Long story short bad stuff happened with my family, we got kicked out, and had to move out of Oregon and to Washington to not become homeless.

Before we moved I had Oregon Health share insurance that made HRT extremely affordable. Basically once or twice a month I got a free refill. And even when it wasn't free it was generally very cheap at about 14 dollars. I had this health insurance via my SSI disability income.

Shortly after we moved I was in for a rude awakening as my Estradiol costed about 70 to 75$ dollars in a Safeway in Washington with no insurance and assumably the Sphiro is 85$ dollars a month

Currently I have a lot of Sphirolactone fortunately, and a smaller but large amount of Estradiol. We applied for my insurance just a few days ago and have no clue how long it will take to go through. We are also currently on a pretty tight budget as we don't currently have the 200$ in food stamps we did in Oregon either.

So anyways my questions are what should I do? Is there anything cheaper or fairly cheap I could do to help keep my estrogen fairly high or testosterone low at all if I ran out of medication?

Further more what's your advice on how I afford HRT at the cheapest price possible at this point? I've been on HRT just over four months now.

When we lived in Oregon my insurance was going to cover an orchiectomy after a year on HRT but we got kicked out and had to emergency move to Washington, hence I wasn't able to wait the 8 more months required for said insurance.

Any advice on how to handle this whole situation money wise?

lyn46,asktransgender,Is coming out via handwritten letter a bad idea?,"So while I came out to my mum last April after a rather awkward incident [(see post here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4fd857/so_my_mum_found_my_hormones/), I still have yet to come out to my dad and step-mum. While I know they're suspecting something, I've never confirmed nor denied anything. I have no clue how to bring this up in conversation, and frankly I have no desire to because I know it would be *incredibly* uncomfortable. I think doing so with a letter would still be personal enough, but at the same time, they would have a bit of time to process it before saying anything. Then when the proper time came, it could be discussed over a phone or video call. 

Has anyone had any experiences with coming out this way? If so, did it go well? Any do's and/or don't's? I'm still not 100% set on this method, but having them not knowing is getting to be more and more of an annoyance as time passes and it looks like it'll have to happen this way. "
idkdude999,asktransgender,How can I tell if I'm only questioning my gender because of others around me?,"Hello! This might seem silly which is why I'm on a throwaway.

So, I've been feeling weird about my gender for about 2 and a half years - ever since I discovered that nonbinary gender identities exist. I've met quite a few people who are trans/NB, and I'd say I know at least 5-6 at the moment.

My problem is that I feel extremely fake. I feel pretty weird when people call me a girl or use she pronouns, but I genuinely can't tell if it's because I got influenced from knowing trans people, if that makes sense. Like I'm subconciously trying to fit in or something. Also, I never necessarily felt uncomfortable with my gender before I realized that people could be trans. I only started questioning it a while after, which is another big reason I'm worried my feelings aren't valid.

I hope this makes sense. Basically, I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences or if I'm just a total fraud. I'm sorry if this is just totally stupid/doesn't belong here."
arthur990807,asktransgender,Am I MTF? I'm having some serious doubts here.,"So I'm _really fucking unsure_ of what my identity really is now. On the one hand, my preferred pronoun is 'she', and I definitely am _not_ a cis male (I'm AMAB). But on the other hand:

- the only feminine name I have for myself is one I _made up_, so I'm risking becoming a special snowflake if I try to use it IRL. I **do not want** to become a special snowflake.

- I don't pass at all. (In fairness, I haven't done anything to pass anyway, since I'm a LAZY FUCKING BUM and can do little but hate myself for it)

- And I'm not quite comfortable with being called a woman or girl.

Now I know that there's nothing that would make my identifying as female _invalid_, but holy crap, it feels so horrible not to be able to say that to myself with full certainty. ;_;

Calling myself agender or genderfluid also doesn't feel quite right. 'Nonbinary' is the only term I know I feel even remotely comfortable with.

Maybe this is because I live in a country where being transgender will probably become ILLEGAL pretty soon, and so treatment won't be available for several years before I emigrate, if I do at all.

I don't know what's right for me. I guess I could use some reassurance / emotional support? ;~;"

Terra2278,asktransgender,Unbiased private pass-ability opinion request.,"Hello, so I am trying to develop the foundations of a plan for saving up money to cover future surgeries. One of the things I am considering is FFS, however this is only a concern if I don't feel I can pass naturally. 

I am only about 3.5 months into HRT and just about 2 weeks at 4mg estradiol vs 2mg the first 3 months. So my effects are currently very minimal. I do understand it is really impossible to say what the end results of the hormones on my face will be. That being said I have no way of getting an unbiased opinion on my appearance since everyone that knows I am trans also has known me as a guy for a very long time, and thus are very familiar with my face. 

Additionally I really do not want to post my picture in a place that is accessible to the general public. For one I am an introvert, and my self confidence isn't great, second I have read stories about stalkers and such, and I really would rather keep that risk to a minimum.

Anyway, sorry for all the rambling, now to the question, is there a private way to get some honest feedback on how I currently look, and maybe some predictions on how optimistic I can be for changes over the next year or 2?

Sometimes it is a double edged sword. I feel as if I have to build success on top of success to feel good about myself while stagnation is harmful. Also, I have built a large network of colleagues, so I am making it difficult to come out because of the large number of people influenced.

Nothing has really hurt much, but my hips and knees are absolutely ON FIRE all day long. I'm noticing definite widening, which is awesome... But the pain is becoming almost unbearable. No matter what position I'm in, standing or sitting. During my first puberty, I got REALLY bad growing pains that would keep me home from school/sports, and these are almost identical to what I remember. My hips are honestly worse than I remember though. Walking sucks, I'm literally dreading a 15 foot walk to get something to help.

I'm under the impression I shouldn't take any NSAIDs, and I took a naproxen sodium tablet a few days back and would rather not add more to my pile of pills I have to take a day. MMJ is helping a little bit but I've been using it for so long that I can still feel the aching regardless of how much I use. I'd also rather not use my entire supply.

- always having had sexual fantasies as a girl

- took gender tests and got ""female"" a majority of the time

- fascination by gender bending themes

- majority of time choosing female avatars, including female names on some email accounts

- Seeing attractive girls, wanting to be w/ them and imagining being them at same time

- Maybe felt some jealousy of women 

- most dreams in past few years as female, feeling very happy in them, hoping to go back asleep to continue them. Also lucid dream to try to be female in them

justsallygirl,asktransgender,"[trans medicine] Let's talk about injections, needles, and syringes!","**Hormone Injection Hardware Explained**
--

So, you picked up your injectable hormones and you need to get them into your body. Chances are this is a new and terrifying thing to do and the doctor didn't go into much detail about the options.

I've used a lot of different syringe sizes and needle gauges over the last several years for many compounds consisting of estrogens, androgens, progestins, peptides, and anesthetics. As for the options available in the USA, most can be purchased online for super cheap compared to the local pharmacy or hospital without a prescription (because it's just metal and plastic, I mean come on CVS!)

---

**Simple Requirements**

The most important aspects to choosing your hardware are **gauge/thickness** and **length**. Secondary to those priorities is the **rigidity** of the syringe barrel - so that the plunger doesn't flex as you push into the barrel. 

---

**Flex, Viscosity, and things that go Bang!**

Long thin needles, flexing plungers, and thin plastic barrels can cause unwanted lateral movement, which leads to tissue damage and bleeding, so you want a rigid syringe whenever possible. 

Typically you'll see insulin and tuberculin syringes being the most flexible since those medications are easy to push through the needle with little resistance compared to oil based hormones that are thicker and require more pressure. If you are using insulin or tuberculin syringes without threaded needles and are pushing hard, it's not unheard of to have the needle blow off of the syringe - at which point your hormones go all over the place and there's some pain. 

Though uncommon and more expensive, self-retracting needles that are spring mounted can be terrifying to use the first time... play with one on an orange before using on skin... they go bang!

---

**Narrow vs Not... gauge is important**

* **What do the sizes mean?**: The gauge value goes opposite style; so a 25g is thinner than a 20g. Most of the time people use a thicker gauge (19,20,21,23) as a filler needle to draw the hormone out of the vial quickly, then switch (in the case of Luer-Lok style) to a narrow gauge for the injection. If you draw and inject with the same needle you will experience the fun of a dull needle (*it's not fun, actually*). 
* **Injection needles**: Many people use 23g for injections, though I advise against that due to the size of the hole it leaves and the propensity for inducing fear -- as the thicker 23g gauge hurts more than a 25g, plus the 23g carries higher risks for piercing veins compared to a thinner 25g-27g.
* **Multi-use Vials**: It's advisable to use the narrowest gauge filler needle possible if your hormone comes in a rubber-top multi-dose vial because thick needles do the same thing to rubber as skin - make a hole. The more holes in your rubber cap + the bigger they are = the more/faster air can get into your vial and degrade the hormone potency. I tend to prefer a 21 or 22g for the filler..
* **Glass ampules**: When using glass ampules instead of the multi-use vial, a narrow gauge filler will tend to not draw up little bits of glass that may have shattered when opening the ampule. Some brands have more/less of an issue with shattering and may benefit from one of the various types of ampule opener tools: https://goo.gl/Y291uT - there are also micron-style filtered filler needles, which will prevent any glass from being grabbed (can't find the link, sorry). 
* **Time and patience**: If you are pushing a lot of volume, like 1cc of thick ester (eg 40mg/ml EV vs the thinner 10mg/ml EV) then it will take noticeably longer to inject 25g vs 23g. If you have consistently shaky hands then you could ask your doctor for 10mg Propranolol, which is a beta-blocker that many surgeons take for that reason. If you don't mind the wait and you are in a pinch for hardware, it is entirely possible to use the cheap and bendy and readily-available 29g insulin needles to inject ~0.5cc of 20mg/ml estradiol valerate, or testosterone prop/enanthate for that matter... but if you can't find any other needles they will get you by until re-order. 

**Length, it doesn't have to be scary!**

* Needle length is important when dealing with IM (intra-muscular) vs SQ/SC (subcutaneous injection). In the case of IM the depth between skin and muscle tissue determines the required length, typically 5/8"" to 1.5"". In the case of SQ you want very short needles; 5/16"" to 1/2"" is common there. 
* Longer needle = higher potential for flex/rotation/alignment issues during insertion, during injection, and during removal. So get the shortest ones you can for your body.
* The most common IM length tends to be 1"" to 1.5"", which can come across as a little bit terrifying, especially when looking at a 23g or thicker needle. 
* For intra-muscular, if your injection muscle is close to the skin then you may benefit from the 5/8"" needles, which have reduced flex and carry less risk of tissue/bleeding issues. 
* Can you inject hormones via SQ instead of IM? Absolutely! This is a separate topic, which I can provide links for if anyone is interested.

One day when waiting for my botox appointment I was going through the drawers at the surgeon's office (everyone does this right?) and came across the best syringe I've ever seen. It's a thick walled BD 1cc that has an exceptionally smooth plunger. 

* **Image**: http://i.imgur.com/XI1JTI6.jpg *(BD 3cc 20g 1"" at the bottom for size comparison)*
* **Syringe**: BD 1mL Luer-Lok Disposable Syringe (ultra rigid). I convinced my endo to special order 150 of them for me, since they're not carried in my pharmacy: https://goo.gl/HGuszA
* **Injection needle**: 25g 5/8"" needle https://goo.gl/Ik2Yw5
* **Filler needle**: 21g 1"" needle (link is for 1.5"", same idea) https://goo.gl/tTNXJx

If my endo can order these for me, I'll be switching to the following needles. 

* **Filler needle**: 22g 1"" https://goo.gl/HjMelI
* **Injection needle**: 27g 1/2"" https://goo.gl/AO5m1g

In terms of ones that I've used over the years... gauges 32,31,30,29,27,26,25,23,21,20,19g and volumes of 0.3cc,0.5c,1.0cc,3.0cc - across three or four brands. So far the BD brand are my favorite. 

Here are the most common ones that I've used for hormones, which are also carried at most Walgreens, CVS, and Kaiser pharmacies. 

* Becton-Dickinson Tuberculin Syringe With Detachable Needle PrecisionGlide 1 mL 25 Gauge 5/8 Inch: https://goo.gl/xziRiA
* Kendall Tuberculin Syringe Monoject 1 mL 25 Gauge x 5/8 Inch Detachable Needle Without Safety: https://goo.gl/dzDj65

**Parting notes**

* Square bandaids are awesome. Regular bandaids suck for injections. 
* Always sterilize the skin with an alcohol wipe before injecting. 
* Have fun! Be safe! "
Elena1270,asktransgender,Dont feel trans or womanly enough,"I just dont feel trans enough or womanly enough right now. I am only on pharmaceutical HRT for seven months. I am only starting to go full time, my dead name is on all my documents and SRS is years off, if I can ever get it. Right now I feel I am but a boy in a dress and I hate it. I hate having this junk between my legs. I want it gone. I wish I was born without it  Feeling totally disgusted about myself right now. I wish I hadn't woken up this morning."
Hahaimtrulyinsanelol,asktransgender,Feeling so hopeless but I need to move forward. Can GD be managed? Or is transitioning my only real best option? I would be truly thankful for some advice!,"This whole process has been so difficult that I finally reached a point where my mind would snap and break down a few times a week. My depression has been so strong for the past couple weeks it's destroying myself and my wife. I can't wallow in depression anymore...I need to do something or it'll be over for me. Time to figure some things out and make something good happen.

The depression was from hopelessness. The idea that my two choices at age 28 are transition and live a life of hell and have a wife wouldn't be attracted to me, or live as a guy in a life of hell. My brain perceived a no win scenario, and a fierce depression set in. I can't do that any more. I know I mostly have to figure this all out on my own, but I need some help too.

Alright, first step: Do I actually have gender dysphoria?

Why I think I have it:
- Symptoms started slow as I discovered GD and have become incredibly strong now, to wear I can't not look at attractive women and wonder what it would be like to be them.    
- Saw two therapists, and albeit I obviously can choose what to tell them, but I was honest at the time and both believe me to have serious gender dysphoria.  
- Cross dressed secretly as a high schooler and I remember now being jealous of girls as they developed. For a while I was afraid of marrying a girl with large breasts because it would disturb me.  
- Speaking of which, an unusual obsession with breasts and having them.  
- Never felt like I fit in at any point, and even when I had some close friends felt isolated beyond just them.  
- I've noticed my depression lessen in moments where I'm referred in some way to being female.
- Inability to play female player created MMO characters because it disturbed me so much. I've tried to at times and enjoyed the feel of playing the female character and wasn't just obsessed in a sexual way. I enjoyed the female pronouns being used in reference to my character and I would have to delete it out of shame later.  
- Jealousy and despair, yet a sense of hope and fear when looking at transition timelines, which even the act of was shameful to be and had to be purged.  
- Secretly bought and wore women's jeans and leggings and enjoyed wearing them all day under my work pants.  
- History of mental illnesses like depression, severe anxiety, ADHD, alcohol dependence, and increasingly worsening OCD.  
- Fantasizing for most of my at least high school and adult life about the idea of transforming into a woman permanently and enjoying the thought of it.  
- Depression and ability to focus and be happy and relaxed has gotten severely worse the more I've looked into and discovered the possible presence of GD, and now have noticed when I've been called sir or mister.  
- Never have had a macho or alpha personality, and the way I think and write seems to match more closely to girls than guys.  
- At times, extremely powerful urges to be able to wear a bikini or bra or dress.  
 
Why a part of my mind doesn't think I have it:
- Symptoms this strong didn't show up until about a year ago.  
- I take a lot of medications that may alter what I think I want.  
- In the mornings I'm usually embarrassed about thinking I had GD the night before.  
- I like sports, metal music, video games, and have an aggressively competitive spirit, especially while working out.  
- The GD fades and comes back in waves. And I haven't had the previously unstoppable urge to buy and wear women's clothing since my wife found out about a month ago.  
- GD seems to intensify when I have alcohol, making me believe it's a product of that.  
- The symptoms hit me the hardest and began this whole process when I started a new dose of Adderall for ADHD last year.  
- Have never felt like I would be a mom. Or that I would rather be an old woman than an old man.  
- Haven't outwardly hated my body or genitals outside of disliking chest hair, and feeling like a gross ape all the time.  

If even the thoughts of questioning which gender I would be happier as disqualifies me from being truly cis-male than the evidence above probably means that I have gender dysphoria and I am transgender.

I know ultimately I have to be the one who figures out if I'm trans or not, but what would you think based on what I've said above? I think I am, but wouldn't mind hearing another opinion.

I've been married for almost two years now, and dated my wife for 6 years before our marriage. She's known me since middle school. So a few months ago when I told her she was believably shocked and confused, because I had been the exact opposite my whole life. But I was also kinda just figuring it out.

I love my wife more than life, and this has been another intense source of depression. The thought that me transitioning would hurt her so much. And yet, I've been so depressed she believes that our combined happiness would at least be higher if I allowed myself to be happy.

But would transitioning make me happy? Sometimes I think it would change my life and make me experience feelings I've never felt. And sometimes I feel like I would be entering living hell and destroying my fairly attractive and gifted male self.

Because this was eating at me for more than a year, our communication really suffered and only now are we finally opening up again, and that has helped a lot. She has said she wouldn't ever leave, but the thought of me transitioning is something she couldn't handle right now.

And we do want kids, but she will not accept the idea of storing sperm and also having to deal with transition while she's pregnant.

It's a complicated issue and we are going to really start working at it now that I'm dedicated to coming out of my depressed shell.

So what should I do? This weekend we were planning on maybe buying some clothes for me and doing some makeup and me just hanging out with her in our house to see how it would feel. I've shaved my legs and painted toenails but that's as far as I've gone and it didn't seem to do much to help or hurt my depression.

But is there any other way to approach this? To know if my lifelong mental issues would begin to go away if I pursued transition?

I'm still very confused and was bordering on hopelessness for a while. But I can't do that to myself or her anymore.

Perhaps me exploring this and seeing if it makes me happier will also help my wife get used to it and see that it maybe isn't that scary?

Or can I somehow get back to where I was just moderately depressed and just get through life like that? Learning about the gender dysphoria has made everything worse. Can this condition be managed? Can I take anti depressants and somehow with a positive attitude and understanding conquer this thing? 

My dysphoria tends to really waver in these ""landmark"" steps, and I feel myself tempted to cancel the idea and just forget about the whole thing. And it might be super awkward to dress up in front of her and pretend that I'm something that I might not be.

Regardless I need to start being assertive and positive and finding solutions or I'll wilt us both away.

If you have any additional advice for me I would really appreciate it. I'm doing all that I can to not fall apart.

Thank you so much for everything, and your help really means the world to me!

I know there are a couple trans students in the club, and the school environment is pretty positive. For me as a high school student (for context, I'm a sophomore in college and a few years on T), it would have been very positive for me to see a functional trans adult in person, though besides the fact of my presence, I don't really know what to say, or what discussion topics to bring up. High schoolers: what sorts of information do you think would be valuable or discussion topics that you would want to hear about? My thoughts were trans housing in college and applying to college while trans, and also medical and legal specifics in my state, though I would love to add to this list. "
WashedRindThrowaway,asktransgender,Am I any kind of nonbinary? Is there any word for this identity?,"I don't normally post here. I'm a trans woman, 22 coming up on 2 years on hormones, passing full time and in the process of trying to go stealth. As a result, I've found /r/asktransgender less and less relevant as time goes on, but it was definitely helpful to me early on in my transition, and I'm thankful for it. Now, I'm stealth even on my main account here on reddit, mainly because I post pictures of myself, plus the drama that follows trans people in subs I frequent. Suffice it to say, I'm pretty secure in life in general and in my identity, and as time goes on being trans becomes a vanishingly small part of my life.

But recently, a conversation with a nonbinary friend of mine made me think. I always sort of considered myself an edge case, regarding binary/nonbinary identities, the primary indicator being that I have no genital dysphoria. My friend initially told me they didn't think that made me nonbinary, because regardless I still always identify as a woman, but they seemed to change their mind when I explained that the reason I always identify as a woman is partly because of how I think about social classes. I identify with the socially constructed class of ""woman,"" consisting of the people society ascribes femininity to and perceives in daily life as female, because in terms of physical features that people use to identify one another (ones that show through clothes), the features that do not cause me dysphoria and with which I identify are female secondary sex characteristics. So, by the measure of socially constructed classes, I'm a trans woman, because I identify with those features which would see me sorted into the category of woman in daily life.

The reason I think I'm still an edge case of being nonbinary is, if I existed in a society without any sort of socially constructed gender classes, if people simply took others physical features at face value and did not further use them to sort them into anything other than objective categories/spectra, I would not be fully trans-female, as due to my lack of genital dysphoria, I don't fully identify with all the features of a binary-sexed female body.

So... basically I don't physically identify with a binary sex, so in a perfectly gender-abolitionist world, I'd be nonbinary, but because I perceive the social construction of gender as a consequence of perception, and in all capacities that I want people in daily life perceiving me by I do identify with feminine features, I'm always a binary-identified woman. Is there any sort of name for this sort of identity? Binary trans-woman but not necessarily wholly binary trans-female?"

asktransgendertw,asktransgender,What's the point in living if I won't be a ciswoman,"Everyone on this sub just says about transitioning will fix it. It won't. 



I've missed out on my childhood of being female. I'll never know what it would of been like to be female as a child. Never. 


I'll never be able to be a ciswoman. I'll always be trans. I'll always have memories of being male. I've always been brought up as a boy. 


Just to make myself as female as possible I'll have to do HRT, FFS and SRS. I dont want to have to go through that, but that's the only way I can make myself feel more female, but after she I'm sure l will feel like a fake woman anyway. 

I have a masculine personality and its not that feminine which I hate so much, it makes me quite dysphoric just thinking that I like masculine stuff and not feminine things. 


I'm living as male at the moment. Everyone thinks I'm a cis male. I just can't deal with it anymore. I have so much anxiety to the point I can't even pick up the phone to make an appointment to get a referral to a GIC. My family is transphobic. My friends think transgender people don't exist. 



Since I was 12 its really pissed me off that girls have been able to dress like that. They can wear dresses, high heels, makeup, everything and just feel great. Wearing male clothes are utter shite, I've known that since I was 12. 


If I think about me being happy with life is if I were a ciswoman. Being MTF isn't enough for me.

I've decided that there is no way I can live my life without at least attempting to be a girl, and I have decided I want to start hormones now. I am planning on going out of state to college and the ability to be a girl right when I'm on campus sounds awesome, and I purposefully only applied to trans-friendly schools. However, I'd like to stay in the closet with my parents until I'm confident enough to let them know, and have financial security as they are potentially unaccepting. This leaves me in an odd pickle where I am underaged and in the closet, but I want hormones. My current thought is to buy prepaid Visas and use them on hormones online, as I have a job but my mom can track my MasterCard. Do you guys think this will work? If so, where would you recommend I buy them from and what hormones and dosages would you recommend? My guess is spiro 50 mg twice a day and 3 or 4 mg of estradiol once a day? I'm 6' 2"" :( and ~190 pounds, although I plan to lose weight.

If you guys don't think I should go the prepaid Visa route what would you recommend?

transthrowaway314159,asktransgender,How often do you feel like people probably completely misinterpret what you've come out about?,"Especially when you do not have the time or possibility to explain to them in-depth at the time what it means to be trans*, or even worse, when someone else outs you to others.

Even being LGB is often misinterpretted (that it's a choice, etc.) but at least people generally have a better idea about what that more or less overall entails than what coming out as trans* means.

It feels really horrifying to think that when I come out as a trans woman, people will understand ""some supergay freak who wants to trick straight men into having sex"" or ""perverted crossdresser who should not be allowed into locker rooms / bathrooms"" or ""mentally delusional person who needs '*proper* medical treatment' like conversion therapy instead of 'enabling' "" or etc. ...

I'm not confident with what i want anymore. I want to be a boy, look like a boy, lesson my dysphoria by being a boy but for some reason i'm completely doubting everything happening in my head.

I feel like i've convinced myself i have dysphoria but it's not really there and at the same time I feel like i have dysphoria and am trying to convince myself it's not real. I don't want to be trans and take hormones my whole life or be a man with a vagina.

I'm scared to look in the mirror and see a girl but i'm scared to look in the mirror and see a man. I can't picture myself growing up as a man and I can't picture myself growing up as a woman. I think i miss being seen as a girl because when i was seen as a girl i was seen as sweet, kind, loving. Now i'm seen as a strange/unfeeling boy. I just don't see myself at all in any part of me anymore.

I'm scared that what if i somehow convinced myself i'm trans and all of my dysphoria actually stemmed from my eating disorder or severe lack of confidence. I'm scared that i might turn out to be an ugly man and i'm scared of being in that in between phase where your voice is dropping, face is changing, curves are uncurving, body hair starts growing....

I have never felt more confused and scared in my life. I don't know what to do and i feel so completely alone. I have no one to talk to and i really just want this all to end.

Here's how i see it, i have two options:
Option 1: i start hormones and see how it goes. I continue living as a man
Option 2: i go back to living as a girl and ignore any and all feelings of dysphoria

With either of those options i feel i would be unhappy. Please share any advice or experiences you have"

_Amoeva,asktransgender,"Bisexuality and being trans, and how you're attracted by both genders","Hello there,

I saw a lot of topics about how sexuality is changing with HRT and how bisexual transwomen experienced a stronger attraction to men when they are on it.

My question isn't about that, i'm not on HRT for now.


I'm bi/pan, and my body... reacts differently depending of genders.

I kinda always have an erection when I feel attracted by a girl. And it happens a much less when it's about boys, even if my attraction has the same ""intensity"" in my mind.

It's like when I'm attracted to a guy, I don't feel the need to get hard-on. I don't feel it at all. 

To be honest it's strange, since I'm not attracted to girls in an ""heterosexual way"". I don't see myself as a man in any kind of relationships. I'm a woman. It's not about that, I think.

It is only a difference between being attracted sexually and romantically ? I never experienced a relationship with a men as a women, only lesbian then gay couple (my life is weird)

Anyone can relate something like that ? "

I'm nearing 12 months hormones and I've got nothing to show other than some puffy nipples. I know the whole 'one year mark doesnt mean youll pass' thing, but just. idk. it's discouraging, it feels like I'm falling behind for lack of a better term. 

I had some breast growth 2-3 months ago where there was an obvious change from 'male bodied pectoral muscles' to 'teenage with less curves than a washboard' and went through the whole 'my chest hurts my nipples hurt' thing and there was obvious change so i was happy. But now it's just. My tits hurt all the time (past 3 months or so) and absolutely nothing. I know transwomen won't have as large as breasts as ciswomen, but this can't but all I'm getting, can it? "

NotSeeEngergy,asktransgender,Is what I am experiencing gender dysphoria?,"Hello to everyone,

This is my first post on reddit in general and I'm hoping you all can answer a question. For about a five or so years I have been toying with the thought of what my life would be like if I were a woman. Prior to this I never honestly payed much attention to thoughts like these but they really became present within the last five years.

These thoughts as well came about when I was diagnosed with a severe depression. As well for disclosure I was diagnosed with the intrusive thoughts variant of OCD. 

The thoughts as of late have become more focused on my appearance as I imagine how a more femme figure on myself would look, as well as spending good amounts of time messing with my face to try and make it look more feminine. 

As well since I was younger I could remember always sort of feeling this ""Rebellious"" urge to play as a female character option in video games, or in other things of the sort in private. I do also remember listening to my parents plan if I had been a girl and being mesmerized by that reality. 

So I come here to ask at this subreddit if what these thoughts I am having are gender dysphoria? I fear I am sort of reaching a peak time to fully consider transitioning (22 years old) or to just continue on accepting these thoughts as just plain old curiosity. 

Thanks in advance :)"
EloiseSkye,asktransgender,Is there a difference between wanting to be x gender and feeling like you are (or not) x gender. Does it matter if there is or isn't?,"Something I've been struggling to pin down is my identity. I know I should be on the feminine side of the spectrum, but in my head I feel like I can't be a girl. I feel like I'm agender but on the girl side, but I want to be a girl. Idk I like being neutral a lot but it feels very impractical in the large sense of things. They pronouns feel good but people in my family keep fighting it so I gave up. I don't like the idea of being ma'am or sir, but I like miss. Ideally I could be no gender but in the way society works it's very much a problem. Do I play on the mens/women's sports teams (why are they even segregated except at the very highest level), do I change with the men or women, men or women's bathroom etc. I just use the men's right now as I'm amab and only 9 months hrt (still living male full time). I would use the women's for all if I had a choice but then why do I still want to be neutral rather than a woman? I don't like being referred to as male or female but I prefer male because it's what I'm used to but I want to just be me if that makes sense.

When I change my name and try to get a new passport I was thinking about going for Mx. and x gender but it just causes more hassle than it's worth because not everywhere recognises nonbinary. 

It's like I want to be as much of a girl as possible but I am not a girl. 

Idk what I'm trying to say I'm just rambling, what are your opinions on the title question? (And let me know if it wasn't phrased well, I tried to make it as inclusive as possible but I'm worried it doesn't really apply to nb people as well as it does the binary people)

(On another note, are there any other active subs/places I can interact with nonbinary people, more specifically agender and amab transfem nb people?)"
jemthememe,asktransgender,"do you believe that trans guys have it easier over trans girls or vice versa, or neither?","As a generally visually passing trans guy I can tell from experience that it's easy to be mistaken for a butch lesbian as soon as I open my mouth. Trans girls can do voice training and make their voice feminine without estrogen. But visually, being 14, I appear to be my own age, although that will change in a few years, as most pre-T trans guys in their twenties still appear to be cis boys in their early/mid teens. Especially since I'm 5'4"". Height-wise I think trans girls have it easier because being a tall girl imo is better than being a short guy. Tall girls are seen as models whereas short guys generally have a harder time finding partners due to their height (yes there's research on this). However, back to facial appearance, with heavy makeup a trans girl can appear fairly feminine but without makeup, trans girls might have a masculine face, but it really depends on what their facial structure already was. In terms of acceptance, although it's harder for a ""feminine man"" (in quotes because trans girls are girls/women not men) to be accepted by society, I've found that in general, teenage girls are more accepting of lgbt+ people than teenage boys. Personally I've been made fun of a lot for being ""a lesbian who wants to be a guy"" and cis guys usually don't want me hanging around them, but a trans girl at my school has lots of female friends. I guess in the end neither of us have is easier. 

also, i've found that going stealth (dunno if this was obvious) makes it easier for people to dismiss a guy's feminine feature or a girl's masculine features as just part of how they look. 

edit: i'm not pitting people against each other. i just want to see people's opinions on this. "
femmejean,asktransgender,Is it possible for someone to be anti-trans without being religious or having grown up in a 'traditional' culture?,"I have gender dysphoria so I can't really be anti-trans (and I'm not), but this discussion is about those who are firmly resistant or extremely against transgender.

In my anecdotal experience, I don't believe that anyone can express hostile ideas without having being shaped by largely by their upbringing. There are two things which I think contribute to the anti-trans mentality:

1.) Religion - Specifically Islam and Christianity. A lot of anti-trans people are unsurprisingly religious or have a strong childhood influence from religion. The idea of being transgender undermines the idea of having faith in a 'God that makes no mistakes' and 'complementary' roles set out by Allah or God.

2.) Traditional Gender Dynamics - If 1 is not the case, then this one certainly is. Even among atheists or non religious people, there are some who are raised by parents that emphasize on 'being a real man'. A similar but equally important element is the idea of 'dealing the cards you were dealt with in life' mentality not just in gender but many aspects of live that  which explains why some tell trans people to that 'Your a man/woman, deal with it'.

I think these two are the main ones. I don't personally think its conceivable for a liberal man/woman growing up with accepting parents to develop hostility at the level that I see some anti-trans individuals expressing; but maybe I'm wrong

What do you think?

Infaemous,asktransgender,People who realised they were transgender later than than their teens; what were the general feelings you had before you realised you were transgender? What was your life like?,"It has been very difficult for me, personally, to come to terms with my transgenderism, as I had always thought of myself as a man until about 22/23. I know I had had DOUBTS since I was about 14, but I didn't realise what these were, and figured they were just something to do with puberty. I didn't even consider that I might genuinely be transgender until about halfway through last year, and I am now almost 24. 

The thoughts I had earlier, were that I really wanted breasts, even at 14, I found it ""unfair"" that girls got them and I didn't; I looked at girls with both sexual attraction AND jealousy, and I assumed the jealousy was a natural part of sexual attraction. When I was 15 I watched a documentary called ""Boys with Breasts"" about men who developed gynaecomastia, and was confused as to why anyone would want to get rid of their breasts, as I had wanted them so badly. I never fit in with guys, as I could never do sports due to a problem with my legs, but despite that I did have ""guy"" or at least gender-neutral interests (violent video games, action movies, guns, violent music). Nonetheless I always found talking to girls a lot easier than talking to guys; I'm not saying I didn't have male friends, just that I felt more of an affinity with those of my friends who were female, even if I didn't share their interests in clothing, rom-coms or whatever other gender stereotypes I feel like throwing into this post. That was more of a minor thing, though; Moreover, I just feel like I've been pretending my entire life, that I'm not who I think I am, that I'm a fake who's playing the part of who everyone else thinks I am in some kind of elaborate stageplay; I wouldn't say I feel ""trapped in a male body"" as one of the most common transgender stories seems to be, but I feel like my mind is in a cage, that I'm a fraud. I've been plagued by anxiety and depression for much of my life (though I've never attempted suicide), and conventional medications and therapy never seemed to help. For some time I had severe religious OCD, and was convinced my soul was in danger because I believed I was gay. The more I analysed these thoughts with a therapist (I got CBT), I realised that I wasn't gay and that I deifnitely only liked girls, but SOMETHING still felt wrong. So I moved on from religion and just concluded that I was weird.. Until I started talking to transgender people, and correlating bits of my experience with theirs. It's difficult though, as my mind has changed so much (I had developmnetal difficulties when I was younger, but am now completely caught up if not beyond) that I can scarcely remember much of my life, as I was such a different person.

Naturally, the fact that I only realised later, that I am ""straight"" (from a male perspective), made me think that when I started considering this, I was going nuts... People who've started transitioning at around that age or people that are transitioning who realised around my age.. I'd really like to hear your stories so I can correlate. 

If you took the time to read this massive wall of text, thank you so much. :D

tipdrinker,asktransgender,How do I convince my psychiatrist I'm trans?,"So I've been living full time as a trans woman for about six months now. Unfortunately in Ireland, in order to get access to an endocrinologist, receive hrt and get surgery within the public health system I need a diagnosis from a psychiatrist (two for surgery) or clinical psychologist. I have finally gotten a meeting with one in March at my local public mental health facility after months of waiting and chasing up. At one stage they declined to see me, preferring me to go to counseling until I explained I can't get access to healthcare until I'm essentially diagnosed with a mental disorder!!!

Anyway I'm quite apprehensive about the whole thing. I fear the person I do meet may not be overly familiar with giving such a diagnosis. I want to be sure I get what I need. So I'm wondering if anyone has knowledge of what to expect, questions I'll likely be asked. What answers I should give. How I should present myself etc etc. Any psychiatrists here?

Personally I find the whole idea of diagnosis quite frustrating and annoying and I haven't even started yet. It's already been a four month wait since I went to my local doctor initially. They even lost the referral letter and I had to send it again, both through my doctor and a personal hand delivered letter. I tried to get the doctor to contact the endocrinologist also to get me started on the 9-10 month waiting list, stating that I'm awaiting diagnosis to see them but they won't even do that without the diagnosis. The thoughts of them making a judgement that I'm not trans enough or dysphoric enough to get access to hrt and surgery fills me with dread.

Honestly the whole thing has contributed to anxiety and panic attacks. Something I've never had before so any information would be thoroughly appreciated."
anchorex,asktransgender,Coming out to my friend. Any tips/stories?," I am an 18 year old FtM, who still hasn't started transitioning. I plan on moving out in June/July to later attend college in fall. My initial idea was to not come out to anyone until I had moved out, and then only come out to my family, and not talking to any friend I had made in my home town ever again, because of fear of being rejected.

However, recently I had started thinking of coming out to my best friend. I guess I just want to be able to talk about this kind of things with someone I trust. We have been best friends for three years, known each other for six. He has known about my depression/suicidal thoughts/addictions and has never treated me badly for that; he has helped me out.

Still, I am not sure how he would react. We have never talked about transgender, so I'm not sure how he feels about it. I am scared because he is Catholic, and all his family is. However, he has LGB friends and he has never had a problem with them. But sexual identity is really different from gender identity.

So, have any of you come out to really good friends you've known before you started transitioning? How did it go? Any tips for coming out to my friend [or should I just not come out to him?] ?"

curiousortrans,asktransgender,Trans or just curious about being female?,"I've always been curious what it were like if I were born female. But now I'm starting to think I'm trans, but I'm not sure. 




I've been considering transitioning, but I genuinely don't know if I should or not. 



I constantly think what if I were born a girl and not a boy. Sometimes I feel like I'm so curious about being a girl I want to transition and go on HRT because of it. But maybe it's an obsession I have related to my aspergers? 



When I'm alone I can get quite upset about being born male, but when I'm with others I don't really think about it. When I'm with others all I can think about is how the thoughts aren't there. 


I don't know weather what I'm experiencing is gender dysphoria or just overly curious about being female? Can anyone tell me how to tell between the two into what I might be having? 





Maybe it's because I was raised by parents with strict gender roles? Growing up because I was raised with strict gender roles. They would never like me to have anything pink. But I never questioned it because I was a boy and boys don't do that.

ThrowawayA2SEP,asktransgender,Does anyone else have these impolitic thoughts regarding GRS?,"My apologies in advance: I'm *not* talking shit about people that have had GRS and are satisfied with the results, more power to them.

So when I look at modern GRS techniques I can't help but feel that they're simply too underdeveloped, not advanced enough, and just generally not satisfactory to me. I look at the modern stuff and I see techniques that aren't much different from decades ago, being a glacial-pace gradual refinement on the same damned stuff. The closest to that would be the famous Thai chonburi technique, which is still merely gradual refinement. 

If I were to cough up the money to get GRS done, well, I am fully aware that a neo-vag has some limitations compared to the standard issue ones. I mean, it just comes off as even a bit primitive that dilation is even still required, much less for the rest of one's life. They're easier to damage than a birth-issued vagina. Plus there's the whole lacking of proper organs part. Hell, even if I had the right organs the male hips aren't built for fetal gestation anyway.

I mean, overall, I just find that the modern GRS techniques are not good enough, which is very frustrating, because were it not for those issues I'd be very glad to have it done. I mean, it's almost like why even try if this is the best thing available?"
Peter__D,asktransgender,Am I autogynephilic?,"I've always been a more femme guy, but never felt like I was in the wrong body until last spring. When I was 13 and found out about transgenders, I would daydream about transitioning and how wonderful it would be. When I was 15 I would always imagine myself as the woman in sexual situations, and occasionally would cross dress, resulting in me being turned on and then masturbating. Just less than a year ago (at age 18) I started to lose my urge to masturbate, and porn became a lot less appealing to me. During these two to three week periods of abstinence, I would become really uncomfortable with my body, wishing that it could be more feminine. I would work on my posture and body language, I would get really jealous of women at my college; I even started growing my hair out. 

Over the summer I was then a counselor at a Christian camp, and repressed my feelings for two and a half months in an attempt to overcome them. Shortly after the end of camp I felt like I was going crazy, I started watching porn and masturbating again. It wasn't consciously to make my dysphoria go away, but I didn't really enjoy it. At least, nowhere near as much as I had in the past. 

Around mid November I had came to hate my sexuality so much that I stopped masturbating. My dysphoria came back then, and it was worse than it had ever been. Up until December my dysphoria was mostly a jealousy of cis-women that resulted in me cross dressing a little bit. Early December my dysphoria started to become actually hating my own genitals and masculine features like a strong jaw line. As of last night I masturbated for the first time in a few weeks. Of course, I pictured myself as the girl while doing it, but as soon as I was done I hated myself for it. I felt repulsive and gross. For the past month or so I've only been comfortable being a guy about 20% of the time. The rest of the time I feel some form of discomfort around being male, usually stemming from my ""package"" when cross dressing now I still get an erection at first, but I'm not mentally aroused. The thought of being a woman doesn't arouse me unless it's in a sexual context, but I still wish I could be a woman in just everyday life. 

For some reason I feel that it's important to mention that my hobbies, clothing, and general demeanor are neither stereotypically feminine or masculine. I dress somewhat androgynously, and my closest friends are female. Although I'm attracted to women, I feel like my sexuality isn't like that of most straight guys. It's more about love than pleasure. I'm currently a virgin. Most guys seem to want to get rid of their virginity, and would have sex with any attractive female if offered. On the other hand, I want love and companionship more than sex. 

Right now I'm very confused as to whether or not I am trans or should even pursue transitioning. I need help, please."

I've been on hormones for about 6 years.

If I am on hormones will a legally admissible paternity test appear falsified? Or does that not effect it at all. I want to know if I'm the biological parent.

Like stef senjati, jazz jennings (especially jazz) and caitlyn jenner to name a few  just makes me more dysphoric than any other cis woman. 



It's a mix of both jealousy and dysphoria,  they all trigger it so much. It's almost makes me not see the point in living. It's like, they have been transition with great support, HRT, etc. And I'm here pretty much pretending to be a cis guy to everyone, it's honestly makes me so angry, I sit in my room and just feel like smashing my phone or computer or do something just to release the anger. 



Is this normal? Everyone seems to get dysphoric over cis women, which I do to a degree but more to other trans women.

amon_erin,asktransgender,Separating who I am from who I want to be?,"I'm going to be honest and say I don't really know what my gender is at this point. One thing I know I don't want, and I fight against is being a guy. I'm often staring the fact that I'm trans dead in the face and somehow I still don't believe it.

I guess internally I still feel like a guy. And that sends my anxiety through the roof because I want to be a woman. Even more than before I started HRT. Yet I still feel like I'm lying to myself at times. The prospect of going back makes me want to jump out of my own skin.

So maybe the female me is the real me. I've spent a fair amount of time this last week thinking about how much easier this would be if I could just wake up a woman tomorrow and never remember being a guy. 

And I just don't know who the real me is. I know who I want it to be, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the truth. I don't feel like I've been lying about anything I've felt.

piscina_dela_muerta,asktransgender,One year ago today was the day I came to myself as a woman. I cant believe it's been a year.,I've done a lot. Went to therapy as soon as I could.

Khazu,asktransgender,Stressed as hell,"Tomorrow's going to be a pretty big day for me. It'll be my first shift at a new job, I plan on calling to have my name put on a waiting list for HRT and in the evening I plan on going to an open-group thing for transgender people. It's got me so stressed, all I've managed to do in the past three hours is chain smoke and pace around my flat.

It took me a while, but Friday I managed to do the call. Thing is, they were still closed for the holidays. I try to see it as a practice run, but the next time I call is going to be the real thing... At least the waiting period is of about a year, so that'll give me plenty to time to really think things through.

I've never been to an open-group, I haven't really talked about gender stuff that much besides with some online friends and with my therapist but I don't have access to that service anymore. And I don't know anyone who's trans. I have no idea what to expect, and that got me pretty scared. I fear I'll just end up putting a few more layers of armor on.

I'm sure I'm gonna do ok at work since I've worked there over a year ago and it's in the gay village of my city, but it's under new management now. I hope they're going to be fine with me being trans, though for now I can just keep hiding it. I can test the waters I guess, I'll ask if it's alright if I have painted nails when I'm working.

Maybe it's just too much for one day? Perhaps waiting for the next group meeting would be a better idea? Or do the call on another day?
On the other hand I just can't wait to get things going, and I'm gonna need support as I know I'm never going to be able to go through on my own.

Anon112353211,asktransgender,A question about pronoun usage from a legitimatly confused individual.,"I would like I to preface this question by stating it is not my intent to offend or dehumanize anyone and if I have inadvertently done so it was a consequence of my own ignorance and not a deliberate attempt at discrimination.

Is the use of 'they' as a singular pronoun when referring to individuals who do not appear (according to the cultural norms of the society one finds themselves in) to subscribe to any particular gender (binary or otherwise) that you can clearly identify, offensive.
   if the use of 'they' as a singular pronoun IS offensive in such a situation what steps can people such as myself take to address such people when the language they utilise is based on a gender binary that requires the speaker to assume the gender of the listener (he, she, her, him for example)

Thank you for your time, I am interested in hearing your response, thanks.

birdsight,asktransgender,Post-estrogen: does anyone else still question their gender?,"I feel dumb even typing this out, but I'm just sitting here on my couch and thinking about me and my girlfriend and my gender and how I present myself to the world and how people perceive me... 

I've been on estrogen since July of last year, I honestly started ""passing"" as female about 3 months ago once I was able to tie my hair into a bun and developed more body fat along my hips.  I knew I was a girl then, I felt affirmed and happy.  I met someone and we started dating about two months ago; they're gender queer/also on estrogen and presents as female and uses female pronouns.  I spent the weekend with her (she just got back from a trip in Patagonia) and we had sex for the first time and it was surprisingly beautiful and easy, it wasn't dysphoric or upsetting: truly wonderful. 

As soon as we were done fucking I started thinking about my gender; I KNOW I'm not a man.  I never was, never could be--that is for sure.  But I started questioning my womanhood.  I used to think maybe I was non-binary or agender but eventually came to be comfy with being a woman, but I think maybe I decided that based on the fact that it's just easier for cis ppl to see me as a woman than as a non-binary trans person?  I'm not regretting my choice to start estrogen and medically transition but I'm just not sure about my social female identity for the moment.  I may wake up tomorrow and these feelings may be gone.

I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this post-estrogen/starting hrt?  If so, how do you handle it? "
sophiebits,asktransgender,Tip: How to use the online passport application wizard when applying for a US passport gender change,"I just applied for a gender change on my passport. They have a tool at https://pptform.state.gov/PassportWizardMain.aspx which creates a PDF of the filled form for you so that you don't need to hand-write everything.

Unfortunately, it tries to give you the DS-82 (renewal) form if you have an existing passport, and when applying for a gender change you need to file DS-11.

However, I figured out that if you mark that you have a *damaged* passport in your possession, it will give you the DS-11 form which is what you need. (Choosing ""damaged"" doesn't actually affect anything printed on the form, it just produces the full DS-11 application.)

I just started getting into the dating world recently and I'm a really submissive/passive type of guy, and flirting with guys just didn't feel right for some reason. However I did flirt one time as a ""girl"" online and it felt amazing, I got those butterfly feelings and everything. I just can't picture myself having gay sex, it seems off to me. I'm so envious of guy-girl relationships with how the man protects her, looks out for her, is dominant, and very few even treat her like a princess. I'm so jealous of that, and it makes me sad knowing I'll never have something like that. I could picture myself as the girl but not as the submissive man in that kind of relationship/scenario. Straight sex is a lot more appealing to me, imaginging myself as the girl getting penetrated is really a turn on. I don't totally hate being a guy and I haven't really been in a real gay relationship yet so maybe it could just be internalized homophobia but why is the thought of being the girl in the relationship so comforting?"

Before it grossed me out to think about having sex as a man, either straight or gay, but now the reality is sort of popping up that dudes are gonna want to penetrate me and stuff, such a drastic change of mindset for me. And I like it... I mean I never really actually put thought into it before that I'd be a sexual woman, it was always just.. woman.., now that my sex drive is coming back, It feels much more right to think about even. But still kind of hard to believe. I mean it's obvious why though.

I transitioned because of hormones basically. I hadn't considered anything else. My role or expression or any of it. It all came down to testosterone fucking my shit up.

So... I know this is an odd bit of dysphoria, but I actually sang on stage at one point pre-transition and I can still carry a tune and such... 

At a sterotypicaly male pitch.

I do a pretty decent female voice, so some of my newer acquaintances just think of my voice as standard female. One of these acquaintances is my new boyfriend, who is generally really nice, but has never dated a transgender woman before.

I mentioned myself that I kind of missed singing, saying ""But hey, it sounds really weird when I, a girl in a dress, sing like this:""

And then I sang a little bit of an old showtune, which I think I did okay at from a technical perspective...

But then when I finished he just said. ""Yeah, that's weird.""

It felt... Really crappy. I mean, he was just agreeing with what I said, but... 

I dunno, that part of my voice always felt like a musical instrument more than a gender defining feature. Singing has always been fun and it hasn't been a huge part of my life for a long time but...

I feel kind of crappy. And angry with him. I'm angry with him for agreeing with me, how messed up is that?

madmarmalade,asktransgender,"Forced to get back in the closet and detransition because of my economic situation, looking for ways to cope","So after leaving my job, losing my room-mate situation, and totaling my car in a wreck, I was in a pretty bad situation.  I spent some time with my sister and got my head a little straighter.  But I couldn't stay with her, so I moved back in with my dad.  I'm in a trailer park full of older white guys, so I was advised to not express my gender, which I agreed with.  Now I'm trying to find a job, and I decided to cut my hair to increase my prospects, since I had been having an impossible time trying to get hired previously.  I tried to get a gender neutral haircut that I could feminize as I wanted (I went for the Justin Bieber/ Miley Cyrus mashup look), but it's still a big change.  Furthermore, I am running out of my hormones; I still have the prescriptions, but without insurance and barely $20 to my name I can't afford to refill them.  I already ran out of spiro, soon I'll be out of estrogen and progesterone as well.  

This is of course all my doing, but it's been harder than I thought on me.  Every time I happen to get an interview, I put on this suit and I try to rationalize it as my ""Power Dyke"" look, but it sucks that I know what the other people are seeing, which is an effeminate man at best.  I try to put on some makeup when I'm home alone, but it feels bad cause I gotta wash it off before I leave the trailer or before my dad comes home.  I've been off hormones before too, but the lack of spiro is really pumping up my sex drive, and every morning when I wake up with a tent it triggers my dysphoria and self-loathing, cursing my own parts for being such an obstacle and an annoyance. I could go to my local trans support group, but most of them are in the closet as well, and I feel like that would just make me feel more depressed.  I just want someone to talk to about this.   "

throwawaydoggo2,asktransgender,If you are a well-known person how do you stay safe?,"Hi all. Making a throwaway for this.
I think my situation is kind of unique - but if anyone here has experience please share it with me.
I'm an artist and quite well known in my country, today I was recognized in the street by someone which got me thinking. Although I don't share images of my face online people still recognize me from other places or photos other people have taken.
There's no way for me to slip under the radar while I transition. Even if I don't tell anyone I'm transgender, I know other people will spread this knowledge against my will. I don't feel safe to be known publicly as transgender for a variety of obvious reasons. I was feeling so angry today just wishing I could have delayed my career by 6 or 7 years so I'd already be transitioned by the time people started to know of me. I can't just start over from scratch pretending to be a different person. That would be impossible. I just want to know how I can keep myself safe from transgender-related hate/doxxing etc and what approach I should take.
Safety is more important than stealth to me, I don't know if being stealth is safer or what, if anyone has info here please share. I haven't been faced with direct transphobia yet - I guess the art community I am in is very welcoming - however I know I'll face it soon enough and I don't know how to approach it or how to ensure my mental/physical safety with it.

tutu_nymph,asktransgender,I need help to find proper terminology for my website.,"I posted this in another group and it was suggested that I post it here. I own a sex+ VR porn company and need help with some terms that I used to classify our POV porn. Watch POV in VR is kind of like getting transported into someone else's body so before you view a video you want to know what type of body you are going to be in, therefore we classify our POV content. After some help from reddit we decided to label our content as Penis POV and Vagina POV so we were not speaking as to the gender of the person in the video. Now as we are shooting more trans content I realize that we need even more categories (but not too many as that is also overwhelming). I was thinking transwomen and transmen but that still does not give the viewer an idea of the body they will be in and it king of labels are talent with genders they may not identify with. So maybe labeling it trans pov and penis pov may work but then the person will not know if it is a transwomen who is preoperative or a trans man who is post operative. It was suggested that I use two categories like penis POV and female POV which I may have to do in the end/ However I would rather have terms that do not speak to the gender identity of the person as there are trans people who are agender, gender fluid, gender non-binary. .... and so on. Basically I need help figuring out these categories and want terms that are not offensive to the trans community.

This is the one thing that throws me off when thinking about gender; it's a fairly new feeling/discovery. I never played as a princess when I was a tiddler, I was never the mum when we played house, I never asked for feminine things in primary school, and so on. Did you know all your life? 

Sorry, I'm not sure what I want you to say here, it's just me being desperate for answers without proper questions :/"
Mousanonly,asktransgender,Having trouble working up the courage to come out to my friend,"After coming out to my parents a few months ago, I now am just as scared of trying to come out again. My parents didn't take it well, and now we act like it never happened. I don't want the same thing to happen with my friend. Even better though, is that my hints to my friend have failed to be noticed. And to top it all off, I pretty much have 1 friend now. (I lost contact with my other friends)

hazelnut___,asktransgender,Were you able to voice train before coming out?,One of my biggest fears (as I'm sure almost everyone here has) is my voice and how it could get me outed the moment i start presenting. Because of this I want to start working on it asap but don't plan on coming out to the majority of people in my life for some time. Were you able to build up your girl voice while still maintaining a guy voice? Also for those who have a passing female voice are you able to use a guy voice when in unsafe situations?
Bournemouth,asktransgender,"HRT or not, how are your emotions?","Looking for diverse perspectives (no matter if you are FTM, MTF, NB, it's all good).

Disclaimer:  this post may or may not be filled with weapons-grade **OVERTHINKING** which I find almost impossible not to do.  Sorry.

I'm a pre-HRT mostly closeted trans fem.  I sometimes hear about people talking about having ""no emotions at all"" before HRT and then suddenly being able to process emotions properly a short time after starting.  I think I do already experience emotions, but they are very weird.  List of things I can experience/have experienced recently:

* depression and anxiety
* anger
* a kind of deep sadness and odd longing
* sometimes a strong response to humour involving laughter
* some kind of universal strong sad response (tearing up/crying) to all kinds of emotional stimuli including ones which aren't necessarily sad
* a very brief sense of accomplishment and triumph when I achieve a thing

things which I remember experiencing as a child:

* basically everything
* possibly even happiness and contentment

Obviously this isn't the case for everyone.  However, a big reason I'm starting HRT is for this supposed emotional benefit (that specifically seems to exist for trans people e.g. a cis guy taking estrogen would just feel bad).  But I'd like to know what exactly your experiences before and after were, maybe with emphasis on the before?  

I'm afraid of things... simply staying the same.  The idea that maybe this is how I'm just supposed to feel is the biggest fear I have.  I have read ""that was dysphoria?"" by Zinnia Jones, and it sounds a lot like me - the overwhelming emotional response at harmless stuff in childhood is something that always happened to me, I knew it was dumb and I didn't want to cry but I honestly couldn't help it.  It was fucked up, embarrassing and up until recently I blamed it on the death of my father at 9, but it happened plenty before that, so that's a lie.  

However I am aware that ZJ ended up on antidepressants anyway, which kind of makes me start doubting again.  Oh well.  Love to hear your responses.  Bye!"

Mahcheese,asktransgender,"Therapists of r/asktransgender, hear me out.","This may come off more as a rant post than a question, but this sub feels welcoming enough for me to post this. Also, incoming long post. I don't really know where else to post this.

Backstory: I'm 17 this year, and I come from Singapore. You may or may not know that in Singapore, there is conscription for males at least 18 years old.

I lived most of my childhood without any issues. But gradually, I simply start feeling like something isnt right. My mum realises it, but she does not directly approve. She tells me that I only feel like this way because 'I am afraid of joining the army'.  I don't directly sit and tell her what transgender means, but she says that I only want to be a girl because of 'Small issues like being jealous of what I can't do as a male' et cetera. My dad does not really comment on it and I don't feel like discussing it with him. Unless I do it secretly, I'll never see a doctor on my own accord.

It just makes me sad.  This isnt about conscription. It's my identity crisis. I don't know how I can survive being surrounded by men in bootcamp. I admit that the thought of being trained to be a soldier intimidated me, but I know that many of my friends (Males) are also afraid of that. But I just want to grow my hair, wear a dress, and hang out with girls. But because I am biologically male, I am forced to serve the army and at this point, it feels that society will take my transgenderness to simply be an excuse to avoid National Service

I don't know who to approach. I know that school counsellors are a thing, but I don't know how to ask them about it. Even my friends are more caring than my parents and they accept that I have more feminine characteristics, but transgender is probably a new word to them.

I'm starting Junior College in a month, and I want to focus on my studies, but the girl inside of me is crying to me to release her. Please help her(me).

broken-neurons,asktransgender,Therapist / patient confidentially rules in Germany (TW),"This is a touchy subject, but I need some advice. I live in Germany and I've been seeing a gender therapist for over a year.

Recently I've been having some suicidal thoughts related to separation from my wife, (separated since March 2016 / two young children) and she is now starting to date men (I'm MTF).

I want to talk to my therapist about these thoughts because they are scaring me. The other night I got drunk then went half way to asphyxiating myself, but shortly before I blacked out my brain started panicking about re-breathing CO2 and I ended up taking the bag off in fear and crying like a baby instead.

The thing is that I want to talk to my therapist about this, without the risk that she could get me committed to a psych ward against my will. 

I'd be very interested to know what the rules are concerning what a therapist can and can't do with the information you share with them under German law. Can they break these confidentiality rules of they believe the patient is in danger of seriously harming themselves?"

WubbalubaTurtle,asktransgender,I need some insight (TEXT WALL),"I was REALLY tempted not to post this, as this is my first post on Reddit in general and I even wrote up a whole other post the same size of this and trashed it because I was extremely nervous but realized I really needed to get this out here, so please bear with all of the writing and any errors that I might have missed.

I am a sixteen year old, AMAB who is questioning themselves (as MTF) and I know that asking Reddit for advice is not a replacement for the expert advice of a decent gender therapist (or any therapist really depending) but that is basically the problem as being sixteen, not going through my parents to do anything is basically impossible and any feelings of me being sure are half out the window and half inside, not sure if it wants to go in or out.

I think I have gotten to the point where it MIGHT be best to see someone like a therapist and talk about this because I know myself better than anyone else (supposedly) and I know that I am very much too critical, too analytic and honestly too confused right now to come to a solid answer, as feelings obviously fluctuate alot so it feels like sometimes I am going two steps forward, one step back or one step forward, one step back and I do not like this as it only helps any denial within me, so any outside validation will be helpful.

So here’s my “little” list.
 

 **Reasons that I think I could be trans (not in any particular order)**

* I have had dreams and daydreams of transformation and such things for a longer time than I can currently remember and I remember a lot of it being about turning into a girl by some medical green vat of goo or magical anomaly (or me taking some initiative and making my whole transformation science-y thing!), though how long I have had them, is lost to my mind.

* As soon as I realized I could be trans, it didn't take me long to jump onto any information that I could get first broad questions on google then a bit of Wikipedia and then the most specific questions on Asktransgender.

* I am pretty completely unopposed to every single physical change that comes with transition, though I am quite aware it takes awhile and it is not easy.

* Instead of asking myself 'Are you Trans?' which never really gets the best answer, I ask ""Am I Cis?"" and a resounding 'No' echoes through my mind.

* The fact I am looking for validation that I am trans is probably a decent amount of proof on it's own.

* I have kept a personal diary about my questioning and such not to long after I started questioning, which includes all of my personal ramblings about it all as well as a list of important reminders and positive statements! As well as a very very very long list of links to positive posts on Reddit for trans things, guides and more.

* As I approached puberty, I didn't really feel anything special that could shout 'TRAAAANS' besides the one feeling of disconnection between me and my body, as I would look into the bathroom mirror and think ""That's not right and I am not sure why"" but I would just ignore it, going on with my day and back to the computer.

* As soon as I started thinking and researching about what transitioning was, I almost immediately stopped bad habits and started new good ones, I went from a compulsive nail biter to someone who is aspiring to have perfectly matching nails in shape. I started going to the gym, which I have NEVER done before and keep as clean shaven a face as possible, though I did want to have facial hair a lot before, that pretty much was just so I could cover up my face, as I didn't like it (still don't).

* I really really really enjoy having no leg hair, as I have shaved it a few times annnnnnd LOVE IT! I don't think Cis-Guys are supposed to feel like that because honestly I want them to be smooth forever and I am saddened that I can't really shave it anymore because the time for shorts is coming towards me sadly.

* Everyday I look for feminine features on my face, usually finding the farther the mirror is the most convincing it is! Then I look to the right and there's one really close and I feel like shit looking into it and seeing my caveman face.

* I look at cis-men and cis-women's facial features, trying to look for any similarities between the two, which there seem to be of course, just that each has a different arrangement of features that makes them look male or female. All of this so I can compare and wonder how I would look with my features being changed slightly.

* I am quite jealous of some cis-girls, well, most of them as they can look the way they do naturally, I even have a decently sized collage of pictures within my little diary of the most optimal ways that I would want to look (Considering my genetics, probably something similar to a Valhalla Goddess with flowing blonde locks of hair! But that is the best case I sorta dream of).

* I remember basically the first day I went into high school, I saw a certain type of guy, well a few of them (brute, jockey type, douche-bag looking type that excrete testosterone in liquid form, I imagine) and I thought to myself ""If I am EVER anything like that, it means I have failed myself at life and should feel sorry for myself"" though I have started really recognizing I dislike a decent amount of the guys in my grade group with a passion, I don't know EXACTLY how this could contribute to being trans as gender roles and all that but I can't really imagine just being 'a feminine guy', doesn't really fit with me, like a four piece jigsaw attempting to be put in the middle of a 1000 piece puzzle set.

* On the same subject, awhile ago I was sorta socially pressured into joining my school's rugby team in eighth grade since my brother had played it himself and I am absolutely massive but whenever I played it, I absolutely hated the feeling I got from it, the brutishness and the testosterone and so, when the season was over, I never went back the next year

* Some days I just wish I could go on something like anti-androgen as I am afraid to lose more hair as I had a terrible scare not to long ago where tuffs of hair were coming out of my scalp, though not in patches, but from everywhere in equal amount, but it stopped and came back slowly but I DO NOT want that to happen again. I also do NOT want to grow taller at all and I am excited by that you have the possibility to shrink with estrogen because soft tissue changes a lot and apparently cartilage likes to shrink somewhat which can make people lose up to 2 to 3 inches of height and I am TOTALLY up for now.

* I would KILL for straight and long hair right now as I am stuck with my stupid curly hair which hates me, a lot.

* I really hate male fashion and all of that, I feel limited in it as it's even a hoodie and jeans or flannel with my age group, well it feels like that and the only things I like even slightly flannel is my pajama bottoms! I want to be able to try all of the women's fashion and all of that because it feels like there is ALOT more choice and such, as well leggings... Mmmm... Now that is something to dream for.

* I very much hate it whenever my parents ever mention stuff like my Adam's apple becoming more prominent or that I am ""shaping up to a lovely young man"" and it also makes me hate myself for thinking about everything because it makes me realize anything I do WILL affect them.


**Reasons that I don't think I am trans (ish)**

* I have only just been questioning myself for two months and I am really paranoid of it being a 'phase'. How can I say a blanket statement like “It’s not a change, it’s just how I’ve always been” if I can’t even clearly remember the past enough to really mean it..

* I know the stereotypical narrative for trans people isn't everyone's story as media really likes to stretch it a lot but I can't particularly remember anything suspect from when I was really young, but I am tempted to think that if there was anything or there could have been anything, it was consumed and repressed through me getting my first computer and never stopping even to present day with it from dawn to dusk, even as I type away at it, I have recognized that I use my computer as a way to get away from sometimes depressing feelings so who's to say a lot of other feelings didn't get disregarded into it's 1010101 void.

* I think I am being too optimistic about how being a woman/girl would be... I think it all peachy with having a happy life and a significant other that I love, or is optimism good or do I need moderation?

* I might be able to research all of the physical aspects of being a woman but I can't possibly know anything about HOW to act as one or compose myself as one as well, I am not very social AT ALL so, I am at a lost, yet I can say a lot of the same for acting male.

* My life is quite alright right now, there is not particularly any outside problems coming down onto me to put me down but maybe that means it's more likely legitimate that I am trans, or maybe not, who knows.


**Other things that don't fit into either category/neutral**

* I can't really say if I have true genital dysphoria because I am sorta in the mind set of ""I have to accept the state of things and that I have a penis... Do I like it? Not particularly. Do I wish it gone? Yeah but I am not exactly in a rush as I accept that right now, I am in a male body. Would that feeling probably change if you were the transition?  Most likely, I do imagine that would change quite dramatically as even right now, I don't hate nor love it, but I definitely do just leave it alone as doing anything with it comes with a starter kit of guilt and regret.

* I think some of the recent denial is probably from me realizing that I am going to have to come out and there is good news and bad news with that, well I think, good news is that my oldest brother is the gayest person I have ever met, next to his fiancee who the whole family loves which means accepting of the LGBT community but the bad news is that I don't think my family would expect ANYTHING like me being trans as I imagine they think me as the straightest person of the three siblings and what am I supposed to say if they started questioning it all? I've got two months of critical thinking and a few other times of suppressed trans thinking on my side with no real proof of anything in my childhood that I can remember besides the transformation daydreams I had and some other things, I know a lot of it doesn't have to be PHYSICAL proof because getting that is impossible but I don't exactly have much of that either that I find reliable as I can't clearly remember much, as well I am not SURE if they will just take me at my word or seriously at all.

* I have no idea how much bearing this has on anything but I have never cross-dressed once except for when I was really young and the people at my daycare let me try out the princess dresses... But I don't think that truly counts as the cis-guys did it too and it was just for some fun and not REALLY cross-dressing! Though I THINK I remember the daycare workers telling me that I should stop being so interested in the dresses, BUUUUUT that could just be a fabricated memory as it's hard to remember. Though I don't think even if I wanted to cross-dress, I'd ever have a chance as the two older siblings I have are smaller than me and both male and my three guardians/parents, my mother, my aunt and my grandmother are obliviously all female so, yeah. But I feel if my parents did something like make me Put on a dress to prove my claims (not that I think THEY personally would, just theoretically) I imagine I would mostly be disgusted with myself as one, I am quite male looking and two, I am very out of shape.

* I wish that I wasn't 6 foot 2 or that my shoulders were broad and that I didn't have big feet but it makes me feel so ""built to be a man"" and I don't like it, but I am reminded of it everyday that I look in the mirror and honestly, my personality is not that of someone who is a towering giant but that is what I am stuck as, well, maybe not.

* The feeling of 'transness' goes up and down right? Some days are better than others and everything clearer but other days not so much.

* The thought of it possibly being a fetish has passed my mind but... Why in my right mind would I do such stressful things just to have some sex? And at the end of the day, do I have a decent male sex drive (it feels very sensitive), yes, would it change with estrogen, most likely and I would welcome that change.

I don't really know what to do.. Should I just wait longer and think it over more considering how long I've been thinking about it so far?"

"
pinkchips,asktransgender,I just read the most profound thing: You are not a transgender person.... you are a person who happens to be transgender.,"Someone over on TrollX just helped me realize a very deep and profound truth to the world.  Something that I had always intuitively understood but hadn't ever seen elegantly stated before.  
  
We get so hung up on labels, and always place labels before the 'person' part.... extending this discourtesy to ourselves.  
  
When we see a gorgeous cis girl, for example, it is a tendency to see her as a gorgeous cis girl, and then after making our way through all her secondary qualities we finally get around to the fact that she is a person, a complex and valid individual with her own agency and mind.  
  
It takes maturity and empathy to see people primarily as people, *who also happen to have secondary characteristics*.  This is important for us in the trans community as well!  
  
**You are not primarily a transperson.  You are a beautiful and valid person - who happens to also be transgender.** And that's ok.  Some people are born tall, and some are born Chinese, and some are born brilliant, some are cis white men. and some are born with giant noses.  Lots of secondary characteristics - but primarily these are all people, *not their labels.*  
  
It's important to realize this for both yourself and others - not only are you a valid and complex mind with lots of secondary traits, but others are too.  And yes, sex and gender count as secondary traits to someone's personhood.  This is the big mistake that gender critters make - they see a person as their birth sex first and foremost before they even consider their status as a valid person.  They primarily define themselves through the circumstances of their genetics and sex, which leads to all sorts of nastiness.  
  
In fact, this is the same attitude that has caused untold suffering in humanity for eons.  So take comfort in your own validity, and realize that no matter what else you may be - you are a person first and foremost, just as important as anyone else.  "
PennyLisa,asktransgender,M2F SRS and genital electro: where and how much is required?,"So, after thinking for a long time that I'd never get SRS, I'm kinda thinking about it now. I'm not *that* bothered by how things are, but I do feel a bit... not correct if that makes sense. A big part of me feels totally grossed out by the idea as well, plus dilating regularly seems like a major hassle.

Anyhow I'm wondering what's required in terms of electro. I know the Thai surgeons don't necessarily require it. I saw a presentation by Marci Bowers recently, her results looked pretty good.

I'd hate to end up with hair in the wrong spots. OTOH it seems like it would be painful, expensive, and degrading.

I'm wondering even if I could get a home electro machine to do it. 

Does anyone have experience here? "
Harlick,asktransgender,"AskTrans, I need your happy married transition stories.","I believe that my wife and I can work through my transition and come out stronger on the other side, but she's feeling a lot of anxiety because so many of the posts at r/mypartneristrans are tales of woe and lost relationships.

We're both in our 30s, we have a 4 year old daughter and a new born on the way. She's bi and isn't so much worried about my physical changes as that my personality will change too much. I am her rock, her anchor when times are bad, her leader. She fears that hormones will make me want to be submissive. I don't believe it will, but that doesn't comfort her much.

We would love to hear from couples that were in the same place as us during transition who survived and are still in love, especially those with younger children."
colette_collie,asktransgender,Making up for lost time,"Hi,
So I was wondering, did any one of you who started transitioning in their 30s feel like they missed out on a lot of... activities, or sort of like, life experiences of a feminine nature?

What I mean is, I got this feeling that if I transition, I'll want to be, or act similar to, a 20 something years old girl, not a 30 years old one. 
Thing is, as a guy, I feel the desire to have a family at around this age, settle down, take care of some things that kinda should be taken care of at this point in life... but if I transition, I wouldn't even consider it for at least 5 years or so. I'd rather prefer going out, having fun, dating, changing a couple of partners before settling... and I don't think I'd be ready to even start doing that until HRT kicks in well, so around 2 year mark. 

Does anyone feel this way and did it come to you as a burden, did you end up rushing through things etc? I can't really forumlate questions well regarding this so I hope yo know what I mean... 

Thanks!"
avi98,asktransgender,Will I lose my memory during HRT?,"I'm starting HRT next month, and I just heard that it causes many to experience memory loss. Is this true? If so, how common is it? Is there any way to avoid it? And is it caused by the t-blockers or the estrogen itself? 

My memory is already terrible because of my constant anxiety, due to dysphoria. So I don't see how hormones will make it worse if not help it as my dysphoria decreases. 

EDIT: thank you so much for your replies everyone, I feel much less nervous now, and super exited to start HRT! "

nau_,asktransgender,"""Biological Sex"" And The War Being Waged With It","https://twitter.com/chasestrangio/status/824317023673057283

Just another example of this bullshit term being used to oppress trans people including reference to ""original birth certificate"" as the only legitimate source. I've talked about this a few times in this sub, namely in the ""Gender vs Sex"" thread recently, but felt it valuable to share with the sub just the latest of a long list of legislation that aims to invalidate all the effort you went through to get your gender marker on government paperwork changed and thereby barring you from basic things like using the right bathroom, getting married, etc, through other bills like the ever-continuing ""Religious Freedom"" laws that are being tried in tons of states. VA's bill in particular uses this same lingo of ""biological sex"" on ""original birth certificate only"" to try to bar people from potentially slipping through their fascist regime and, I don't know, living our lives? #MuchThreat

And for more reading on how they're trying to bar you from existing, bills like these are attempting to be put into place to make it impossible to change your birth certificate outside of a typographical error. http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=161&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB431&amp;submit=GO

feelinqueer,asktransgender,Bad Dysphoria Because of Masturbating (MtF or FtM) NSFW,"So I'm MtF and I've always felt weird about masturbation even though in the past I did it daily I always felt disgusted afterwards and like something was just wrong, I assume this to be a ""I have the wrong parts"" scenario. But ever since I've accepted myself and have decided on transitioning it has gotten far worse... I don't really feel like a very sexual person in the first place, I've barely even thought about sex from a transitioning stand point, but maybe I would finally be interested, I don't know? Either way though the only reason why I even relieve myself now is because I hate feeling horny in my current state, and one of the worst dysphoria triggers for me is getting erections... It's not even the thought of having a penis, it's just getting erect is the problem and especially when climaxing it's the WORST it's almost like I can feel the testosterone when it happens and I hate it... (Sorry to any of you on T out there, I don't mean to make you uncomfortable).

I guess what I'm asking is does anyone else feel shitty about masturbating because of your current parts? Or the functionality of your parts at this moment? Also how do you deal with it? I feel like my case might be different than many others because sure I could stimulate my prostate, or do something that's less like penetration, but I don't enjoy masturbating at all at my current stage, I literally only do it to stop getting horny. The lack of libido when going on estrogen honestly excites me a lot because of all of this!

Suggestions or how you feel about it for yourself would be greatly appreciated, I just want some shared thoughts on the matter..."

I'll try to keep this brief. Apologies for any faulty vernacular and/or pronoun confusion, the sibling in question is still using male pronouns for now &amp; I am still learning correct terminology.

My younger brother came out to me as trans a couple of months ago. I, of course, was like nbd, you do you &amp; I got your back no matter what. But now it's been several months, and he seems really unsure of what to do. He doesn't ever try to present/pass as female. But he says he suffers from dysphoria and he thinks hormones would help. He went to a couple of sessions with a gender therapist, and then dropped off.

He still talks about transitioning, but it seems like he's no longer sure if it's what he wants. He's clearly struggling, and I want to help.

Any thoughts?"
hey_its_Espeon,asktransgender,How do I sit with my knees together?,I can pretty easily cross my legs but when I sit casually I can't put my knees together without straining a bit. When I stand and put my feet together my legs are pretty far apart. Is this because of how my hip is shaped or smth?
HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,Fantasy vs reality and why cant i make my own decisions xp,"So when i was younger, i read a lot of literotica, erotic literature.  Specifically forced feminization, sissification, and transformation stories, among others. Also artful porn, such as x-art, when i could find it for free (i read that some cis women like x art, which was validating, despite coming from a silly comparison of stereotypes, namely that women dont watch porn, especially not gross porn. Makes me feel more womanly. But anyway-) i read a lot of these stories, and they kinda pervaded my sexual life.  I think this really confused my transness, because never in my life has it been clear cut if i really want to be a girl, or if its just a thing i imagine and fantasize about  but could neber really do in reality. Ir am i just too afraid to go about transitioning myself, without being ousned. Without habing anyone guiding me.  Everyone taught me how to be a man, but i have to ask for teachings on how to be a girl and eventually a woman.

 So now, after realizing im trans some way or another, coming out going on hormones for two years almost, and feeling good abiut at least the ohysical effects (my mentality is a whole nother thing because of depression and emotional inaccessibility) i still struggle to feel real about it all. Its scary, for one thing.  To make my own decisions and to feel good about learning everything about being a girl. Its like, if i had a push, almost like being forced, my transition would go smoother. But would i even accept that push. Idk.  But the even bigger issues comes with surgey. I cant make any headway on whether or not to get bottom surgery. Ive thougt about all the pros and cons and reasons and everything but i still dont know. Obviously, being forced into surgery would be crazy. Its permanent, its not famtasy, its real.  But im stuck and i dint know how to get myself to move forward.  

So i figured id sorta let my thoughts out here. If anyone has any advice, it is most welcome."

So I do my injections on Saturdays. I started at .3ml of 40mg/ml per week for a few weeks, went up to .5 per week because on .3ml there were a few good days each week and then a weird crash where i felt weird and flat and sensitive in the ladyparts in a way that gave me a ton of dysphoria, then lowered to .4ml because moodiness on .5ml. 

I got bloodwork on Thursday. The results came back today, and....my estradiol is *929 pg/ml* 5 days after injecting .4ml of 40mg/ml EV.

Does it make sense that my levels would be that high 5 days into a 7 day injection cycle, or is it more likely some kind of labwork error?
 
I feel pretty emotionally flat, my breasts don't have much of any sensitivity or soreness or anything, body/remaining facial hair growth hasn't slowed,  and male-ish libido and extreme sensitivity in the ladyparts coming back, and....long story short, I don't know if this *is* what having e that high feels like but i can tell that something's wrong with me.

What should I do? I can't see my doctor for more than a month and she doesn't really listen to me or believe me when I tell her about hormone problems at the *best* of times, and I'm seeing a new doctor but that won't be until the end of February and I have no idea if that's going to go really bad too, so.....I'm a little desperate for any advice I can get before then."

scaredycat321,asktransgender,I'm terrified about having sex with my new girlfriend,"I'm a late 20s transgender woman who transitioned more than a decade ago (like 2005?) and had bottom surgery in 2009. However, I don't know if it was the surgery or the hormones but the (admittedly already small) sex drive I had had pretty much died out after I had surgery. I still love being intimate with people--cuddling, kissing, etc.--but I don't get any real pleasure from ""conventional"" sex and don't feel much of anything.

Since figuring this out, I've had a few partners but they were either men who are easy enough to satisfy in bed or women who like me didn't really want to have much sex at all. It hasn't ever been an issue. Until now.

Recently I started dating this cisgender woman who is amazing. I could wax poetic about her for hours on end. However, she definitely wants to have sex. And since she is wonderful I want to be able to satisfy her in every possible way she would want.

But the fact is I'm terrified of going down on her. I've never done it before ever (which feels embarrassing as a nearly 30 year old lesbian). I don't want to disappoint her, but I don't have a clue what to do. I tried reading online and even watching some porn but it's usually just someone's head between someone's legs and I can't tell what they're doing.

I should tell her this I know and be honest about it. I have told her the truth that I'm nervous because I like her so much and also that I want to make our first time really special so I just need a moment to figure things out. I think most likely our first time is going to be next Saturday because we have a date night and then I'm staying over at her place.

I don't want to jump the gun but I really think I could have a long term partnership with this woman and I don't want to mess it up. Please any advice anyone could give me would be appreciated. Thank you!"

The thing I'm worried about is people noticing, I don't really wear shorts or anything, so idk why I'm even worrying. But something is telling me my parents will find out, I'm super worried.

What were any of your experiences like? Did they question it? Did they not? Did they not even notice? I'd love to know

Also, how long until hair grows back, if I decide to not take this step yet, I'd like to know.

DiamondDark,asktransgender,My MtF Girlfriend has a year+ waiting time before she can see the gender clinic. Have a GP appointment tomorrow and need advise on what to say.,"She's been self medicating for some years now and passes as female. However she did this herself by self medicating through a site called in house pharmacy.

However the site no longer takes payment other than through bitcoin and bank transfers which makes paying for the medication too difficult. Switching websites and in the process of all that.

In the meanwhile, she's been feeling unwell due to a lack of hormones. In 24 hours I will be seeing a GP. The problem is, she's been before and has been told that they are unwilling to prescribe hormones and other medication until she sees the gender clinic. There is a waiting list of over a year and waiting is simply not viable.

We don't have too much money, and a prescription on the NHS would be a HUGE benefit to us. My plan is to point out her circumstances (already transitioned, feeling unwell, exceptional circumstances, would be given hormones if seen at a gender clinic) in order to persuade the doctor to give a prescription. Plan B which is a lot worse but still better than what we have is to ask for a private prescription (one we have to pay a lot for, but might be cheaper than getting it from abroad).

I'm not trans myself, and I profess I'm ignorant about all of this. Any advise is greatly appreciated, as I aim to try my best to help her."

MonicaRising,asktransgender,Dysphoria during HRT,"When I finally decided to start HRT I couldn't have been more excited for the physical changes I would be experiencing. The emotional has really been great too. But here's the thing and my question for you all: As my breasts are now beginning to grow, you would, I guess, think I'd be staring in the mirror trying to detect any hint of progress... and I did just that... until now that there actually are the first signs of growth and progress. Now I find myself avoiding looking in the mirror. I really don't like this ""in between"" phase, physically speaking. I feel like it increased my dysphoria or whatever you call the feeling of not wanting to look at your body because it grosses you out. I am still excited for whatever the end result of my breast growth will be. It's just that I can't stand to look at myself in this in-between phase. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Or is it just me? Is it just impatience? I just feel like my body looks too masculine still and the small signs of growth only seem to make it appear more masculine instead of less... "
heroicintent,asktransgender,Do you have any friends?,"My parents have a ton of weird assumptions about the trans experience. One of them is that the only people who will befriend transgender people are other trans. So, suddenly they don't believe me when I go over to my friends homes to hang out and watch movies, create art, and goof off. I am still close friends with my close cisfriends. Nothing has changed. Yes, life has changed us. One is married and his husband just recovered from cancer and another has a kid whose getting into trouble at school, and yes, I've transitioned, but fundamentally we still have the same dynamic. I have literally showed them photos of us through the years, and my mother starts crying and saying,"" I'm sooo sad that you don't have any friends.""  Maybe part of it is I had one friend that they really liked because she was very religious conservative and I never introduced them to my main friendgroup of artsy diverse friends. This friend that they liked, we drifted apart long before I transitioned but perhaps they've talked. "
Throwaway1383827172,asktransgender,"Fuck it: I'm ""coming out"" to my mom next time we're alone","Background: Just turned 16, closeted MtF, live in a really traditional conservative family. I've posted a lot here on various throwaway account.

Up to this point, I've just accepted axiomatically that I'll come out after I graduate high school, as it wouldn't be far from moving out for college. I've known I'm definitely trans for at least a year, with it really ramping up in the past month or two: not a day has gone by in the past month where I haven't been consciously thinking about it throughout the day. And not in a negative or depressing way. I've been a sponge of all transgender information I could soak up, especially from places like this subreddit with all of you lovely people in it.

I've come to the conclusion that:

* Waiting too long could bring about lots of undesirable changes: while 16 is pretty far into puberty, I've been pretty fortunate so far. I've had next to no facial hair growth (probably shave above my lip once every two weeks and that's it), I have zero visible Adam's apple, and I'm of decent height at 5'8 (above average for women but there's still lots of girls at my school taller than me), and I still have a very young looking face. I haven't masculine-ized, I guess. It's possible that I never will and I could stay like this forever, but it's also possible that I could sprout up and lose all of that.

* Because of the previously mentioned facts, there's pretty much no reason to not push to get on T blockers if there's even the slightest chance of it happening.

I go to a Catholic school so obviously I wouldn't be transitioning anytime soon, but just stealthily avoiding testosterone through the rest of my high school career (I'm a junior now) would make me so happy and alleviate all stress I have about my adolescent life as of now. I pride myself in being a straight A student and don't want that distraction.

Now, for my family situation. As I stated, my family is extremely conservative: they definitely wouldn't support a transition. However, they do truly love and care about me. My mom is definitely more open minded that my dad, so the idea I have is that because I have my yearly pediatrician check-up coming later this month, I can bring it up to my mom without ever using the word ""transgender:"" leave it up to my doctor to use those words (he's definitely cool about LGBT issues, part of his initial puberty shpiel to me was about how it's okay if I end up liking boys). I think I can approach my mom with something like ""over the past year, I haven't felt comfortable being a boy. [insert elaboration]. Maybe we can discuss it with the doctor at the appointment?"" She genuinely loves and cares about me, so even if it's from a ""my son is potentially crazy"" standpoint, she would likely bring it with my doctor who can then tell her the facts of the issue. It'd be easier coming from him than me, believe me. This is why ""coming out"" is in quotation marks in my title: straight-up saying ""I'm transgender"" to my mom is the worst thing I could do, I think, when she doesn't fully understand it. Build it up first, and then let a medical professional drop the name.

To elaborate on the extent of my trans-ness: it's completely bodily. I don't see myself ever not wearing hoodies, jamming out to Childish Gambino and Paramore, playing video games, and loving astronomy and math and science. There's no right or wrong way to be a man or a woman or anyone else. I just know that I don't want the male physical characteristics that I have.

I know y'all probably don't care about all these details. Honestly, I'm just sitting here at 3 AM in my bed with these thoughts racing through my head, and I wanted to organize my thoughts as well as get any potential advice, so I'm posting it here. I'm really feeling like I swoop in the first chance I get alone with my mom. Best case is that she reacts with genuine concern, brings it up with my doctor who then convinced her that it's a serious medical situation that can be dealt with prescriptions. Worst case, it becomes an awkward conversation that we can pretend never happened for a while until I graduate. I don't see any reason not to try!

Wish me luck and please provide me with any similar experiences or thoughts you may have!"

Abby_Road88,asktransgender,What have I done?,"I've been medically transitioning for about 4.5 months now.

It's been a big shock to everyone that I've told and it's been a constant battle in my mind, trying to validate my feelings.  I know that questioning one self is normal.  This is a BIG change!! 

Skip to the end....

I was uploading photos from my phone to the cloud today, and I went back and was individually selecting photos from the past two years and uploading them.  As I'm looking through the pictures I become overwhelmed with sadness.  I keep looking at the person, who I have been my entire life and that I now know I have to say goodbye to.  Am I ready for that?!  I'm super scared now.  Have I made a mistake?  Do I really want to transition?  Christ, I've made my next two year plan all around transitioning so it would really mess up my plans and be awkward with all of the people I've come out to. 

Maybe this is just a bad day?  Right now I just feel like a dude still, and it is upsetting but nearly as upsetting as seeing myself in those old pictures.  I'm just really freaked out now.  What the hell do i do?"

twasanotherthrowaway,asktransgender,Getting orchidectomy before SRS?,"Hi everyone, I'm wondering if I could get rid of those monstrosites. Reason for that is they just feel uncomfortable, annoying, and they're producing testosterone (well, they want to, but I won't allow them). Plus every antiandrogen sucks, cypro is causing damage to the liver (and that's what I'm taking for nearly 8 months now), spiro messes up with potassium and stuff. If I get rid of them, I'll have better results, more healthy body and more comfort, so I definitely would like to do that.

If there's someone from UK who've got orchidectomy, could you post name of your surgeon?

HopefulAndrogyne624,asktransgender,Orchiectomy questions (UK),"So I don't have genital dysphoria, I am quite attached to my penis. My testes on the other hand, while not distressing in themselves, are the cause of a lot of hassle. Producing Testosterone primarily, but also getting in the way of tucking and being generally inconvenient. This, along with the nasty side affects from the AAs that I have access to, make getting an orchiectomy pretty appealing.

I hear getting an orchiectomy causes penile atrophy. Is this just due to loss of tissue from the DHT and loss of spontaneous erections, or is there some other contributing factor that AAs don't have?

If I get an orchi, will my scrotum just look like it does when my testes ascend into the inguinal canals?

Has anyone in the UK gone overseas to get an orchiectomy (can't get one over here without waiting several month/years, fuck the NHS), and can you recommend a surgeon/give price estimates etc?"

My opinion on the matter changes almost weekly, sometimes more frequently. I'm just worried that I'm only interested sexually, and not genuinely. I definitely do find it arousing, being a girl. And I often doubt myself and think that's the only thing I find appealing. But there is some evidence towards that not being the case, like how when try on a new outfit I really like I get super excited and genuinely happy. But I don't know if that's enough evidence for me. It's just very confusing, because I feel differently on it so often and so I have no idea what I actually want. I often feel like I could enjoy being a girl all the time. But at the same time sometimes I feel I am fine as a guy, and there's no need to change. And often when I try to see what I think on something I doubt my first thought because it feels forced. I often feel like I might be forcing myself to want this lifestyle. But maybe that's just me trying to stick to the easy road? I don't know!

Artichexx,asktransgender,How can I tackle this once and for all?,"Hi everyone. This year I planned my resolution is to become more independent, and finally tackle my gender questioning. Today I think I've somehow managed to finally see the light, and somehow become passionate about the things I care about again without dysphoria de motivating me.

My passion for art/animation is back, and I want to work really hard to get back into a good school, after having dropped out because of issues related to questioning, and building dysphoria.

I think i've finally realized after years of questioning. I think i'm just in denial, and too afraid of what the future can hold for me.

It all boils down to a few thoughts that always keep me back;
- All of this would be a lot of hard work
- I don't think I'm strong enough to handle it
-I've been a male for so long how can I ever adapt
- I don't want anyone to look at me different
- I just want to be the same old me, but in a female body
- I don't want to worry my family
- A lots already going on, and I don't want them to worry about me. They already do enough as is.
- Am I selfish for wanting this, when there are people who are far worse off in life? 

-I don't even have a preferred name yet


My other issues would be on how can I accept myself, and my feelings on this? I repress expressing myself a lot of the times in so many ways. Mostly because I don't want anyone to worry about me...

I've come up with some conclusions that I could try. I found out that there's an informed consent thats really close by me. I could also try some kind of therapy. I'm not sure how I feel about coming out to anyone

I've become soo good at running away, or simply ignoring my issues, but I want to put an end to that. 

Any input is appreciated :)

tgpeoplerule,asktransgender,Did anyone wonder how no one noticed something was up?,"I've been thinking this throughout the past couple of days, but I'm trying to work out how my parents never noticed anything was up during childhood.

OK, this is a mixture of something that has been dysphoria related, and some of it isn't.

Well, here is my story:

When I was 5/6, I hardly ever spoke a word to anyone. I was even too scared to even ask the teacher to go to the toilet, I never spoke a word.


I got so many detentions throughout school, I never did homework, I got suspended about 7 times, I failed loads of exams, I didn't give a care in the world. 


I then went to secondary school. Everything went downhill from there (aged 11/12). I thought that it was a new school, everything would get better, but nope. I had no friends, I would come straight home everyday and just sit and play video games all day. I hardly ever left my room, my health was terrible, I was quite fat at this point. I never actually went out with friends until I was 13.

I started smoking when I was 13 (I don't now, though), I started hanging out with one of my female friends best friend when she moved away, I started smoking, did weed a couple of times and almost took ecstasy (at this point I said ""no"" and just stopped hanging out with her). I don't know if my parents knew, but they don't smoke and they must of smelt the combination of lynx smoke on me. This continued when I was 14.


Then when I turned 15/16, I had my GCSEs. I had so many phone calls home saying I wasn't doing the work for them, I never revised for a single exam, I just never did anything.



However, at the same time, socially I was getting a lot better. I had friends, I'd go out every evening in the summer, my social anxiety magically disappeared and my life was getting better in terms of being anxious.


Then, at 16.5 I got into a fight over my friends. I am really submissive, I literally always do what others do, but one time I had enough and asked about doing what I want to do. I just fell out with them there and then, and stayed in my room completely over the summer. This was really the first time I felt bad mentally since I was 13, because I only think about these things alone.




I started becoming obsessed with transgender issues, I realized I was bisexual, everything was just getting worse and worse. I bought a wig, so I could just have something that was a bit feminine. I did cross dress, and started at 12. Around 16 and 9 months I discovered I might be transgender. Then from here, dysphoria just took over my life.



I then moved onto college at 16, I got threatened to be kicked out, I had meetings with the head of sixth and my parents, they just said that I was lazy and never bother doing the work. It wasn't this at all, it was all gender dysphoria, but I never told anyone about it, I was worried about other people rather than myself. I'm still closeted except for a few people, but no one knows about the dysphoria.

I never went to get a referral to a GIC as I was afraid it was a phase and it will be all over soon, so a referral was pointless. I still think that now. I've never gone out as female before, I've tried makeup only a handful of times, but this was before I realized I was dysphoric. I crossdressed a couple of times, I get mixed feelings over it.


There is obviously a lot more than this, but this is pretty long anyway and I haven't got time to put it all down.

I'm now about to turn 18, I still have done nothing about this. I'm closeted. 



I'm just surprised that no one has really noticed anything was up. I clearly had depression, social anxiety, no one ever really supported me with it at all growing up, and I really needed it. Most people say ""if anything is bothering you, tell someone"" but with social anxiety that is basically impossible.

twasanotherthrowaway,asktransgender,I'm not sure about what should I do. Also I have some questions about SRS with Dr. Chettawut.,"So, the thing is that I'm not sure if I want to get an orchidectomy. It would help me in many ways, easier tucking, not having to take AA (cypro), smaller genital dysphoria.

I live in UK atm, because when I started transitioning, I knew that I wouldn't be able to save for it, and my dysphoria is really bad so I moved here. But I'm Polish, and this summer I'm going to Poland to change my gender marker and stuff.

I'm mentioning that, because orchidectomy in UK costs 2000GBP, which is quite a lot. SRS with Dr. Chettawut costs 6500GBP (more on that later). But if I would do it in Poland (since I'm going there anyway), it would cost me about 600GBP.

I'm wondering, does prices listed on Dr. Chettawut's website are ""complete"" prices, including anesthesia and other costs? I know that I need to pay tickets, food and from what I've heard, hotel room. But still, it doesn't sound that bad. At first I was considering Dr. Suporn, but he's just too expensive. If we round costs to about 8000GBP, I'll be able to save for it in about 14 months (that is, if I'll find a new job, because I just lost my old one).

So, what do you think? Any advice? Opinions?"
GayGuyOrTransGirl,asktransgender,"Do I sound like a just a very feminine, gay cisgender man or a transgender woman?","I'm very feminine! VERY feminine. Like, if I figure out i am a man and I'm in a relationship with another man, I will be the guy with the long hair (my real hair is VERY long), wearing the mens or women's leggings or jeggings or skinny jeans, I will be the girl in the relationship without a doubt (I only like REALLY MASCULINE MEN), I want to hold hands, etc. But, am I just a gay guy or transgender woman?

I'm not going to lie, I have been living as a woman but where I trip up at is, I was never dysphoric over being a guy. I was fine. One of my biggest fears Is, getting into a relationship with a guy and then figuring out years later that I am a transgender woman, when I've gotten more masculine and can't pass. Those are my two biggest fears.

I mean, I'm okay with just being a gay feminine guy in a relationship with another guy. The other day I didn't know if I was, but, I would never be the masculine one. See, I do have fat thighs, curvy-ish hips, fat on my chest and a biggish butt, and I don't mind that at all, I love it. I love having curves and being curvy. But, I don't know how I feel about getting broader shoulders, becoming hairier and things like that. None of them really bother me, but, yeah.

Like, if I am a gay man, I literally see myself being the stay at home man who is just like a wife. I love to cook and clean, have dinner ready, etc and I'm only 18."

So I've been on HRT for about 10 months now (MtF), and so far everything is going really well.
My biggest issue at this point is looking at myself in the mirror and still mostly seeing my male self in my facial features. I can't get past the masculine look of my face and how it looks so much like my father's face. It is one of my biggest sources of dysphoria.

Is there anything you do, or have done, to come to terms with your facial features?"
RileyLacy,asktransgender,I feel like I'll never have a successful transition.,"I'm only 17, I know that's definitely young, mtf/genderfluid, but I'm not going to be able to really transition until I'm in my mid twenties. That's for my own reasons, affording it, college, wanting it to be a more seamless process, etc. I can't get on hormones now, as my parents don't support me. And honestly, I don't know what to do. I feel like it's pointless and I should just go back to living as a ""man"". It's sad, I feel like I'm being denied my own healthcare because of my bigoted parents. I just, I don't know what to think. Honestly I think I'm somewhere between male and female but I've always been feminine, and I feel like transitioning will make things a lot easier. I also feel like I'm going to miss out on the rest of my childhood. Lately I've been dreaming (not literally dreaming) about going to prom as a beautiful girl, and I know prom isn't all that it's made out to be, but I don't want to miss out on that experience. It's making my anxiety and presentation skills far worse, and my parents know I'm depressed but don't care enough to do anything about it. I just feel hopeless. Especially, when I'm attracted to females, it makes me feel more masculine, and vice versa for males, which makes things even more confusing. Am I just crazy?"
saltysmilodon,asktransgender,What do I do after I have my name legally changed?,"I'm in the process of getting my name legally changed. I still have to go before a judge and convince them that this name change is necessary. I'm wondering what I do in the instance of my state ID. Do I have to pay for it out of pocket to get the correct name on it, or will it be free of charge? "
bitchassthrowawaybro,asktransgender,How do you deal with the baby-related triggers? Will it be possible for trans women to bare their own children in the future?,"So I've recently discovered the fact that I'm probably a trans woman, and I'd like to start transitioning soon, but there are certain facts that just crush me to think about. I know that I'll probably pass fine within a year or two, because I'm young (21) and have a decent amount going for me in terms of feminine features. I also have a decent amount going against me, but I feel luckier than most who find themselves in my position.

However, it's the random triggers of hopelessness throughout the day that are really starting to get to me. Ever since I started questioning this summer, they've gotten worse and worse. For the most part, it's anything to do with being able to carry a child. It's a very odd feeling when I know that I'm genetically male, yet an overwhelming sense of despair hits me suddenly when I see anything ranging from a new mother and her baby to a fucking tampon in someones purse, reminding me I'll never need them. These types of tiny little instances can turn me into a sobbing mess. I've gotten a bit better at repressing the tears when that (now familiar) feeling comes on, but I'm afraid I won't be able to if I get on hrt. I don't think I'd be able to handle these hopeless feelings with estrogen in my system, because I can barely manage them now...

Like every single trans woman reading this, I wish nothing more in life than to have simply been born a girl. To live authentically and effortlessly in the body I was born in. I know that's simply not going to be true for me in this life, and my mind has wandered to some very dark places because of this fact.

However, I take a bit of comfort in the fact that medical science is advancing so rapidly. Uterus transplants in cis women have had recent success, and should be applicable to trans women in the relatively near future. If only there were a solution to the absence of ovaries...

(***main question***) I recently had the thought that, because cloning and artificial insemination exist, shouldn't you theoretically be able to remove the nucleus of a donor egg cell and replace it with the nucleus of a trans woman's sperm cell? Could this new egg then be fertilized by a partner's sperm and produce a zygote? Shouldn't it also be possible to artificially fertilize the egg of a cis woman with the nucleus from an egg of a trans man?

Does anyone know if this type of thing is biologically possible? Has it been done with animals? If I can convince myself that it could be medically possible for me to get pregnant with my own child in the next 10-15 years, I'd have a much easier time with being negatively triggered by all things baby-related.

Please post anything you have seen or read on the subject of trans women being able to one day bare children. This is the one major hangup that is preventing me from jumping to start transition. I have always known I'd like to be a parent some day, but only recently have I considered the fact that I didn't necessarily want or need to be a father...

AuroraSophia,asktransgender,Looking at adding dydrogesterone to my HRT cocktail.,"Visiting my psych tomorrow for a consult and a top up for my meds... and I'd like to bring the issue of adding progesterone to the mix. Now I know that the most common progestogen used is medroxyprogesterone, but that doesn't give all the desired effect that natural progesterone offers. From what I understand it functions better as an AA.

So I'm now looking at just micronised progesterone or dydrogesterone which is a progestogen but not... in the sense that it's as bio-identical to progesterone as possible without any of the unwanted effects of say medroxyprogesterone.

I've seen only a few mentions of dydrogesterone here, or anywhere, but it seems that it's 10-20 more potent than natural progesterone. Firstly, I'd like to know if anyone tried using this, and what doses would you recommend. And what effects did you notice?"

I still feel like I'm really far from presenting in front of friends/public but each passing day really makes me want to take the plunge.

With that being said, I don't really know and haven't really met too many trans people in my life. I find it's been kind of bugging me lately. As I take more steps into transition I find myself really wanting to be able to talk to other trans people to try and get some perspective on things.

I just have a hypothetical question: if I as a trans women never have worked as a sex worker and never had anal sex but only 'normal' penis in (neo)vagina sex with men and occasionaly oral, would I be at a higher risk of HIV than cis women?

Also do cis women who have regular anal sex with men a higher risk rate of HIV?"
Huppdader,asktransgender,"Aw, fuck. About to start HRT but I've never had this many doubts. Anyone else who had this?","Bit of a suicide trigger warning. Sorry. :(

So got back from my blood works this morning, already have those lovely pills and pretty much waiting for confirmation from the test to make sure there's nothing I overlooked. 

I've been getting more and more depressed over the last few months. I don't know if this makes sense but the waves of dysphoria have gotten a lot more extreme on both ends and I think a lot of it comes from just low self esteem and uncertainty for the future. 

While I drove home from the medical post today I had this intense urge to just steer left, hit a truck and save myself and the people around me so much suffering and disappointment. 

Every time my mind gets flooded with doubts whether or not this is the right course of action I considered suicide a lot because it seems more and more like a reasonable solution I can't really disregard anymore? 

I'm constantly switching between two thought-bubbles.

When the dysphoria gets less and quite manageable in situations where I'm super active and too busy to think about it I end up pondering ""Hey, maybe it's not so bad living as a guy. Maybe if I just toss my clothes away, avoid transgender people and never think of it again, I'll manage. You'll just have to shave your legs and arms every other day and not look in a mirror."" Honestly. I wasn't happy before I found these things out, but I could deal with it. I wish I could go back to the times of ignorance and stick there. Forever. 

Then something happens and it swings the other way. ""You'll never pass. My face is too masculine. My hairline is fucked. You'll be homeless. Whatever you gain in terms of hating your body less will just be replaced by loneliness and rejection. You're going to ruin any other possibility to feel happy if this doesn't work out. You're not really transgender, but just a delusional idiot."" Like I start trying to actively talking myself out of it - even this close to starting.

I'm also scared the cypro will make my depression a lot worse and that -for some reason- I'll end up being that rare case for who it all fucks up and who gets the raw end of the deal. 

I've sort of concluded that if I don't start, I'll probably end myself this year. I don't even feel guilty about it anymore. It's just too much for me to handle. I have more problems other than my dysphoria, but this is the one I want to tackle first. Best case scenario, I'll feel better. Hopefully good enough to keep going. Worst case scenario everything goes wrong and I can still make that rather resolute decision to quit.

If some mystical genie came up to me and said I could take a 10% chance to be happy and 90% chance to just die on the spot gamble, I'd take it without having to think about it. 

Did anyone else have sudden extreme doubts before starting HRT? If so, how did you deal with it? Did they get worse? When did they go away? 

When did you start feeling better -mostly emotionally- after you started HRT? Or did you feel the same? I guess it's a very big YMMV thing.

Does anyone have experience with taking cypro when you're already depressed and how did it change how you felt? "

boogie_man_,asktransgender,I want to transition while working at an elementary school -- any similar experiences/advice?,"Hey folks. I'm in the middle of my third year working at an elementary school after school program. The kids are K-5, and many of them have been there since I started and know me fairly well. 

Recently, I've decided I want to transition to living as a man with my family and in my professional life. (Technically, I ID as nonbinary, but I want to begin T, etc, and I think this is the best/most comfortable option for me.) There are resources online re: transitioning at work, but most of these resources assume office jobs, etc. I am not necessarily concerned with my coworkers' reactions; I live in a liberal state and city and I am not the first trans person to be employed in the program (though the kids didn't know this). My concern is the kids/parents.

Has anyone gone through a similar experience re: coming out to kids and parents this way? Any teachers or other childcare professionals? I'm fortunate to be in a fairly liberal city/school district, but I still worry and wonder what advice people might have for how to share this information, especially with children I have known for a couple years now, to whom my transition will be obvious and potentially affecting. Even just knowing folks have gone through similar experiences could be helpful.

I am young and in grad school, so it would not be a total upheaval to my career to leave this job to pursue my transition. But I enjoy it there, it works for my life right now, and I love those kids, and I would prefer to keep them in my life."
kalinychja,asktransgender,"Struggling with sexuality, might be partially because of gender?","Physically, sexually, I am firmly only attracted to other guys. 100% gay in the physical realm. I kissed a girl once and I felt gross for a week. It was awful. No desire for getting physical with a girl.

Except that like, girls are attractive??? I have no idea what part of me is recognizing that and what it expects to come from it. But like I'll see a girl, and find her very attractive, and I'll simultaneously be very intimidated and also really want to talk to her? Flirt with her? Even though I don't want anything to come out of it? Except becoming emotionally very close and maybe cuddling a little sometimes I'm not sure? I'm like, friend attracted to her plus maybe cuddling??? Not sure where I stand on cuddling???

But then I'll see a guy, and he doesn't even need to be very attractive, even just moderately attractive and I want to get with it, you feel? But I cannot connect emotionally with guys. I just want to bro around with guys and maybe suck dick sometimes, but in terms of genuine emotional connection, that's pretty much only with girls.

And long-term I feel like I could only ever see myself with a guy, but I'd need to find a guy I could connect with emotionally. I could see myself dating a girl, but since I wouldn't even want to kiss her, I couldn't see it going very far, I'm not even sure if it would be real dating.

But I feel like maybe this is gender stuff. Like the trouble with men. I used to not have that problem until I started coming to terms with being trans, and now I have *massive* anxiety about men. Like my band director will talk to me, he can say something positive, doesn't matter, I will just break down crying for no reason other than that he is a man that is talking to me. I feel so ingenuine with other guys, and terrified at the prospect of trying to ""prove"" myself, and terrified at the prospect of other guys not accepting me as a guy. So I feel like if I could get over that, I could just be a normal gay guy who is both physically attracted to men and also emotionally able to be in a genuine relationship with a man.

And for the most part I brush off the girl thing as like, something weird and platonic, but then I worry that maybe I'm bi and my physical attraction to women is just stiffled by my dysphoria??? And then I worry that I'm actually straight and my physical attraction to women is stiffled by dysphoria and also my attraction to male bodies is just an expression of my own desire to have a male body but I'm not *really* into men and that's why I can't get the emotional part down?

Like if I had to say I'd probably just call myself gay but I can't deny that I sometimes have weird feelings that I don't know what they are about girls.

I've been trying to get up the nerve to ask this for a few weeks now. I am 23 years old and i've known myself to be transgendered since i was 14 and found out it was an actual thing. But ever since then, for one reason or another, ive been putting off Finding a therapist to help me transition. When i was younger i was afraid to talk to my mom about it, and when i finally moved out it made sense to leave it until i was financially stable. Now, however, im not sure if ill even have this option in a year if I don't start soon. But Trying to find a therapist on the internet is a lot harder than i thought it would be, since so many of the listings online are tagged for Transgender treatment but don't mention it at all on their sites and its really very confusing to deal with. Theoretically, i could call around and try to feel them out, but i just dont think i have it in me to try several therapists. I dont even like talking about my issues with the people closest to me and honestly the idea of talking about it with a complete stranger terrifies me, however necessary it might be. Some of the stories I've read about bad therapists don't do much to help my anxiety either.

So, i came here. Hopefully someone from my area will see this and point me in the right direction. I'm looking for someone willing to help me get on hormones sooner rather than later but i know that's rarer than some of us would hope. Personal Experience with the therapist definitely a plus.

I'd like to give a pre-emptive thanks to anyone who can help, and if you can't, Thanks for taking the time to read at least. And again, if this breaks any rules I am sorry, and i wont be too put out if it gets deleted."
Call_me_Cassius,asktransgender,"Wanting to change my name, but mom is very opposed","I think I've really finally settled on a name (it's not Cassius.) Although I decided to commit somewhat recently, it has been one of my favorites for the going-on-4 years I've known I was trans. If I still love it 4 years later, I should probably just go with it, you know?

But my given name is unisex. Technically. Growing up I loved it, because I knew four other people with it and they were all boys. But around 2010 it suddenly got *very* popular for girls, and there's a very high-profile female celebrity with the name, and although for my age group it's technically used as unisex, at this point it's pretty firmly feminine (to the point of kids asking me why I have a girl name if I look like a boy.) Could I get away with keeping it? Absolutely. Do I want to? Not really.

But my mom insists that since I have a unisex name I should keep it. She says she put a lot of love into picking my name, and if I really love her I won't change it. Hella manipulative, I know, but it gets to me regardless. I already have a rocky relationship with my mom and I don't want to lose her (especially because losing her would ultimately mean losing my whole family) over this. 

So I planned to just change it legally, use the name I want in most realms of my life, but let my family keep calling me by my given name and not tell them I changed it. Except that I don't think I can hide it. At the very least I'd need to be on a different insurance than my mom, so that when I update my name for insurance she doesn't get a new card with my name on it (idk how everyone else's works, but all our insurance cards are identical with all of our names on it.) Plus there's the fear of having to do to stupid announcement in the newspaper and her seeing it, or someone we know seeing it and telling her. I know I wouldn't realistically be able to keep a name change a secret forever, but I'm hoping if I can give it a few years maybe she'll come around to the idea, or our relationship will stabilize more so that even if she's hurt it's not catastrophic, or she'll get over her stupid victim complex like everything I do is just a ploy to spite her. 

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Did you change it? Could you hide it? How'd it go?

I'm starting to think my brain is just stupid and that's just who I am because life is only getting worse for me the harder I try. People already don't like me. And I feel like an idiot trying to be ""one of the girls"" because I'm so fucking ugly.

I'm just really really really really shit at life. And being trans isn't working, so there's another reason to give up. If the rest of my life and personality and myself were all great but I didn't really pass, fine. If I could pass and help fix some of the rest of my life that way, cool. But when everything is this horrible I don't see a way to be happy. I have been here so many times and it never gets any better.

Fuck being trans. Fuck not passing. Fuck me for being a moron. Fuck this whole shitty life thing. I just want to fucking die already please."
ItsAlmostAlice,asktransgender,I'm sorry but I need help again.,"I'm on Medicaid. I can't afford my medicine or the surgery. And with the proposed over 1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, I'm terrified. I know some can transition without ever needing hrt. Or transition before getting hrt. But I need hrt. I can't watch my body go back. I can't live with that. I have social and physical dysphoria. And even if I continue living as myself when I'm not able to be on hormones, the physical dysphoria will be too intense. And the remasculinization of my body will cause people to view me as male again and cause me a lot of social dysphoria again. I'm terrified. I can't stop hormones. I can't push back the surgery. I know other people have been able to. But they're not me. Only I'm me. And I know I can't make it."
throwawaymightbtrans,asktransgender,FTM question - how did makeup feel prior to realising you were trans?,"To clarify: I'm 21, just figuring things out, and this is regarding my experience with makeup as a whole throughout life. 

I currently only wear makeup for 1) doing stuff on stage, 2) being in cosplay (so I look less tired, lol) and 3) if I'm going on a night out and want to break out the glitter (once or twice a year).

Makeup has always felt super heavy and clunky on my face, and I feel like no matter how I do it I look like a man in drag. I'm now wondering if this is because I am, in fact, a man in drag. In other words, I'm wondering if every time I've put makeup on it's looked so wrong because I'm seeing myself as more masculine than I really am... if that makes sense??

I have a few sensory issues so I do think that's a large part of it - in fact, until I actually questioned my gender I assumed that was why I hated makeup so much. But now I'm wondering if there's more to it than just sensory stuff.

So my question to the gentlemen and masculine leaning folks in the room: what's your experience with makeup prior to realising you were trans? 

EDIT: thank you to everyone who's responded, it's been helpful. It's also really interesting how many different perspectives there are on this!

ts_curious,asktransgender,Anyone else that felt mostly dysphoric in bed?,"So, I (mtf) have finally after a year of serious soul searching and talking to a therapist found out that I am transgender. Not 100% sure how female i feel, maybe more around 60%, but not 100% female at this point. I have always identified as a crossdresser, and given other circumstances I would probably looked into transitioning. 

I am married, and my wife is ok and understanding of me being transgender, but not transitioning. She is bisexual, so I hope she might be able to change her mind, but it is not a deal breaker.

My dysphoria is quite mild, and so I am not comfortable with pursuing transitioning now if that will cause my marriage to fall apart. I can't really pinpoint any dysphoria related to my gender role, social or physical, and I guess I experience more euphoria when crossdressing, but I feel that mostly my dysphoria is related to my gender role during sex I think... I fantasize about being the female in bed, and am probably more submissive, but though I have had fantazies of having sex with men, its more to do with the feeling of being female I guess. Never felt any attraction towards men. Anyone else experienced dysphoria like this? Or am I just imagining it?"

The places I've worked don't know that I'm trans and one of them (where I had the most experience) wasn't a progressive accepting place at all.  If my old jobs got a call from someone asking for Danielle [last name] and about her work experience, they would think, *Who?  We had a [dead name last name], is that who you mean?*  Then I'd have to explain that I'm trans to the new place which is annoying and potentially problematic since I'm planning to go stealth.

After I woke up, my first thought was that I really liked the idea of having a girlfriend who was specifically trans because the dream was so nice. Then I worried that I was being objectifying. Then I started to think that I wasn't being offensive because the dream was entirely romantic and not sexual, and that I may have just been wanting to feel the way the dream made me feel in real life. But it's always best to ask rather than assume, so I decided to ask here.
So, is it offensive to want to find a girlfriend who is trans? Am I being chasery? Am I fetishizing people's gender?

mashedvote,asktransgender,Being half out,"I've been trying out going by my preferred name and preferred pronoun with a small group of friends. It has felt been pretty great so far. I am not out to my family yet and not out at school. I live in a different country to my family and I know these friends in a completely different context from school so I really don't have to worry about the two worlds ever meeting. I still feel to some extent that I am experimenting with it but I am pretty sure I am a trans girl.

It has begun to feel more and more unpleasant to go by my birth name and assigned pronoun at school and I just impulsively came out to one of my best school friends (she was amazing and immediately asked me about preferred pronouns etc). I hadn't planned on coming out at school until later and now I feel a bit awkward asking my friend to use my preferred pronouns with such and such a person, but not such and such a person. Like, what is reasonable to ask of her? 

I've told her my preferred name and I would like to be out my close school friends and that they would use my name and correct pronouns. But I'm not sure if I am ready to be out completely at school so I would be asking them to keep my secret and switch modes depending on who they are talking to. This sounds like a mindfuck and not at all fair to do to them. Do I need to just bite the bullet now and come out at school if I want my school friends to gender me correctly?

Some information that may or may not be relevant:

I'm 36, school is university. I have 2 years left after this academic year.

I've started getting my face lasered.

I wear exclusively women's clothes now but not super feminine at school.

I probably won't get to start hormones until at least a year from now (unless I self medicate), maybe voice training towards the end of the summer. "

flox901,asktransgender,I'm lost,"Hi there, I'm an 18-yo cisgendered male thinking about transitioning but am quite lost :s.

Firstly, I alsways thought about what being a female would be like from very early on. I never acted on these thoughts as they seemed like curiosity and not as frequent. But, recently, say the last 2 years of my life, they have become more and more frequent to the point where I am now. If there was a button I could press that would turn me into a woman, I'd press that button multiple times every time. 

In my dreams, I see myself always as a woman now, and when I wake up and notice I am still a male, I'm pissed at myself for not taking the plunge. Whenever I nowadays see some beautiful female clothing, my heart starts beating faster and thoughts about trying it on etc. start filling my head.(sorry, not the best wording)

Yet, when I start thinking about the whole trajectory that is transitioning I start to become a bit hesitant. Because, living my life as a male right now is not too bad. I don't have suicidal thoughts some of you. My life isn't too bad right now. But, I feel like I have never experienced true happiness about who I am.

I feel like I'm playing a script. And the older I got, the more dull it became. I want to emphasize that I'm not hesitant to come out to my family and friends, I'm quite certain they would be very supportive. 

Now that I've written this all up it seems clear to me that I should probably see a therapist about this but I'd like to know wether I should tell my family about that or wait for the result of the therapy.

My sincere apologies for the style I wrote this down, typing this on my phone with English as a second language, it can be quite hard to notice spelling errors ^^.

Anyway, thanks for reading!"

I often obsess about my dumb enormous fat head because it's very big 'n' large.  However I suspect this is just dysphoria in disguise due to having pretty bald temples, which I *hate*, AAAA.  Unfortunately I still hate my head along with the rest of my dumb alien ectomorph skeleton.  FFS might be in my future but it's a long way off.  It gives me a lot of stress - I think the reason I'm so fatalistic about it is that I'm also 6'3'', as if being trans wasn't enough of a bad joke as it is already.  yeehaw.

[deleted],asktransgender,Signs of dysphoria reducing? Or something else?,"Started HRT (4mg estradiol, 200mg spiro) in mid-december, so it's been about 2.5 weeks now.

I've noticed a few small changes (odor, body hair growing slower, definitely the beginnings of some boobage happening mostly on the left, and other things I may be imagining). I've been waiting for the psychological changes to hit and give me the clarity I need to answer the question: Am I really transgender or is this about something else?

It didn't seem like the hormones did anything because I've been in constant conflict and have intense anxiety, just as I did before starting. But I realized sometime in the last couple days, I seem to be a little different mentally.

First, I seem to be thinking about this less. And when I do think about it, I kind of just shrug it off and think about something else. Second, sex and sexual feelings were one of the primary motivations for me transitioning in the first place, but now that my sex drive seems reduced, that need to become a woman seems to be fading as well. Third, I seem to have a reduced need to cross dress (yes I still consider it crossdressing because I don't think I'm actually a woman) except for a sports bra because of nipple sensitivity. And finally, while I'm still very much questioning whether I should continue, I also have doubts about stopping treatment.

Did anyone else go through something similar? Could those be signs of dysphoria fading (not that I really ever had dysphoria, this was all about euphoria for me)? Or could those be signals that it's not about being transgender at all? I'm still absolutely terrified of the next steps, especially those with permanent results such as more boob growth and lasering my face off, so I'm just holding off on getting those things done (I guess boob growth will happen with or without my say)"

I used this as an opportunity to tell my mom that i was transgender and bisexual. I couldnt tell her in person no matter how hard i tried and this i thought would be the best way to do it. She seemed fine with everything, except for the transgender part. She kept on saying son in the text messages and kind of ignoring it. Maybe im overthinking it idk. She said we would talk when i got home, but i was dead tired and used that as an excuse to avoid conversation. As im writing this my mom still thinks im in bed sleeping.

We had a huge fight about being trans. She still thinks that there has to be an other way than HRT. I started 2 months ago.

I'm way happier than I have been before HRT, she isn't and that's why My relationship is probably going to end when we meet again. 

I really love her. Next weekend, we'd be together for 8 years and I don't regret a single second.
Yet, she says I ruined her life because I didn't talk about being trans for such a long time, although I did as soon as I was aware of it myself. I couldn't identifiy these feeling for 25 years.

As I'm lying here, I'm thinking about what my options are. I can't imagine a life without her, and no life without HRT. If we break up, the girl I always loved will have financial problems. I'm even more concernee about her than about me.

In my eyes, the best way would be to end it. I've been suicidal for a long time of my life and I can't see any other way right now to ever get out of this. I've been crying and hyperventilating for nearly 4 hours now... I think I really need some help

Naturally I'm really pissed off and don't quite understand what she expects of me. At this rate I don't know when I'll be able to begin hormones and that really bothers me. The wait is really awful and I feel like it is wasted time especially because I wanted to start presenting full time in 2018 but who knows if that will even be possible now.

Now I can't help but feel like it would be easier just to lie to her about various emotional things just to appease her whereas before I always told the truth.

Just really frustrated.

avjjx10,asktransgender,FTM 13 too scared to come out,"Hi, I'm 13 years old FTM, and I'm terrified to come out to my parents. They are both older (40s-50s) and not that up to date on anything modern. My dad is unpredictable, extremely Christian, and he thinks gay people have ""demons."" It's terribly hard to explain him. So lately I've been very depressed, and my mom asked what was wrong. (She is also christian and her view on gay people isn't amazing as far as I know.) I told her I couldn't tell her cause she might not love me anymore, then she said that she would always love any of her children. I also live with my grandma, who is Morman, but not a strict morman, doesn't go to church, but she always says morman families are happier. So once awhile ago, my dad came across something where I wrote I was bisexual, and asked me about it. I told him that I was just trying to fit in and he said ""Okay good."" My grandma also heard about it and said, ""I'm glad you aren't cause that made my stomach upset"" BUT, my grandma has a lesbian friend, she's her best friend. She always helps our family. My grandma says she loves her but wishes she wasn't lesbian and went to church. So anyways, awhile ago I told my dad I was an athiest, and my family still has a hard time accepting that. Anyways, I also told my parents I was tomboy. (They kind of already knew that but it's been bugging me more lately and I've been more masculine) so I asked my dad to cut my hair. I told him that girly girls cut their hair short too. He said no absolutely not, then started reading to me out of the bible about how girls hair is ""sacred"" So anyways, I'm terrified to come out, I feel pretty safe, but I have TERRIBLE anxiety. I'm just so scared. I don't have anyone to go stay with, and plus if I tried, I know my dad would say no. My uncle is gay, and my dad dislikes my uncle, and when my grandma's friend got married, my dad wouldn't let me and my brother attend the ceremony. I just feel hopeless and so lonely. I can't wait for 5 more years to come out and transition. (That didn't mean ""I can't wait!"" That I can't wait, actually means I can't wait. Like I can't go on living if I have to wait.) Every day is a living hell, I'm home schooled and have no friends. I am so dysphoric and just want to die. All I do every day is sit in my room crying, sleeping, getting fat, telling myself how much I want to die, so so scared to come out cause my family would never look at me the same. They would probably think I'm weird or a freak. By the way, I know for a fact I'm gay, I like guys, and have a tiny feminine side. That's also why I've probably been able to cope with my birth assigned gender, and, in a way, not know when I was younger. Anyways, any advice would be great even though I know it will do nothing because tomorrow I'll be too much of a wimp to come out. I'm such a wimp, that's why I'm not dead already, I don't want any pain. Ugh I hate my life. Sorry this was long.

Update: My 2nd cousin is trans and my age, and I really want to get in touch with him, I know his facebook, but we never talk cause my dad dislikes them. Plus, I have social anxiety and feel like it would be stalkerish to talk to him. Also, his families opinion on mine isn't amazing, cause they think we are so judgemental and rude, which my parents are, but little does he know I'm exactly like him. ):"

I can't help but wonder if by conflagration of ""Gender Dysphoria"" with ""distress due to Gender Dysphoria"" we dilute the meaning of ""gender dysphoria"".



I think ""Gender Dysphoria"" is: wrongness or discomfort *irrespective* of whether there is any ensuing distress it may or **may not** cause.


Please note I refer to it as a symptom not as a diagnosis. Just as many of us use it as a verb or adjective rather than a noun.

EDIT:

For people that disagree. I can't explain how to otherwise rationalize statements like ""I don't get any dysphoria"" by people who go onto to describe their gender dysphoria. They HAVE to mean distress: Else there'd be no vernacular for relating to ""dysphoric"" people whose mental health is not negatively affected by their gender identity being mistmatched with their assigned gender, or their desire to live as another gender identity."

Soapsoph,asktransgender,Changing Sexuality confusion (mtf),"Hi, I am a 20 year old transwoman, and I figured this could be the place to go to ask about this sort of thing ha ha. I've been on hormones for about 9 months now, and its has been the best decision of my life. I feel more myself than ever. However I've started to increasingly grown confused with my sexuality as I have transitioned. So I guess Im asking if anyone else has experience or advice regarding my situation? More details are below

Before I transitioned I was predominantly attracted to women, although I dont think I ever felt the same kind of attraction that most cis men my age seemed to experience. I never felt a powerful sexual urge unless I had become seriously emotionally attached to a girl, but I would feel it in these scenarios. There were a few moments that I think I might have had a small interest in a boy but it was few and far between. However for some reason I could never flirt with girls or bring myself to identify who I find attractive, but if my female friends talked about guys they liked i would chime in as a ""joke"" which is confusing to me. Flirting with men has always been more natural to me even when I was substantially more attracted to women.

Anyway now as Ive been taking hormones Ive found myself growing increasingly attracted to men, but my sexuality seems to fluxuate more than anything. One day Ill find myself more attracted to women, and the next men. Yet the shift to being attracted to males has become more and more frequent. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Am I going to eventually stop being attracted to women? Im just confused and I guess Im looking to hear other peoples experiences. Thanks :)"
boldheart,asktransgender,Coming out to my GP &amp; gyno... Help?,"Hi. I'm a pre-transition trans guy. I have a family doctor (officially he is internal medicine) who has me on meds for depression and hypothyroidism. Last year I went to a gynecologist to get on birth control for very heavy periods. My next gyno appointment is next month, for my first pap smear. My next family doctor appointment is in March but I may come out to him via email so I might have a sooner appointment.


I'm almost 21 and came out as trans to my family when I was 15. I've been to 4 different therapists and my current is the first to be knowledgeable about the whole process (she is trans herself).


Now, I want to start hrt soon. But the first step is to alert my 2 regular doctors. I'm extremely scared. I have no idea how they will react. Can anyone give me advice on how to come out to them so they know I want to start testosterone?


My local hospital is a branch of Cleveland Clinic, who is lgbt friendly, but I'm still really worried."
Bsapp13,asktransgender,Anyone with OCD?,"This may be a bit long... I apologize in advance! 

I am a cisgender female and had a baby 6 months ago. During my pregnancy I started to get really bad anxiety towards the end thinking I was going to die during labor. You could not have told me otherwise ( I wrote my baby and boyfriend letters). I thought the anxiety would go away After having her and it did about that. But now it changes to different things. I.e) scared I would commit suicide Bc I read a post about it, thought I didn't love my boyfriend, about the illuminati, about it war, about my daughter, and about being transgender. I first had the anxiety and obsessed about that about 6 - 7 weeks post partum after my boyfriend showed me a video of a young trans girl and I couldn't stop thinking about it I was devastated. It went away and was replaced by another obsession but I've had that one a few times since then and is usually easy to move on from. I am currently having it now and it feels so much more real this time. I am scared that I want to be a gay male. I know I like men. I have never questioned my gender not that I can remember. I have never had a problem with my body other than the usual things girls don't like about themselves. I was watching a video someone posted about things that may mean you're trans and it said if you ever played when you were little and wanted to be the male (I used to go to a daycare where we played house all the time and I can't remember what role I played) and then saw a comment where someone said they had never cross dressed c they would look like a boy in a dress and not a girl so it was pointless to them and that comment gave me anxiety and idk if it's Bc I have had a similar thought like that or what? I honestly can't remember if I have or not. I try to picture myself as a male but just have apathy or the thought ""that was weird"" when I picture it but since I've been having this obsession I get anxiety calling my self mama to my baby girl, I have been waking up in the middle of the night - the thoughts are waking me up I guess. It has been a nightmare. And I can't tell if I'm scared of actually being it or of hurting the people I love. I just want to go back to being a woman and. Not thinking about it!! I know trans people say they get tired of people saying they have trans OCD and that no one can tell someone else if they are but please help. I am so stuck and I was crying for days about it but now I can't really and I just feel anxious all day. 

And I also have the thought we'll because I have had anxiety since pregnancy it's Bc I want to be a man and not a woman. I have never had anxiety before in my life except once and that went away after a few months. I have no idea what caused that but I think the adderall I was on.  Oh &amp; yes I have been diagnosed with OCD by a Arnp in psychiatry, a psychiatrist, and a therapist but of course I always doubt it. 

I know that activities/ sexual preference don't matter but just a few things about me to help maybe...

-I have cheered my whole life
-I have always loved getting my nails done, makeup, tanning, etc. 
-I have never had a problem being called she, her, or anything related. 
-I always wanted my mom to have more girls so I could have sisters. 
- I can't remember ever hoping to be a guy but I feel like my OCD is giving me false memories like the ones stated above. 
-I have always picture myself being a wife with a beautiful diamond ring and a mother 
- I've had a boob job. Bc I wanted them perkier.. lol



Thank you!"
TrueHOAS,asktransgender,Weird but important: Knees....,"I just noticed that girls seem to have a much less pronounced knee. Will this go away with HRT? Do muscles push the knee cap up or something, so will they get less pronounced when taking HRT? Or will the fat distribution do the thing? I am skinny so this might even be the case that the knee cap is visible."
barnebae,asktransgender,At what point did you feel you'd reached certain milestones?,"I'm just over a month into HRT and I'm already feeling the light pain in my nipples and my skin seems to be rapidly getting more soft which is ♥. I'm not presenting as female and I don't feel ready in any way to. However, I do  paint my nails however I'd like and I'm slowly getting accustomed to the idea of wearing light makeup in public. I'm slowly getting better at doing my nails, but I have to work on the makeup a lot still. My hair is also getting longer, but it's still a lion mane and not really anything super feminine.

When did you change to a female hairstyle? Finally figure out makeup? Knew how to paint your nails well? Started seeing noticeable effects from HRT? Started using your feminine voice?

Were you on HRT? Were you 2 years into HRT? Have you been doing it for years and you still aren't on HRT? 

When did you feel like you'd reached certain milestones? I know YMMV! Just interested in hearing about experiences."
Slothentic,asktransgender,"What should I expect when talking about how I feel like I'm a woman, not a man, to my family for the first time?","Okay, so today I decided that I am going to talk about the fact I am currently questioning my gender to my parents and brother who I still live with soon. 

I'm 95% certain I am a woman who is currently in a mans body; I'm going to see if I can speak to a therapist about it as that seems sensible, but want my families support while I do this if possible.

I've planned it out a bit. I have enough money in the bank and enough income that I can move out of home immediately if necessary, just in case there are issues staying with my parents, and will see if there's a friend I can stay with for a few nights if needed closer to the time. I'm also going to reach out to a local transgender support group as well before doing anything.

The main two things I'm asking:
How did you get/not get your thoughts and emotions across clearly to your family?
What are the questions I should be prepared for from my parents and brother?

Thanks in advance, and at the moment I really would appreciate any advice you can give as I want to make sure I've thought everything I can through.

EDIT:
As someone in the comments pointed out, it would be really useful if you can share any links to websites and info that you found useful early on, both to send to my parents if needed and for myself. I'd like to say i know everything about being trans and what to expect, but I really don't, and my current knowledge on the subject is relatively limited. So, any help would be appreciated!"

Miscamthropic,asktransgender,Reminder: Hormones and hormone-blockers are relatively inexpensive to pay for out-of-pocket. Don't let the changes to health care scare you away from being who you need to be.,"I was discussing this with my doctor the last time I went. I told her that I was really concerned about not being able to see her whenever my health insurance is ended (I'm on state run Medicaid). She told me that I'm fortunate that her clinic works on a sliding-scale basis, so even when I don't have insurance I'll be able to at least see a doctor without paying an outrageous fee.

Estrogen and testosterone are both quite affordable, as is spironolactone. I'm not sure about other forms of HRT because those are the three that I have the most experience with, but for most people the cost of HRT is not going to be the determining factor in whether or not they are able to transition.

So talk to you doctor about your concerns, and be aware that since pre-existing conditions are about to no longer be covered, the majority of us who are currently being ""treated"" for being transgender will have to foot the bill.

Blood tests can be quite expensive, though. That's a problem for a lot of people. My only advice there would be to ask your doctor if they can be as infrequent as possible. I do mine every six months, which comes to about $400 twice a year without insurance. Expensive, but worth it for something as important as transition."

A_Windward_flame,asktransgender,Handling curious children (particularly when parents are around)?,"So I've been pondering how to handle curious children asking questions along the lines of 'are you a boy or a girl?'

I always feel like I should say something along the lines of 'does it matter?' to try and spark thoughts about the relevance of gender in a lot of situations, and hopefully change society's views on gender one small step at a time. Problem is I always worry if any adults present will react, or be thinking 'oh my god look at these $%£$% trans people trying to push the ""trans agenda"" on children' (I am probably just paranoid... overwhelmingly people tend to be reasonable right?) and making things worse.

So I usually just end up smiling and saying 'I'm a girl'

michelle_p,asktransgender,ADHD affecting GD intensity?,"When I described the funk I've been in recently, my therapist said that she thought I might be bored. This resonated with me. I googled careers for the easily bored and most of the results mentioned ADHD. I have never been hyperactive, but the symptoms of ADHD-pi are eerily familiar.

I don't have an official diagnosis, so maybe I am thinking out of turn, but I was wondering if something like ADHD could affect the severity of GD. I am not even sure which way I think it would go, more or less, but not being able to focus might make it easier for thoughts about gender to intrude more frequently and easily.

longhairedthrowawa,asktransgender,Just feel like an opportunity was wasted,"So texas introduced a bathroom bill, like literally just a couple weeks ago. It made huge news it seems especially amongst the feminist community.

Yet tens of thousands of women got together to protest a dude who's already in office yesterday [right in front of where that bill will be voted on](http://i.imgur.com/ZSjrxq8.jpg), and from what i heard from friends only a very small fraction were there with signs against the bathroom bill etc.

PM_ME_YOUR_WHOLESOME,asktransgender,"Yet another ""Am I transgender"" thread, yet...","So hey guys, obviously a throwaway as not out to anyone (not to myself I guess? but getting closer probably?). So well, thing is, I don't know if I'm trans or not. But I can't stop thinking about it.  
Ever since I'm like, 12 (I'm 22 right now), I felt like I wanted to be a girl. Actually you can see the switch as I only played video games as male characters before, and exclusively female characters afterwards. I was trying to not think it was me I was representing but still... I even went to the point of putting like exact copies of me in The Sims, including the fact of being vegetarian, but as female. Of course I didn't say ""well this is me as I should be"" when I created those characters, but I feel like you can see a pattern in those choices.  
Once in high school a girl told me I played the woman very well in a class, whereas there was no fixed gender in the ""play"" and I wasn't trying to do that specifically, but it actually filled me with joy.  
I went through depression (not linked to the gender thingy) and this skipped out of my mind a bit, but now I can't stop thinking about it. I use female gendered pronouns online, 'pretend' I'm a woman or a transgender woman...
Thing is, I don't really feel depressed by being male, I just feel I'd way rather be female but I'm really afraid of how others would think of it, of how I would think of it (internalized transphobia? yay), the fear of not passing, the response of my family, etc...  
And yet I'm so jealous of the women I see on the streets, I keep spending my time looking at subreddits to motivate(?) myself (transtimelines, transpassing, asktransgender...)   
So well, don't really know if I'm trans or if I'm just making things up, especially since I never had sex, I sometimes think that it is just a way of externalizing that problem (which I don't really see as one for me as I don't care that much but maybe some part of me does? whatever), maybe to try to find an excuse to my will to be a woman?
Well that's a mess, I feel like I could add more, but I don't want to make it too long/annoying as this question is like asked everyday, but meh."
VeNzorrR,asktransgender,"Is it normal to ""run away"" rather than come out?","Hi all,

Let me set the scene for you, I'm 25 and identify as female. I'm in a successful, happy relationship with someone who accepts my feminine tendencies in the bedroom, but isn't too comfortable outside. I work in a male driven environment (software development) and love my job.

My main worries about coming out to close ones are about abandonment. I love my partner, I'm close with my family and like my work colleagues, but I'm terrified if I admit my true feelings to them I will be ostracised.

This probably stems from my parents divorce as a child, coupled with my fiancée leaving me because she ""fell in love with me as a guy"". I've moved on emotionally but to be honest I feel like the least pain for everyone involved would be if I were to disappear.

Is this normal?"

MaybeTransThrowaway7,asktransgender,Am I Trans or Just mentally dissociating from a chronic groin condition in a weird way?,"Yeah, sorry about being another one of these, but it does have a bit of a unique twist to it. For quite a while now I’ve been dealing with this odd, chronic irritation in the groin area that just isn’t going away no matter how many creams, pills, or powders are thrown at it. There came a point in mid-October where I just started to question if I was going crazy. I also found myself panicking about whether it was some weird psychosomatic thing or  that it might be some odd Ripley’s Believe It or Not volume worthy physical manifestation of gender dysphoria that I was unaware of because of all the fun emotion processing issues that come with NVLD and Asperger's Syndrome. I initially dismissed it because it work like that, but I got really paranoid about it, to the point that, despite being absolutely clueless about what the hell was going on inside my head, had gotten drunk with the intention of coming out on three separate occasions.
 Now though the irritation is chronic, there is a certain method of temporary relief. During, well, that, I’ve lately found myself , for lack of a better term, window-shopping the attributes of the women I’d see in porn and eromanga. Essentially, I find myself desiring things like their hair, their figures, their breasts, and their genitals for myself. I have never experienced this before until now. It just suddenly was a thing that happened. So I looked up various fetishes to see if it was a thing, but I got repulsed by a lot of stuff I encountered. I discovered a thing called autogynephilia, but then learned that that was bullshit. I'm just really concerned whether or not anxiety over my condition is leading me to use gender identity as an escape route on a subconscious level or if it’s actually legitimate.
 
I initially contested those doubts regarding gender-y stuff with the fact that I was never really particularly feminine (not that I was ever really all that masculine either) and I never was interested in crossdressing or anything, and it never occurred to me that transwomen could be tomboys (although that was mostly due to me lurking on /r/TumblrInAction for so long I just ended up associating that with being on the same level as those 15 year old girls on Tumblr who think they're some unique identity because they occasionally wear pants) but I did some googling and it turns out those aren't exactly uncommon among transwomen, and that revelation kind of left me in a state of shock and I was  left practically glued to my bed for a week muttering to myself. And all of a sudden, I've started to have aversions to things I was largely indifferent to literally the week before. But that can't be dysphoria, right? That's way too damn fast, right?
The whole deflection from my groin condition theory is also starting to lose a bit of weight because I was finally referred to a urologist, which I’m seeing on Friday, and they wanted to do an ultrasound on my testicles, so I had that done a week ago, and results came back negative, so It’s probably just dysaesthesia, neuralgia, or CPPS or something. But then again, the actual appointment isn't until Friday, so the mental deflection thing could still be a possibility.

So, am I trans or just being driven insane by my groin irritation? And has anyone here had a physical issue that led them to contemplate this sort of thing? This is just a really distressing chicken or egg scenario to be in.

4riadn3,asktransgender,Does anyone else feel like a diffent person after transitioning?should I detransition or smthn 2 get more in touch with myself?,"Hey! I guess I might start off by explaining things a little. I transitioned two years ago (im 18) and don't regret it although I am not sure if I can really call myself a girl.. I am now stealth in college and nobody knows except for mostly just a few friends and guys that I've been with.

I have had a lot of emotional issues in the past and they still affect me today, but whenever I think of anything or recall any memories before I transitioned, it's like I'm seeing things through someone else's eyes. It doesn't feel quite real and I feel detached from it.. But it's changed me a lot as a person and I feel almost like I'm living in the shadow of it. I dont like feeling so disconnected. 

And on top of that, I don't know what I even am any more. I used to be entirely sure I was a binary trans woman but I don't know if that label fits me, I just feel personally like I'm not sure, or maybe even just a guy. And I feel a lot less dysphoric after hormones, and I'm definitely very feminine presentation-wise, but I don't plan on getting SRS, ever. 

But the problem is, I'm terrified of expressing anything other than being a feminine girl. I was pretty ostracized before I went stealth and I don't want to be a freak again and I don't know whether I would even feel safe ""experimenting"" or anything

allofmyinternetz,asktransgender,I'm having my worst days since I started this. I might just need to vent.,"So I moved to the city (Sydney) a couple of weeks back. Had my first GP appointment pursuing transition a few days later, my GP is great.

The first thing I wanted to do was get into contact with a therapist/counsellor/psychiatrist. I was a little disappointed when GP referred me to the Gender Centre (I could have done that) but I rang them trying to get a counselling session. That was on Thursday, a public holiday, so no answer. I rang again yesterday, Friday, early-ish in the morning. The person in charge of counselling appointments wasn't at the phone so I left my number. When I asked if/when I'd get a call back I was told maybe the same day. 

I spent all day doing nothing, waiting by the phone, watching YouTube videos for fourteen hours. (Side note: The Great War, fantastic channel) Feeling real dysphoria for the first time (that shit suuuuuucks) and getting really drunk to turn the volume down.

I wasn't certain of my Gender Identity before. But I've gotten certainty lately. The sooner I can take more significant steps than talking to doctors the better. Now the weekend's stretching out in front of me and my mood is just spiralling.

Is there anyone in this sub from Sydney? Have you had dealings with the gender centre before? Are they incompetent? Overstretched? Am I being unfair expecting to be called back in one day? Am I being a whiny impatient entitled cunt? Should I go back to my GP looking for a different counsellor/therapist/psychiatrist? Now a really long shot: Does anyone here have any experience/knowledge with any counselors/therapists/psychiatrists out West (Parramatta area) who know their way around these kinds of issues? Because that's where I'm living and going all the way in to the Inner West sounds about as fun as the last two days have been."

In a typical day, I can go from not even thinking about being trans, wanting to be AFAB, suicidal, angry and thinking I am just a confused cis feminine guy. I can literally go from suicidal to completely fine in a few minutes.




Most of the time I feel more like a feminine guy when out in public, but I feel female when I'm alone. It's stopping me from doing anything about it, because what I want changes constantly.



Since I discovered I might be trans a few months ago, there has not been a single day where I have not even thought about my gender at all. It's always in the back in my mind. I'm either thinking about how much I want to be female, or thinking about how I don't feel female.

DeeDeeDa,asktransgender,Any of you are or were into Red Pill stuff? What do you think of RP?,"The more I read /r/TheRedPill, the more I understand stuff I knew intimately. They put my thoughts in words. For us ftms, transition increases privilege and reduces discrimination, but modern society is so much against men and masculinity that it is frightening!

Also, I would also be curious if mtfs were or are still into RP and MRA. I have heard at least Blaire is into MRA."
A_Whole_New_Me,asktransgender,Did your friends ever say weird things (before they knew)?,"I'll try to keep it brief but it's difficult for me to do so.

I have a couple friends, A and K. Both friends for 10+ years. 
I never (to my knowledge) gave any indication of my feelings on anything like is discussed on this board. As far as they know I was AMAB and no reason to see otherwise. 

Often A will say things like: ""Don't be such a girl."" ""You sound like a girl (needy/whining)."" ""You can't be a girl forever.""
Most of the time in response to me talking about something that is apparently interpreted as whining. A is also my SO but we are long distance and only get to see each other 1-2 times a year (longer story). 

My relationship with K is much like a father/mentor and we have been friends for more of my life than not. In that time I would always (always!) have short hair, like &lt;1.5 inches and at that point it was super long for me. This year (very shortly before some other realizations) I decided to grow my hair and initially said it would be for 12 months when I told K. 
Multiple times K has said things like ""You're going to look like a girl"" ""Do you know how long it's going to be?"" ""What happens if you win the bet?"" 
I've reiterated multiple times it's not for a bet but am not believe because of how vehemently I hated long hair in all the years we've known each other.

Over the years K has (unprompted) said a few strange things to me though like ""You better not come over in a skirt"". We were in the middle of cooking dinner and hadn't been talking about clothing or anything. It was just so out of the blue that it's the only one that sticks with me even after a couple years.


I see or speak to both of them regularly and have yet to tell them the changes that are going to be becoming apparent (especially after winter). 


I was just curious if anybody else had strange encounters with friends and how you dealt with them? 

For instance I just laugh it off. I do think to myself though, what happens if I just blurt out that ""Yes, I want to look like a girl that is the point!"" I am way to passive (afraid of conflict for that, at least for now).

BluOP,asktransgender,"I have a trans MtF girlfriend, looking for advice~",She is pre-everything because she can't really afford too much at the moment (but that will change because she's starting a job in 2 days) and I just wanted to get some advice to help things go smoothly!
toodledootdoot,asktransgender,I'm hitting walls left and right. How do I start hrt when it seems like no one is cooperating?,"So at the beginning of last semester I sent an email to my school's lgbt center, and they never responded.  Later I was able to speak to the head of the lgbt center, and sent another email, this time she responded, but as soon as I said I was trans and looking for resources she stopped responding again.

Then I spent a few weeks just lost and wondering what to do when I made an appointment with my school's therapists.  I had a fantastic hour long talk where the person I was talking to was completely amazing, and she said she would hook me up with local resources to potentially start transitioning,  but after the appointment I was never contacted like I told I would be to schedule a follow up appointment.

I was told to check out my local lgbt center, but even they haven't responded.  I'm at the point where I'm ready to walk into my local pharmacy, slam my fists on the counter and yell ""give me some god damned estrogen,"" but obviously that's a bad idea.  What do I do? What channels haven't I explored yet?"
m3dicore,asktransgender,My new draft of a letter coming out to my parents,"Earlier I had posted a draft of a letter I was writing to my parents to tell them about my transgender issues. I would like to thank the user u/ImHerCupofTea for their help in editing this. I was wondoring if anybody had other suggestions:

Mom and Dad, 
The reason I’m writing is to tell you something very important that is not to put into words. I want to give you private time to digest this before we have a face-to-face conversation, preferably one at a time. It is something that has caused me a lot of anxiety and stress and kept me from being myself. I want you to read this whole letter because each detail is important in my transfer of this message. I will not withhold this from you any longer, I believe that I may be transgender.
 I say ‘believe’ because it is one of the most difficult questions I’ve ever had to ask myself. It is a question I still do not truly have an answer to. 
Earlier, in 2016, you offered me the opportunity to see a therapist to negotiate some issues I have been having with family, I would like to now take you up on that offer. So that I can search for answers. I am afraid that introspection and research cannot get me any further.
I want you to read this as many times as you need to and think about me and the way I am. I don’t want to make a huge deal out of this and turn it into some huge major issue. I want us to get through this as easily and painlessly as possible. I know this situation is uncomfortable. Believe me, this is hard for me too. I have had feelings like this for a long time and the past month or so I have been doing my research and trying to figure out what these feelings mean. I have searched the internet, talked with people online and looked at how I’ve felt and acted in the past as well as doing some recent introspection.
I don’t have all the answers and I would like to talk to a therapist before doing anything else, weigh my options and then decide. Please, do not worry for me. I want you to be okay with this, whatever therapy uncovers. What I do ask for is your support."
Jesaisbien,asktransgender,Had a revelation tonight,"I've been dealing with pretty strong depression lately for the past year and today was no different. I had been feeling okay for the past couple days but unfortunately my hair seemed to trigger me today. I'm home with my parents for a couple weeks and I very quickly spiraled into just a horrible version of me. In the end my parents ended up intervening and telling me how horrible this is for them (unfortunately not unknown to me). After this I proceeded to meet up with my hometown friends and of course do what millennials do, smoke weed! Well at some point I am finally able to calm down my mind and just relax. It can be crazy how kinetic it can get in there, my main problem being I overthink the crap out of things. My mind never stops racing, and it is just amplified when there are no distractions. Well, all of a sudden I just had a revelation, I understood things weren't okay but I guess it seems like it is not too late. I guess for the first time in a long time I am starting to see things positively. I understood my two options, I could continue every day feeling like crap with no hope just killing time until I finally killed myself, an act I have thought about every day for months, or I could just calm down, and not worry so much about every single aspect my life and just let things happen. I could be someone I did not think possible. I could have a relationship with my parents, express myself how I feel and not live as a slave to the persona that I have been for too long. 

Now I'm just worried about one darn thing. Am I going to wake up tomorrow feeling this way? Or am I completely going to brush this off and think it was stupid? I feel like the quality of my life greatly depends on this. I think I'm going to let go of my ego and apologize to my parents."

Biteytheswitch,asktransgender,Any AMAB parents? Hormone and conception questions...,"My wife (29F trans lady) and I (28F cis lady) are about to start trying for a baby-- yay! She's been on HRT for a little over a year and we're planning on stopping her spiro and my birth control until we conceive and the fetus is around 10-ish weeks. For those of you who have had kids after/in the middle of HRT, I have *so many* questions:  

* Around how long did it take for your gametes to come back after stopping anti-androgens? 
* What kind of emotional and physical support did you need or would you have liked to have had from your partner throughout your hormonal changes? 
* How hard is it to find trans- and lesbian-friendly OBGYNs and birth classes (we plan on being very firm that while I'm the gestational mother, we're both mom)? 
* Some friends of ours are in the same boat a few months ahead of us and are having a lot of ups and downs. From what I've read, it's hard enough for cishet couples to get through yet another period when trying to conceive, so how did you and your partner stay positive throughout the process? 
* Did you induce lactation so you could both breastfeed? If you did, what was your pumping schedule like to keep both of your supplies up? 
* What are ways, aside from the obvious things marketed as ""for dads"" (I hate that so much), to keep her involved, validated, and appreciated throughout trying to conceive, pregnancy, and childbirth?

Thank you for your help! &lt;3"
ClearLensCap,asktransgender,How do I convince my moms that I need HRT?,"My moms, ironically, are lesbians yet have barely tried with accepting my being trans. They call me he and use my birth name still. I'm pretty certain that my gender is like an inside joke to them.
My mom says that I'm too young and my step mom says that she doesn't believe in medicine when you don't need it to live. I've been practically fighting with them for months and I came out to them a year ago.
I tried explaining that it is medically necessary and that I want to kill myself but that somehow doesn't seem to be working.
Help???"
DecadesofSun,asktransgender,I think my friend is genderfluid because of me. How do I handle this?,"So I'm going to be as cautious about this as I can and I hope not to offend anyone here, and I offer my apologies in advance if I piss anyone off as it is not my intent. I'm going to detail a bit about a particular problem between a friend of mine and myself that's been developing for several years and is about to turn into something dangerous if I don't step in and do something.

Bit of backstory: My friend and I are both biological males, age 22. I'm a few months older than he is and we've known each other since 6th grade. Back then he was my best friend, mostly because I was a social misfit and he was even more so. He was the type who no one wanted to be around (came from a dysfunctional family, didn't do well in school, no social skills) and I wasn't much better, having come from a turbulent background myself but I could at least keep friends and had social recognition. Over the years I noticed a habit in my friend where he saw that I was better at certain things than he was, and so he tried to emulate me in order to rectify how people saw him.

When I was 15, I began realizing I was bisexual. A short time later, he thought the same of himself. When I was 18, I moved across the country to be with someone I was in love with. Only days after I arrived, he started talking to my then-bf and wanted to be part of our relationship somehow, even though he was hundreds of miles away and hardly knew him. That subsided when I made it clear that the guy was mine, and he soon started seeing other people instead for what was supposedly sexual encounters... I say supposedly because he never introduced anyone that he was seeing, constantly has been moaning both then and now about how no one cares for him and how he just ""wants to cuddle"", and has very little sexual prowess. I know because he's hit on me before as well, saying he fell for me, and none of what he ever tried worked. To be honest I wouldn't be surprised if he's still a virgin and just doesn't want to seem uncool, but I'm not about to ask that for obvious reasons.

All of this was fine until a few months ago. I've been experiencing gender dysphoria for the better part of two years now and, in early 2015 I was forced into a situation where I had to look back on a lot of my life and realized I may or may not be trans. I tried rationalizing it away to myself, saying it was either this or that instead, but no matter what I've thought or done it won't go away. For awhile, I didn't tell anyone. My friend and I were both raised in rather conservative environments, both having attended the same Christian school way back when, and I still have a lot of internalized transphobia I'm trying to work through. Finally I came out to my parents in Christmas '15, and it was the most relaxed I'd felt in years like a huge burden had been lifted.

Then disaster struck. In the summer of '16, my stepfather was killed. In a drunken stupor of emotion, I came out publicly over Facebook to what was largely an either neutral or understanding response, which was the best I could really ask for. Fast forward a few months until the heat from that settles down, and my friend tells me he's also been struggling with identity issues and thinks he might be genderfluid. At first I figured it was just him imitating me again... then recently he opened a new Facebook account with a feminine name he's chosen for himself, and a few days ago he apparently had a shipment arrive featuring fake breasts with a video of himself unboxing them and putting them on. He also says that he's moving to a different town with some friends soon and plans to abandon his parents and family because of how conservative and dysfunctional they are (I lived in their house for awhile, and I don't personally blame him at all for that because they're all a little crazy).

Where am I going with all this? I don't think my friend is actually genderfluid. I think he's seen the social progress I've made since coming out and he wants a piece of the pie himself. He's never exerted even the slightest bit of gender-nonconformity even in the times where we were close enough to each other to see one another's intimate secrets, and I speculate he's jumping on the LGBT bandwagon and has been for years not because he's actually in the community, but because he wants to feel accepted for being a misfit and find love he doesn't find in his family. In my case, the environment for me dealing with my issues is safe. My family accepts me, they're willing to work with me and I'm looking at seeing a therapist later on in the year to help sort myself out. In his case, it's much more dangerous. His family adopted him and he's had frequent trouble not only with them, but with the law. He doesn't seem to want to see a therapist to find out if he's actually fluid, and has a history of drug and alcohol experimentation. I think he's mentally unstable and so do his parents, but I'm not the one to tell him that because he comes to me for advice (which he rarely listens to anyway) and thinks that doctors prescribe him meds because they don't understand how his brain functions, whereas he does. Even if he made it through the gatekeeping of doctors and therapists and decided to transition in *any* fashion, his family would ostracize him, he'd lose what few job opportunities he actually has (no college degree), and would likely end up living on the street. What's more, when he told his mom he was bisexual, he did it at a time not long after I had done the same and so his mom thinks he is what he is because I turned him that way. If he does anything physical to his body, I would be responsible for having influenced him.

I don't mean to sound mean to him, I really don't. But I honestly think he's mistaken his gender identity for his mental condition and if I can't get him to see straight enough to *at least* see a professional and have them give him an honest evaluation, he's on the road to disaster. How do I handle a situation like this when I'm one of the few people he actually respects and listens to somewhat, even when I might have had a hand in his situation? Realize also I'm not saying he isn't bi or fluid, but I do worry about why he believes so. The goal of this post is not in invalidate him in any way.

**TL;DR- Friend has been imitating me to get social brownie points ever since I met him. Thinks he is bi because of me, wanted the same person I wanted, now thinks he's genderfluid because I might be trans. He's going off the deep end and has a history of mental issues. If he transitions or presents as anything other than male, he's likely to end up homeless. I need to help him because I'm one of the few he listens to.**"

SATANIC_TURTLE,asktransgender,Children transitioning?,"How do you feel about young children transitioning (like lets say, under the age of 10)? 

Here is my stance. I'm absolutely fine with children identifying other than with their birth sex and dressing in such a way, and calling themselves different names and pronouns etc etc. Where I will draw the line is hormone therapy. Simply because children at that age don't seem to have an understanding of permanence and the fact that undergoing hormone therapy is not a decision to be taken lightly at all and you need to weigh up the pros and cons of it.

What are the pros/cons and ramifications of not getting it done?

The obvious one would be hairs in the you know what, and I'm sure that would be uncomfortable no? Will the hairs be deep in there or just at the front? Because I imagine it would be irritating and uncomfortable—especially with sex (anything going in or out of there has the opportunity to tug on the hair)—and/or painful.

I'm morbidly afraid of electrolysis. It hurts me so much even on the lowest setting. I have really really sensitive skin and every electrolygist doesn't understand why it hurts me so much. The pain is unbearable on my face... and I can barely do laser on my face... so I'm dreading/thinking genital electrolysis is a no-go unless I'm put under for 10hours having 3 techs working at once lol."

CaptainRyn,asktransgender,In light of incoming bathroom bills...,"So, it looks like alot of us here in the american south may end up getting bathroom bills. My state TN it's real touch and go, and I spend alot of time in MS where it is on hold holding legal stuff. I have a TN birth certificate so even after I get surgery, I can never change it short of there being a successful legal battle.

So I had a bright idea for folks that already have passports with updated records and those getting their stuff processed now. Bring that with you, since the Real ID act requires that a passport can be used for any encounter that a birth certificate would use, and is superior to a BC. And that's federal law, so I don't think any weirdo in a state house is willing to want to tangle with the feds for this.

Thoughts folks? If these jerks want to use legalized harrasment, we can use the law to protect ourselves in turn. I don't like having to carry my papers with me at every turn and I think I pass everyday so I doubt I will be harrased anyway, but better safe than sorry.

Quiet_Zenith,asktransgender,"Thoughts, and an apology, from a cis-male.","I've used ""gay"" as an insult. I've used the words ""transgender"" and ""transsexual"" with malice and cruelty. Before I was old enough to understand the weight behind those words, I abused them with all the angst and ignorance allowed to a child, and I regret it immensely.

Older now, and mildly more mature, I can begin to fathom the repercussions of my belligerence. This post isn't about atonement, but maybe understanding.

By far the most poignant revelation I had as a kid was being told my best friend's father was gay. I realized I had unknowingly derided a man I respected to his son, whom I loved like a brother. I've never felt shame as sharply as in the moment my best friend trusted me with his confidence, knowing the things I've said.

It annihilated the palette of black and white which I colored my perspective of sexuality. Furthermore, I realized that an identity wasn't beholden to a popularized stereotype. My best friend's father was a masterful pianist, and a man of devout spirituality. I began to understand that people have depth, and consist of complexity and often contradiction.

I've never made the mistake of vilifying people for the sake of complacent categorization again, but I have made other mistakes since.

With all the bravery of an experimental teenager, I turned introspective and explored my own sexuality. Untethered access to the internet and pornography can induce more confrontations with your subconscious than I was often comfortable with.

With Google and the Kinsey Scale as a guide I discovered that I wasn't gay, but neither was I straight. I couldn't define it, and so I bordered between the two. With the bent-metal effort that comes of twisting your own psyche, I reasoned that the transgender identity was the halfway point. I fetishized transgenderism, slowly accepting my own sexuality while simultaneously denying your identity as more than my personal perversion.

For this, as well, I am sorry.

I mention this with the purpose of illustrating that there are steps to understanding, and they can be ugly. Even now, I'm attempting to alter my programming so as to broaden my perspective. Acceptance is wholly different from understanding, but I think one late night spent browsing this subreddit has brought me a step closer.

My point, I suppose, is this: I have come  this far only with great effort, directed introspectively, and the patience of others who could have more easily seen me with enmity.

It is my belief that my circumstances are not unique, and that there are more people attempting to welcome the trans community into mainstream society. From a personal standpoint, traversing the pitfalls of my own sexuality was and continues to be difficult. Comparatively, I cannot imagine the strength of will it must take to endure your journey.

If nothing else, I feel that I can be proof of positive change, and I want this post to be a small beacon of hope to the few who read it.

I wish you boundless love, both from those around you, and from yourself.

Edit: As others here have pointed out, sexuality and gender identification are two separate entities, and it was my mistake being unclear on that point. What I attempted to do, was to draw a connection between my personal experience in understanding my sexuality, and how that confusion obfuscated my perspective of the trans community in a way that was unworthy.

I realize that transexuality and transgenderism aren't related to sexual preference, sexuality in general, and certainly not fetishism. I'm still not wholly clear on all the proper terminology, and my attempt at being inoffensive may have led to misunderstanding. I'm still trying to educate myself, but it's a work in progress.

Thank you for your patience while I stumble in ignorance."

lyaa55,asktransgender,Why am I so anxious about this?,"I've been posting a lot, a little selfishly, i'm sorry...

I've been on hormones a few months and the AMBIVALENCE is out of control.

Fuck like I read the posts on here about people's first months on hormones, and I relate 100% to the most glowing, happiest ones.  I totally DID start to feel alive all the time.  I totally did start liking my reflection in the mirror for the first time.  I totally did feel like my life was on pause but could now earnestly begin.  I went from being too depressed for minor chores to energetically putting myself to any necessary task.  I drastically improved my life.  I feel like I've gotten more pleasant, more popular, more sexually desirable, and better looking, and it's only been a couple months.

Yet I also ~not irregularly~ get fairly intense anxiety.  I worry I'm making a huge mistake, that I'm ruining my life, that I'm a ridiculous fool, that I don't want breasts, I don't want long hair, I don't want to wear feminine clothing, I don't want to change my name etc etc etc.

Of course I do also frequently enjoy my growing little breasts, and have been going almost entirely by a new name...

Alitagraham,asktransgender,I need to write cover letters. There is some relevant experience and evidence of commitment with a pre-transition volunteer job where the coordinator/supervisor is openly transphobic. How do I work with this?,"I found a few jobs that provide a specific benefit that I need. They do not specify that they need extensive experience or prefer more experienced candidates. I have some past volunteer work where I dedicated just over 3 years to that I think could give me a boost in the hiring process but the problem is that the coordinator/supervisor I had there is transphobic and I know this because I had some passive conversations where trans people came up in a very negative light. 

Being that I have very little experience, I know this could be the difference between getting an interview and not and I want to demonstrate my ability to dedicate myself to a job in my cover letter but this is the best example and only example because I got pushed away from the professional connections aspect of a lot of other jobs for a small assortment of reasons, many around the way I was treated for being trans and/or mentally ill. 

My main question is can I include this in the cover letter (I left it off my resume)? I do not mind talking about it, I just do not want them to contact the people at that place. I don't think I can easily convey this information in the cover letter itself. What is my best option?

Some important things to note: 
 
* these are not corporations so I cannot easily find information about them from former employees or anything else. 
* I am sending in my resume/cover letter with my name, not the one I was given at birth. I figure I could explain that later if needed. And I cannot change my name/gender legally right now or I lose my health insurance. 

Thank you so much. "

I've been out for 2 years to my family and the idea of retracting that coming out and returning to girl-me feels deeply wrong.

When it comes to transition, i'm fearful of the aspects of myself that can never be changed with hormones. I know hormones would help me with most things and i know they would feel right, but that can't be the only option, right?

Chaojidage,asktransgender,I'm seeing a psychologist this Friday!,"After I came out in April 2016, my parents, especially my father, have been rather worried that I might transition and regret it. After seeing 2 psychologists who didn't really help me make progress in my transition, I'm seeing another one this Friday. On one hand, I'm afraid that the appointment will just waste my time, but on the other hand, I think that this is an excellent opportunity to get someone to convince my parents that the best option for me now is to start transitioning in all aspects. I wouldn't have this opportunity if I hadn't come out last April.

For all of you who are still in the closet or haven't transitioned, I highly recommend that you come out or personally seek professional help as soon as possible. You could try to postpone your transition so you don't have to deal with the challenge now, but in the end, you would much rather have transitioned early than late. "

throwaway-number-two,asktransgender,Questioning a little; looking to maybe move for a month?,"I am a prospective high-school graduate living around Seattle. If asked, I would confidently say I'm not trans, I don't experience dysphoria, I'm not jealous of others' bodies, I don't in any conventional sense wish I was a girl, etc.

That having been said, I want to ""try it out"" so to speak (that feels kind of offensive to say...) but I can't around here. The area is incredible LGBT-friendly, but I'm not at all comfortable with being flagrant whatsoever so close to home.

Basically, I'm looking for cities in the US where I could live for maybe a month in the summer between high school and college, and try shaving my legs, wearing dresses and makeup, etc. to see how I feel about the lifestyle. (Oi that feels offensive to say)

Factors I care about:

1. Relatively low cost of living (I'll take anything at or below the national median)

2. Ideally a small-ish population so I don't have to feel that weird about the number of people I see/see me, and I know this kind of goes hand in hand with number one, but cerainly not three.

3. Somewhere trans-friendly enough that it's reasonably unlikely that I'm assaulted for looking too, well, trans.

4. Proximity to the Seattle area. I'd rather not cross the Rockies, and certainly not the Mississippi, but if there's a city in Georgia or Maine that fits everything else beautifully, then I won't complain.

I don't really care that much about the weather, since I like it pretty warm and I'd be doing it in the summer anyway.

So far, all of the ""Top however many LGBT-friendly/trans-friendly cities"" lists have been populated with San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, Austin, all great cities, but with monumental costs of living. Thus far I've considered [Harlingen, TX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlingen,_Texas) and [Pocatello, ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocatello,_Idaho) but that's by no means an exhaustive or well-researched list.

Both cities seem to have a very low COL, and each definitely has its benefits and drawbacks. Harlingen is cheaper has a good majority of the population registered as democrat, which is probably a good sign for acceptance, but Pocatello is far closer.

If anyone has any suggestions, anywhere from a perfect city within an hour's drive or ""What the fuck are you doing, this is a terrible idea don't do it,"" then I'm all ears."

starfruiits,asktransgender,Am I questioning? (Long post),"I don't really know any other place where I can ask this, but recently I've been thinking about it over and over.

At a young age I never saw myself as a female, I never really dressed up like one. And when I did it was usually my mother or my grandmother picking the outfits out for me, or uniform-wise. I /hated/ skirts with a burning passion, and just makeup? I never really understood the deal with makeup. When I could, I would dress up like a male and act similar to them even imitate and I felt more comfortable and at ease with myself. I never fit in with girls, or how feminine they were.

Right now, I started asking my closer friends to use he/him pronouns. I've taken the name Aiden as an interest. I have more masculine clothes, and I still have been acting like that way I was since I was younger although I was more carefree. I don't necessarily hate my female body I just don't care about it but I would absolutely adore if I was a male. I've tried to make myself look more masculine before and like tried to use baggy shirts and clothing to hide my breasts which thankfully aren't that large. Although I had my moments where I cried about being a female, just thinking about it makes me cringe from being disgusted sometimes. I rarely talk about the topic gender because it would normally make me uncomfortable. I remember I used to avoid trans topics, and I never really got too into it because I felt like I wouldn't ""belong"" to that category and felt like I would've been hated by many. I was just so afraid for some reason.

So far, a few of my closer friends support me thankfully! Although my grandmother and mother is highly transphobic. My mother hates the idea of me being masculine and strictly wants me to be feminine. So does my grandmother and they both have said before ""you are a girl, act like it"" and it just made me feel like utter garbage. Like I would normally hate my self for it too. I can't cut my hair because they won't let me and my mom says that I'll look horrible in it. My grandmother says I'll look like a lesbian.

I'm trying to look for more medium-hair styles that look masculine and hopefully that will do. I'm also getting my first binder and I'm so excited for it! Hopefully I can get more masculine clothing, and I'll begin to feel more comfortable and happier with myself.

I'm just afraid of what other people will think of me. My anxiety doesn't really make things better. (I don't take any medication or therapy sadly). I also don't want to ""confirm"" that I could possibly be trans because I want to feel 100% certain that I am. I don't think I am agender, or genderfluid I highly doubt it actually. I just want to if anyone else can relate to this or give me some advice, it would really be nice!"
anaspd,asktransgender,my morning,"
I usually go to church with my mom every sunday, because it makes her happy, but she doesnt know that im an athiest and dont really like going because I feel they dont respect my gender identity or commuity being that I am a transgender female. I usually never participate and really just sit on my phone creating polyvore sets or whatever but she doesnt care, because she appreciates me even coming. Today I wasnt feeling all that great, because of this cold I have but I still went anyway because she wanted me to get prayer by some of the members since im leaving for college in california soon. 

I wasnt too excited about this because my mom isnt the most supportive of my transition, refuses to use she/her, and stills calls me my birth name, and because Im actually very passable and am unrecognizably male, this makes going anywhere with her extremely stressful, depressing and dangerous. Anyways after church my mom took me to a room where a bunch of people who at first had no clue I was born male until my mom introduced me prayed over me outloud and all I could here was he, him, man and I almost broke down and cried because my mom knows I have depression and how sensitive I am when it comes to being misgendered but she didnt care… she didnt defend my identity in the slightest not that I expect her to but it wouldve been nice and when I heard them saying things like “make him the man hes suppose to be” I didnt know what to do. 

After the prayer a few people looked at me differently and some even offered their condolences as if im possessed by something. I was extremely depressed afterwords and it showed. As we walked to the car my mom began yelling at me for having an attitude and embarrassing her in front of everyone. I literally just sat in silence as my mom let everyone basically disrespect and attack my identity. I tried to explain to her how I felt but she cuts me off and says she couldn’t care less about my feelings… am I wrong for getting upset… should I apologize? "

Tasorow,asktransgender,Confusion or: How I Started Worrying About My Gender,"Sorry about the length.

So this past week has been a bit of emotional mess for me. Some background: ever since graduating high school, I've been dealing with some difficulties adapting to college life. I've had depression for a long time, but it's especially hit me like a truck a couple of times these past few years. I thought I got it together last semester, despite a couple of bumps, and was really feeling good about myself for the first time in a while. Enter inevitable existential crisis. Basically, my friend who never has dreams actually had one, so I offered to interpret for him. It was pretty basic, so I felt like interpreting one of mine. 

The choice was easy for me, since I had a dream when I was about 10 that has always meant a lot to me. The short of it is, I end up washed up on an island and end up being helped by the literal girl of my dreams, only for the dream to eventually end with us looking at each other through a panicked crowd before a bright light ends the dream. For a while, dork that I am, I used to think that the girl might be a real person, and to be fair, I fell in love with a girl who looked like her. Unfortunately, that didn't work out, and my first period of depression began.

Anyway, I had actually reviewed this dream a few months prior to the interpretation of my friend's dream, and I had reach a conclusion that I kind of threw somewhere in the back of my mind. So the moment I started to interpret it again, I already kind of knew what I was going to find. You might have guessed already that I realized that maybe the girl from my dream was actually supposed to be me. Everything in the dream seemed to keep pointing to elements of femininity and emotional turbulence, which at the age I had the dream was strange, since life seemed pretty good for me then. Long-story short, trying to throw this thought back into the abyss hasn't exactly worked out. 

So yeah, I've been having an impressively suppressed freak out all week. Basically any moment I've had to myself (and then some) has been spent thinking about this. Even the music I HAPPENED to start listening to ended up making me think of the possibility of being a girl (Wolfmother, Sia, Death Parade's OP). I never considered this possibility this seriously before, though I admit I'm just remembering several instances of wishing I had been born a girl (bad memory). I've also done cross-dressing before, though not lately. I definitely liked it; the one time I tried a dress sticks out in particular as feeling more right than sexual. I could go on about my feminine mannerisms, desire to appear feminine, and other various ""signs"". Of note is that what got me to finally start getting healthy was the idea of cross-dressing again while appearing as feminine as possible (I cannot bring myself to do it without absolutely passing). 

The problem is my doubt. I'm super logical and philosophical, and I admit I can get obsessive about things. No matter how much I journal or think or talk to counselors, the only answer I ever seem to get is to follow my heart. But how do I do that when I don't know what my heart is telling me? I WANT to be a girl, I WANT for it to be the truth, but I just can't seem to accept it without proof. So I ended up kind of slipping and telling my mom, hoping she could help me work through this. She wasn't mad, just dismissive and more concerned that this would get in the way of school again. I'm going to probably talk to her again tomorrow, but I want to be more certain about this, or at least more prepared. I've thought so much about this that, combined with my mom's reaction, I'm feeling more numb than freaked out. Still pretty freaked out though. Am I transgender, and if so, why can I not accept it?

TLDR: *Screams Internally*"
Samanthakru,asktransgender,I need to get out I need to get out I need to get out,"Hi Everyone- 
I wanna preface this by saying that I have generally supportive family- compared to other parents of LGBT folk. I have their financial support and they use my respected name and pronouns. My mom is excluded from this rant, as she is amazing. It is my dad that is driving me fucking crazy.

I am going to make a general assumption here when I say that a good amount of people transitioning start out with NO confidence. I am that person. I have started collecting girls clothes and I start estrogen tuesday and I wear makeup everyday. I am becoming socialized more and more as female, which is a huge relief. I had my first semester of college at the beginning of the year, and now I am home for this quarter to focus on transitioning. I regret that decision because my father drives me fucking crazy. He has clear depression and baggage that he has never dealt with and so he does the same boring things everyday. I take selfies alot because I enjoy showing off my makeup and I enjoy documenting myself! My dad constantly puts me down and makes me feel bad for the things I enjoy (makeup, clothing, fashion, jewelry, girly things like that) even though he thinks that he is being supportive. I am in a place where I feel that I should be on my own and finding out who I am without the pressure of my dad here.

I know I am lucky to have supportive parents but my dad is supportive on paper, and nothing else. He is a jerk and I want to find an identity far away from him. "
sheeplesnight,asktransgender,transitioning vs family,"i'm afraid if i transition i might lose my immediate family.

to be completely fair, i can hardly consider them family. i've lived on my own since it was legal and have received very little support (emotional, financial, etc) from them since. i didn't come out to them as gay until i was away in college, but i don't think it was a surprise to them.

they've also never accepted it. i guess they LOVE me so they still talk to me--but they can't accept me. the last time i talked about my partner to my father and he diminished our relationship as if it wasn't serious, once even calling them my ""roommate''.

the thing is, i've been seriously considering transitioning recently. it has been a thing that i just told myself was too much work to commit to, but being seen as a female is becoming unbearable. 

i dont want to tell them. i don't want to have that conversation. because they're all a bunch of pricks. my father admitted he wouldn't come to my gay wedding. i don't necessarily *have* to tell them. they live several states away from me.

and then i think about my mom and how it would break her heart. she hasn't seen me in two years and the last time she saw me, would have been, unbeknownst her, the last time she saw me as a woman. it's painful to think about.

i want to do this for myself so much but i can't shake off the disapproval from my family. any... advice?"

Sexually I could never wrap my head around how my trans body would fit with someone else short of surgeries, at least this way I can see if I can work something out as a gay male. I've gone as far as I can with HRT and clothes and most likely will never be able to afford the surgeries I need. Nobody sees me as a woman and I'm starting to see it less and less. Has anyone else gone back in the closet? Even for a bit? How did it work out for you?

TrueHOAS,asktransgender,ALOT of Selfhatred and Depression,"I am 16 and not outing myself earlier was the worst thing I have ever done but I was too scared of my parents and they gave me good reasons to be scared. I know that this is early for some but read the rest.

Going through puberty just destroyed my entire body and I hate myself for it so bad, I can't even describe how much hate I feel for myself. Bones won't shrink and more problems won't go away fully too. I will probably have much more body hair than a cis girl and in much more places, my facial features are completetly fucked so is my lower body (male hips, legs/knees), my face looks overall just ugly. I destroyed my own goddamn life by being too scared of everything how I always am. 

I really hate my life as I can never experience anything that cis girls experience (actual female puberty, getting treated like a girl, not having to get super expensive shit like surgeries etc., get a few guys to like my appearance) or anything that is normal for every average human that isn't trans (being actually treated like a girl/human and not like a disgusting alien, getting your body to a point where you could like it, getting any friends or a relationsship). I know that this isn't how every trans is treated or what every trans is experiencing but I am.

I have seen timelines where almost every trans girl my age has much better conditions to transition than I have, they often look like girls without HRT as their facial features aren't as disgusting and masculine as mine. And they are often much more petite and smaller.

Every decision of mine was the worst it could be. For example, I tried getting permanent make-up and now I look even more ugly. My life was already bad when I was born but I manage to make it even worse with my decisions or being too scared. Or I just got a crush that is as useless as any crush for me since nobody actually would want to be with me as it seems like everyone is disgusted by me (trans), wants to have biological kids and I look like shit not like the other trans girls my age and I don't even want to talk about how much more feminine the cis girls my age always will be.

I don't know what to do as I can not know what HRT can do for me but it won't change something like my chin, jaw, nose and will actually give me a hairline that looks feminine and hides my massive forehead and of course my male hip bones and male knees/legs. "

I've gotten nothing but support from friends, family, and co-workers.

But every time somebody refers to me as ""her"" I kinda bristle. I just don't *feel like* a woman. I'm still firmly rooted in ""want to be/wish I was"" territory. This has been such a source of doubt lately - some days I wake up just feeling like I've lost all connection with my desire to do this. I'll just get this really intense ""What the fuck am I doing???"" feeling for a while. But I've never even almost stop taking the pills. I clearly WANT to be doing this. I just don't know if I'm ever going to ""feel like a woman"". I can't shake it, and I can't shake being concerned about it.

transttthrowawayy000,asktransgender,Help! I haven't felt this uncomfortable in a while,"...and over the smallest thing as well, it seems.

Happy new year folks! 

Lately I've been thinking about getting started on the name change process. Thankfully my current school has a preferred name policy so I've actually already been using my real name for a while now.

When I first picked the name though, I just thought it was pretty. So while looking at all the legal stuff earlier today, I decided to also look up the meaning of the name. The site I went to also has frequency of the name and turns out it's actually quite heavily single gender.... and it's not the one I am. In fact the name is apparently one of those English ones that literally means ""son of ...."" 

With all that's going on these days, I feel pretty stupid to be worried about this. I guess what bothers me is I don't know if I can have a name that means ""son"" for the rest of my life when I'm fighting so hard everyday for everyone to recognize and acknowledge me as their daughter. 

""So just change it already, OP"" right? I'm also worried about that since I've been using the name for a while especially at school and work. If I change my name ***again***, I worry I may end up losing important professional contacts. If there'd ever be a time to change my name though, it'd be now since I'm graduating soon. Or maybe not since I'm graduating soon. 

*sigh* All of this has sent me down the spiral of dysphoria which I thankfully haven't really been this deep in in a while. I dunno, maybe that's why it's uncomfortable--because I'm not used to being dysphoric anymore? I could probably get over this right? Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you!"

Neosovereign,asktransgender,I need help understanding a few things.,"So this is my second post on /r/asktransgender. I was treated pretty poorly last time, so it has been a while since my last question which was about the nature of gender dysphoria. Maybe this will go better, as I really want to understand people of all types more completely.

This question is more about the community and other aspects of it that I don't understand.

So, I am a pretty progressive person and have quite a bit of sympathy for people going through transition. I'm in the medical community, so it makes sense to me when someone says their brains and bodies don't readily match up. When someone says they have gender dysphoria and want to transition, I'll support them all the way through.

What I so far don't understand are two things. Non-binary people in general and people who claim to be transgender, but deny having gender dysphoria. Both of these are somewhat separate confusions, but I figured the best place to ask would be here.

For non-binary people, what does it mean to you? Why do you need to carve out a niche that so few occupy? If you are ""genderfluid"" what does that actually mean to you and what makes you feel that way? How about other non-binary types? Why do you feel the need to identify as something other than male/female?

For my second question, I'm mostly interested in how the community feels about these people. If anyone claims to be transgender without experiencing gender dysphoria what does that mean to you?

Anyways, thanks for answering.

EDIT: If I used any terminology incorrectly, please feel free to correct it."
voicethrowaway1337,asktransgender,Any recommendations on which surgeon to pick for a tracheal shave?,"Let's ignore insurance coverage for now and cost. I'm not looking for FFS or bottom surgery with the tracheal shave. If it helps, I live in the United States but am willing to travel internationally. I'm not really sure which incision location would be best for me either.

I see a lot of options for a tracheal shave, but I have no idea who to consider scheduling with. The options I'm aware of are Bowers, The Facial Team, Toby Mayer, Spiegel, Cardenas, Chettawut, Papillon Center (McGinn), Yeson (definitely not looking for voice surgery either), Suporn, and I don't think I know any other options for now."

SophieCalle,asktransgender,Laser and Bikini Norms for Women??,"Hello everyone!  So, I'm pretty much going all out with laser and am already in the process of doing at least most of my whole body (luckily my arms and feet are bare, as well, as most of my back and a few other spots).

But, there's something I can't figure out.  What are the norms these days for the bikini area?

I'm not a person to even want to talk about this, but I never dated much before this and know times change, but I can't tell if it's more the norm for me to laser literally everything or keep a little down there.  

Obviously, it's a personal thing, and of course, there's no need to say what you did, but I'm trying to get an idea of what's expected, since I just can't tell.  Google is being no help, either.

kaylarue,asktransgender,Lower back pain from posture change?,"I honestly have no idea if I'm standing like this subconsciously or it's a result of the hormones, the comfortable/relaxed position for my pelvis tilts *much* further forward than it used too. 

Now, I've always had a bit of curve for my back. If I laid flat down there'd be a visible gap between the mid-lower part and the floor well before I started hormones, but it's never caused discomfort. Trying to stand in a way to alleviate the pain is even more uncomfortable and looks like I'm jutting my crotch out.

colesss,asktransgender,I had a moment of clarity regarding equality issues.,"I never understood how people could not support equality for all. It always seemed like such an easy thing to give people. I also never understood how people could stand on the sidelines for equality issues. I mean, it seems so easy to support equality issues right?


Well a recent event kind of blew my mind into how easy it really is to want to stay on the sidelines and not take a stance. How easy is it to say equality for all when you never have to sacrifice your own rights to do so. Or how easy to say equality for all when you never had that right to begin with and have nothing to lose. But what about when you have to sacrifice a right that you currently have in order to stand with those who do not have the same right?


Event: A favorite all women spa that I have been going to for ages with some of my closest friends...


My partner recently informed me how hurtful it was for me to be able to go to an all women spa when she could not because she was not the exact right ""type"" of women. She wasn't telling me that she was hurt that she couldn't go with me...she was telling me that she was hurt that I would choose to go somewhere that didn't include all types of women.


Kind of like going to a segregated restaurant or being able to marry someone because the conditions are correct. Segregated establishments don't really exist anymore although I am sure I could probably find unofficial ones somewhere. But what if I set a condition on myself that I couldn't go or experience anything that others are denied. What if I chose NOT to marry until everybody could marry everywhere, even though I can currently marry anyone I choose. What if I chose NOT to go to an all women spa until every women can go to the spa, even though I currently can.


After these thoughts, I can now understand why it was/is so difficult for people to embrace opposing equality issues. In order to really stand up for rights, you have to be willing to deny the rights you currently have. I can now understand and empathize with those who don't want to give up their own rights to stand with those who don't have them. It's really hard to make that sacrifice.

I feel like I will never get to where I want to be, to be one of those transwomen who are finally happy, finally complete. Heck, I cannot even get my mothers lawyer to call me back to make sure I wont fuck up moms will, power of attorney and special needs before I send my name change papers in. On top if that, I cannot get my tax return trans scripts so I could get booted out of school. I am really upset tonight. More dysphoric than I have ever been. I just hate myself, my body and my life.

LoveIinus,asktransgender,"Feeling suicidal, helpless and extremely depressed.","Oh god, I thought after starting HRT this would've been over. No. It hasn't. After 4.5 months on HRT I'm back to feeling the same way, again. 

I hate the fact that I'm a transgender and that I have to live this way for the rest of my life. I want to be a girl so badly, but I don't think it would ever work out. My Sister hates me. She hates having a Sister, and she openly admitted that she has Sister jealousy issues. She told me that she doesn't want to deal with me. I tried to talk to her yesterday and her attitude towards me is still the same after almost 5 months. She puts the blame on me saying that because of my problem our family will never be the same. My parents still love me the same, they've came around although initially they hoped that I would change my mind and stay as a boy. But I can't talk to them about this, they would probably just say well that's the path you chose so you gotta be strong and deal with it. :(

I feel like HRT is not going to work for me. It's been almost 5 months. I feel like I'm never gonna pass. I've took a lot of photos along the way and every face analysis site tells me that I'm male and that I'm masculine. I don't know what's wrong with it though? I don't know what is it about my face that makes it so masculine. But it's definitely depressing. Even as of today, I'm still being analysed as 70-90% masculine on these sites. 

I feel Super anxious when somebody approaches me and have a conversation with me. It literally feels like I'm going to have a panic attack every time. I'm doing great in terms of voice. I used to sing and I'm a tenor. With all these knowledge about vocal technique and anatomy it wasn't too difficult. But I always feel like I'm being scrutinised whenever I talk, like my voice doesn't match my face. I hate my face so much. 

I feel so lonely and I've no friends. Honestly I'm on my own. I'm such a wuss I don't even have the guts to buy a bra when my boobs are already pretty obvious. I'm stuck wearing boy clothes every time because I'm sooo scared to buy female clothing. I feel my heart in my mouth whenever I'm using the female's toilet. 

I feel like my life's a joke. Why give me feminine hands, feet, waist, body and size when my face is probably gonna look like a boy. I don't want to go for FFS and SRS. Yes I'm the worst wuss ever, I get uncomfortable and get nausea whenever I watch such videos. I'm scared of the pain. I'm just scared of everything. 

I don't know what's the point of transitioning if I'm going to be clocked for the rest of my life living as a transgender girl. It's like I'm still living as a guy and I would rather die than to live as a guy again. I don't know what to do. I'll never go off HRT but I really want to look like a girl and go stealth :( 

In my country (Singapore), LGBTQs are not protected and they're often discriminated. It will be hard for me to find a job even. I hate my country. :( 

You can find my photos from my other postings. I feel like shit and I hope this will just be a phase. I don't want to look like a boy forever :( "
viridianlion,asktransgender,"Transgender treating doc here, wondering if anyone here is on topical estrogen/progesterone?","So I'm a family practice physician who treats hiv and also transgender patients with HRT. 

I'm looking into the possibility of using a combination estrogen/progesterone cream as adjunct therapy applied to the face/chest. 

Unfortunately, there is very little research available in regards to this. I cannot find a single study talking about the usage of a topical cream to help with facial skin changes or breast development. I'm considering actually doing one, and currently in talks with a compounding pharmacy who could make this for me. 

Is there anyone out there whose doctor prescribes something like this? If so, could you provide me their contact information? I'd love to talk to them to hear their experiences. 

I'd like to offer my patients the absolute best possible care, and that includes things that are cutting edge (as long as they are safe). I'd just like to hear the results of anyone else who has tried this as I can't find much scientific data on the subject. 

**Edit: I use a combination of the WPATH and USCF guidelines with some minor modifications such as sublingual administration of E/P. I have personally seen the benefits of P on transwomen who were ""maxed out"" after approx 10 years on E. I've seen the P have significant beneficial effects. Unfortunately, I no longer have a ""peer"" in my region who knows more about this than me, and I cannot find any actual scientific literature about this particular treatment. The theory is basically to have higher local tissue concentrations early in therapy to result in more rapid breast development changes without having to have dangerously high serum rates. In regards to the breast cancer risk, this is present no matter what we do in terms of estrogen, and I'm sure there has never been a study about the breast cancer risk of estrogens applied directly to the breast. I personally mammogram any transwoman over 30 who has been on estrogen more than a year, or anyone on for more than 5 years as the levels in transwomen can be higher than cisgendered women, are often un-opposed with progesterone, and just because I'm protective of my people. I however don't want to do something ""experimental"". I'd rather know that there are other doctors out there who have done this safely and effectively for years before I consider doing it.**"

This is when he said that text message isnt the greatest place to debate a topic like this but his and my parents view of gender is that your gender is determined by chromosomes and no amount of pills, surgery, or government documents is going to change that.

I didnt want to start a big argument over text message and start throwing link after link of studies at him so I just told him about intersex people and Kleinfelters and said that gender isnt as black and white as he paints it.

Question-the-Quo,asktransgender,"Do you personally wish to see a statistical increase in the number of trans-identifying people, or decrease? Or do you have no personal feelings either way? Why/why not?","Defenses down, I'm going to be very honest in that I frequent the gender-critical subreddit and GCdebatesQT (which more of you who are interested should totally subscribe or opt to be mods https://www.reddit.com/r/GCdebatesQT/). 

Moving on, I'm curious as to how transgender people might feel in regards to statistical increase or decrease in folks who identify as or otherwise come out as transgender. 

On one hand, many (though not all) transgender people recognize a part of being transgender as having gender-dysphoria, which is also acknowledged as extremely stressful and uncomfortable. So some form of an end to gender dysphoria (and thus the need to transition) would probably correlate with a decrease in trans-identifying people. This could be, then, considered a positive change.

On the other hand, I know that there are some transgender people who believe that one does not need to be gender dysphoric to be transgender, and therefore not all transgender people are gender dysphoric (I don't know about here, but there are a lot of trans people on Tumblr who have this belief). So a decrease in trans-identifying individuals might not be a positive thing for someone who holds this belief, but an increase in transgender people *could* be a positive thing.

What are your thoughts? Do you wish to see an increase or decrease in trans-identifying people? Are you on the fence, or don't care either way? Why/why not?

feelinqueer,asktransgender,Is there anything I should do to prepare my body for HRT? (MtF) And general transitioning first steps?,"Hello!

I am still a ways off from starting HRT as I will probably have to finish this upcoming semester before I begin, but I want to know if there's anything that I should do to prepare myself? Anything that you wish you had done before hand or anything that is suggested to do that I don't know about? Also there are a few specific questions below.

1. I am 6'2"" and weigh 165 lbs and at about 9-10% body fat (BF). In other words I am tall and lean with an athletic build/fair amount of muscle (very unfortunate for my dysphoria and comfort) I had been working hard for about 1.5 years or so to become a stereotype of an attractive man body because I thought that was what would make me happy but to say the least it turns out that I was actually working on almost the opposite of what I really wanted so there goes 1.5 years of hard work down the toilet... But anyway why I am telling you this is because I am concerned about my BF%, should I be at a certain % before I start HRT? 9-10% BF is very low for a woman, unhealthy levels, should I be gaining weight to prepare for HRT? Should I wait until I start HRT then start working on gaining BF? I have already stopped weight lifting to start decreasing my muscle mass which I know will become a faster process once I start HRT (at least that's what I understand and I really hope that it is the case). Any information about this would be great!

2. I am starting to grow out my hair but I have a literal mop of hair once it gets very long at all, like were talking 1990's Trent Reznor looking if anyone knows what I am talking about, are there any suggestions that any of you could give me that went from typical short male hairstyles to growing out your hair and having no idea what you're doing?

3. Any suggestions of how to start looking more androgynous? I don't think I could handle my social anxiety or stress levels if I tried getting to obvious while going through this semester but I also can't stand to look as masculine as I have been in the past plus I want to be able to make it a slow process for my family as they are very supportive but I don't want to alienate anyone by jumping from looking like a boy (it hurts to even say that) to full on I am going full girl mode (please yes). So any suggestions on subtle changes that I can slowly ramp up would be great! I plan on doing the big obvious steps once I start HRT.

4. This is just asking about anything I should generally be practicing? I am already practicing my voice daily (worst part by far I have the worst voice ever and is my biggest source of dysphoria D:) I am practicing make-up whenever I can which is super fun my favorite thing to do now. I am trying to practice different body language, different eye contact, different ways of speaking (even though my voice isn't there) working on eyebrows and other grooming that wasn't there much before like better skin care, etc. But I want to be able to be experienced/ready for as much as I can for when my transition can really start having dramatic impacts on my life and I can truly begin which will probably be around when I start HRT.

Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated! I am trying to come at my transitioning with joy and excitement instead of anxiety and stress and I feel like if I am working on things to help me in the future that it will help fight any dysphoria (which luckily I don't get insane amounts of mostly just euphoria when doing 'girl' things but I can already feel my dysphoria getting worse) and to help myself put it out of my every thought while going through this semester.

Thanks!!! &lt;3"
Bzttid,asktransgender,Is it transphobic to not like a preop transwoman?,"So, I'm trans. Unfortunately, Tumblr is one of my main things that I read in my spare time and I noticed there's this argument that comes from TERFs saying that transwomen are saying that not liking penises on a transwoman is transphobic. I have to ask, is this an actual opinion? Like.. it seems a bit rediculous because as a lesbian and a transwoman, I don't want to have sex with a penis, hence the lesbian title. 

What's the ACTUAL belief on this? Because I feel like this is just TERFs strawman-ing.

EDIT: To be clear I'm not talking about *refusing to be with* a preop transwoman, but I'm talking about the preop transwoman saying that it's transphobic that you won't fuck her dick.

EDIT2: Also, I'm with a lesbian cis woman and I'm a preop transwoman, so this isn't a personal experience/advice question. This is just an opinion that TERFs said transwomen agree on (but I think they were strawman-ing): that lesbians have to like a preop transwoman's penis or else it's transphobic."

throaway_trans,asktransgender,Would anyone like to share their experiences?,"One of the major reasons that I had not considered the possibility that I was trans before is that I have very little interest in 'girly' things. In fact if there is one thing that I can say I like about being male is the cultural benefits that come with it. I always appreciated the fact that I can choose to be social when I want and be aloof when I don't. In fact I always felt bad that girls had to deal with so much unwanted attention while I can be invisible when I want. Not to mention the fact that people automatically treat me with respect and take me seriously just for being male. Actually if there is one thing that I actually do envy of girls is that they can get pregnant and have babies and stuff. So what I am trying to say is that if there is one thing that I envy about cis girls is the experience of motherhood. Now obviously medical transitioning has not reached the point where I can have a baby maker installed and I am having a hard time reconciling the fact that I would be giving so many advantages that I enjoy for what I perceive to be disadvantages for the most part ( I mean I obviously would like to be called pretty and stuff but only when I am in the mood to be called pretty and stuff you know?). From a logical point of view it seems like a bad decision to transition were it not for the fact that regardless of these things I do feel like a girl on the inside and that I have started to realize the toll living as a male is taking on me. Yet there is a little voice inside of me which keeps saying that you can't get what you want anyhow and that by transitioning I would also lose out on whatever I have going for me right now and if I can just grin and bear it maybe I can reconcile the fact that I am transgender without transitioning.

So my question is, how did you folks deal with the loss of societal and cultural benefits that come pre-packaged with your assigned gender? How hard was it? Am I overthinking this?"

Now I'm slightly androgynous and more feminine, but I don't know how well that will go over with anyone. I present female but I feel it won't be accepted. Also, when I answered the call to schedule the interview it was early in the morning and I used my male voice which would really confuse them if I showed up in feel. Blarg I don't know where I'm going.


and side note, do cutting scars affect interviews? I don't want to not get hired from both being trans and cuts."
Malkria,asktransgender,"Hair and ""horns""","So not only do I have thin hairs, but I have large indents in my hairline that look like 'horns' of bare skin. Looking back I never noticed since I had short hair growing up, but with long hair they show through my bangs and make me look like I'm trying to hide hair loss. Which my female coworkers assure me it isn't, it's just sadly my natural hairline.

Any good styles or tips to deal with large indents? "
uskdyrmtvl3150,asktransgender,I'm torn between both sides [long],"I could present a convincing case for me being trans. I still hold the idea that everyone on at least some level would actually want to be a girl, even if not very seriously, and I don’t understand how my guy friends don’t feel envy of cute girls, in fact I think that they aren’t being totally honest with me when I ask them. There have always been some girls that are “annoyingly cute” to me and a year ago this started happening much more and now I really don’t understand how this isn’t a common thing. I never actually cared about any of this stuff until a year ago, and I had managed to convince myself that I was kind of androgynous and that I would be able to pass on hormones if I went that route, and that I would end up being cute and stuff, though I don’t think I believe that any longer so now this all bothers me a bit more. For a little less than a year now I’ve been shaving all my body hair, arms, legs, face, and torso, and when I see men with actual beards and stuff, I wonder how that doesn’t feel uncomfortable to them, and how they don’t just shave it off, and so I let my facial hair grow for three days, and saw that I actually had more follicles than I had once thought, so I took a picture of it as a reminder, but that and I guess the angle that I took the picture from made me totally look like a grown man in it, my face looked big and kind of long and bony and with angular features and even though I already knew in the back of my mind that I was more masculine than I thought, this made me feel kind of dead inside, and that night I couldn’t sleep thinking about this, and had to cry myself to sleep for half an hour. The next day I still felt kind of dead inside, just like this feeling in the background constantly, though after that it was gone. I still feel that way a few days later just a bit when I see myself in the mirror, especially after a shower when my hair can’t hide some of the more masculine features of my face, and I’m reminded that I have a somewhat masculine jawline, and a somewhat wide face, and a somewhat big skull and just generally somewhat big and masculine features, though now I recognize that I’ve sort of felt these things for a while even if it wasn’t very noticeable. I’m also 18 meaning I’m sort of far into puberty and have permanent changes to my face and body already, but I’m probably not completely done and still have more masculinization to undergo, though I’m unsure what this will be exactly. I don’t want my shoulders or ribcage or face to get any larger, or to get any more body hair.

But I can also present a case for me not being trans which is troubling. I don’t feel like a girl, I don’t feel like I relate to them any better than men, and I’ve made this all sound pretty bad but I’m not sure that it really is, because I feel that I’ve thought about it too much and in a way caused this all, as I never had any problems like this before a year ago, aside from only playing female characters in games given the choice, and still kind of wanting to be a girl though not actively, (a few years ago I would have said that I sort of wanted to be a girl, but I found that embarrassing and almost never thought about it), also a few isolated cases of me wishing I was a specific girl like 3 years ago. Furthermore I’m not sure how I feel about being an old woman, or some of the effects of HRT; I don’t feel anything bad towards my genitals, and I like how they work now, but this would change on HRT, sure, you can resist shrinkage by exercising that area, but eventually, after enough years, I would surely lose the ability to have erections, and would lose a lot of size, right? Then there’s the idea of having breasts, which I’m unsure about, as I think I would like having small ones but worry about them being too big, or feeling like they shouldn’t be there, like what FTMs feel. Not having erections might be weird in this way too. 

It’s a dilemma - if both sides felt equally “right”, and breasts/different genital function not bothering me was a given, then transitioning seems like the better option because there will always be another girl who I wish I was more like, another girl at school, or on the bus, or something, whose face/hips/shoulders and sometimes voice I wish I had, but it feels like I’m almost forcing myself to think this way, in a sense, but then again I don’t feel anything positive towards having masculine features, but do towards feminine ones, though this may just be a case of the grass is greener on the other side.

uncansancio,asktransgender,Do you ever worry that your socialization is an issue?,"Hi all, I'm looking for advice but also just curious. I know there's contention about socialization. My thing is that I'm undecided about it. It seems like a real thing, as how women are raised versus how men are raised appears to affect their family goals, career goals, self esteem etc. It seems pretty pervasive. I also imagine being in a certain group causes certain subconscious, uncontrollable behaviors to develop in certain ways.

While I'm partial to this, as it seems pretty reasonable and the source of a lot of oppression and sadness for cis women, it also makes me feel like a fraud, as I feel I'll never truly be able to have that experience as be authentic. I always wonder ""would a real woman have felt this way, reacted this way, etc.""

Neosquid,asktransgender,I wish I understood my mind,"If I put all the annoying, ridiculously irrational self doubt aside, I know that being transgender is a thing and I know that I am among said group of people. That part's for sure. But, after lurking here more today, I found some posts that motivated me to do more research on the subject. Well, okay, the post in question linked me to most of said research itself, but same point. It did make me feel better in a way, reading firsthand what I kept hearing about the biological factors that make us what we are. But it also made me feel worse in that nobody really understands how we work completely. The ways my body is different than a cis female's? That's one thing. But what ways are my mind different than a cis female's? In what ways am I actually different? That thought just seems to bother me so much more. Just typing that gives me significant dysphoria. I suppose part of the issue is that the lack of information makes me feel like it's a simpler biological issue than I'm sure it actually is, but still.

mjollnir82,asktransgender,"Being at the center of the attention for a lot of people, and discover to be transgeder. What to do? Your experiences?","I guess this is something that is very common, especially to late bloomers.
I kind of lived my life as a continuous learning. In the first phase, I learnt what a boy was (I am AMAB), and that nothing was able to make me happy, and always felt dysphoric. Then, in a second phase, I fought a battle against myself, aiming at being good at a lot of things. Eventually I entered also a PhD, but started to struggling with everything: no love for girls, no morivation for study, no life plans. I started to feel miserable. In the second phase, I was kind of cery well known person: a lot of friends everywhere, and I had many colleagues.
Third phase, discovered I was trying hard something without listening to my heart. Eventually found I want to be a girl, ever wanted, maybe. Now I am full of shame, with a PhD and people expecting I am taking a teaching career in CS, and... I don't want any of this.

Kyuumatose,asktransgender,Coming out. Should I see a Doctor first?,"Hi, Kyuumatose or Ciel here. I'm a pre-anything MtF transgender and I have been like this since I was incredibly young (let's say around the age of 3 when I were playing with dolls and dress up gear rather than toy soldiers, which mind you was always passed off as me experimenting). That aside, I'm 18 now and at college. The time has come and I would like to think about coming out as 15 years of confusion and hiding it all really scares me. My question is, if I am to come out to family and friends, is it wise to wait to see a GP first or does this change literally nothing? Thank you and sorry if I posted something I'm not meant to :P First ever Reddit post here. "
ErebusBat,asktransgender,What is the proper protocol?,"First some background:  I am a hetro cis 31M.  I live in a very red state but I am very very blue.   I think the taboo society has put on sexuality is bad and I actively work to help people feel comfortable in their sexuality (whatever that means to them).

I am not one of those guys who gets freaked out that someone is different than I am.  As an example:  For me finding out that someone is gay is like finding out that someone else prefers blondes.  Interesting and I might keep an eye out for blondes when I am with them, but that is about how far it goes.

Obviously transgendered is a bit different given the body/gender identity mismatch and I don't mean to diminish that at all, but I really have no negative feelings about it at all.

So my question is this:  I met someone in a professional setting who I am pretty sure is transgender.  Given our location (red state) I would like her to know that I support her and she can be herself around me. 

But I also don't want to be that asshole that points it out and says things like ""it is cool that you used to be a dude"" or whatever.  Or worse yet ""accuse"" her of being trans-gendered if she really isn't, or even worse point out that she still has some very physical male attributes when she is obviously trying to not have any.

I am not around this person at all normally (in fact it was a fluke that we met at all).  So approaching her at all might be a little odd.

What should I do?"

What I would love to do is just come out to everyone at work and just transition casually. This seems unorthodox really which is why Im asking has anyone else done this?

atc593,asktransgender,Has anyone ever had to deal with being in the closet in a family owned business?,"I'll discuss this with my therapist within the next few days, but since I'm stressed as hell over it I might as well vent some now.

I just became one of many family members to take a position in a company that my cousin's been managing for the past 30 years (same person I'm currently living with). Great, I'll finally have income to put towards all the transition related things I want and moving out.

Alas, I'm in the closet at home and *now* work is going to be incredibly awkward too. Besides the depression caused by being ""Sir'd"" while wearing a men's suit and putting ""male"" on all the paper work,  what's worrying me is my name and gender marker changes are progressing forward and I fear that it's going to be a double-whammy because out at work=automatically out to family now.

Part of me is trying to be the optimist and say this isn't going to stop/change anything and it's good that I'll kill two birds with one stone because I'm 27 god damn years old and sick of hiding everything to much distress (let alone while living somewhere as accepting as NYC). 

The cynical part of me is ready to give up and fall back into a deep depression while pretending to live in the male body I increasingly hate with each month that progresses on HRT.

 I get that their current gender makes them uncomfortable/they dont identify with it but i dont understand how they know another gender will make them happy. They have never been in the other genders body and as such unable to experience the other genders bodily experience.

___lukas,asktransgender,Coming out...? Self expression without having to be public?,"I'm a male, 16 right now living with my parents. I desperately want to transition, to stop the dysphoria. My main issue however, (not unlike many other people in this sub) is my parents. I'm terrified to come out to them because of their previous track record regarding politics, religion, etc.  I've already decided it would be safer to come out once I start college. This being said, it eats away at me every single day and I don't know how to cope with it. 
I know already what everyone will say, that it's better emotionally to come out as soon as possible, but I already tried coming out as gay to my parents. And after collapsing into a ball of tears in front of them, I just couldn't get it out. I guess I'm just not strong enough to come out at this point. 
For the record I should mention, most of my friends accept me as a gay male, but I've never come out to anyone (except for some people anonymously online) as trans. 
This is why I was wondering if anyone could give advice on how to express myself as female (or at least closer to my desired gender than I am right now), without having to tell my parents. 

TL;DR I'm a weak idiot who can't muster up the strength to come out to my parents as trans, and need advice on how to express myself, and deal with the dysphoria. 

PS I'm writing this right in front of my parents, secretly wishing they would come over and look at my laptop. Either that or they look up my YouTube history and see the myriad of makeup tutorials I watch, even without owning any makeup myself. "

lopolow,asktransgender,To hair remove or not to hair remove... Planning surgery with Chett,"So, i'm at that point where i have chosen Chett for GRS. I just need to work out a few final things with work, get a good date (aiming for August), have a minor *OMFG what am i doing!?* panic, and then put down the deposit.

Thing is, i have seen the occasional report of postoperative hair (although this is admittedly rare, i think) within the neo-vagina. and. The thought of this is admittedly, terrifying, mainly because besides incredibly awkward self plucking, i dont know of anyway one would be able to ever remove this hair. not to mention the possible health risks of a clump of dreaded hair festering an infection (probably just an extreme and unlikely fear in my head)...

So. where im stuck is.

- Do i just ""risk"" it? (maybe its not even a risk), and hope it never is an issue?

- Realise the thought of a hairy vagina is too great and just get bilateral bilateral orchiectomy (maybe the reduced mass down there reduces genital dysphoira at least somewhat)?

- Nuke everywhere down there with lasers and electrolysis which may be somewhat against the surgeons recommendations, but, yolo. Probably making it hard to schedule surgery, as hair removal takes a variable amount of time (and might not even be permanent as the hair probably regrows again at some point)

- Some other option?

I might be panicking a little here. Help and advice needed.

throwawaymightbtrans,asktransgender,"20 years old, questioning if I might be a transman, anyone got any insight/perspective on these experiences?","Hi reddit. This is long and I'm sorry - I'm looking for maybe some opinions and perspectives, if this stuff sounds familiar to anyone... I know I’ve gotta figure for myself whether or not I’m actually trans, but I’d really appreciate it if anyone can relate/give me some insight on anything.

I'm 20 and female, but I think I might be a boy. I've got a few trans friends, and I've been questioning my gender in general for around 8 months now (currently identifying as some degree of non binary), but only started really thinking about potentially being a binary boy for a few weeks.

When I'm out in public, I look at guys a lot, and picture myself in what they’re wearing, and I usually think about what I would be wearing if I was a guy (usually jeans and leather jackets and nice shoes lol). I don’t like my chest, because it’s honestly huge, but in terms of dysphoria it’s only my chest and my hips/general curves (not my bits) that give me unpleasant feelings, which makes me unsure about being genuinely trans.

When I was little I wanted to be Harry Potter really badly. I've never really known how to act or behave because I have Asperger's, so I used to copy book characters to create my personality. As a result, I kinda feel like mentally/emotionally I was very closely emulating Harry Potter for most of my primary school years. 

I always wanted short messy hair like Harry's but my mum wouldn't let me cut it short; my hair is now shoulder length, but she doesn't like girls having hair above shoulder length, and although I'm old enough to make that decision for myself, I know she would guilt me and make me feel ugly if I cut it any shorter. She once told me that I can dress as boyish as I want, as long as I don’t start saying I’m a boy, and that’s made me even more worried about the outcome of what I’m questioning at the moment.

Thinking about stuff like uni and work, I always prefer the idea of coworkers and patients seeing me as male, but I will be working in healthcare and I feel like just transitioning would be difficult in that environment. When I think about the future, maybe having a family, I picture myself as a dad kinda figure. I've tried thinking about myself as a dad-ish mother but it just feels wrong, and I can't pinpoint why this would be so different, if I would be behaving the same way. I'm not even sure if I want children, so the fact I'm getting fathering instincts just feels plain weird.

The main thing that's making me think I can't be a transman is that I enjoy dressing up pretty, and wearing skirts/dresses (no makeup, though); I hated that stuff as a child but from around 15 years old I warmed to it. My mother always tried to get me to be more girly. 

I have a binder I use for cosplay, but I've used it a few times for crossdressing to try and test the waters, but I've never really passed so it hasn't done a lot except make me self conscious. 

I have a few friends transitioning, and whenever they reach a milestone (like one getting top surgery) I get this crazy jealous pang, but I can’t tell if I’m jealous of what they’ve actually done, or if I’m just seeing them do something that’s making them happy, and my brain is deciding it must be the cure to unhappiness and could make me happy too. 

TL;DR: I’m questioning whether or not I might be a transman. I’m not totally unhappy as a girl, though. I just don’t really know what to think right now. Any perspectives or insight appreciated, thank you so much for reading. 

Sorry for the long post!!

stephanierose538,asktransgender,Dead confused,"So I've been actively questioning whether I'm trans for like 6 months now, and frankly I'm still not too close to being sure about it either way. I'm male, and definitely don't like the idea of someone thinking of me as a guy or identify at all with being a man, and since I've been at uni I've had my nails painted and bought skirts, and close friends call me by a female name and use she/her, and that's felt wonderful and like nothing I've ever felt before, and I would much rather have been born female. But at the same time, I think I could manage pretty ok if I just went back to acting like a guy. I don't think I have like massive dysphoria at being male or anything, just feel uncomfortable when someone refers to me as he, and even that only since I've had friends call me she. I don't remember as a kid feeling like I was a girl or should have been or anything. I did hang round with girls in primary school, but since I live in a tiny village and there were 9 people in my year, I don't think that really supports it much.  When I was like 11 starting secondary school I never really had many friends but the people I did hang round with were always guys, and then when I became actual friends with people they were all girls. I do remember wanting to play with my sisters doll house,  but that doesn't exactly change anything to me bc I'm sure plenty of boys did really. Besides not wanting my voice to break or grow hair everywhere, I don't remember having much of an issue or a desire to do many feminine things until about 3 years ago. I know since about 3 years ago I've like done the whole going out for Halloween dressed as a girl for JOKES HAHA YEAH totally just wanting to, same with one time a girl painting my nails for jokes and me pretending it's not exactly what I want. I've even felt like almost jealousy when one of my friends like complains about her period and like surely that can't be normal cis guy thing? Basically, I don't want to, but if I just went back to all people calling me he and stuff then I'd probably be mostly ok. I've been kinda self harmy and suicidal at various points, and not liked how I look for as long as I can remember, but I don't feel like that's related to the wanting to be a girl thing really.

The post starts below - 

Now I've been getting to sleep at regular hours, now that I'm in a regular sleeping pattern, I seem to not be thinking that much about being a transgender woman! Also, when I was living as a man, I wasn't very confident, like at all. Now, when I'm passable and I'm treated like any woman on the street, I'm very confident. Outspoken even. But, I can't help but think, ""am I just feeling more confident as a woman because when I'm perceived as a heterosexual woman which society says is the norm, rather then being seen as a VERY and I mean VERY, stereotypical homosexual man (like I was perceived as whilst living as a man), which is of course frowned upon by many in society, because it's more acceptable and easier to go through life? See, I was never uncomfortable living as a man. What do you think this all means?"

MotherofViolence,asktransgender,Does HRT affect the way you sprint?,"(I'm MTF, but I'd love answers going in either direction) 

So before I got on E, I used to pride myself as being the fastest person I'd ever met. Growing up, sports were a weird love/hate combo - stuck among dudes and machismo sports culture, but absolutely loving the challenge and the chase. I could sprint with ease, but now, about 23 months into E/Spiro/Finasteride, I'm feeling the effects of muscle and energy loss. I can't just 'summon' adrenaline rushes like I used to.

Now, this is certainly partly due to lack of exercise. College demands your time, and I've been avoiding the gym and heavily-populated areas while exercising (I'm not passing as yet, but my breasts are coming in well enough). 

So, knowing full well that between boobs, muscle loss, lack of energy, and lack of exercise, I would be moving a little slower from now on, and I try to give myself a little more leeway when going for a jog. Last week though, I tried sprinting, and remembered that my center of balance should be shifting as well. Instead of leaning forward (which I what I used to do), I tried 'crouching' a little bit more, and that seemed to give me back that kind of weightless 'pushed forward' feeling you get when you're sprinting at full power, if you know what I mean. 

But that might just be confirmation bias, which is why I'm asking. Do men and women sprint in different ways, or am I completely off base here? How have you experienced changes in running while on HRT, whether on T or E?"
kernalmustache,asktransgender,FFS before SRS?,"I know it doesn't matter which one you get first because they're completely different parts of your body, but following Stef Sanjati and seeing how much prettier she is after FFS made me realize that I would feel less dysphoric if I got FFS first rather than SRS and then I started to wonder if it was more common for people who want to get both to get FFS first or SRS first."
razzelle,asktransgender,Has anyone here with health insurance tested the waters to see if Gender Affirmation Surgery is covered under their plan?,"I live in Oregon, where Gender Affirmation Surgery is covered as a right for people receiving Medicaid health coverage. We also have a good anti-discrimination law that protects trans people - our state has interpreted this to mean that private insurers must cover (for instance) vaginoplasty for trans clients if they have ever covered a vaginoplasty for a cis client for any reason.

I've also been hearing that increasing numbers of private insurers are beginning to cover Gender-Affirming Care independent of legal requirements. For instance, I heard that Walmart just announced it is now covered under the plans they contract for.

I have private healthcare insurance through my job, and I don't know if they cover surgery or not. They don't advertise what they cover in my plan, because they're always hoping to discourage people from receiving care for any reason. As soon as they announce they cover something, everyone will fight to get it. But Gender Affirming Surgery is not specifically listed as an exclusion.

Has anybody here gone through a process with a private insurer in search of coverage? It sounds absurd, but if I can't get private coverage through my workplace, my best bet to save money would be to stop working, become poor enough to receive Medicaid, and then live poor for a year or so until I've made it through the waiting list (and hopefully before Trump and the Republicans are able to destroy this coverage). The other option, of course, is to continue working and see if it's possible to save up money to receive care in Thailand.

I'm curious to learn if anyone has had experiences that would provide useful context for me in figuring this out."
deimosXdeimos,asktransgender,Pity compliments? Am I ungrateful?,"Well, I've had  this thought for a while, but, when close friends or family tell me how cute or feminine I look now...

I really like how I look every day since some weeks now, but I always keep in mind that article I read some time ago that said that the brain usually tricks you onto thinking you're more good looking than you really are, so I'm always like nah.

Why is it that I think that the most important people who compliments how I look are doing just because the feel bad for me? Or they are lying just to make me feel better? Why is that I want strangers to do that for me instead? Am i a ungrateful biatch?"

  I've actually been having thoughts like that. How do I know I will be happier post-transition? I don't. I'm scared of going out as female incase I realise I'm not trans (sounds strange, I know).

bitchassthrowawaybro,asktransgender,"Most impressive, up to date SRS result photos? Personal results???","It's very difficult to find result photos that are relatively recent. Obviously, not many people are keen on posting their bits online in any context, but it's fairly easy to do anonymously. I don't understand why simple photos are so hard to find, or maybe I'm missing something.

Also, I've been wondering why no one on this sub ever seems to post their SRS results. They may discuss their results, but I've never seen anyone post a single photo. If I were in their position, I would certainly just make a throwaway and post a couple photos for informational purposes. It just feels as if I'm missing something when it comes to how advanced the process has become, because the vast majority seem to be satisfied after recovering. However, I feel like I've never actually seen what they're so satisfied with, in context, and it makes me uneasy with SRS in general. In hindsight, I've known I should have a vagina since I was 11. But, I'm still not convinced by the random google searches I've done which yield seemingly outdated results. I know there are better examples out there, I just haven't seen them...

iywciuwqrcbw,asktransgender,You probably get this a lot: I'm not sure if I should transition from female to male.,"
I'm currently a girl, though internally I always saw myself as a boy and in dreams I'm usually a boy–I'm a girl in nightmarish situations. Before recently I think I close to fully internally saw myself as a boy, I saw myself as the male roles in books, poems, plays etc. Now for some reason I'm having trouble enjoying my favorite books, because I feel that the characters are not for written for me, that I'm can't be like them, but when I imagined myself as having transitioned, I can fully be immersed and not distanced from them as previously. I guess now there's a subconscious awareness that I can't be a boy if I'm not physically a boy. This might seem like a trivial issue, but books are the only source from which I derive happiness in my otherwise really anxiety ridden and depressed life.
I'm not happy being a girl, but I don't seem to mind when others see me as a girl because I don't often look for and enjoy other's company, so there's not much inconvenience for me to be a girl socially. But it's just to myself, I feel so torn apart.
However I do still feel really sad when there's ostensibly female-specific treatment directed towards me, I guess most of that type are degrading and shouldn't be subjected to anyone, maybe I'm put off by the unfairness of it.

I don't have support as I'm estranged from my family. But I honestly don't yearn for any because I really like my own company, making friends for me is quite overwhelming. What holds me back the most from transitioning is fear of harassment and discrimination--I'm really scared that for instance my relationship with professors and staff would be affected if I transition, especially since I'll become a Ph.D candidate next year. Even if I apply to other schools, I'll still depend on recommendations. I'm also quite attuned to intricacies in people's regard towards me, and easily becomes depressed and anxious even now.
Also that I'm afraid people would be weirded out and wonder ""is that a boy or a girl"" because passing for a man will probably be really hard since I'm barely 5""1 on a good day. I'm really scared of 'putting people off'; I'm just so scared of drawing any attention to me or people thinking about me, I really want to be invisible.
Sometimes I also worry about my appearance.
Overall I'm really miserable now, have been quite miserable all my life, uncertain about transitioning because I'm worried about potential greater misery that could befall if I do transition."

Sayoria,asktransgender,Massively depressed. Don't know what to do now.,"I had a plan to have SRS this summer. I have had a plan to see Dr. Brassard. I have given them everything except for a psychiatrist letter that I have been so eager to work on. My insurance promised to re-imburse me for my surgery with Brassard, which was fantastic. Any aid helps.

In October, I got a letter telling me my insurance plan was going to be discontinued in 2017 and that I needed to choose a new one. I looked into it and the closest one to my current plan at the time was 125 dollars more a month. I could not afford this.

I ended up having to get on MassHealth (The Massachusetts poor people insurance program) because I couldn't afford insurance anymore. Individuals, it costs about 400 fucking dollars a month. A MONTH.

So I called this insurance and while they will cover SRS, they will only do local surgeons which kills me. My mind was set on Brassard. I gave all of my information to this point to Brassard. SRS is nothing I want to have some hack do for me... I want to make sure it's a great surgeon. 

And now, I feel like this isn't fucking happening. Thankfully I am not suicidal, but I feel absolutely hopeless now. My world and all my hard work just came crashing down on me.

Helloharryson,asktransgender,Something has to give. But nothing can give. I can't breathe.,"I can't go on like this


I want to look female but the degree to which hormones would help my big boned balding 27yr old body will not outweigh the negatives of throwing my whole life into crisis and feeling immediately like I'd want to be a million miles away from the only support I have in life in my friends and family. 


I'd describe my sexuality as 'I want to look female'. It's not based in an attraction to people or reality so the constant urges drive me insane on a daily basis. I can't go on living in this trap. I feel like a pervert. I've never had sex and all I do is masturabte on a regular basis.


I can't knuckle down to a type of CBT programme of changing the way I think because the urges are so instinctual. It's like this constant poison running through me ruining my happiness. Ironically chopping of my dick would probably help me see a positive life ahead as the guy I am now.


I can't kill myself because of what it would do to my family.


I feel like the world and my genes and my family and who I am and my friends have got their hands around my throat suffocating me. I'm in bed right now and I've had to come and write this because the thought of closing my eyes fills me with such utter fear and hopelessness and emptiness because then it will just be tomorrow.


The only thing that gets me through is looking at the sky and convincing myself if I think hard enough about what life really is and what we're all here for I'll have some kind of religious experience that will make me happy and all this seem trivial.

She ended up deadnaming me...again..and I told her to please not call me that. She ends up going on this yuuuuuge thing about how ""it's hard!"" and this is what she calls me all the time when I'm not around and what she'll always think of me as no matter what I do. I did my best to stay calm and quiet and said that it's disrespectful and I just dont want to be called that name.

She claims that it's not disrespectful and goes on this long story about people call her ""Squirt"". They called her that since she was little and she doesnt like it but she lets it go. And I told her that what if she didnt want to let it go. What if she told them to not call her squirt and they did it anyway. Wouldnt that be pretty disrespectful? And I asked her to just call me something else like hun or sweetie. She said she doesnt talk like that. And I told her that's why it's called a compromise. I'm not forcing her to call me Holly but I dont wanna be called my deadname. She mumbled something about how she'll try to be better about it. So....yeah. We'll see.

And on a side note, she also wanted to tell me how offended my dad was when, after not talking to me for months, he said ""Merry Christmas, Deadname!"" Over facebook and I responded with ""Merry Christmas to you too! But could you please not call me that name?""

Meanwhile, I'm going to be starting HRT quite soon. 

I know E makes it easier to put on weight, and I'd assume T makes it easier to lose it and gain muscle (?), but I suppose what I'm more curious about is if there can be any reverse effects: heavy weight loss or workouts having any effect on transitioning or the effects of hormones.

Mostly, as a trans woman, I'm afraid that working out too much will cause me to build too much testosterone and that'll throw off my transition. Or, I suppose, that the blockers will prevent me from being able to lose much weight either. 

Is it then easier for trans men to lose weight with all of their new testosterone? "

The question I've got is -- I'm not sure how to answer something my wife posed to me. What is it I actually need to change? She's firmly convinced that the concept of gender is stupid and I can't effectively explain to her how much it matters to me and more importantly why. I don't know what to tell her about what I feel I could do as a woman that I can't as a man besides make myself a pariah.

She hasn't outright said ""You probably ought to continue to present male. I don't think you can handle being a woman, let alone a transwoman out here"".

Then, on top of that, my girlfriend is closeted about being into me, and the temptation is so strong to revert to being a man or make some changes to make things easier on her- I definitely do love her with all my heart, and this is the one and only thing that even vaguely threatens our relationship. We're both willing to wait and work and endure until she feels ready to come out, but I'm terrified that if she's feeling cornered or outed she'll end things out of fear. 

There's a lot else going into this feeling, but I can't detangle all of the stuff going on in my head well enough to put it into words. Just, if anyone has anything to say, suggest, ask or otherwise, please do. "
idk-throwaway7,asktransgender,Feeling fake,"I was trying to sing along to a song with a female vocalist to try and practice my voice and I just sounded so male and felt so fake and I broke down. I don't get how to do this. How can I speak without sounding like I'm acting like I'm playing some character. I want to be able to just feel like I can be me but I have to fake a voice just to be believable and people to not gender me male. The voice that is mine is unmistakably male and if I try to speak like a girl I either end up speaking quieter or just sounded like a freak. Does Yeson VFS fix this. I'll do anything to fix it. Although I can't afford Yeson I'll find a way if I have to. 

Please help me to not feel fake.

What do you do when you feel fake? (In any respect not just due to voice)"
Finnoli,asktransgender,[NSFW] Trouble Having Sex With Nonbinary Partner,"[TW: the following contains mention of rape]
I've been with my datemate for a year now and everything is going great except we still haven't found out what works with them when having sex. Like...They haven't had a single orgasm or really gotten that close. Neither of us have any past sexual experiences to go off of as this is the first relationship to turn sexual for either of us and we've kind of depleted our imaginations and all of the heterosexual or cisgender sex advice resources available on the internet.

I'm a transman without bottom surgery and they're nonbinary as stated above and have female genitalia. Neither of us are particularly comfortable with the idea of vaginal penetration. They've said they would be willing to try it but are obviously very hesitant about it and would need a lot of time to ease into it if it even works for them at all. 

That being said, I'm still not sure if me just penetrating them would work even if it ends up not being a dysphoria-inducing experience for them. Part of the problem is they get turned off very quickly and easily and really the only way they can maintain a lot of arousal during sex is when they're dominating me and giving me sexual pleasure (they're definitely the more dominant one in the bed and I am more than okay with that). I don't see how I could be penetrating them with them still being the dominant one as they like to be.  I've looked into the realdoe but we're both 19 year olds without jobs who still get money from our parents primarily and $140 seems like a lot to spend on a sex toy that might not even work for us. 

Excuse me, because I'm gonna get possibly a bit TMI here, but I'm gonna give y'all a brief rundown of what we've tried in the past to help give some perspective and tell you what hasn't worked. Initially I would just try to stimulate their external genitalia as they had described they would when masturbating but for one thing the way they apparently get off is really fucking weird and would end in a major hand cramp for me but also it still would not work for them when I was the one doing it. I've also tried stimulating their clitoris but apparently there is a fine line between ""not enough stimulation"" and ""I am overwhelmed and not in a good way"" for them and I have yet to find it because it's as fine as a god damn strand of hair and I'm still not convinced I'm not looking on a bald head for it. I experimented with giving them oral as well but apparently it just felt warm and kind of weird to them. We bought a small bullet vibrator a bit ago and while I enjoyed it it just felt funny to them. 

It's possible I'm just bad at pleasuring them and it has nothing to do with dysphoria but I'm also wondering if this has something to do with their past sexual abuse and PTSD. I'm always careful and make sure everything I do is okay and doesn't trigger anything for them and they've never said they had any problems with whatever I'm doing and that they're doing fine. Regardless, it's possible that while they aren't consciously upset there could be something more subliminal at work here that is preventing them from actually enjoying the experience or letting them trust someone enough in a sexual context to allow an orgasm. 

Is there anyone here that has had a similar experience? Or, if not, that have any ideas on what to do? I'm fairly open about answering any questions that may help."

typowilliams,asktransgender,Is it okay not to transition if you feel the risks outweight what you're not even sure will be benefits?,"I've lurked these forums for a while. I've noticed that my dysphoria, if it is that, comes and goes. It's never a huge urge to be a woman, more mild envy than anything else. If asked if I'm happy with the gender I am now, I'll nod and say that I'm quite satisfied. I also feel like I could be as female as well. I've really come to the conclusion that I could be transgender, but not sure if transitioning and all the huge hurdles to go over will make me any happier than I am now. Is that a bad thing?"
HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,"the more i try to be female (mtf), the more i resist it. im fighting against myself and i always lose. anyone relate/have any advice?","what i mean is that when i try to be female, i end up being really weird, and essentially more of a male.  its *tough* to say one thing means male and another means female, but that's essentially what it is i guess. its like im fighting against everything ive learned was 'right', and punishing myself by disfiguring my social interactions into grotesque bitter spiteful over-exaggerations of men, especially when talking to women.  like theres this invisible enemy that i cant see or feel from all my interactions with males who made me feel like a piece of shit for what i am, so i punished myself for that, and became like them.  and any time i dont live up to being like them, i hate myself for it.   its a  constant cycle of psychological punishment, negative reinforcement or something i cant really remember, positive punishment, to keep me from making any progress in transition, mentally.  yes im on hrt, yes i came out to my social network on facebook, but i can't feel good about anything.  whenever i try to, i just immediately remember how male my body is, how puberty ruined it, how many surgeries ill need, how similar face surgery is to superficial narcissistic plastic surgery, etc etc etc. how the closest thing to a vagina that i will have is a reconfiguration of these male parts. it fucking blows.   

but then, when i actually see myself as female, which i can sometimes, and when i feel ok and sorta prepared when thinking about surgeries, content with having a neo-vagina over what i have now, then my social femininity is gone, my entire me is gone, im back to being an empty shell. its one or the other sorta thing.  this has been going on for two years, but really its been the damage ive been doing to myself (with the aiding and abetting of society) for my entire life.

ErikaJay,asktransgender,When have I had enough female HRT to decide if I want FFS? Should I try different dosing methods?,"I'm almost 26 and have passed two years on female HRT, although it took a year of dosage adjustments before my bloodwork showed ""normal female"" estrogen and testosterone levels. Obviously, medication mileage varies, but my daily meds are 6mg estradiol pills (generic, IDK what kind of estradiol), 200mg spironolactone pills, and 5mg finasteride pills.

I feel like it's become easier to take cute selfies without makeup/I look more feminine from some angles, and my friends have told me as much. However, I have a pretty masculine brow and jaw, and while HRT can't change bone, I hoped it would balance those things out, and it really hasn't.

I know HRT isn't a miracle-worker, nor is FFS. I'm just wondering when I can say that HRT has done everything it can, and decide if I want to try FFS or just live with it. Should I give it another 6-12 months? Is there evidence (or maybe a preponderance of anecdotes :P) that changing to bioidentical hormones or injections or patches might do more for me?

Thank you all!"
throwawayauntmay,asktransgender,Question for those who consider themselves truscum/trans-medacalists or just plain old don't believe that gender is a social construct.,"Hi, this is last time asking because i am in deep financial trouble question, can't get a psychiatrist and just want to talk with some people, am i ""trans enough? to be considered truly trans"".

two of my earliest memories where i felt different was basically when i was very young, i remember feeling like my *you know what area* was ugly and ""should be flat"" 
even before even knowing really what a vagina was, the other was when i was sent to a doctor once by my mom, the doctor referred to me when talking to my mom as 
""Your daughter bla bla bla""...all i remember, heared and cared about was he said ""daughter"", it's one of my most happiest memories. As a kid, i was also super gentle,
sensitive, cried a lot and was very loving, i was pretty feminine too.

Later on, i was more tomboyish/boyish in the way that i liked playing with swords, super hero toys, video games, i also liked playing with cooking toys, 
animal plushies, figurines and i used to put on my mom's make up for a while, i also loved wearing an skirt for men in asian culure (sarong) which was my way of 
feeling more feminine eventhough it was ugly as sin i loved feeling like i was wearing a skirt. 

Then i reached puberty (i think i reached it at age 9), i went crazy, wanting a female body and wanting to live as a girl and be a girl in every way, i wished i would
 wake up one day and wake up a girl.I started cross dressing at this age too and it always made me feel at peace, it may have ended sexually but the main reason i did 
it was because i just felt happy, like everything was right. I also had a friend who i was albe to play make believe where he was a hero and i was always the damsel in
distress (it was asia in the 90's lol), I also was semi-flirtatious with boys however i was in an all-boys school so when i went to school at about age 12, I would 
presentted as if i was tougher but felt the same way inside. My interests was this age was bascially video games and tv (i loved WWE) i also remember watching Ranma 1/2 
and wishing i was the powers Ranma had (it's an anime where a boy has the ability to change his body to female), as i grew older after years of getting bullied in 
school because i was gentle, pretty soft still and awkward.

Later on i would been taken out of school because of the bullying, after this i became more aggressive as a defense mechanism, At this point deep down i still felt the
 same feelings of  wishing i was born a girl, wanting a female body etc. Living in Singapore which was very conservative (gay marriage is still illegal, so not exactly trans accepting), i honestly didn't know there was such a thing as 
a sex change..i pretty much thought i had to be male till the day i died and that was just life, being female was just a pipedream, so i thought i was either gay or a cross dresser but again, living in
a conservative country i had already been bullied for just being gentle, i felt if i accepted that i was different in any way, it was bascially suicide. At this point i
was somewhere in between in my presentation, i was goth which was basically my way of thinking ""I can dress femininely, wear make up and no one will ""figure me out"" (i pretty much just wore thick eyeliner and pink lipstick, do i don't know how gothic that was lol)
however also not feeling like there was a choice in life besides ""male"", i tried to live life as a guy and make it work, trying to be a normal guy in everyway sense of the word, it was
never what i wanted and i was never happy, because that's how truly how i wanted to look/present and not being to truly be myself. 

Anyway, after that basically i transitioned, eventhough my life isn't perfect, i've been so much happier and at peace, something i never felt nor had before. I'm not complete
but am more comfortable than i've ever been. "
theone23four,asktransgender,I feel like i'm slowly being pushed towards suicide and there's nothing I can do,"Hi. I'm not about to commit suicide this post isn't about that. It's about how I feel like any hope for being happy has been taken away and I won't be able to last long without it. My life has been shit so far, I grew up with a single parent home while my other parent drank herself to an early grave when I was a young teen. $20k a year income with a single parent was hardly enough to live let alone be happy as a child. We are still struggling every day and on top of that I hate myself, starting last year when I recognized I am trans. I don't think I'm universally ugly but to me the bad traits are all I see. I don't pass, I can't afford surgery, and I feel like no matter what I'll never be like ""other girls"". Being trans will follow me everywhere passing or not. I can't even get a job right now because we have no money, and I've been sitting in my room for about 2 years straight with zero friends. I have been leaving my house one time a week starting like 4 months ago, but that's it. I don't see a point in living a live that is continuously so hard and unsatisfactory. When I think of my life in the future it will mostly be the same, I'll still be poor and lonely because it's my only choice. I'll still hate everything about myself and will still feel like complete shit about the fact that when I was born into this shitty life I couldn't even get the absolutely most simple thing - my own body.

zauraz,asktransgender,Where to go?,"Hey 

In the past month I have written a lot on here and to say the least, a lot has happened in my life but weirdly enough I have found some security.

Following that I found out that my referal had not been sent I hit an all time low. Depression went through the roof and I found my life meaningless, there was nothing left for me. Insecurity and doubt remained but mostly I felt hopeless. There was no future in sight any more, no better life or anything. For months I dealt with this and not really talking about anything I feel with anyone even though I at times want to yell out that I am trans or a girl. Internally I correct others and I am self aware of my gender every minute and every second of my life.

Two days ago I however talked to my bestfriends girlfriend who knows I am trans and I partially brought up that I felt kinda bad about having to get a suit for the school prom and not being able to get a dress. For the first time since I came out my friends someone told me they would be there for me and support me, she told me that both her and her boyfriend were there for me and that she understood this must be hard. To hear just support, no questions nor explanations relieved me to degrees that are hard to explain.

Following up this she insured me that I could feel free talking about this more and another important topic came up. I have not been able to talk much with my bestfriend and its become harder talking about this as I feel like a huge bother and I don't know how to bring it up. She asked me to talk more to him and be more open and don't worry so much about what he might think like I do. It seemed like even he wanted that. The problem is I don't know how to bring it up when we rarely write at all outside of school anymore :/

Anywho. Her saying this filled me with a determination that first got shaken last night. I felt like I knew I was a girl and trans. I wanted to transition for myself and it was who I am. Meeting up with norms and consuming fiction caused the doubt but I still feel the certainty and all which is great but... Knowing my referral is not sent I have months without anything...... I don't know what to do. I feel that I need to do something related to this to not suffer throught months of nothingness again. I have hobbies but those never relieve the pain caused by the waiting without anything happening that only reinforces the idea that I might not be trans...

Lately I have started to think about how I will see my relationship to my parents. The idea that I am their daughter and imagining myself as presenting like that makes me feel weird and shitty knowing that they 'know' that I am 'male'... This causes reluctance and doubts ..

----------

Tl;dr I need tips on how to talk to my bestfriend about this and open ut more when communication is rare as is and I am ultra shy, scared and uncertain how to bring up something I feel is a 'selfish problem'. 

Primarily I also want tips on dealing with the fact that I have months of waiting left and the pain of not doing anything whilst being trans will become unbearable eventually again."
cady4,asktransgender,Realized that you don't pass as assigned gender anymore?,"Recently I realized that I don't pass or barely pass as male anymore. Going to work at a new job a couple of weeks ago has made that pretty clear to me. My goal was to be seen as a women in mens clothing while at work, and it has finally happened. It is a bit shocking to be treated so differently. I don't ever want to dress feminine at work and be anymore objectified than I already am. 

At just over two years hrt, I'm really excited to have changed so much. I still have a bunch of those wtf moments where I catch my reflection and see a beautiful woman. It's like, holy shit, is this what they're seeing. "
Wolf_Parade,asktransgender,Did your personality change as you/after you transitioned?,"I'm currently in transition and I am definitely dealing with the physical dysphoria but I also find that as I continue to process what being trans means, and I leave my old gender identification behind, it is the internal shifts which are troubling me the most. Sometimes I find myself thinking and acting in a way that is authentic to the person I am now. Other times, especially under stress (of which there is a lot) or if I am experiencing scarcity (also often) I revert back to the person I was before transitioning. Like many of us I was an angry and unhappy person before I transitioned and so much of what I am finding joy in now/for the future are not just the physical changes but the emotional/relational/interpersonal changes that an increased sense of peace, wellbeing, and self-awareness will bring. But at least for now I still feel trapped in my dead name's thoughts and patterns of behavior. It's scary to think I might not be able to escape that. Anybody relate to this? Has anyone found any helpful coping strategies or is this another thing I just have to wait out? I'm in therapy and that is for sure helping but it's really sucking a lot to experience internalized dysphoria from my own thoughts, words, and actions. From my very self."

BambooUtensils,asktransgender,Do you ever judge someone based on your experience with your assigned gender?,"This has been something I've been wondering for a while.

For example, as a MtF, do you ever find yourself looking at a man and thinking something like, ""psh, when I was a man I could do that much better"" or something to that effect? I don't mean always in such a negative way, but in general, do you ever find yourself judging someone based on your experience in their gender-shoes?

I suppose a follow up question would be, how do you view your life before transition, and to what extent does it inform your thoughts and opinions now? This seems a little silly when you think, well, it's not like all that time just disappears! But I'm just curious and would like a little perspective :)"
sarahtay98,asktransgender,Random Question: I think my parents might know I'm trans.,"This really isn't a question that has to strictly be asked in this sub but I figure maybe some of you might have experienced something like this. I accepted that i was trans last summer but I haven't come out to anyone but my best friend. I have been trying to show an interest in trans issues and I've stopped trying to hide some of my more feminine manerisms and interests so it's possible my parents and sister may have picked up some suspicions.

They haven't addressed it or anything but for christmas, my Aunt got me a pair of women's sweatpants. I didn't realize they were women's at the time until I googled the tag. I figured it could have just been a mistake or something but I thought she would have to go out of her way to go to the women's section to get something like these. All in all, they could easily be sweatpants for either sex so I didn't think much of it.

When I started to where them a lot(because they're very comfortable and they're my favorite pair of pants) my sister came into my room one day and said, ""I didn't think you'd actually where those pants."" I just told her i thought they were comfortable because I was honestly afriad of asking her what she meant. The only way she could have known they were women's pants was if my mom told her so I'm really starting to think they might know.

Anyway, sorry for the boring backstory, my question is am i overthinking this? Or do you think they know? And if you think they know, it is a good sign they did this?"

transphthrowaway,asktransgender,"I (might) be MTF, and have internalized transphobia, help?","I'm probably going to get down voted the hell out of for this, but here I go.



Growing up, my parents were transphobic, homophobic, etc. So, naturally growing up I was too basically LGBT-phobic, and so was everyone I knew, so I thought that was normal.


I grew up thinking trans people were just perverts/pedos who wanted to use womens toilets, etc. I always had some feeling I'd rather be a girl, but it wasn't that bad at all. When I was 7/8, I used to think it was bad that I liked trying on dresses, I acted like I hated it, because I was a boy and I shouldn't do that. 


I also used to think all transpeople were drag queens, and used to associate drag queens with being gay and because I was raised in a homophobic family, I grew up thinking that was the norm, so I just did not like them and did not like it. I try not to think that, but because I've felt like that for a long time it's really hard not to.


I'm now older and I do experience some transphobia still. I'm trying to correct it, but I just can't stop it and I feel so bad for feeling this. I've managed to accept I was Bi, but I don't actually tell anyone.

I've been sexually curious for a long time and today it kind of came to a head with me going on Craigslist and getting someone by me to essentially let me blow him. Well I didn't pull out of it as I should and it ended up happening about 30 minutes ago and I'm in serious regret mode. 

It's not necessarily that it wasn't enjoyable (it was eh) but that it was my first sexual encounter and with a complete stranger. I'm having a massive panic attack about it and don't know what to do and honestly just need advice. The entire experience made me realize that I'm more lesbian than bi, but I'm still freaking out. 

What if I see him around my town? What if he try's to contact me again? (This one is null because I deleted the email but still) What if he had a std?! He said he didn't but could have lied. No there wasn't a condom. God I feel like making myself vomit. I'm not suicidal right now but I'm definitely not liking what I did to myself. 

I feel like a complete slut. Can I talk to my therapist about this? Should I? Who even am I anymore?

I've spoke with a decent number of trans people and they explain that from a young age they did not feel that their actions, preferences, thoughts, and feelings match societal expectations of their birth sex. Is the desire to change your body to match your gender in effort to look how society expects your gender to look? I don't understand why a ""feminine"" person (someone who acts, feels, and thinks like the female gender is expected to) cannot also be a male in gender and have a male looking body. As a cis person, maybe there is just something I can't understand and that's why I'm asking. Is the body/mind mismatch (oversimplification I know) based on some internal feeling of something not being right or based on expectations of assigned sex and gender roles?"
GabiCap,asktransgender,Therapist kinda implied I may be in denial,"So today was my first therapy session since the holidays. We caught up on everything (or as much as you can catch up from 2 weeks in one session).
And towards the last 20 minutes or so she asked, ""Where's Gabi in all this?"" And I told her the truth. While for the last month or so I kinda suppressed it (or forgot about it) my feelings have come back and there are days I just feel bad because I'm not a girl (tried to avoid calling it dysphoria) and whenever I talk to myself, I use my preferred name now almost out of instinct.
And here I was thinking it was just another phase....
So eventually she said something about accepting who I am and the progress I've made in caring for myself. And I responded, ""But I still don't know who I am"" she gave me a look that kinda said, ""Really?""
In response I repeated a line from a favorite book about once we know something we have to act on it and I don't wanna yet.
I thought it was a phase that I was over and I was just fooling myself. Now I'm wondering if I'm missing something that she's catching or am I just that good at selling I am trans when I'm not???"

transthrowaway43454,asktransgender,"Coming out at work in a retail environment, need advice.","Hello! I have been browsing a while looking for help with this sort of situation for a bit but nothing I could really find works for my current situation. My workplace is the only thing in my life where I still present as a male and I want to change that so I can be me 100% of the time.

I have already discussed this with HR and the store manager who are both wonderfully supportive of me. They said since I am the first person to transition on the job here they want to follow my lead and ask me how I would like to come out to everyone, to which I was sort of clueless and asked for a few days to think over how I wanted to do that.

My predicament is that it is a very large department store, the permanent staff numbers probably close to 50 people with all very times at which they come in, days they work and what not. Being a retail store no one is really dependent on computer work or emails, so coming out or letting everyone know electronically is a bust. Having a meeting would be too hectic to try and grab everyone even on their off days for it would not work. HR said if there was no other choice when I am ready he could let the information pass down to each departments supervisor and then let them tell the individuals under them. 

I am not too certain on that way as I would be unsure of how that would be spread and what could be said behind the backs of myself and HR before coming out. Has anyone else been in a similar situation and have any advice on how to go about this?"
Jillujion,asktransgender,Im a tortured soul.,"Hello, this a resume of my life the past 5 years. 

So. Where to begin..

Lets start 5 Years ago where I found out I was TG. I startede dressing up as a Girl, gave myself a female name and accepted myself as just that, a TG. Everything was blizz. All my hormones was in balance and everything else was smooth, i was so happy.

Fast forward 5 years. 

It was on that fateful night i woke up screaming from a very very bad nightmare, it was something about some army guys doimg horrible things to me. I vant remember so well now. Anyway, since that day I have Been possessed in my mind, I remember even floating upwards from my bed into the ceiling. I hear words in my head now, words like, Girl, youre a girl, money and others,  as if i didnt know myself.. My entire body is sweaty,  my stomach is very very painful, I have absolutely no joy or feelings anymore, everything is just gone,  all my enerrgy and I cant think straight

This is just a taste, Theres more to it than this, but that is the main.

Dearest regards.

goodgirlGrace,asktransgender,Are stealth trans folks usually uncomfortable around those of us who are open with our experienced or who don't pass?,"So, a little bit of context for the question - this is my first week back from a holiday trip to see my extended family, which includes a cousin who is a completely stealth transwoman (the family knows, obviously,  and her boyfriend too but I believe that's it).

This year lack of interaction was due to a delayed flight, but she has always been distant since her transition, too. That's her perogative and, as much as I'd like to reconnect with her, I'm fine just not really crossing paths any more.

That said, the whole thing kinda made me wonder whether stealth trans women tend to be uncomfortable around other girls who don't pass very well. I can see how it might make one afraid of extra scrutiny,  or bring up bad early transition memories."

allthemolecules,asktransgender,Just a little catchup post and some hard-won advice,"I don't come on here often these days, but this place used to be absolutely essential in helping me transition, so I stop by from time to time.

I figured out 'something was up' a couple years ago. You can search my username and see all the posts I made from summer of '14 onwards. It's been a journey.

I'm several months into HRT, for the second time. I was on estrogen for about 6-7 months until I realized I really wanted to bank sperm, which required me to go off for 4 months until I regained sperm production. That was a major bummer. I've been back on for almost 3 months now, and I'm feeling great again.

You can do this. All of you can. If I had to give any advice, going through what I've been through, it would be:

* Whatever you're going through, it's normal. I PROMISE. I can't count how many times I've flipped out over something I was thinking or something that was happening with my body and it's either gone away or wound up being totally irrelevant and benign.

* If you think you might be trans, talk to a doctor and get the ball started. Don't hem and haw about hormones; start a low dose for two months and see if you like it. You can spend years in indecisive limbo. Starting the process, even if you're not 100% certain, will tell you everything you need to know about whether or not you want this. 

* After your trial period, if you start for realsies: if you think you might want kids, and can afford it, make reproductive banking one of your top priorities. I can't tell you how much it sucks to watch (and feel) your changes reverse because you had to go off hormones. 

* Simply having doubts isn't a reason not to move forward. For me, it often felt like dragging myself, kicking and screaming. And even now, I sometimes have to snap myself out of some extremely unhelpful thoughts. The thoughts may never stop, but you get way better at shutting them up over time.

* We need to stick together, but by and large we're a pretty anxious, messed-up bunch of humans with a high incidence of mental health issues. Don't let any self-hating words or behavior from another trans person drive you away from anything you want or need.

* Same goes for TERFs. And cis people. And me. And anyone, really.

* Cis people don't fret about their gender all that much. They just don't. The best ones do question themselves, especially if they have lots of queer friends, but not like we do. Trust your instincts.

* I love you. You got this."

katy1989,asktransgender,Panic attacks about making the wrong choice?,"Hello,

I'm Katy, MTF, 3 months HRT, full time for 6 months ish, UK based.

Since Christmas I've been feeling pretty crap in general. I put it down to the weather or possibly to hormone changes as I guess things are starting to happen now. Last weekend I just did nothing apart from sleep and worry. I worry about hormone side effects, my future, and the idea of trying to have a family. Luckily I'm not worrying about my social or work life at all, all of my friends and work colleagues have been amazingly supportive and make me feel very welcome all the time.

I thought that I'd shaken this depression/worry phase off on Monday when I had a good chat with one of my trans friends who's much further along the path. Yesterday and this morning I really felt like I was back on track. 

This evening I was playing guitar and not really thinking about anything, focusing on the guitar when all of a sudden I was hit by a panic attack and I couldn't stop imagining myself in the future, regretting everything I have done genderwise. I don't know if I'm doubting things or not, and I don't know if I'm regretting things or not. I just can't stop panicking about regretting it in the future and I can't think straight or relax enough to see what I'm feeling. I'm a bit autistic and often have trouble understanding what is upsetting me until after it's finished happening.

Has anyone else gone through this? Do you think this is entirely hormone related? Or more that it's the hormones revealing something that I've been feeling for a while? Is 3 months about the time you first felt emotional ups and downs? I was kind of expecting it to be like puberty before where I just felt a little up and down sometimes, not like uncontrollable panic attacks. 

Sorry for the tone of my post I'm still feeling panicked and adrenaliney so couldn't make it a friendly sounding as I'd have liked.

Thanks a lot,

Katy x"

maccas196,asktransgender,Lump under right breast?,"I'm 21, MtF and started hormones about 3 weeks ago. I've always had male gynecomastia in my right breast - a hardish tender lump under the nipple. As a kid it got checked and they said it was fine. As I got older the lump grew a little bit, but nothing drastic, and I kept telling myself it was gyno and males rarely got breast cancer so I'd be fine. Since starting HRT it seems to have grown more, and I  just found another lump in between my right breast and armpit which has formed. It all feels more tender than usual. I want to believe it's HRT breast growth, but my left breast doesn't share these lumps and never has. If it's gynecomastia, why has it spread towards my armpit? I'm starting to freak out.

I struggled with gender dysphoria and depression for 6 years before finally transitioning. I've come out to my parents and hormones have made me feel so much better. Imagining the end result is what keeps me going. If this is breast cancer it will literally break me. I've seen the result of breast surgeries to remove cancer. I'd be taken off hormones, probably forever. I'm going to see my doctor next week about it. But how do I cope with this if it turns out to be bad news?"

The will to win, for what it's worth, arguments against people with opposing views (even though they often stop replying or just keep dismissing your points and keep parrotting their opinion)?

So as someone who is a 'man' in every other way (jobs, hobbies, relationships, ect) this is hard for me to except that I am trans even though I like the thought of being a woman.

feelinqueer,asktransgender,"How to stay focused on ""more important"" things without suppressing your transition?","TL;DR at the bottom.

So after suppressing my wishes and thoughts of being a transwoman for several years because I thought it was ""just a phase"" or ""it would be too hard"" I finally accepted myself about a month ago and shortly after came out to the family I live with (mom, dad, brother) who are all very supportive of me! (Lucky me!)

With that said, ever since I have been on a near 24/7 binge of research, question asking, seeking relatability, etc. I have felt so good about browsing this sub and similar ones finally having similar thoughts and experiences as others.

The problem with this is, I start the spring semester tomorrow and I often shut most everything out of my life when school is on and I am afraid that I will either not be able to focus on school for once because this is so important to me or end up suppressing it (which I have done so many times before just in different context). I am scheduled to see a gender identity specialist counselor next week (it took a while to find a counselor I was confident/comfortable with seeing) which should help in not suppressing anything, but I still worry...

In other words, what have you done when you've needed to focus your thoughts on something besides your gender/transition without ""losing progress"" or feeling like you aren't being true to yourself and making dysphoria worse?

TL;DR: What do you do/have done when you need to focus your thoughts on something other than your gender/transitioning without suppressing it? This is coming from someone who is still presenting as their assigned gender at birth, in my case male."

Nin_Nin_Nin,asktransgender,Dissociation vs. dysphoria?,"This is a problem that's been weighing on my mind recently. I had a severe concussion a little less than two years ago that in many ways was a turning point in my life where my depression and anxiety got much, much worse. I know this can be a pretty common side-effect of concussions, but recently I've been discovering other possible long-lasting side-effects. I discovered I have a drooping eyelid (funnily enough because I was trying to style my eyebrows), which I didn't have in the past according to old pictures. I also once described [depersonalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization) perfectly to my therapist before really knowing what it was.

It's got me panicking. Many of the signs that I considered dysphoria overlap with dissociation, and although I'm still confident in my identity as a woman, I feel like trying to talk about both is just muddying the waters. It's just making room for people to argue that my personality is fragmented, and that my gender issues could be resolved in a different way. How am I supposed to make any distinction between what's going on in my head when all my problems are so nuanced? I don't know if anyone has any similar experiences, but if so, how do you feel confident in who you are when it's impossible to understand what's causing you to feel the way you do?

I have a lump under my left breast that hurts a lot. Will I ever be able to hide my breasts? I actually wanted to fully transition once I start to fail in boy mode. Will I ever fail at boy mode?

All these question are making me feel so insecure. Adding the lack of dysphoria, I can´t decide what to do. I still want to be a woman, but the urge has weakened a lot. Anyway, I can´t imagine stopping HRT. In fact, next week, I have a new appointment where my dose will be raised, I´m on 2mg Estrofem and 25mg Cypro right now.

I´m pretty confused right now. I feel like I still want to transition, but I´m not sure if it´s worth it. All these questions kept me from being happy. I´ve not even been happy when I started HRT since I had a huge fight with my gf...

What´s your opinion on this?"
esby88,asktransgender,Facial femininity,"Hello everyone,

I started my HRT (MtF) in July 2016 and I've been on Spiro (200 mg, split twice) everyday and Estradiol valerate (0.25 mL of 40 mg/mL) IM injection every Friday. Results have been fairly successful neck down. 

Widening of hips, enlargement of ass and breast growth are some of the most conspicuous and faster changes that I've experienced.

On the other hand, facial changes have been somewhat ambiguous. To start with, I don't have a masculine bone structure -- my jawbone, jaw angle and chin are not pronounced. Observable changes on face since HRT include really soft skin (not just on face), increasing subcutaneous fat especially on the cheeks, and larger eyes. I'm very thankful for all these changes.

However, there are these areas of concern (I don't know if I'm overreacting because it has only been six months since I started my HRT) -- nevertheless I am requesting the opinion and expert advice from you guys.

(1) I read (mostly everywhere) about the cheek and jawline fat changes during HRT. Women have more fat along their cheekbones and very less immediately below the cheekbones and along the jawline, while men store more fat under the cheekbones and along the jawline. While subcutaneous fat storage on my face seems to be appreciable, I am not too sure about the fat redistribution. It maybe me, but I feel that fat has just accumulated more than being redistributed (if at all). I still have spongy jawline and fatter lower cheeks. How long does it take for fat redistribution to be complete in the face? Is this completely normal, what I have, in 6 months of HRT?

(2) Another thing about the cheeks that’s been really bugging me is that they’re somewhat uneven. My left cheek seems to be responding more to fat storage and redistribution (if at all) than the right cheek.  I do think that the right cheek is responding, but at a considerably slower rate than the left one. Is this normal? Will time bring about the changes? Does facial yoga help to reduce the fat in the lower half of the face? Has anybody been through the same?

(3) The chin itself is fine, but I have a lot of fat under the chin. This fat is evident only when I look down. I have to say that this fat was present before I started HRT. I just don’t know how much of it has been redistributed. How much of the chin fat gets redistributed and how long does it usually take (I know YMMV applies for most of the questions I have, but what would be an average time for someone who doesn’t have a masculine face?) Should I wait for the chin fat to be redistributed or should I focus on reducing the face fat? 

(4) Finally, the cheekbone. My forehead is smaller and my cheekbones are somewhat wider than the forehead. Is this normal?

Sorry for the really long post. Thanks much everyone!"

LisaLies,asktransgender,What is up with the finasteride hate?,"I'm a member of a Facebook group for HRT discussion, and the mods have become militant about being anti-finasteride. They're posting links about how it hurts cis men, causes mental health issues, and ruins your entire transition by blocking progesterone. 

I consider finasteride to have saved my life. My male pattern baldness has completely reversed. I have a friend who takes it as her only anti androgen. Is this anti-finasteride thing for real, or is it just Facebook pseudoscience?

Edit: they're mostly talking about ""post finasteride syndrome"" and how it, apparently, permanently affects your mental health. "

tinawtg,asktransgender,"After 15,015 days...","I'm about to possibly take the red pill (well, they're not actually red). Let me preface by saying that I am married to a cishet female. We've been married for over 15 years. For most of my life, I've been unsure about myself. I used to wonder, was I only a crossdresser (no, there's more to it), am I trans (more than likely). I went to see a therapist four years ago and when I told her that I thought I was trans, she responded with, ""Ok, you're trans. You need to tell your spouse."" So I hesitated for a few months before sitting now, and writing out my thoughts and what I would say. when the time came (three years ago next month), I couldn't speak so I gave her my written words. It did not go well.
Eventually, she agreed that we needed to go to marriage counseling. We saw a new therapist (also one that specializes in gender). The therapist met with us together and individually. 
In the end, my wife gave me two options:
1-Be the husband/father that she's ""known' for +15 years. 
2-Be the person that I said I believed I am. This option means that we would not remain married or together. 

I've never had major dysphoria, major depression, etc. related to my gender. So along with my therapist, and because I've always put my partners first, I opted for option 1.
Cut to the last few months, we've moved from a large city to a very ""bigly"" city, one with an amazing trans community. Since moving here, I've met a lot of other women on social media.
Today, I met with one woman that has given me a few months of her previously stockpiled hormones (she's got access via a doctor now). So tomorrow, I'm going to take my first doses of E and Spiro. I've got about two months to try.
My concerns I've had since coming out were that if I did decide to transition and lost my wife, family, etc. due to it, what would happen if I started HRT and then came to some realization that I'm not trans, or I'm just genderfluid, or something else. I will have lost a lot w/ no way back.
So, I've gotten the pills and I think I'm going to start taking them, on the DL, to see how it affects me.

Thoughts? Am I crazy?

tl;dr 
I'm got E and Spiro, gonna try taking them for a few months to see how it affects me w/o my spouse knowing. Anything I should look out for?

jx3266,asktransgender,HRT in different countries + Germany,"Hi,
I live in Germany and I have read and heard that before you are allowed to get HRT you need to do something that is called practical trial (Alltagstest) for at least 6 months. This means you need to live out your desired gender role full time for this time period.
Is there any way to bypass this because I don't really want to come out to everyone this soon and because of the other obvious reasons.

What are the rules for HRT in other countries?

Do you have any advice for me, my therapy will start soon but I have many doubts because I would rather start HRT and start presenting female when I feel ready to (and when I look somewhat feminine).

My question might be a bit dumb:

How do you feel about families hanging up pictures of transgender relatives prior to their transition? Say, a picture of him as a little kid with longer hair and more feminine clothing hung up in the hallway. I know everyone is different, but would that be disrespectful to the transgender relative? I'm worried readers might get the wrong impression and think the parentd are clinging to the past, not accepting of their son's identity.

I have to have what the *judge* would deem a ""legitimate reason"".

Two major problems with that:

1. The area I live in is *highly* ultra-conservative, and no government official, neither elected nor appointed, believes in transgenderism. Let me make this clear: ***ANY*** **mention of ""gender"" or ""gender identity""** ***WILL*** **get me declined immediately.**

2. I've had numerous legal problems with this court before, and so basically the only assumption they could make is that I'm changing my name to avoid the law. It's a small town in a small county, they know who I am and they know I'm a delinquent.

Soooo..... how can I change my name from a masculine one to a decidedly neutral one, without mentioning gender or making it seem like I'm on the run from the law? What would constitute a ""legitimate reason"" that is likely to stand up in court against a highly-conservative judge?

phoenixfire777,asktransgender,I need help,"This may be kind of long so i apologize in advance. I've had a very tough year. When i started transitioning over a year ago i really thought i'd found the source of my depression. I was living with who i thought was a really good friend before she bailed on me, leaving me with two right wing trump supporters. I was forced to move back in with my emotionally abusive father. 
     I've been here for almost a year and realized that i really in fact have severe depression. I eventually went on medical leave in late october and began seeking out thetapy. The entire time I've been in his house has been a nightmare for me. It's a small place with just one bedroom which is his of course. I've been sleeping on a very uncomfortable couch in the living room with no privacy at all. And there's so much more.
      My mother killed herself almost nine yeats ago leaving me alone with my dad and brother, who have always been very close. They're both also fairly right wing; i pretty grew up listening to them make fun of gays and trans people, which became more frightening to me as i began realizing that i was trans. Oddly enough, my dad was rather accepting of that. 
      He'd always treated my depression like im being whiny and selfish (his words exactly). Over the last several years I've become increasly suicidal, especially given that i dont really have any family and only a couple friends. I have a very bad addiction to cutting which increased to such a point that i nearly died on thanksgiving. I've been so open with him, but i only ever hear the same thing he's been saying forever. Living my entire life hearing that i'm wrong about everything and being told that going through what i have is because god has a plan for me. I'm not religious, which he knows. 
        I want to go into detail because i know im not doing this story justice, but i'd be here for a while. My question of help is how can i find a place to live? Im due to go back to work and im getting a nice tax return back, but i still need time to save and i dont think i can wait around anymore. I want very very badly to end my life and i don't know if i can fight it much longer given what I've done to work on it. 
      How do i find a place and find a room mate that i know will at least be good about me being trans. This world is so terrifying as it is and I'm tired of being afraid. If you made it this far, thank you."

TrashcanThoughts,asktransgender,I just came out to my mom... and now I'm even more confused.,"Just a few hours ago I told my mom that I'm trans. I already regret doing it.

The thing is, she's supportive and everything, but now I'm feeling paranoid that maybe I'm just making all of this up in my head. That maybe I'm rushing things and I don't *actually* want to be a woman after all. ...I would be so deeply ashamed and embarrassed if that were true, now that I've told her and my closest friends.

She talked more than I did. She kept rambling, saying how I'm an actor and a college student, and this is a big time for self-discovery and whatever. She only said a few things that really left a nasty feeling in my stomach: **a)** how unhealthy HRT would be (I knew she was going to say that); **b)** to avoid doing anything physical to my body that would be irreversible; and worst of all, **c)** that most men who take hormones don’t end up really looking female – that your hormones and your body don't make you a woman. I felt a bit invalidated by those things, but otherwise, she was supportive.

Before I talked to her, I was about 80%-90% sure of myself, and now I'm only 60%-70% sure. Maybe less. It's not even her fault, necessarily. I'm probably just very insecure. I just feel like a total sack of shit. I can't tell what I feel anymore. I hate this so much. I just want a booming voice from the heavens to tell me what I am.

_Amoeva,asktransgender,Help me to create a point&amp;click game about dysphoria !,"*TL;DR : I make a quick point &amp; click game to play in your navigator, about dysphoria, and if you want you can give me some ideas of things / situations that I could integrate in the game*

Hi there,

I'm currently in a brainstorming phase about the creation of a quick video game. The subject is to explain what dysphoria is to cis people, and baby trans who don't know how to deal with it.

The pitch is to try to make choices in front of situation to try to not explode. You have a ""dysphoria bar"" like a ""HP bar"". I don't know for now what will do this bar when it will hit 100% or 0%. Your character could have suicidal thought when it's too high, but I don't know if it's a very positive way to introduce the concept.

My main inspiration is a little game called ""Robin"", which is about Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. More infos here : http://gamejolt.com/games/robin/173478

The game will be a point &amp; click game on browser, very simple, like static illustrations and little choices to make by clicking on part of the screens. The game experience will be no longer than 5-6mn of play. For your information I'm a illustrator and I have some skills on web development.

For now I know that my character is called Louise (I love that french name), a young transwoman who just came to understand what she is few days ago, and need to deal with her highschool life. 

I thought some interactions I could integrate, like avoiding mirrors, or try to never speak because of voice dysphoria, for example. It's hard to tell what could be interesting to play and learn for cis people. Maybe you can help me ?"

I cannot speak from experience as a trans person, as I'm not one, but I feel that from my experience of discovering my sexuality (I'm a lesbian) I found that although I didn't like when people said ""you're too young to know if you're gay"" I wasn't too keen on being told ""you're gay"" either.

Silverriolu295,asktransgender,School is back in next week and I feel so far in the closet,"I guess this is more of a rant than a question...

So background info: I'm in High School, MTF, and I'm out to my family. I'm also out to all of my friends. Pre everything.


So yeah I'm out to my family and they more or less accept me as trans. But the thing is it seems that me and my mom are kinda both ignoring it. When I told her I want to go by a different name (birth name is gender neutral but I hate it) she got angry because she was so sentimental about the fact that she named me. 

That was back in early November. I was under the impression that social transition at school was happening in January when the new semester started. But we haven't mentioned anything about being trans since that awful argument. I'm always scared to bring it up because every single time it just ends in me feeling terrible because of my mom. 

She keeps treating me like a cis boy and it just feels like a punch to the stomach every time I hear her use male pronouns. I'm scared to say anything because even if we had a great conversation, she is super busy right now and my transition would be put on the side like it already was. 

It always follows this cycle. I break down and finally talk to my mom, we talk, she says a bunch of unintentionally hurtful stuff, either we argue or it ends sort of okay, talk about progressing transition for a few days, then nothing. Repeat and repeat and repeat.

Dysphoria has killed lots of my motivation to work on stuff I love like art and just makes me feel so shitty. I had school today (don't know why they made the first day back on a Friday) and all of the friends I made last semester who I love and they support me and really just make me feel happy are in different classes. Entirely new teachers, entirety new people in my classes, dysphoria constantly hanging over my head, I'm just so broken. I just go to school, hide it for 8 hours then shut myself off from others and waste time on Reddit until I go to sleep.

I'm just so sick of all of this. having to present as male, having to hide my dysphoria, possibly loosing my friends for a long time again I'm just so tired. Everything is weighing down on me and I just can't take it. I don't know what to do. "

thePhoebeStone,asktransgender,Bullying &amp; suicide statistics vs. trans suicides.,"Trying to do some homework for a long needed update to my blog [EndTransHate.wordpress.com] and noticed an interesting coincidence maybe someone can find some more info on. I am bringing this up because I notice a lot of people who are against trans rights using the statistics of trans suicides to fuel their dislike of our medical treatments. Their argument is that because the rate is so high (41%), that transitioning doesn't work as an effective treatment for Gender Dysphoria. I decided to look into it more...

According to a Yale study kids who are bullied are ""reported that bullying victims were two to nine times more likely to report suicidal thoughts than other children were"" (http://news.yale.edu/2008/07/16/bullying-suicide-link-explored-new-study-researchers-yale). With ""16% of students reported seriously considering suicide, 13% reported creating a plan, and 8% reporting trying to take their own life"" according to the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/suicide/youth_suicide.html), this means that roughly taking averages [(2 x 16)(9 x 16)/2 ""considering"", and (2 x 8)(9 x 8)/2 ""attempted""] 88% of children BULLIED have considered suicide, and 44% attempted to take their lives.

Basically, in my mind there is a link between these things that I am trying to correlate with actual information, and I would love to hear your opinions, any insights, or even better some critical analysis of relating the two things."

Malloryisaboyname,asktransgender,How do you deal with the waiting?,"The last three and a half years the waiting hasn't been terrible, because I knew there wasn't anything I could do. There were a couple bad nights, but for the most part I didn't spend all my time consumed by thoughts of gender.

But now that the ball is rolling, I am. I faxed my forms to an informed consent on Thursday, and should be able to schedule an appointment tomorrow or Wednesday, and ai have spent this whole time thinking almost every second of the day about my gender. Part of it was doubt, like ""wait I know I've been sure for years but am I really sure?"" part of it was fear, lime ""what if even though it's informed consent the doctor doesn't believe me and makes me see a therapist which I can't do?"" But a lot of it was just fantasizing. Fantasizing about the day I finally look in the mirror and see a guy. Going out in public and consistently being gendered male. Fantasizing about showing up at band camp in August and my section, who have been so supportive of me, finally seeing a guy. 

And there's so much more waiting. Once I get an appointment I have to actually wait for it to happen. The peoe I've talked to who have seen the doctor both got their script the first visit, and the doctor himself said that's always his goal, but I might have to wait for bloodwork. Then there's waiting for it to, you know, actually work.

I know it'll be a little better when I go back to school, but I also know I am 100% capable of wasting entire class periods and even entire evenings I should be working on homework instead fantasizing, or doodling myself as a guy, or over and over again calculating the possible cost of different surgeries and researching doctors and planning out trips down to hotels and shit.

I can't do this. How do I calm my heart? How do I wait without being consumed?"
MeanderingMage,asktransgender,I had GRS with Dr. Rumer two weeks ago. Insurance paid for everything. AMA,"Hey folks. I was a user on here when I was just starting out transitioning. It really helped me out, figured I should pay it forward.

I had GRS (vaginoplasty) on 12/27/16 with Dr Kathy Rumer in Philadelphia. My insurance paid for everything except the trip and one of the nights of my hotel stay. After 2 weeks I feel well enough and confident enough to answer questions!

My transition has been trying, but possibly easier than most. I have had everything else done legally, so feel free to ask about that too!

So folks: ASK ME ANYTHING!"
HylicismIsReigning,asktransgender,Hormones killed my emotions (mtf),"Ive kept forgetting to take my hormones (oral) the past few days, and i think my T levels are back to male norms now, and i woke up this morning feeling...more. I dont know what happens and maybe its a mental block, but when i take hormones, i  lose touch of my feelings, like, almost completely.  

Today i woke up feeling a deep seated fear and anxiety--i dont know why, other than that i have another therapy appointment that im afraid to go to.  Then i realized i forgot to take hormones--again. I feel more focus right now, i feel more driven..maybe im feeling what i had gotten used to from years of having hgh T levels, feeling comfort in knowing.  Its all i know and im afraid of the unknown, maybe.  

I also have been depressed and had anxiety priblems crop up before i came out and went on hormones in the first place, and maybe i destroyed my wmotional availability before starting hormones. But this...this makese doubt that. 

The problem is, i dont want to live as a man, and i like the physical changes from hormones.  But why are my emotions gone when on them :(  

I seriously dont know what to do now. Gonna talk to my therapist about it, but argh.  This sucks this sucks this sucks

I swear to god, im feelingy beard hairs start to grow in evem tho its only been a few days and this is *not what i want*

Cant go down both paths, changes from hormones and emotional availability, i guess.  Maybe im comparing myself to men too much tho.  I just dont know"

whatname2pick,asktransgender,Anybody else know Amazon covers everything,"I started working at Amazon half a year back, and finally decided on transitioning a bit after that. That was when I checked my coverage. I was shocked to discover  

MY INSURANCE COVERS EVERYTHING RELATED TO GID BASICALLY WITHOUT QUESTION.  

-Hair removal  
-top surgery  
-bottom surgery  
-facial surgeries   
-and so much more are covered.    
 The provider is blue cross blue shield, and I was told it's usually easier for transgender patients to be on the standard plan so they can use out of network providers much easier, but I'm on the in network only plan and I get along well enough. The pay may be only slightly above average, but the healthcare savings from things that would be otherwise considered cosmetic can be thousands a year. The only thing is you will have to talk to most providers billing agents because this concept of coverage on things ""cosmetic"" can be so new and confusing

ThrowawayR101,asktransgender,"Did anyone else share there doubt about being transgender or transitioning with a family member or a friend or someone close to you or anyone like this, and now they think that you shouldn't transition or that you'll regret it, etc.","I told one VERY close family member that I had doubts and fears about things such as if I was actually a transgender woman, if I should transition and I even said things like ""what if i regret transitioning"" to them, and now they seem to think that I shouldn't transition at all.

They also seem to do this thing where they say things like ""well I know you won't regret transitioning"", but they say it in a not so convincing way..... it's like they are humouring me. I genuinely think that they think that I shouldn't transition. They also saw a programme on TV about people who apparently regretted transitioning and they were telling me about it and the way they were explaining it, they should've just come out and said ""look, you shouldn't do this. I think what I saw on that programme is true.""

This person also has a tendency to hold people to things. For example, if I transition (which I more then likely will) there are a few surgeries i want to get, and I honestly think that they will be thinking in there mind ""how long until she comes to me anf says she regrets this all"".

I live with this person too and I don't like this as all. I have even said that some people go on HRT and then come off it because they figure out they are not transgender and I think this is what they think will happen to me, and I also think they think that I am mentally ill or confused. I have told them that going on and then coming off HRT is incredibly rare and I said this is all a journey of self discovery.

I'll tell you something, when I came out as a transgender woman, I had doubts. I literally would look up common ""signs and symptoms"" of gender dysphoria and tell this person that I had always hated my penis, didn't want to touch it or anything just so that they would believe me, but I think they think I was putting this all on, which I was.

I used to also get told that I was mentally ill and that I needed to be put in a straight jacket, and because of this I would literally say to this person that ""when we go and see the gender therapist, you need to tell them I have always showed signs of being a transgender woman"". I would even ask people on Yahoo Answers questions like, ""what questions will I be asked in gender therapy"" and I would rehearse or what I was going to say to them.

What does this all sound like to you?"
Coinsonmythrowaway,asktransgender,I have a rare and unpopular inquiry: how to come out as wanting to de-transition?,"I'm 18, transgender (ftm), and i experience dysphoria. I have been out for 2~ years. My family calls me he/him and i do my absolute best to pass without hormones. 

I'm supposed to be starting hormones in a month and I'm swinging from ecstatic to horrifically doubtful. These feelings are keeping me up at night.

Above all else, i am TERRIFIED to transition. I think i want to keep living as a girl because hormones are a scary lifelong commitment. I want to fool myself into being okay as a woman.

It is beyond difficult to put all my thoughts down so my apologies if this doesn't make much sense. I know of some trans people who came out, started medically transitioning, stopped, and started again for a few months. If you have any experience with these things, please tell me. I'm hurting so much and feel really sick to my stomach from all the stress :(

Long story short: i'm so scared to physically and socially transition that i'm willing to live with my dysphoria and live life as a girl. I'm out to only a few people (my mom, dad, sister, brother) and i'm embarrassed and scared to tell them i'm considering ""being a girl"" again. I don't want them to think my desire to transition was a phase because it wasn't a phase; it's just something i'm too scared to do anything about"

ace-murdock,asktransgender,Pilot's license question,"Hey there, 
  
   I'm a student pilot pursuing my private pilot's license in the US. I'm currently on track to get my license in the early summer, although I'm waiting on a special issuance medical from the FAA due to being on an ssri for anxiety. 

  
  I'm also hoping to get on hormones soon (ftm) but I'm wondering if I should wait until after I get my license? Will doing that invalidate my third class medical and make me go through the whole process again? I've read the FAA's statement on it but it only tells you what to do when going in to get your medical, so I don't know what would happen if I already had one. 

Thanks! "

Call_me_Cassius,asktransgender,How did your bloodwork show up on your bill?,"(xpost /r/ftm) 

I need to get bloodwork done for my 3-month checkup, and I reeeeally want to use insurance for it. I'm on my dad's insurance, and it's a stupid high deductible plan that sucks. It covers pretty much everything, but the individual deductible is like $6,000, so I'm not gonna be able to use actual insurance to pay for it. But the other part of it is my dad setting aside some amount of money and we all get ""debit cards"" that we can use to charge medical costs to the account that my dad set aside. IDK, it's a stupid system.

So I'd like to use the card to pay for my bloodwork. I'm out to my dad, and he kinda knows I'm transitioning? Neither of my parents will talk to me about it. Like they're not explicitly unsupportive, but if I try to bring it up they just don't respond. But they keep saying things about my ""*medicine"" with sort of a look, so I think they get it. But I'd prefer to not be too overt with it.

So I want to just say that I'm seeing a doctor and he's ordering some bloodwork. But will it specifically bill as a T test (and whatever else I end up having to get)? If it does, is there a way to get it to *not* specifically say anything about testosterone?"
toodledootdoot,asktransgender,"I'm finally starting to make real progress, but I'm not happy, just really tired and fed up with the system.","I feel like I've been fighting against everything in my life lately, I am making progress towards transitioning, but I've had to practically beg for the few things I've gotten.  I've come out to so many people, and they've all been accepting, but there are still so many more people I need to talk to / answer the same old questions for.  I'm sick of this state, but I can't move, and I'm tired listening to bigots pretend to be accepting of LGBT people.

The shitty thing is I'm not even remotely close to being done fighting, and I don't know if I'll ever be done, but I'm just so done with everything.  The cherry on top is that I can't stop, I'm stuck fighting because giving up the few centimeters I've advanced would be even worse than struggling forever.

amon_erin,asktransgender,So what? A question for those who used HRT as a litmus test (or not).,"So I'm roughly 4 months into HRT. I'm starting to normalize, despite my E levels being apparently low (whatever). Physical changes are great, aside from the 60ish pounds I've now put on. I'm disgusting.

I guess I thought that by now I would have had this straightened out, or at least closer to doing so.  I'm just a couple weeks shy of being on this path for a year. I'm no more sure of myself now than I was then. My therapist says it's okay to not know where my puzzle piece fits in the puzzle. I guess I'm okay with that, but I really don't want it to fit into the male slot. I keep on taking my HRT meds with the hope that one day I'm going to have this finally click. It just doesn't feel like that will ever happen. Maybe I identified as male for too long to ever have a shot at moving past that. I mean, wouldn't a cis guy just be fine with saying ""Well, I'm clearly not trans"" and be happy going back. I am, of course, assuming that they even went through a process of questioning and made it to HRT.

I've been quiet on here lately for multiple reasons, but this is really bugging me. I guess what my question is, if you weren't completely sure that you were trans before HRT, at what point (if ever) did it finally click for you that you were?"
rulenumberten,asktransgender,"Is there anyone here that never went through transition?

Although I am sexually fluid, I'm not sure I can commit to a romantic relationship with a woman. I love them very much and I'm trying very hard to accept it, but I'm having major difficulties. I've told them that maybe we should end the relationship so they could find a better fitting partner, but that conversation did not go well. I know I will lose them if I can't accept the possibility of them transitioning, but I don't want to lose them. Unfortunately, they only want me in their lives as a romantic partner so friendship is not an option. I guess is there any possibility they will be happy not transitioning? Again, my partner insists they will not. I'm trying my best to not pigeon hole them. I have often told them that I will support them.

34534gr,asktransgender,I don't feel worthy of being female,"I guess...

I feel like a massive fraud, sometimes. I'm not out to anyone but close friends and family and I'm not presenting as full time yet. I feel like I guess I could have a good life as a man, but it'd be restricted. I don't know how to describe how I feel so well, but I feel like my life could be much better as a woman. When I see women on the street I feel a mix of envy and profound longing.

I feel gender dysphoria in the same way I guess I'd react to a black hole pulling me in: it gets worse the closer I consider to making the ""jump"" and transitioning. I can live with my facial hair for now, I think because I have such a poor image of myself in my head, but once I've let down my hair, shaved and put on a nice dress I feel *SO MUCH BETTER* about myself.

And yet... I also feel like a fraud still. My parents aren't quite with it. They're not angry or gonna throw me out, but they've made it clear they think I'm making a mistake. My attempts to talk with them (I hate conflict anyway) end up being exhaustingly blunt.

* ""But you never played with girls toys when you were younger""
* ""But you don't have any female mannerisms""
* ""But dressing in women's clothes doesn't mean you have to be a woman""
* ""I saw a tv show which said that having transgender feelings is related to autism. I know you're autistic so maybe you've just latched onto this?""

I guess they just want the best from me and want to keep me safe. In their eyes this might be another mistake of mine. I've made some in the past, and my father has (gently) said that I need his guidance on big decisions. But... I can't describe the feelings I have to them. And I *hate* the feeling that someone knows me better than I know myself.

I'm going to specialist counseling now just to try and find a way of talking to them, not even to deal with my dysphoria.

And even beyond that... I can look in a mirror when I'm dressed up and feel great, but when I look back on the pictures I've taken of myself then and compare them to ciswomen, I feel like I'm another species. I just don't see many ciswomen who look like me (I am 194cm tall I guess). How could I ever fit in?"

(I am 16, MTF)


* Does dysphoria go up and down, perhaps if you think you are starting to accept yourself as trans, your mind feels like it needs to severely back track and re-access everything and every little point letting denial seep in?

* I accept that Reddit isn't a replacement for a therapist but that is a problem as being 16, I cannot go to anyone without my parents knowing, I am not afraid of them being transphobic or anything, I am scared that I cannot say ""I've always felt this way, it's not a change, it's my TRUE gender"" to myself and definitely not my parents due to the fact I can barely remember any signs or really ANYTHING of my early childhood and I feel like I'd be lying to myself. Even if I say something casual like ""I need to see a therapist"" to them, I FEEL like they would severely doubt it or say something that would translate to ""Baby's first phase"" or something like that, but that could just be paranoia. Does this mean anything deal breaking?"

Marla__,asktransgender,[Re-Post] How do i talk to my mom?,"I really, REALLY want to start hormones. My body is practically begging me for them at this point.

However, just because she knows doesnt mean anything has changed between us. She still treats me like her ""son"" and im too scared to say anything about it. I have incredibly bad anxiety and it isnt helping me as far as this goes.
Have any of you guys gone through the same troubles? If so, how did you deal with them?

cantaloupemelon,asktransgender,Am I the only one who doesn't feel isolated by talks of periods or genital related health?," afab trans folks should feel welcome respond to how they relate to this too cause I don't hear much about that outside lurking /r/ftm and would like to hear your thoughts and experiences because you're in a unique position that can provide valuable perspective on this.

I've read a lot about how some trans fem folks or allies have negative reactions when women's(?) spaces center or discuss items related to general afab reproductive health. What's the deal?

Certainly for me, any talk about genitals brings up complex feelings. But, when I hear cis women talk about their bodies and especially the negative experience of feeling othered or neglected in healthcare, it's something I can relate to. 

I also know what it's like to feel excluded and like aspects of cis women are sometimes essentialized, but I'd guess sometimes that isnt the case.

RoyalLlama,asktransgender,"Since fall of 2015, I've been super confident in my gender. But now, I'm a confused goddamn mess. Help please!","I came out in October of 2015, after having spent a good part of the year dealing with a miserable level of dysphoria and finally figuring out what it was. From then till current day, I've been publically out, going by James, and using male pronouns.

The last fifteen or so months, I've been very very secure in the fact that I wanted to be a *very* fem guy, despite the fact that many people (even some trans ones) think that's pretty fucking dumb. I knew that I wanted to be viewed as male, even if I looked frilly and pretty.

The past week or two, though, I'm not feeling that at all. Male doesn't feel right either, it just feels less wrong than female. I've not ever had more than a day or so of gender uncertainty before, and it wasn't like this (Like, I used to think 'am I really not manly enough?' but this feeling is more like 'am I a man cause that feels weird now'). After a lot of thinking and talking to another friend who went through similar shit a few years back, I'm almost positive I'm nonbinary.

I don't even know how to fucking begin dealing with this. For the most part, I probably won't even bother re-coming-out to most people. But I will need to explain it to my family, and I don't know how. I wanted to get my name changed this summer, but now I have to start from scratch finding a name. I have literally nothing to work off--my birth name was super fem, and I actually really like James, but it's a super male name, and I'm not about to become Jamie.

I don't really want to have to explain the clusterfuckery of being nonbinary to my parents, at least not my dad. I actually explained it to my mom once talking about one of my friends and she seemed to mostly get it, but my dad is *so happy* to have a son. He especially loves that I'm James, because he can call me Jim and 'feel like he's in Star Trek'. And they still haven't gotten used to my current pronouns, so changing them again would suck donkey dick.

I don't even know where to begin trying to deal with all this. The only thing I have in mind--I may keep James as a middle name, since I really do like it as a name, and I plan to change my gender marker to male (it's not quite how I feel anymore but it'd be way worse for all my forms to still say female, y'know?). Do any of you guys have some advice on how to sort this shit out, or where to start, or really fucking anything for that matter? I'd really appreciate it."

Duckreas,asktransgender,is this gender dysphoria or just general depression?,"To start from the beginning, I've always loved to feel feminine, in most ways possible, but i've also been super shy and very good at masking my emotions from people. therefore, nobody knew about my desire to be feminine. 

But lately I got a new friend that i can trust with everything and she helped me a lot to open up and start telling some of my closest friends, which i feel great about!

But telling people haven't only brought me happiness, even though so far everyone is really supportive about it. i have also started getting waves of depression that only gets worse, and i'm starting to doubt and second guess everything, up to the point of some slight suicidal thought (i would never go through with such stuff, i love my friends too much). 

My question is though, are these kinds of depressive thoughts what i've heard is gender dysphoria? or is this just classed as a depression? how do i deal with this? is it normal?

SailorEmma,asktransgender,Is it true that not masturbating increases testosterone levels?

JustCallMeClaire,asktransgender,Do you care if you get clocked?,"I met a transwoman in my therapist's support group meeting (let's just call her ""J""), and she has an interesting point of view.  Anytime J is dressed as her true self, she assumes everyone is clocking her.  Instead of being afraid, she owns it. J said, ""I love being trans.  It's who I am.""

I found her 'default setting' of 'everyone knows' rather novel &amp; refreshing.  I have never thought about viewing my life this way.  The few times I've been me out of the house, I have been terrified!  The thoughts that run through my head!  ""Don't make eye contact with that man.  Did that woman just look at me weird?  Omg that person knows.  What am I doing?  I am a fraud.""  I seem so worried about trying to pass, that I do not enjoy being me out in the real world.  It's so stressful.

Instead of starting from a position of fear, J is starting from a position of strength &amp; courage.  She's trans, and she fully expects everyone to see that.  When she passes, she's happy, but she's not defining her happiness by passing.

This idea of not defining happiness by passing made me think of all of you.  Does anyone else have this viewpoint, that you don't care if you get clocked?  How did you get to the point of true self acceptance that getting clocked doesn't matter? For me, this is my current hurdle; I know I don't pass, and I need to get to a point where I can just be me, regardless of how I look.  

I am really interested to know your stories of how you overcame your fears to be you in the real world.

Laika_Come_Home,asktransgender,"When it comes to trans people, I feel like there's this club I can't join.","I'm still figuring out my identity. Or I'm in the closet or something. I don't know. 

But when it comes to other trans women, I don't feel like I fit in, and/or I'm treated with mistrust because of how I present (cis). At support groups, I feel like I don't fit it. Online, with trans groups or etc. I don't feel like I fit in.

I never feel like I fit in because of where I am, and I feel like I'm not only not trusted, but actively avoided.

It's like I'm not welcome to the club.

Is this common, I guess? Do I have to start presenting as female to get accepted?"
amabtrans,asktransgender,"I think I might not actually have gender dysphoria, but something else","Well for the past couple of months I've been thinking I have gender dysphoria or maybe something else.



I don't exactly care about being seen as male or female. I'm not motivated to transition. If there was a way to instantly transition I would do it, but there isn't.


I would rather of been born female, but only because I would of been made to grow up as a girl rather than a boy and wouldn't have any of these doubts.


I only feel like this when I am alone. When I'm alone I think ""how much better would if be if I'd go into college tomorrow as a girl"" but then I go in as male, and I think ""Oh, this is fine, what am I complaining about"". 



Nearly all of these feelings are triggered by clothes, rather than my body or anything. I'd say 65% clothes, 25% about being AMAB and not AFAB, and 15% for being seen male and not female.  If I see someone who is female (and mainly attractive) in a dress, wearing makeup, etc it can trigger these thoughts, but otherwise it doesn't really trigger them.



When I discovered about gender dysphoria, I started having these feelings. Before I noticed the differences between men and women a lot more than most people, back when I was 13 I'd see girls wearing the female uniform and think how I really wanted to wear them. I wanted to be born female, but it didn't bother me at all. I didn't even question it, I was born male and that was that. 


When puberty started, growing up into a man seemed exciting. Growing hair, looking masculine, maybe even be more attractive to girls. I liked it when I started growing facial hair. But now I'm 17, I'm growing chest hair and it bothers me a bit.



Is there anything that is similar to gender dysphoria, because I'm not sure what I am. I think I'm pushing myself to be trans, when in reality I might just be a crossdresser, I don't know.

idk-throwaway7,asktransgender,Questions about camming for any trans people who do it.,"So transition is expensive and part of me is thinking about trying to start camming as a way to make some extra money on the side. Is there anyone here that does that? I have some questions if you do:

1) what sites do you do it on?
2) how do you build an audience?
3) has it affected you in your daily life? (Like have people recognised you?)
4) how can you make sure people don't completely disrespect you as people seem to do when it comes to trans girls and sex (as I've learned from experience)
5) if I wanted to have a side project which would involve having a large social media presence (such as a YouTuber) would having done cam work make it harder to be treated well (and not like a sex object) in that space?
6) how can you protect your identity and make sure people don't find out who you are?
7) how much money can you realistically make from it, is it even worth trying to do? Or would I be better off finding a sugar daddy or something lol (but if that is a better idea how do you do that)
8) can only ever doing solo things be fine? I've never had actual sex with someone else, and I'm not sure how comfortable I am with doing that for the time being.

Sorry for all the questions, and if there's a better place to ask it please send me in the right direction."
cjsnow1,asktransgender,Transition: Doubts or confirmation bias to begin with?,"As a disclaimer, I realize that most here are likely not highly educated in Psychological Analysis. I'm simply looking for advice from people who may or may not be in the same position

I’ve been having doubts about my gender identity since I was ~19 or 20, a good 3 to 4 months before Caitlyn Jenner or anything regarding transgender topics was as big a blip on the cultural radar as it was before she came out.

I first identified as Transfeminine and now have downgraded to Genderqueer. I was on Estrogen and Testosterone Blockers from December 2015 to March 2016, but had to put the HRT on hold due to monetary constraints and loss of insurance.

Since the beginning of my identity journey, I’ve been trying to figure out whether or not my motives aren’t just a form of confirmation bias brought on by, among other things, what I may simply be compartmentalising based on what seem to be similar experiences from my adolescence in relation to threads and posts I've come across here over the last couple of years...

I made it clear to a therapist (not a gender therapist specifically) that I wanted to go into this as rationally as possible so as to make the best educated decision I can when I started seeing her a few months prior to going to an IC Clinic to see how I would like Estrogen.

In regards to the effects of said decision, for the three months I was on HRT, I loved not having random unwanted erections and also loved the bit of breast growth I received from the wonderful hormonal magic happening inside me.

In June, I realized that, from what I can remember at least, I may have begun questioning due to sexual inadequacies and lack of fulfillment in that area of my life.

I’d like to go back to Therapy in order to receive further counseling to help figure myself out. As soon as I’m able to fund it, I’ll do so, but until then, I keep going in circles when I don’t keep myself busy with work or making music or ingesting other types of media or having stimulating human conversations.

My question is this: What would you all recommend I do to help alleviate my anxiety and doubts whilst I am financially unable to seek therapy?"

Findingmyhopetoo,asktransgender,Does this sound familiar.,"I have been transitioning rurally in northern BC which is in the western part of Canada. Besides the online community my transition has largely been done alone or without a lot of local peers who are transitioning or have transitioned. I am one of two openly Transgender people in my community.

I'm not a shy girl. I'm bold and as I've mentioned in this /r before I'm a laugh riot so I went out quite a few times to different social and family functions.

Quite often I am the first and only openly transgender person people have met. So explaining my existence has become part of the routine for me which I know I am under obligation to however I'm #patienttrans so I gracefully get through it.

I don't fit CiSgender women stereo types. I rock a shaved head, I sing in a baritone, I have an athletic build and a graceful and poised woman I remain. I stand out and I don't really give a damn. I'm passing wonderfully as Hope Vaughn Warren �� 

A very common thread amongst the new people I meet however seems to be their misunderstanding between identity and orientation. About a billion times this festive season when I told some one I was transgender, their first response was.....

""Oh your gay? I have (or know) a gay cousin(or the likes)""


Having not disclosed my sexual orientation to them I would patiently (cause I'm #patienttrans) ask them why they thought I was gay and then begin to break down the difference between who I go to bed ""as"" and who I go to bed ""with""

Not having a lot of Trans peers to talk to here, I was wondering if this was normal for others who are transitioning/transitioned as well?

Thoughts?

[deleted],asktransgender,These feelings are killing me [Text Wall],"Hi,

I'm not really sure if I belong here or not and I'm just having a really difficult time trying to understand what I'm going through. For the past 5 years or so I have been having these fits of extreme discomfort with myself. For like a week in private I will dress like a girl and shave my entire body and express myself in ways that I'm sorry to say make me feel really ashamed. And for awhile I'm so convinced that this is who I am that I'm preparing to come to terms with it and then all of a sudden just like in the blink of an eye I wake up the next day and I want to dress like a boy and I want my hair back and I grow out my facial hair. For a long time I would take all the female clothes I had and throw them all away and change all my shit from music and wallpapers and everything. I would get really angry with myself and promise to never do it again. 

This kept happening over and over and over and I was spending so much money and throwing the clothes away and the bracelets and all kinds of hair bands and things. Well now I don't throw them away I just pack them up and hide them away in the closet and I still keep going through this phase over and over again. But now I know I can't stick with either so I just keep switching back and forth and trying not to pressure myself one way or the other and I'm just so exhausted. Everytime I feel really manly I don't understand what I was thinking before and then all of a sudden overwhelmingly one day I just have this uncontrollable urge to change again. I try so hard to fight it but it's just so strong and I can't help it.

And it's the exact same the other way. I tell myself okay this is who I am? fine. I can do this. So I try to stay in girls stuff and all of a sudden one day I get the overwhelming urge to get rid of everything and change back. 

I don't think I'm transgender and I'm sorry if this is not the right place to post this, I just don't know what to do anymore and I feel so unhappy and confused. I don't care anymore if it's male or female or whatever I just want to stay one way and stop having these conflicting feelings. I honestly feel like I have split personalities or something, only I'm the same person both times I just want to do different things. 

I read these posts from you guys talking about having issues with stuff like this your entire lives. I didn't. I always had anxiety and mental problems but besides for liking pretty things and being a bit emotional for a boy I never had this issue as a child. It's all just came up in my early adult years. I'm just so alone and confused and I can't talk about this with anyone. Honestly, sometimes I just want to give up."
atransredditor,asktransgender,Acceptable hormone levels?,"I take 4mg estradiol twice daily by swallowing (they specifically said don't do sublingual). My labs come back about 100pg/ml when tested five hours after dosing. My doctor is happy with this, I feel it's low.

If sublingual is generally considered about twice as effective, in theory I could just take my pills sublingual and be very close too much more acceptable levels? 

I was thinking a couple weeks before my next tests I can stop sublingual and go back to swallowing, then resume again.  I hate to play games but my previous doctor would only prescribe 4mg daily sublingual ( which resulted in 75pg/ml )and I don't want to mess it up with this one.

I have also thought about just continuing to take sublingual and get my next test in the AM before I take the morning dose, but then worried about getting lowered dose again. "
[deleted],asktransgender,I love the shit outta my family.,"Hi all. I been on this board in some capacity for the past 3.5(ish) years. I felt like offering a view point that is not often seen on this sub. I fucking love my family. Now before you, dear reader, go thinking that my parents/siblings have been completely for 1000% supportive of my transitiong since day one I can assure you that is absolutely not the case. I fought them tooth and nail to be  acknowledged for who I am. It was a shit process if I am being honest. A lot of terrible mean things were said by both sides. Personally I said things that in hindsight I must admit I am incredibly ashamed of. My family is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. Sure my mom cried when I came out to her. My dad thought I was some sort of sexual deviant when I told him. My siblings flat out refused to accept my female-ness when I was just starting. But they all said they still loved me no matter what. What a bitter pill to swallow at the moment that was. It seemed like a half assed attempt to grant themselves clemency in the moment regarding my girl-ness. But that was two years ago. Through all the tears and anger I stayed with them. They were cruel to me in glaring ways. But I decided that having them in my life was worth everything. I often came to this sub to complain about our various fights. The overall message I got was ""why are you even still talking to them?"" I see this same sentiment echoed almost every day. I want to offer a suggestion for those who are just coming out. Take the time to tend to these relationships. Good things take time but it they are worth having they will pay off. I don't pretend to know exactly where you are in your journey but I hope you take the time to cultivate the 'ships that you have by blood. Show them patience and understanding if you can. If something is worth keeping it will meet maitenenve. Look past the misgendering and the deadnaming if you can and see the human attempting to relate if you can. Good things take time and effort to cultivate. Have patience. Just my $0.02."

I wanna ask: how long until my T levels are back at normal? 
Nice things like a much less greasy face and hair are a thing that I love, but with T I had to wash my hair every day, my face was very greasy...
So basically i'm asking in general: is 1 month without my pills enough to go back to the horrible normal T levels and every thing I enjoy of my body just vanishes? 
Should I keep buying them pills? Or at least spiro? Nothing at all?

What I want to do is get a car (used), but that'd hurt my finances for transitioning. I'd have to give up either HRT or Electrolysis (but probably not both).

It's also worth noting that the only electrolysis place near here is in the same city as where I'd get HRT (and there's no guarantee that they're trans-friendly), and the place I want to go for Grad School has a lot more electrolysis places (and trans resources) around."

I've been pretty familiar with what I've had to do for a while (even though they don't list the instructions on [their website](www.mva.maryland.gov/) ). I have my letter from my therapist, and doctor, and me.

AlikiVougiouklaki,asktransgender,~97% of people are satisfied with HRT. How can we explain this mind-blowing statistic?,"I'm considering starting HRT MtF. I'm full of doubts and fears.

One report states that [97%](http://www.transstudent.org/Affirming_Gender.pdf) of people are satisfied with hormone therapy after 5+ years. Many other studies report high satisfaction and low regret rates.

These statistics are very encouraging for me. Of course some people regret transitioning because of the social cost involved, or because they're actually nonbinary—but *97% of people* are satisfied.

HRT changes your secondary sexual characteristics *a lot* over time. How can this impactful process be so satisfying, almost every time? Don't confused cis people ever take HRT?

Everything else still tastes the same, and other than a little less of a sweet tooth, I still like the same foods. I thought maybe it was just a temporary thing, but I guess not. It's not a huge deal though, just kinda curious what's caused it. Anyone else experienced anything like this?"

What I mean is, I have felt I was transgender since a relatively young age.  Since then I have been consumed by the idea of transitioning to the point that it is obssesive.  Once I turned 13 it started to become a sexual obsession and it still is sometimes.  I like to crossdress but it always leaves me feeling empty.  I have only ever done it in private.

Im pretty scared of the idea of socially transitioning.  I feel like having physical changes from HRT would turn me into a social recluse.  Im already pretty reclusive as it is...

In spite of these fears, I still have a strong desire to start HRT.  At this point I have felt this way for a majority of my life, so its not going away.

I don't know how to proceed when I am terrified to do so.  I know I am somewhere on the transgender spectrum, but I feel like HRT would ruin my stable but lonely life.

I basically want to start HRT and stay in boy mode indefinitely but this is not possible.  I wish I didnt have to choose one or the other.

Since shortly after last Thanksgiving, I've been fairly certain that I am transgender (MtF). My problem is that I am so ridiculously uncertain about it. Over the years I have definitely had instances of gender dysphoria (or at least I think it was). I've crossdressed, and wished I was a woman, but mostly dismissed it as a fetish. A lot of my doubt around this issue comes with being raised in a very conservative christian home, so a lot of the teachings about gender are still rattling around in my head. One of the most frustrating things right now is that my dysphoria (or at least what I think is dysphoria) isn't crippling. I'm not suicidal, and I don't especially hate my body, but I'm fairly certain that I would much more enjoy being a woman. But the thing is, knowing my family, the amount of backlash about this decision would be devastating. When one of my friends said that they support transgender people on Facebook, my mom called it unnatural, and when at one point my parents noticed me wearing a bra (I was wearing it to experiment with being more feminine, and I managed to convince her that I was wearing it because I lost a bet to my girlfriend) they said that it was degrading for a guy to wear it. So many things would become so difficult if I decided to pursue this that I'm honestly not sure if it's worth it. My dysphoria's not crippling, so maybe it's just a better idea to stay this way and keep my good relationship with my parents? And on top of this, while I have told my girlfriend about it, and she has completely supported me wonderfully, and even helped me experiment, we are planning on getting married this summer, and I know if I pursue transition, even after marriage, her parents would have an equally bad reaction, and I don't want to ruin her relationship with her parents as well. And there's also the difficulty of the transition process, and just the expense of it as well. I just don't know if it's worth it if my issues with my gender aren't enough to cause me seriously harmful distress, even if I still have a lot of distress about it. Can anyone help me out with this? Anyone of you all had a similar experience before transitioning, or are going through similar stuff rn?
TL;DR: I'm really goddamn confused about whether or not I'm actually transgender"
Jadetsu,asktransgender,Had a lovely thing happen to me yesterday,"So umm, not really a question but I just wanted to vent this here.

Yesterday I was just grocery shopping w/ my mum and I saw this really cute t-shirt. I told her about it and she asked if I wanted it, I said I don't really need it.

Later she asked if I wanted it and should we go get it. I agreed after a moment. 

She got it for me and it really made my day. I love my mom.

Do any of you have parents like this who know you thoroughly (?) and really want to support u w/ your transition etc?"
Jack_Shine,asktransgender,Does rogaine help at all?,"My doctor is kind of a transphobic asshole, and due to my military status I'm kind of fucked right now by being stuck with him for another year.  The old ""lose all of your fucking hair in half a year"" gene that runs rampant in my family seems to have recently kicked in and I lost almost an inch of hairline in the last two months.

I only have access to rogaine... will it slow anything at all? Or am I just completely and utterly fucked due to the vindications of circumstance and chance genetics?

SadieRippedin2,asktransgender,Just had a talk with my dad about starting hrt,"We had a good long talk, where it became clear to me that while he isn't going to hinder me from transitioning, his support would be minimal at best. Take what you can get, I guess.

The thing that's bugging me, though, is that at the end, I made a joke that I'd have to stop smoking and he commented seriously that he's not sure that he'd rather me stop smoking if that's the trade off.

Now, I'm upset. "
forgetmeinaday,asktransgender,Does this sound like a testosterone spike?,"Hi all. I've been transitioning for 1 1/2 years. I was on 4mg estradiol (swallowed) and 100 mg spiro a day. Around 2 months ago I got bumped up to 6mg estradiol (sublingual) and 200 mg spiro a day.

My libido has skyrocketed. I'm not getting morning wood or random erections, but I've been far more sexually active than I have been since pre-transition. I've been hooking up with friends daily, and yesterday I masturbated thrice in a row.

I've been having really bad anger attacks. For some reason I'll randomly get in a 'pissy' mood, and any little thing will set me off.

After starting HRT my facial acne disappeared entirely, but just this week for the first time in over a year it's been coming back. Not just one spot, but nine different spots have popped up in just a few days. I look hideous, but it hasn't stopped me from slapping on layers of concealer so I can still get my friends to satisfy my insane libido.

It could just be my imagination, but it seems like all the hair growth on my body has been accelerating rapidly. I've gone from shaving once a week to once every three days.

Basically it feels like when I first started male puberty when I was younger, but 100x more powerful.

But what's weird is that ever since these awful symptoms appeared, my boobs have grown SUPER fast. I wear a B cup despite having As that don't fill it, and just in the span of a month I'm nearly filling them out. I can't pick out what it is, but despite the increased hair growth and acne, my entire body is looking more feminine, and passing has become way easier for me.

Does anyone have any idea what this could be? I got blood work done, but it won't be back for another week and it's driving me crazy. I haven't been eating any more meat than I usually do. I haven't missed any doses and I've been taking my pills when I'm supposed to. I have been exercising a lot recently, but I'm not sure if that could be a contributing factor.

PhobicThrowaway12390,asktransgender,Please help me change my view on passing.,"Hi /r/asktransgender. I first want to thank you and the other transgender subreddits for putting a safe space and positive attitude to discuss things like this. Secondly, I'd like to put a warning that this post may contain views that may be offensive or triggering, especially if you're transitioning. I apologize for that, and if that sort of stuff is sensitive to you, please close this thread.

**I am not here to troll or start a flame war. I am fully aware that my view is wrong and I would like help changing it.**

I've been mtf trans-curious for a little over a year now. One of the biggest barriers for me however, is the outwardly physical transition. When I browse photos or subbreddits of people who are transitioning or have transitioned(more specifically mtf), I often see encouraging comments about how people look like they're passing. I think this kind of encouragement is wonderful, yet whenever I look at the photo, almost all of the time to me I feel like I still see the ""male"" characteristics, even if they mostly pass otherwise. This happens in most of the photos I see, even for people who have completed hormone therapy. I can't unsee it and it bothers me so much. No matter how much they pass I can still see parts of it and I can't get past that. What can I do to change this? Thanks for reading and I apologize for a rather negative post but I don't know where else I can ask to CMV. 

Edit: Thanks for the replies everyone. While I can't say I've broken that mindset yet, these responses were very helpful for offering a different perspective. The change in mindset will just be something that I have to work on over time. Thank you."

It was asking if it was my dysphoric arguing or normal relationship argue because it was getting out of hand. Fast foward a semester and it turns out it was HIS dysphoria. 
Seriously what are the odds that his husband turned out to be his wife and my wife turned out to be my husband. Kinda Awesome right? That's a whole other story to get into later.

Okay now here's the issue, I've been on HRT for a year and have changed a lot and am noticeable feminine.  But he's just started and is having a really hard time comparing our Transitionings.  We've talked about that it's not about the comparison and that we are from different backgrounds and it just kind of went well for me. But he's my love and my husband I can see it in his eyes that he's Jealous?
I mean I can help along through his dysphoria and assist through his feelings. It's that I don't know anymore than that, im a girl that pretended to be a boy. I don't know what is actually going to help with His transition.

That's where we are now, I need advise, ideas, experience from others guys that have been there done that, or experience from ladies that know how guys work. 

I love my husband so much and it kinda sucks that my transition makes them feel sucky. I wanna ease that, ease the hurt. So here I am asking for help."
LangMeYourLight,asktransgender,"The worst ""good advice"" that cis people give to trans people.","Most of us have heard some form of this statement at some point.

***""Just dress how you want and don't give a fuck what anyone else thinks.""***  

Typically, this is in response to finding out someone is trans and wishes to transition.  

Though on the surface it sounds good, it almost always carries this implicit meaning:

***""Please don't transition.""***

Many cis people think our problems would be immediately over if we just identified as cis and cross dressed on the weekends.  They do not really know about gender dysphoria.  

Many never stop and think about their own gender identity to understand how deeply rooted such a thing is.  Many would get annoyed if called by the wrong gender, but don't understand that that's how trans people feel about being called their assigned gender.  Many cis people feel sad when they have to lose their breasts and/or penis for medical reasons.  Many cancer survivors with mastectomies report feeling like ""less of a woman.""  But transphobes often don't think that trans people would experience the same distress over not having those organs.

Many people try to go a long way to talk us out of our personal decisions.  

Has anyone else here received similar advice as soon as you came out?"
Loriellea,asktransgender,Should I have taken the max dose hrt?,"I just got back on hrt today (mtf).  My endo asked me if I wanted to go with the minimal dosage for the first month, or just go ahead with the max dosage (double) when I was at normal female hormone levels.  I've been off of hrt for about 3 months now and of course I am currently at normal male levels.  I chose minimal dosage because I felt that was the safe route.  Do you think that was best or is the minimal dosage necessary at this point?  I had no complications and everything went smoothly the very first time.  If I went with max dosage it would have saved me an hour long drive to the endo in the end and one less blood sample.  I've thought about maybe calling and seeing if I can go with the max dosage instead, but I wanted some opinions/advice first."

I can't even go to the store to buy 16+ beer without having 2 cashiers and a manager checking my ID for it's legitimacy.
 
But that has left me wondering, how will I age? Am I at some point just gonna stop looking younger and then age normally like a teenage girl?

gelbkatze,asktransgender,Recently had FFS with Dr Spiegel if anyone has any questions,"I know there are about a 1000 of these but I found them to be super helpful when trying to make my decision so hopefully this might be useful.

I had a Trachea Shave, Forehead Contouring with Scalp Advancement, Rhinolasty and Lip Lift. The grand total for everything was around $36,000 including the overnight stay in the hospital. I paid for this primarily by using care-credit/ 0 interest credit cards. 

These procedures are covered in my BCBS policy but they have been a real pain in throughout this whole process. I paid up-front and hopefully should be getting reimbursed sometime in the near future. I was able to get confirmation that I would be covered for these procedure with Dr. Spiegel, but really holding my breath on seeing that money anytime soon.

I live in New England so I really did not have to worry about travel/accommodations.  

Can't really comment to the aesthetics at the moment as I still look like I spent a night with Chris Brown but everything seems to be healing really well and there were no complications.

lyaa55,asktransgender,Having trouble committing...,"Exactly as the title says.  I went on hormones while still questioning.  They immediately reversed a debilitating depression. Every step in transition I've taken has made me feel wonderful.  I'm dating a queer woman who refers to me as her girlfriend and I'm basically full-time in my social life.  I have way less social anxiety and haven't hung out with boys in like 6 months.  I already dress primarily in women's clothing everyday.

Yet I'm having trouble getting past the ""i'm still questioning"" mindset.  I'm not sure if i'm putting too much pressure on myself to come out on facebook and change my name everywhere when there's no reason to rush.  I do know that I'm conscious of how being trans will make my life harder, and it makes me keep revisiting the question of transition.  But I never consider *actually* stopping hormones.  I ask myself, ""will I continue?"" and leave it as an open question.  But when I ask, ""will I stop?""  I know the answer is No.

I'm getting some shipments of clothes I bought myself for xmas in the next 2-3 days and my gf coming back from vacation :).  So i'll be able to continue feeling things out.  I guess there's no problem just painstakingly feeling out every aspect of this, especially because I did begin hormones while questioning. "

I'm just worried I'll get desperate and start while I'm unstable and it'll make me miserable because of all the social implications and not being ready for a great change. On the other hand, I'm already presenting more and more androgynous, so I feel silly not starting because it'll be months before I see changes...

This relates to the fear of losing my genitals,  but my mom (who doesn't know I'm questioning my gender identity and am bisexual) called it ""Castration anxiety,"" at which point I told her to stop playing amateur psychologist because, well, she started linking it to my thoughts of how she and my older brother are very domineering. 

I do think that she is a lot stricter than all the other parents I know, while my brother is only a year older and is a bit dominating too, and often expects people to adjust to him rather than he adjusting for once, but is generally a really awesome guy and pretty much my partner in crime throughout all my exploits as a kid.

[deleted],asktransgender,Injectable Estrogen Questions / Levels &amp; Doses etc,"I had a couple of questions regarding injectable estrogen if anyone would be polite enough to answer?

I'm having real difficulty getting my levels right.

It seems from reading through posts that doses of 20mg per week, 10mg per week still yield very high levels in the blood. This is the case with me also.

My levels after being tested late in the week were 1340 pmol/l. I took 10mg/1ml per week at that time.

So some questions:

1 ) When is the best time to take a blood test for injectable E. Would it be a good idea to test a day or two after and then another test at the end of the week?

2 ) What is the degradation curve for injectable estrogen? is it constant?

3 ) My SHBG is naturally high at 121 nmol/L. Does this mean I should take more injectable estrogen since a lot of it will be bound up by SHBG?

4 ) Does anyone know the correct reference ranges for FREE estradiol and available estrogen? Surely that is more important than total E?

CuriousAnConfusedSam,asktransgender,Tips for somebody starting out?,"Hiya r/transgender!

I've posted a couple of times over the past week and a half and I have a couple of more questions, these being more specific to taking care of my body.

Part of my checklist (that I'm still making as I go along) is to lose about 100 pounds. I'm currently 250lbs and about 6 feet tall. With hard exercise due to the job I had before my current one, I dropped from 280 to where I am now. I, however, didn't really change my eating habits. 

So, here are the questions:

1.  Is there any sort of recommended diet for MtF people? I'm pre everything, as I'm still in the ""Planning and research"" stage.

2. What sort of exercises do you folks recommend? The job I'm about to start is about 6-7 hours of lifting and moving packages for UPS (up to 70lbs.).

Now a mostly unrelated question:

3. How often should I be full on washing my hair with shampoo? As a male, I've never really cared about how my hair looked. Short, simple, wash with a tiny bit of shampoo every day. Lately I've grown my hair out a little and I feel like I'm losing control a bit despite thouroughly washing it daily.

Thanks for any answers!"

CoraZin,asktransgender,Unexpected response from clinic,"So yesterday I had a checkup. Before they prescribed me HRT, they tested my blood for any health issues. They did another this time. 

I had asked if they checked hormone levels, and first time she said they don't, it just matters what the levels are after starting HRT. This time, she said they don't check hormone levels at all, they just base levels on results.

Her explanation was: if you are happy with the results, we keep you on the same amount, if you want more results, we can increase dosage, as long as it's healthy.

Has anyone else had experiences like this? I'm going to see a new Endo in a couple weeks, so these people were very helpful in getting me started, but I thought it was odd to not look at hormone levels."

throw1way132,asktransgender,Crush has mutual feelings for me... but being trans is a dealbreaker and we both dont know what to do.,"Hey

Been a while since I've posted here but I'm stuck with something again. Recently I met a guy online. We play gw2 together and organise raids for newer people. A few months ago his 3 year relationship ended and he's still kinda struggling with it. I like helping people where I can so that's where we started talking. He's really sweet, caring and empathic and I felt comfortable right away around him. I told him that I was dealing with things too (being trans) and he seemed really interested and asked tons of questions. 

Over the past few weeks I've started developping feelings for him. I havent really felt like this ever and this is really special to me. He's special to me. I could go on about how amazing he is but I just really like him. It sounds cliche but I really think he's ""the one"" for me. We're a good fit. 

Few days ago I told him how I felt. He gave me a wall of text with a vague message that he likes me too, but that he wasnt ready for anything because of his ex. He told me I shouldnt get my hopes up because he's scared of hurting me. After talking more he explained that me being trans is somewhat of a dealbreaker. He says he sees me as a girl, but that he has a mental block when it comes to relationships and that he doesnt know why. He says that the fact that ""something would be off"" would nag him all the time. Lots of the conversation was ""I dont know"", ""we'll see in the future"" and similar things. Just lots of confusion from both sides. He didnt mean to hurt me but I made him be honest about it. I really do think he has feelings for me too and from the things he said, he cares a lot about me. 

We both have a mutual friend (who I'm meeting IRL for the first time friday) who has actually dated a transgirl before. I talked to him and he already expected this because the guy I like told him ""I dont see myself doing something like that"" back when he dated a transgirl. 

This feels so unfair. I hate being trans and it always stabs me in the back...

I dont really know what to do now. Our mutual friend tells me to just stay a good friend and see what the future gives us. This seems like the most sensible advice but I have constant anxiety that it's not gonna work out and that I'll lose him. I want to show him that a relationship with me wouldnt be different from dating another girl but I dont know how, or where to start. I really need help with this whole situation, I want this to work out for once. 

Thanks in advance for the advice but please keep comments like ""find someone else, he's transphobic"" away. That's not the case, he's not a bad guy. If I wasnt trans there would be no problem. Also please dont give me ""there are 7 billion people on earth...."", this is so devaluing.

Please fix my heartbreak :(

howlongwasiasleep,asktransgender,Can anyone suggest a flavored lubricant? Nsfw,"DEAR MODS, if this is accidentally posted multiple times, I'm sorry!!!

My girlfriend is mtf, so obviously when it comes to le sexy times we use lube on her. We use KY, which is fine, but not ingestible so I'm kind of limited to doing one thing per session as far as pleasing her (by which I mean... I can either use lube and manually stimulate her, or go lube free if we plan to do oral). Ideally, I'd like to be able to do whatever the heck she wants during sex, so I thought a flavored, ingestible lube would solve that problem! 

I wanted to ask on here, though, because A. Neither of us has ever used a flavored lube, and B. As my darlin is mtf, I want to be sure that whatever we go with is safe for her body, body chemistry, etc. I know that sugary things can screw with the chemistry of MY lady parts, so I want to ensure that it is safe for hers as well. 

Thanks in advance!"

Lately, though, I haven't been able to do this, I wish I was a girl, but I don't want to transition, I don't think that would make me a woman, I wouldn't feel like one.

Whenever I really think about it I cry a lot, and I kind of lose my already miniscule will to live. And before anything: no, this isn't the reason I already feel shitty, I've been struggling with Borderline personality disorder coupled with anxiety for a while.

Also, I don't really have much of a problem with my appearance, I think I'm ugly but I don't care, I just wish I was girl (even if I enjoy having a penis)

Necronzon,asktransgender,New Year. New Gender.,"I've finally had enough of denying who I am, but I need advice, so I came to this thread!

I'm 23 years old, 24 at the end of this month, and have been having dysphoric thoughts since early puberty, but they only became particularly intense in the past year or two. I struggled with depression for so long, not knowing the reason; I knew something was off, and thought I was gay, until I realised I only liked girls. If it wasn't that, then what could it have been?

Then it struck me after conversations with transgender friends I met on the internet. It all made sense why I'd always gotten on better with girls, why I'd never felt like one of the lads, but I still couldn't get over the fact that I simply didn't like girly things. Like a typical boy, I liked shooting things in video games, and angry, violent music. This made me doubt myself for so long until a friend told me ""Nobody can tell you how to be trans.""

I hope to start hormones very soon (I want my boobs!) but I have some obstacles to cross.. My parents have no idea I feel this way, and I don't know how to tell them. My mother has always been a protective, overbearing person and I've always been her special son destined for great things; she's very conservative, and with this revelation I'll just be turning everything on its head for her.. For so long I denied myself this because I didn't want to upset my parents, I was worried that I'd be a disappointment. 

Another thing that irritates me is that I have a constantly nagging ""masculine block"" in my brain, repeating all of my old excuses not to transition. I remember reading that ""If you think you're trans, you probably are."" If I keep doubting myself like this, am I not? I know I want this, but I can't assuage my worries. 

Having been a straight male, I also worry about my potential pool of partners being dramatically cut in half. I'd like a girlfriend, and what if I'm just making it harder for myself by making myself a girl? (I'd be a total lesbian, is what I'm saying!)

Anyway.. That's only the half of it, but I don't want to ramble on and on in this post. Anyone who took the time to read this, thank you. Whatever support you can give me means a lot. "

You likely don't have gender dysmorphia (it accounts for less than 0.1% of the population) you just associate with too many liberals and far-lefts and are exposed to their propaganda that you have convinced yourself that you do have a problem and need to transition.

I thought it started when out of nowhere I felt aroused by the idea of wearing my girlfriend's clothes. It was a weird attraction but in the end I came out to her, told her it was a fetish. She was OK about it, gave me full access to her wardrobe and told me to not feel shame or guilt and just try whatever I wanted as long as she didn't had to see me like that.


Well, it was a turn on at first, but it wasn't even the third time I tried I found out it wasn't really a fetish. I have a really high libido but honestly it just felt great, but not a turn on. So I guess I mixed both.


But this led to me do some thinking, about my past, about how I've been feeling my whole life. Stuff I guess I just didn't want to remember and hid from myself.


I've never been very manly, never liked sports, don't really have a manly body... more like a feminine figure, and always was a lonely guy on my own. My way out was several girl friends I met over the internet, which was awesome because I really felt like I was connecting with others, and being people completely disconnected from my real life made it way easier to talk about everything. I've been only be able to open myself to other girls. I feel now like this could be one of many reasons why I could never connect with others like anyone else, my social anxiety, why every goddamn thing was so fucking hard to go through. Maybe it's even the reason why I found out how to use my thing so late. I don't know, but anyway.


When I was really depressed as a teenager, I had this recurrent dream and fantasy about waking up as a girl. 


Everything about all of this, was gone for several years. I've lived through some rough stuff, so I tried my best at forgetting my childhood and when I met my current girlfriend, well, I kind of left behind all of that.


But now I don't know. I've been feeling dysphoric for several months now, with its climax reaching now as this week has been hell.


This is, really really hard to talk about. I'm trying my best but. It's pretty hard.


I don't want to transition, because I don't really feel like a woman. But If i had to choose between both, I would choose being a woman. And because to be honest I really don't feel like a man nowadays. 


My perfect world would be one in which I could switch, being female for most of the time, and everyone I know just not knowing about it if that makes any kind of sense?


I'm so confused. I've been finally looking for some counselling in my town, as I think I really need it, not just for this but... it's kind of one of the reasons but I just can't afford it right now so this was the only thing that I could try, writing this in here.

mjollnir82,asktransgender,"You are an ingrateful jerk: issues with same-AAB-gender friendship, before discovered being transgender?","Hello everyone.
This may sound sooo stupid, but please, consider... that I may be :P

I always lived the friendship with some same-gender friends of mine (I am AMAB, so male friends). 
I always felt that I HAD to have male friends, and I could not have (not even be with) females, back at age 4.
Besides the fact I always were very uncomfortable with male mates, I was able to adapt and had not too much problems in general. 

The problems begun as I grew up, with some mates. I knew one to which I was his best friend, but I didn't feel like him. He could get really upset by the fact I didn't consider him his best friend, and I started thinking I was ungrateful respect to his friendship, and I was not a good friend. I developed a sense of guilt and a constant sorry feeling for him, and I started thinking very early how I should behave. 
Eventually, I started acting as it was expected to act, as I was male, and not behaving properly. Besides this, I started feeling deeply stupid, ashamed, guilty and fearful. I started to say that I HAD to be a good friend, or... why not being? I had no justification (and also, nowhere to go... I could not have female friends, and didn't want male friends). 

Btw, I had some other, plain friends, both males and females, and all this didn't happen.
I think that some of these friends were a little bit manipulative (and I was needing someone to protect me, maybe). Yes, it was a bit toxic.

bbatchelder,asktransgender,"Best way to handle ""sex/gender"" in sports?","Hey folks.  I'm involved in the sport of ""disc dog"" (people playing various games with their dogs using discs).  Typically a persons biological sex doesn't come into play - except when it comes to distance-based games where there is a stark difference in results.

So in those games we have different ""qualification thresholds"" based on sex.

We have a website where competitors manage their profiles, and I need to add a place for competitors to identify their sex, so the right qualification rules are applied to them.

So my question to you all is what is the most appropriate way to prompt for this information, while being inclusive of all people?

Clarine87,asktransgender,Little unsure what to think: Clear Ejaculate after only three weeks on E without AA.,"Over the last 20 days I've taken 20mg of E.

4 days 0.5mg, 2 days 1mg, 4 days 2mg, 8 days 1.5mg, 2 days 2mg.

Xmas hols caused me to act irrationally and switch from hemihydrate to valerate for 8 days.

Also ongoing finasteride. 

Has anyone else heard of this happening so quickly? Afterwards the glans felt like it had just had water on it, and it the residue tasted completely different - the only empirical test available to me.

Also my perineum has changed dramatically. The Raphe darkened about 6 days ago, and 2 days ago on either side of it (where the vulva would be I guess) has gone orange - literally covered in freckles. This has also happened to the base of the penis.

I've never read about these particular changes happening so quickly. (I suspect I have mild androgen insensitivity, if that's relevant). 

Should I be concerned that this has happened so much quicker than I've read in all the resources I've accessed? Also mild testicular ache. Seeing doctor for blood test in two weeks.

I'm not alarmed by these things, just surprised and curious whether they're indicative of something else I might want to get checked out.

EDIT:
Thanks for your kind words, I came back to delete this thread because I had another sesh to be sure and it looked the same, but the sticky residue was back, though still tasteless. I'm going to leave it up so that others can be aware that this can happen quickly.

I did consider stopping or asking my GP for T(weird train of though there) and took 50% of my dose this morning, but I have decided to wait until my blood results a week after the 16th before making any decisions and will maintain my usual dose.

In other news my orgasm changed today (made my legs cramp), and the physical component (loss of blood flow) of the refractory period did not kick in (though mentally I was just as **not** aroused as when I started) in the usual way. However I'm going to relax and not post a thread for a month or so on that."
throwawaymightbtrans,asktransgender,Working in healthcare and thinking about transitioning - can anyone share experiences?,"Ok, first things first: THANK YOU REDDIT!! 

I've made a few posts over the last few days trying to figure things out. Conclusion: I'm trans. currently 67% sure I'm a guy, 19% sure I'm non binary, and 14% doubting myself i.e. cis. 

I'm gonna keep track of those figures for the next few days, while I start making some aesthetic changes, to see how things change. 

So, onto my question: if I do transition, it will very likely be once I'm out of uni and working (I graduate this year, and companies are interviewing us for grad jobs already). 

The problem here is that I'm going to be working in healthcare, in a clinical role. 

I'm nervous about how transitioning would affect whether or not patients get along with me; I know once I'm passing it won't be a problem, but I also know it's a very slow process, and I'm concerned about 'scaring patients off' I guess. I kinda regret being in such a frontline role, as it's not like I'm going to just be in an office with the same few coworkers every day. 

So I suppose my main concern is that for a while, I'll be effectively coming out every day to multiple people; has anyone been in a career with this kind of interaction?

Anyone worked in healthcare whilst transitioning, and what were your experiences?"

I was speaking to someone (Who is also MTF), and they said about if it ain't broke, then don't fix it. 


Maybe transitioning isn't for me, or maybe something in the future. It's just, not knowing what I am is really annoying me, not knowing if I should transition or continue being male.


If there was a way to somehow magically transition, it happened instantly and I knew I wouldn't regret it, I would. But I still don't know if I will regret any of the changes. I don't want to, but I'm 17, and I'm not sure if it is right for me or not.

stuck1nthem1ddle,asktransgender,Weird response to upping spiro dosage,"My partner and I are a bit confused, so I figured I throw it out there to the group.  

Both the first time I started taking spiro, and since I upped my dosage from 50mg twice a day to 100mg twice a day, a weird thing has happened about a week later.  Basically, I'll go to sleep not thinking about sex at all, but an hour or so later, I'll partially wake up and instigate sex with my partner.  I am sort of partially conscious during the beginning and get more aware as it goes on, but it is like my mind is blank and singularly focused.  The sex is pretty great for both of us, though this last time it was definitely much harder for me to come, which makes sense.  It's just confusing to both of us because it seems to come out of nowhere.  Whether it is due to just the spiro, or to the stress in my life right now, I just don't think about sex at all anymore.  We're both ok with that and have accepted it as part of the process of transitioning, but this out of the blue sleepy sex is just catching us off guard.

Has anyone had any similar experiences when taking spiro?"

ladyturqouise,asktransgender,Looking for advice from older trans girls regarding the long term effects of HRT,"Hi there everyone, I'm starting HRT this month (CAN I GET AN AMEN) and I'm excited but somewhat nervous. I've been so fixated on getting to this stage that I've kind of not paid attention and signed every piece of paper that's been thrown at me. Reading through the health risks of HRT some are quite frightening and I know must be taken seriously i.e. increased rate of heart attacks, deep vein thrombosis etc. My doctor tells me these risks are practically nothing for someone my age (21) but will increase as I get older. 

I was wondering have any of you encountered serious health issues as a direct result of HRT, older trans people specifically? I doubt anything is going to change my mind but I would love to hear people's experiences this sub is always a great help. "
VerySeriousThrowaway,asktransgender,Is this a fetish or something else?,"Okay to start a lot of this background I originally posted on NoFap for advice, but I feel like some one here could help me?

Perhaps you had similar feelings whilst younger? or perhaps you can assure me that I am non-trans with a fetish?

Anyway, heres what I posted before:
Okay to start, this is my first time posting on this sub or even to reddit at all. I am 18 years old and am suffering from serious PIED (porn induced erectile dysfunction).

Ive been watching porn probably since I was around 13, and it very quickly turned to femdom and 'sissy' themes. When I was first getting into porn I looked at a wide variety of depraved porn and did occasionally look at vanilla porn but was usually perverted in some sense. for the last few years it has very much become centered around the 'sissy' and 'feminisation' themes, often involving forced gay sex with black men (that felt really weird and disgusting to type),

I have tried NoFap numerous times over the last 3 months since discovering, and am currently on my longest streak (only of 15 days).

Last year I had a long time girlfriend who I was with for at least 8 months. In this time I spent numerous nights with her, all of which I could only muster 50% of an erection at most, and we didn't really talk about this. I just avoided her going near that whole area. I fingered her and performed oral sex basically whenever I spent the night at her place. Once after giving oral I was hard enough to let her give me hand but this was a one off occasion.

Currently, I have a girlfriend who I have been with upwards of half a year. I love this girl very much and I want more than anything to make her happy. I could see a future with her, but find myself feeling incredibly depressed when I think about it, due to my ED. She is more than ready to have sex and has expressed on multiple occasions that she would like to. I have fingered her a few times but again I have not let her touch me because of the ED.
I did not want this relationship to go the way of my last relationship, so I told her that the reason for the lack of sexual escalation was because I found it hard to get it up. Shes been very understanding and says she wants to help however she can.

I haven't told her it is anything to do with porn or the weird fetishes I involve(d?) myself in. This is because it is embarrassing and I don't want her to think of me differently. I understand trust is important, and some may suggest telling her, but the extent of my porn addiction would be so alien to her that I fear shed be pushed away.
Here is the thing - I had light fantasies about female domination and about 'feminisation' of me before I even discovered porn. I often invented stories in my head, and these stories sometimes led down these routes. I feel this may have stemmed from me being a very lonely child who had few friends, and I felt I had no hope of ever actually getting into a healthy relationship.

I have always kept this side of me extremely separate from my masculine, hard-working self. At the moment after a few weeks of NoFap, I realize I want nothing to do with this anymore. I want to be able to have sex with my girlfriend, and have a normal relationship.

I understand it seems as though I am suppressing fetishes that are innate in me, but all I want is to live a normal life without this.

Will NoFap push away these desires that have always been associated with sexual pleasure?
When I am with my girlfriend Im thinking only of her and how much I want to have sex with her. The rush I get from typing in the words 'sissy' into google is scary.

I want to be rid of this and live a normal life. I do not want to have a relationship embracing these 'kinks' - this part of me is so separate from my life and it just makes me sick thinking that the people I love - especially my girlfriend - finding out about, even more so embracing and introducing in our sex life.

Right now I feel like utter shit, considering suicide.

Any advice would be appreciated. thanks

OnePunchRoxanne,asktransgender,Educational help.,"Hey guys, gals and everything in between. 

So I've been doing things to attempt to look female but I'm not into being transgender in terms of my mental. Like for example my dad asked me how it was possible for me to change my gender and that it didn't make sense. I told him I don't know and I didn't care. That I was doing this to obtain my final form (lol), obtain happiness and trueness. I told him he can call me male if he wants and that I didn't care. He told me ad hominems are adorable, that I'm starting to get my mothers booty and left... He also asked me whether he should identify as an Apache helicopter or a an AK-47... I didn't get this at all. 

And that's a problem. What am I supposed to say if it gets serious or day. Like why is me changing my gender valid (logically) and why can I identify as a woman? I thought it was the social construct thing? Can someone help me out?"

FemOrNot,asktransgender,I think bullying may have caused me to be in denial about being transgender.,"

So just to start off.. I'm a 25 y.o. guy and I've been questioning my gender a ton for the last year or so. It got really bad around 8 months ago when I was basically locking myself away from the world, hating the way I looked, losing weight really fast (I stopped eating and lost 30lbs in 6 weeks), hating the way I looked and spending time crying in bed. It ended with me having a mental breakdown and having to defer from uni for a year.

After that, I decided to start writing down my feelings and life experience with them...I'm not sure why really but it did help and it felt like I was getting things off my chest. 

So, I've recently reread most of what I wrote (took a while) and I think I may have repressed the feeling of being transgender in the past as I was bullied about looking like a girl when I was younger.

I SERIOUSLY hated having my hair cut short my whole childhood. Until the ages of 7-8 my parents would have to pin me in a chair at the hairdressers just to get a couple inches taken off and even after that stopped I dreaded going. I can also remember cutting my vests into crop tops, hiding them in the garden and wearing them in the woods behind my house in summer. 

But, to cut a long story short; I was bullied in school pretty badly because of my hair. It went on for a few years but I never told anyone. I finally started getting it cut short and gelling it down in the first year of secondary school to make it stop. As it was always older kids doing the bullying. I decided I had to be more macho now because of all the older guys in my new school. I essentially did that until I left high school at 16 which was also around when I began cross-dressing. 

I've starting to think I repressed my feelings of wanting to be female because the feeling of being bullied was worse. And, that once I left that environment, they started to resurface hence why I started cross-dressing?

Im not sure what what to ask really..  Any opinions? Is this even possible or am I reading into it too much? 

*Sorry if this is long winded I just never get to talk to anyone about these feelings and this is just the tip of the iceberg.*"

abbyjames327,asktransgender,Coming out to some people this weekend. Any advice would be appreciated!,"Sorry if this turns into a wall of text. 

As of right now, I am only out to 3 people, my wife, my best friend, and my therapist. This weekend my wife and I will be visiting some family and friends and I am planning on telling a few people, 3 to be exact. 

The first would be my brother in law, he is a very easy going person, and both my wife and I think he will probably be accepting. 

The second one would be a close friend of ours who is I have known for 10 years, and he has seen a picture of me dressed up on Halloween, but has no idea that my costume is what I wear the other 364 days of the year. In all the years I've known him the topic of transgender people never came but he is accepting of the gay and lesbian communities.

The third one is my sister, is in her 50's (I'm 28). We have different mothers and I'm the same age as my nephew. This one will be over the phone or text as she lives in Florida now. I could wait to tell her in person but the next time I know I will see her will be in March at my niece's wedding, and I think that would probably not be a good time. This one feels like it could be a wild card, we have a good relationship but because of the huge age gap we don't have a traditional sibling connection. 

I'm so nervous about this and not sure how to get the conversation started to tell them. I WILL NOT chicken out, but I would love any advice.

Throwaway999333222,asktransgender,"When does it get better? [TW: Depression, Dysphoria, Suicide]","Hey again. Sorry for being so spammy lately, but knowing I have people to talk to about being trans WITH trans people is just something I need right now.

But ... yeah. When does it get better? Dysphoria haunts me every wakng moment of my life. Staring at myself in the mirror makes me disconnect from my body and surroundings, seeing myself through the lens of a different perspective other than my own. And what I see terrifies me.

When I look in the mirror I don't even see a human. I just see a hideous, hulking, freakish monster. It makes me so scared just watching my movements and breathing, and I even fear at times that my own reflection is going to reach out and attack me. Just recently I attempted strangling myself with my towel after showering for the night because of how much I hated what I saw, how far away I am from what I want so badly to be.

I want to be pretty, have nice proportions, boobs, legs, nice skin, no body hair, etc. But instead? I have this disgusting tiny alien head copy pasted onto a massive hulking fat man body. I have no hips, I only have a big butt because I weigh 234 pound at 6""2, I've got body hair (especially on my legs) to put Harambe to shame, a gigantic barrel chest with huge shoulders and feet bigger than my own father's

And then, when the rare occasion arises that I can at least TOLERATE myself, I visit places like these and read posts. I see so many beautiful men and women who've acheived so much and pass so well and it often makes me cry because I know I'll never be sexy, pretty, or even cute. Instead, I'm just an ugly, fat, gross freak who pulls others down because I hate myself so much.

I see people at the gym, my friends at school, even male ones, who are prettier and more feminine than I am and I just can't stand it anymore, lnowing I will NEVER pass, or be beautiful, or smart, or in love, or ANYTHING and I hate it so much.

Back when I just started watching Steven Universe, I got to Stevonnie, and they made me so happy because they seemed so much like me. They even made me ok with my skin color. I even thought about cosplaying them. But I realized I'm not attractive and never will be, and I'll just look like a creep cosplaying them.

I cannot stand living in this body anymore, but I'm too pathetic and cowardly to end it, even though I want to every minute of the day. I've been told it gets better for years, yet it's only gotten worse and worse.

So what I do then? "
felmyst,asktransgender,I think my partner might be a trans girl,"I'm ftm, and they currently identify as genderfluid/genderqueer. We trade femme and masc stuff and they get very dysphoric when reminded they don't have breasts, and have expressed feeling much more comfortable wearing a bra. They've asked me to call them babygirl, princess, etc and avoid masculine petnames.

I feel like they've been dropping hints heavily lately, and I remember doing the same before I came out (though obviously not everyone is the same.)

I love them no matter what, regardless of their gender. I just want to know how they're feeling and help walk them through their feelings and the process of transitioning.

I am not in a constant state of dysphoria or hate myself, I just simply feel that I will never live the life I want to or feel happy with myself but instead just not feel much at all. But along with those feelings I feel that I could live a life as a cis male, but I would just never bother finding relationships or push my goals and aspirations, but instead just continue going through school easily maintaining my 4.0 GPA just to find a good paying job to sustain myself with a job that I'm good at but don't care about, basically my life ""success"" doesn't seem to be bothered by it, I just continue to go along a path and life that I don't care about, but I am also not suicidal whatsoever...

Infaemous,asktransgender,I want to come out to my Dad this weekend.. Am very nervous. Any advice?,"Me and my Dad are really close, and I don't want to disappoint him. We regularly go out drinking together, although I do look a little effeminate he's never had much reason beyond that to doubt my gender. I was never able to do sports due to a dodgy leg, but my other interests: Violent video games, violent music, they were pretty masculine or at least gender-neutral. 

He's very emotionally receptive after having had a drink, and I am generally a lot more open and talkative too; is it recommended that I come out when we are both under the influence of alcohol? I'd like to be as honest and as reassuring with him as I can that I've thought about this and would definitely like to try this path, and that I need his support if I ever want to start feeling better about myself.

I also can't decide whether to write him a letter and then just sit while he reads it, or simply speak openly and answer his questions/explain things as it comes.

Any general advice for coming out would also be massively appreciated. I don't want to tell my mother just yet as she isn't quite as.. liberal, as my Dad is, and even he isn't completely so, but I hope he'll understand.

Thanks~"

LangMeYourLight,asktransgender,How to get amazing pictures as a trans person- from a semi-professional photographer,"1. **Is it worth getting a ""real"" camera?** Though smartphone cameras have gotten considerably better over the years, standalone cameras and DSLRs continue to get even better.  The laws of physics can only be pushed so far, and a larger camera with a larger lens, sensor, etc., will always take the better picture.  Even a consumer-level point-and-shoot will offer much better quality than a phone, especially in low light and when zoomed in.  However, there is a flipside to all this high resolution: DSLR's tend to be less forgiving.  They will pick up every detail of your face and body, ***including things like 5 o'clock shadow.***  That said, you really shouldn't worry all that much about what camera you use, as long as it's not a potato.  ***It's not the camera, it's the photographer.***  An iPhone 3GS in the hands of a skilled photographer will give much better results than a Canon in the hands of a drunk person.

2. **Lighting.**  For trans women, the best type of lighting is direct/front lighting.  Decent front lighting will make your eyes appear less sunken-in and lessen the appearance of your brow bone.  The eye socket and brow bone are subtle sex characteristics that can make a huge difference in your photos.  Many bathroom vanity lights will suffice when taking a selfie.  Open windows are another good source.  **Avoid overhead lights,** such as ceiling fans or office lighting.  Also avoid cloudy days, since there is typically a lot of top lighting going on on a cloudy day.  Don't use flash unless it's your only option.  Back lighting is not recommended for anyone, since you'll either be dark, or your background will be too light.  

3. **Zoom and distance.**  Many people assume that zooming in does the same thing as moving closer to your subject, but they are in reality two different things.  [Here is the same picture, taken at various different distances and zoom ranges.](https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2016/07/grid.jpg)  **For trans men (FTM), go with longer zooms and get your ""photographer"" to take your picture from farther away.**  This will make your shoulders appear more masculine.  **For trans women, use a medium focal length, such as 50mm or 3x.**  Wider zooms will make your shoulders appear even smaller, but have the nasty side effect of making your nose look bigger.  

4.  **Facial expressions.**  **Trans women: Smile!**  It rounds out your face.  Trans men: Smiling is nice, but if you wish to masculinize your appearance, go for serious expressions.

5. **Trial and error.**  Keep practicing.  Thankfully, we live in the digital age, and no longer need to buy film or Polaroid paper.  

TL;DR A decent camera can help but isn't necessary.  Trans women should use front lighting, medium zoom ranges, and smiling.  Trans men should use far zoom ranges and serious facial expressions."

 I have been fighting to be able to transition for a little over a year now (decided it was time in december 2014) and I feel like I am at the end of my rope. So far I have seen a doctor who told me to my face that I am not transgender, A therapist who cared more about my other mental health problems (I already have another therapist for those mental health problems) than helping me get any grips on my gender dysphoria, and an informed consent clinic that wouldn't help me because of my mental health problems. I am going to see a new doctor on Wednesday but at this point I am expecting more of the same.

I have gotten to the point where I have told my family to not refer to me by my chosen name or correct gender any more because I feel like it's hopeless. All I can feel is that I am being discriminated against because of my mental health issues. Is there anything left that I can do that doesn't include black market hormones?"

Bzttid,asktransgender,I don't know how to deal with what I've just been told..,"My mom is constantly trying to convince me to detransition, saying that she knows ""ex-transgender"" people to talk to and that there's success stories of detransition and stuff. I've also been suspicious that she's trying to set me up for failure to prove that she's right in saying that transition is bad for me.

So, a few days ago I came out on Facebook and all that. I got a message from my aunt today saying that my mom messaged her and all of her kids telling them not to like the status or comment on it or support me. They were all like ""uh.. no. She's family and we support her"", so she deleted them all off of Facebook and won't talk to them. 

On top of this I learned two more things: she's taking advice from my grandpa on how to handle this whole thing. My grandpa is a narcissist and a pervert, but what I just learned blew my mind and I don't really know how to feel.

My aunt told me that my grandpa (her dad) molested her when she was a kid. My mom brought me and my brothers around him when we were kids. He was always an asshole. And now she's taking advice from him and trying to turn people against me.

I honestly don't know what to do. My mom is actively trying to ruin my life all while keeping up this face with me of ""oh I love you and care about you"". I'm realizing that she's seriously mentally ill and most likely a narcissist. I never caused problems before coming out and I'm seeing a whole new side of both my parents that's really, really ugly. Not to mention she's a devout Christian.

I'm sort of at a loss of what to do, and I'm really sad. I feel like I needed to share just because.. I don't really know what to do, and I needed to tell someone.."

In the California court government website it says we do not need a court ordered gender change to get a new passport. They didn't believe it and we're saying things like oh well we need the court order because your other ID doesn't say (F) on it. 

It seems reasonable, but I haven't heard that ever from other trans people or the gov websites. After I pressed them they were like okay we can still submit it, but they might put it on hold till you get the court order and stuff like that.

CluelessCisLord,asktransgender,[Cis male] Emotionally confused after my partner (sort of?) came out,"*(edited because my phone went on the fritz)*

I just want to say up-front that I'm fully in support of the trans community.  While I may not use the correct vocabulary at times, I love people (unless they're assholes!), regardless of what they look like or how they act.  My sibling came out as lesbian 17 years ago, identified as trans shortly after, publicly transitioned about 10 years ago, and finally had top-surgery about 6 years ago.  We've helped each other along the way: me being a pillar of staunch support for him, while he educated his clueless ""Cislord"" brother, lol.

That said, my partner of 8 months just told me that she thinks she wants to be a man.  We talked about it, and I promised my full support to her with whatever her decision ends up being, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't more than a scared and hurt, emotionally.  I didn't display any of this to her, though - just positivity and support, but I think I need some of my own support while I figure things out.  

Unfortunately, she uses Reddit, and I'm fairly certain she's in this sub (or at least reads it, as she's referenced it before).  She jumps to conclusions a lot, and I'm afraid that during the process of figuring out how I feel, she'll read too much into it and think I hate her (which is no where near the truth).

I'm looking for anyone who's got an open mind, is drama-free, and is willing to help a guy out.  We can keep it in private messages here, or use something like Gmail or Facebook (I have throw-away accounts on both).

Let's say you wern't happy with your appearance also and you didn't have the money for any surgery procedures. Would you still transition as best you could if you suffered from gender dysphoria or would you just accept that you can only be a cis man or women knowing that you can never achieve what you want?"
CherryColaCan,asktransgender,Mea Culpa (and how to deal with rejection?),"I like to pretend here that I'm full of confidence and that I can handle my own problems. (I give advice here like the worst know-it-all ever!)

Truth is, I'm a wreck. The holidays were horrible and I'm only now climbing out of my own deep hole. Last year I lost my wife and my best friend (same lady). Her extended family who I have been close to for almost two decades now think I'm Satan. (I got to spend a lot of time with them and it was not fun.) Their love was always conditional and I broke the conditions.

I have a lot of support in my transition from friends and my own bio-family. My kids still think I'm awesome. I'm very lucky in that! However being rejected by people I loved stings. How do you guys deal with that shit? Does that sense of bitterness and loss get better or does it just kind of scab over?

feelinqueer,asktransgender,"Let's have a collective f*ck you to the phrase ""it's just a phase"" [rant]","Seriously though, this has been the worst words ever said towards harming my transitioning, it prolonged my coming out for *years*.

I'm tired of seeing other trans people say how they doubt themselves all the time because of it, especially when we're younger it's so harmful, I couldn't even say how many times I've seen a young trans person say that their parents just tell them ""it's just a phase"" and brush off their children's call for help and support...

No one goes through the horribly stressful and nerve racking experience of coming out as trans (at least for most I'd say it is) if it's just a phase... Do such things exist? Sure, I bet there has been a few instances of someone thinking that they are trans and end up realizing that they are not. But if they've been dealing with it and thinking about it enough to come out to family or friends then I bet it is very rare for it to be such. Not to mention I don't think it can be an actual ""phase"" even with the people that end up realizing they're cis. They obviously still needed to express that they are not comfortable with who they are.

Let's take the position of a shitty parent who says such a thing, would you rather support your kid in finding help via a counselor/therapist and talking to them about how they feel and it end up being just a ""phase"" but show that you love your kid? Or would you rather just tell them ""it's a phase"" ignore them and have them swallowed up in their own depression and possibly take their own life? My conclusion is that THEY just want to believe it's a ""phase"" because they're too scared or transphobic to think that their kid could be trans. They just ignore it hoping that they're right even if it puts their kids life in danger. So I say FUCK you to all the people who say ""it's just a phase"" because it's a selfish defense mechanism for themselves!

We has a community often doubt ourselves a lot, and I have come to the conclusion that it's a part of being trans at least at first. But the only doubts you should allow yourself to have are your own, NEVER let someone else put doubts in your mind! Don't let yourself get harmed by such things, they aren't thinking of you when they say it, they're thinking of themselves.

I know many of you probably already understand this, but I just had to rant a bit about it and wanted to let others have an outlet to do so also.

so to sum it up, i have had feelings of being trans for over 6 years on and off and recently had a really hard phase of questioning after being depressed for a week.

I am not depressed, nor do I hate myself.
Looking back at my feelings I kinda have to cringe now and it makes me feel weird to even think about that stuff. I even like some aspects about being male and am unsure about the question if i'd be happier being female and I would really struggle with ""the button"" and don't think I would press it. I don't feel male and I don't feel female, I feel like a personality and not as a gender. I know that sounds weird, but I feel like that all of the distress came from me obsessing over that thought and reading too much into it, overthinking that topic. I think that I'd be better off living as male. I guess that ""agender"" fits all of this more than any other term?

You might also have read the 2014 amnesty international report about that place and how violated a lot of patients felt from the questions asked during treatment.

If you've been scared by all of this I have some great news! I had my first appointment there this Monday and my second one today and everything has been so amazing. They are super friendly there, they really try to make you comfortable. The first thing I was asked was if I had a name I preferred over my given name, and which portions I preferred. At the appointment today I told the psychologist that I had been very nervous about starting the treatment due to all that things I'd heard. She told me that all those things are because just a few years ago a lot of patients couldn't get the treatment they felt they needed.

And here comes the important part. She then told me that today, regardless of how all your talks there go, I the end ** you have the final choice regarding treatment**. This means that the new system practically functions like the American informed consent clinics, the process just takes slightly longer =)

I'm not worried about physically passing but vocally passing is a whole new story. I have to pass vocally or it'll be near impossible to get a job and the job I do get I'll face heavier discrimination that other jobs, cause I'd be around kids. 

Maybe I should have majored in a different major I majored into History.

And I want be a teacher starting next year in the fall but how realistic is that. Let's say I start September 2018 that would be 1 year and about 10 months on HRT. And I can't practice my voice till this summer because I live in a small apt with my always present roommate and no place for privacy until this summer. And I'm poor and in college I can't afford no voice therapy or even surgery. Surgery if I need it is years from now for me expenses wise. 

But honestly how many people actually end up passing vocally? And if I can't pass should I just go back to school after my bachelors for a new bachelors or something?

It turns out that I simply didn't want to date, as I was not sure about what I was doing all the time, and didn't want to be ""the good fiancee"", and having a ""normal social life"" as it was expected from my gender.

I was happy to discover this, but... I was also a kind of sad for my condition (I know, I still have to accept myself).
So, ""they were not right! Great... but... oh, crap!"" is my feeling.

Anyone else?

ellehutton,asktransgender,Progesterone and androgenic effects?,"I started micronized progesterone in october. Was taking it everyday for 3 months. Stopped for about 3 weeks and am now cycling 10 days on (3 days single dose, 4 days double dose and 3 days back at single dose) and 18 off.

I'm just wondering if progesterone has or can have strong androgen effects?
I felt some hip and breast growth during those 3 months but a lot of the lightening of body hair from estrogen was reversed and supercharged. Plus it just seemed to masculinize my face a bit or fight the estrogen effects.
Once I went off I swear my breast actually swelled for awhile and I started liking my face again.

Now I'm cycling and almost done with my first cycle but I feel similar androgen effects starting. I see it in my face first and pretty immediately. I feel like I don't even want to take at all anymore let alone cycle. I don't want to stunt my development by not having it everyday but seriously I don't think I can. I don't have major side effects on progesterone except appearance wise. But not sure if I can even handle cycling it. Maybe I should just shut up and deal with it for 10 days out of the month while I have the opportunity.

Is this possible? Progesterone fighting your estrogen or the effects of it?"
tinyshain,asktransgender,Is it worth trying to educate cis people?,"I was reading comments on the article posted about the fact that transgender boys are now allowed to be in Boy Scouts, and was appalled at how many people still perceive being transgender to be a mental illness, or that they conflate it with sexuality, or they think surgeries are being performed on young children, etc.

I don't think that any trans person has an obligation to educate cis people, but I feel like it may be helpful for some of us, if we choose, to do so.

But is it worth it? Can we change people's minds and give them a different perspective? Will people that hold biogted viewpoints ever change their minds? And, how can we educate people in a way they'll be receptive to the new information?"

ConfusedBeing_04,asktransgender,"I feel trapped, and it's killing my sanity.","Hi there,

This is a cry for help I guess. It's been 8 month since I clicked, 5 since I came out to myself. I've been at support groups girl mode, invested myself in it as a staff member, Collected clothes, makeup, outed myself to my girlfriend who's supportive, she even does my makeup sometimes, long story short: I've been really into exploring that side of me and I liked it. I'm not on hrt yet, that should come in a couple of months.

So until a few days ago I've been pretty consistent in my belief that I was transgender and that I should transition. I was really excited each time something got me close to being a woman, and I felt right most of the time, except a couple of times when dysphoria decided to hide under a tree for hours or a day.

But this time is kind of different I guess. I'm really comfortable with my gf, my life has been great, everything's ""fine"". But suddenly I had this very lucid vision of the future with me transitioning, and it **scared the fuck out of me**. I feel like I could lose everything, and that life as a boy could be pretty much enjoyable if I stayed one. Also I feel trapped because if I decided not to transition, I'm terrified that the people I came out to would think I am insane. Sometimes I feel like I'm becoming insane: I feel stuck, and scared, and it doesn't go away. I'm not sure of anything anymore, and I feel like I'm going to blow up. Sometimes I feel like my dysphoria is GONE for good, and that maybe is was only some form of OCD. I don't know.

Is this normal? What should I do? I feel fucked up and that is... horrible right now. I'm afraid that I could become suicidal, which never happened to me before....

Edit: This is pretty recent, little less than a week. But it's the longest I had so far after I came out to myself."

How can I get my muscles to shrink? They have not been shrinking on hrt despite not working out and running everyday.

If I had more time I would run like I use to and run 100+ miles a week to literally burn my muscles as fuel like I did during my first year of college when I thought I was going to transition.

I've stopped smoking completely. I have had multiple head injuries due to me playing football. On weed I heard voices, they sounded like my own thoughts but they were not, they told me I was gay (I believed it) they told me I was a girl (I believed it) they even made me feel as if my body had turned into a girls. I did not enjoy any experience and each was even more confusing and scarier than the last. You guys pushed me to seek help, so I did. I developed HOCD and TOCD directly after these events (without knowing either was a possible thing) I talked to many gender therapist who either say I suffered a psychotic break or that I am suffering from some interesting form of TOCD. I'm on antidepressants now...and it has brought the edge off a bit I've noticed. I have never wanted a man or have wanted to be a women. But the voices told me otherwise. I think I understand now. They eluded to this ""big secret"" I have had that I've wanted to tell my family my whole life. Something I believed was the aforementioned thoughts above at the moment I was having them. I have recently realized that I was a victim of molestation when I was younger. I am not ready to talk about why, not even to my therapist, but I am very certain to this point. I believe that is the ""big secret"". I believe that my head injuries/my past has manifested on marijuana that brought out the thoughts ""you're gay/I'm gay"" and ""you're a girl/you're a women trapped in a man's body"". I can't explain why weed makes me feel as a women, but if I liked being a women I wouldn't have stopped smoking...the voice said other things, like I don't like playing football and I wanna quit and I'm not good enough, things like that. I want to thank you all here for talking me through all of this and helping me sort out my thoughts. Especially bubbles who put my in my place on more than one occasion. I'm 18 years old and for the first time in a long time I am excited about my future again. I hope the best for all of you and am truly appreciative because I have my life back on the right track. Happy new year everyone, I hope 2017 brings you all happiness in all your endeavors. "

Girls clothes seem so much better than mens clothes. Men's clothes are dull and boring. I'd love to wear a dress, tights (or pantyhose) and some high heels.

I'm their first trans employee in store and that has been stated as an excuse for slow progress, however surely two months is enough time to read company policy, inform members of staff etc?

cdortrans,asktransgender,Most of my dysphoria is linked towards clothes?,"Since I was 6 I've always had a thing for girls clothes. I'd dream about wearing the girls uniform to school, I remember hearing about the ""dress punishment"" where ones' parents would punish their child by making them wear girls clothes, makeup etc. But I never saw that as a punishment, I saw that as a reward. Obviously it never happened, I think I did tell my parents about it hoping they do it on me, then I'd purposely do something bad so they made me do it. They never did. 


But then at 12 I was home alone more, and I could crossdress in private home. It was more of a fetish than anything though. Everytime I'd have a shower I'd wrap the towel round me like it was a dress, just something to do. I became obsessed with outfits, especially office wear.  I never had a thing for underwear. 





Here I am, 17 and I get really dysphoric over clothes. I just see a woman wearing a dress, I get so jealous and want to wear it. It's just, I hate how society is fine with girls wearing dresses, but a guy wears one and instantly he is a drag queen. 


The thing is, is that now crossdressing in private doesn't excite me. It only makes me depressed because I have to wear men's clothes and I really have no option. Plus I'm just a man in a dress, and not a woman. If I were a girl I'd wear dresses or skirts everyday, I probably wouldn't own a pair of trousers. 


If I were born a girl I'd just be like another other girl, I wouldn't have to worry about any of this. I'd be raised like a girl and would be more feminine. I would just be who I want to be.  I can transition but I'd always be AMAB. Being male just upsets me. I look down, I see a flat chest and not a nice one with breasts.  I get annoyed when I get erections over thinking about this because it makes me think it's all a fetish. 



Is this normal? Am I just a confused drag queen or crossdresser?

He is the perfect date : caring, hard worker, realistic and handsome. I told him these things and I shared my fears with him. He replied with :  a princess like you needs a tad more self confidence to face this hard world and I'm going to help you with your self image and show you how love worthy you are. I cried and he ruined my mascara lol.

So this is a date. I believe he is being genuine because I dropped the bomb about that I will never be able to carry children of my own and he replied that adoption is always an option he is open for if it works out.

Anyway, I got more responses than I thought, but then I had someone from /r/GenderCritical/ telling me that this sub is toxic, and how that I'm probably just confused and reading this is just causing me even more confusion. Then someone posted about that post on that sub.


This person told me that they de-transitioned, and that people on this sub convinced him transitioning will fix everything, they transitioned, then went back, and completely messed up their life, and saying to get off this sub before I get confused anymore.


I don't really know who to trust anymore. They where all like that this sub is so pro-trans, that confused cis people are coming on here, people say that they are trans, they become incredibly confused, and it just makes the whole situation worse.


They said that I'm just going through some teen-phase, I'm cis and just gotten really confused from this sub.




A friend told me not to trust anything they said, they are just a trans hate group, but what that person says sticks in my head... he said his feelings was the same as mine, and that this sub just made him more confused, transitioned, regretted it then de-transitioned.




Before I even discovered /r/asktransgender, or reddit all together  I would of said I was cisgender. I've always liked crossdressing in private, but then I discovered gender dypshoria. I started reading about gender dypshoria, and I read about how it feels, then I started feeling like this. I watched a video on youtube where someone said ""if I can't be a girl I don't want to live"" and I started feeling like that, but only after I heard that.



Not sure who to trust anymore. I want to see a therapist, but with no money, and the NHS waiting lists now being 2.5 years, I doubt I will be alive when I finally get an appointment anyway, there is no point in bothering.

I have lost 170ish pounds this year through hard work and determination. I am starting to feel a lot of dysphoria around the female form that's taking shape. I never really had curves or breasts that stood out from stomach before.

I was questioning a little before, and have lots of dreams/day dreams/thoughts about being male especially when I was growing up, but thought they were just a phase/ had to do with a lot of the fantasy novels I read as a kid (Alanna the Lioness, ect). Thought it was just the Mulan fantasy?

My partner is trans and I don't know if I'm just wanting to be in the same boat, or if I am really questioning.

I've been reading some of the Trans and Genderqueer subs and I must admit some trepidation about posting some of this as I fear some negative responses. I present this with all due respect and perhaps some level of ignorance but never malice. Certainly, never malice.

I am a very straight cis-male. I've had many gay, queer, and or tans friends for decades. I have had little (verging on none) sexual contact with men. What many would call youthful experimentation at the most. I have had one friendly and fun experience with a post-op transexual woman, MTF ... part of my continued ignorance shows in how I describe her perhaps. She was always she to me and I didn't know she was trans until we had been flirting for some time. In my head I think of her as her and don't bother with the history unless it's relevant.

But I ramble.

I have had thoughts, feelings, and some not well formed fantasies about FTM trans men. My attraction to trans men does not carry over to male genitalia however and the fact that under the male dress and manor is a biological woman is important for my romantic and sexual interest. In many ways, the ability for him to pass is public is a huge turn on.

I have recently met a genderqueer/genderfluid woman who lives mostly as androgynous and masculine. All of our interaction has been with her, as she put it ""femmed up"" because that male/female relationship is something she was interested in with me. After spending some time together it was pretty clear that most of her life away from me is lived as a trans man/genderqueer. We have not discussed our relationship pasts in exacting detail but it seems the vast majority of her romantic and sexual relationships have been with lesbian women and trans people of various descriptions. She was a little surprised when I sussed her out as FTM trans and expressed a pre-existing interest within hours of meeting her.

Since she is interested in me as a man and I am interested in her in all of her ... uh ... ? ... and I am interested in all of her ... him ... them ? but now faced with someone that presents a possibility to explore and experience this vague desire of mine and I'm a bit confused and a little overwhelmed. For me, because I am me, and because of her interest in me as a man she does tend to present herself as a her. She is aware of my interest in her as a he and we have had some interesting talks about it. All of this leaves me a bit out of sorts and stomping all over what would be my usual comfort zone.

I am who I am. I don't have some great existential conflict here. I'm not concerned with or doubting my masculinity or even my sexuality. I feel no great need to somehow identify other than how I have identified my entire life. What I don't have is a model for this sort of relationship. What I'm unsure of is how to help my new found friend express all aspects of her personality within this relationship. What I'm not sure of is how to fully express some of these vague long standing thoughts, fantasies, and desires centered on MTF trans men. 

My relationship models tell me (and in the nature of our fledgling relationship) buying her flowers, things that are pink or purple, opening and holding doors for her, even feminine lingerie are the norm. What I'm having trouble with is that I don't know how to ... or at least have no experience with being in a relationship with someone who lives much of their life apart from me as something other than a woman. Can anyone offer any suggestions for bringing these aspects of her personality and identity in to a more prominent place between us? Are there gifts, tokens, activities, date nights that might better allow these sorts of interactions between us. I have no problem at all going to trans, queer, or other LGBTQXYZ event, gathering or bar but she seems hesitant and feels that I might not be welcome. Playing catch or going to a game isn't something I would do ... ever ... so I'm left with this heterosexual relationship model, which in many ways she likes between us, that doesn't entirely fulfill or encompass the entirety of our personalities and I'm not sure how to proceed.

Last night I was hanging out with Joel and Russ, and out of nowhere Joel starts talking about trans people. I braced myself for what he was going to say. He kept saying transgenders first of all. That's just ignorance. I corrected him in that. 

Then he went on and on. I tried correcting him on all the stupid things that he was saying. It didn't help. The subject was finally changed, but not before he said something that really rocked me to my core, ""If someone was murdered and their body was burned they would indentify you by your true gender based on your pelvic bone and teeth.""

That's just bullshit, but I can't help but let it affect me. I nearly started crying on the spot, but managed to hold it together. 

I don't why I'm doing this to myself. I'm the one who is surrounding myself with people like him. But it's not like there's many more people for me to hang out with. I'm just at a loss right now. I can stop hanging out with him but I'd have to make up an excuse. He doesn't even know about how I feel, so can I really get that mad. I think I can. 

What would you recommend?

Just as an aside: I once posted here asking if people were transphobic if they didn't want to date someone who was trans. I did this because my true best friend said he wouldn't. I think that was wrong of me to do. He is an ally to me, and I feel like I spit in his face by coming here behind his back to rant to everyone about him. He's the first person I told, and he has encouraged me to be myself more than anyone else in my life. I just want to apologize to him here where I first ranted about him. He didn't deserve that. Seeing someone who truly would dislike me if they knew I was trans helped me to realize this. "

two of my earliest memories where i felt different was basically when i was very young, i remember feeling like my you know what area was ugly and ""should be flat"" even before even knowing really what a vagina was, the other was when i was sent to a doctor once by my mom, the doctor referred to me when talking to my mom as ""Your daughter bla bla bla""...all i remember, heared and cared about was he said ""daughter"", it's one of my most happiest memories. As a kid, i was also super gentle, sensitive, cried a lot and was very loving, i was pretty feminine too.

Later on, i was more tomboyish/boyish in the way that i liked playing with swords, super hero toys, video games, i also liked playing with cooking toys, animal plushies, figurines and i used to put on my mom's make up for a while, i also loved wearing an skirt for men in asian culure (sarong) which was my way of feeling more feminine eventhough it was ugly as sin i loved feeling like i was wearing a skirt. 

Then i reached puberty (i think i reached it at age 9), i went crazy, wanting a female body and wanting to live as a girl and be a girl in every way, i wished i would wake up one day and wake up a girl.I started cross dressing at this age too and it always made me feel at peace, it may have ended sexually but the main reason i did it was because i just felt happy, like everything was right. I also had a friend who i was albe to play make believe where he was a hero and i was always the damsel in distress (it was asia in the 90's lol), I also was semi-flirtatious with boys however i was in an all-boys school so when i went to school at about age 12, I would presentted as if i was tougher but felt the same way inside. My interests was this age was bascially video games and tv (i loved WWE) i also remember watching Ranma 1/2 and wishing i was the powers Ranma had (it's an anime where a boy has the ability to change his body to female), as i grew older after years of getting bullied in school because i was gentle, pretty soft still and awkward.

Later on i would been taken out of school because of the bullying, after this i became more aggressive as a defense mechanism, At this point deep down i still felt the same feelings of wishing i was born a girl, wanting a female body etc. Living in asia which was very conservative, i honestly didn't know there was such a thing as a sex change..i pretty much thought i had to be male till the day i died and that was just life, so i thought i was either gay or a cross dresser but again, living in a conservative country i had already been bullied for just being gentle, i felt if i accepted that i was different in any way, it was bascially suicide. At this point i was somewhere in between in my presentation, i was goth which was basically my way of thinking ""I can dress femininely and no one will ""figure me out"", however also not feeling like there was a choice in life besides ""male"", i tried to live life as a guy and make it work, trying to be a normal guy in everyway sense of the word, it was never what i wanted and i was never happy, because that's not how i saw myself nor was it ever who i wanted to be.

Anyway, after that basically i transitioned, eventhough my life isn't perfect, i've been so much happier and at peace, something i never felt nor had before."

I don't want to pressure them to transition or make any lifestyle changes that they might not want to, but I also want to let them know of what options are available to them if they decide to transition and what they might be able to do to feel better about their identity if they decide to not transition.

They told me how they've been feeling about their gender identity and I think it sounded very similar to my own experience, but they have some circumstances that might make them decide to not transition even if they want to. I introduced them to a few different nonbinary identifiers and talked to them about how transitioning is great for some people but not for others and how there are a lot of options, but I might have missed some important details because I really wasn't expecting it and they seemed very uncomfortable talking about it so I was trying to respond quickly in a way that let them know I would be understanding and try to help whatever conclusion they come to.

evilpenguin234,asktransgender,Has anyone had success changing their birth certificate gender marker with a procedure other than SRS?,"Question pretty much applies to the people who's birth states supposedly require SRS to change the marker.

I was born in North Carolina, where the requirement states that

&gt;A written request from an individual is received by the State Registrar to
change the sex on that individual's birth record because of sex reassignment
surgery, if the request is accompanied by a notarized statement from the
physician who performed the sex reassignment surgery or from a physician
licensed to practice medicine who has examined the individual and can
certify that the person has undergone sex reassignment surgery

Has anyone gotten away with having a relatively minor procedure used as the surgery mentioned? The one I'm thinking about offhand is for me to just get an orchi - that's pretty permanent, not to mention way cheaper and easier than full on vaginoplasty. As long as the doctor's note doesn't specifically say what the surgery is there's no way they'd know, right?

ringinghere,asktransgender,Question about using parent's insurance,"Honestly even posting here on an alt feels scary, like I'm really admitting to thinking about this. But here I am so I'd like some help understanding something.

I'm still not 100% sure I'm a trans woman, but I think I'm maybe 80% there, and I'd like to try seeing a gender therapist to help me figure things out. I'm in my early 20s, live with my father, and am covered by his insurance.

I don't know the details of what (if any) the insurance will provide for out of network therapists, which a gender therapist would likely be. My father has paid for therapy for me in the past, for anxiety and depression. I haven't been in therapy for a while, but haven't really needed it recently. 

Even MORE recently, however, I've started questioning my gender and experiencing a lot of anxiety related to that, and it's been showing. Dad wants me to try meeting with a therapist again and I'd like to hit to birds with one stone here, but I'm neither out nor ready to be. He has asked me to research therapists in the area and to give him a name to get in contact with. 

How feasible would it be to meet with a therapist, pay for it myself, then talk to my father after the session and still have him be able to get money from the insurance for that session (assuming, of course, there's anything at all for out of network therapists)?

katie-elizabeth,asktransgender,Oh my damn! Breasts really are like an entire new sensual organ. (NSFW),"I thought that I enjoyed nipple play before transition, and had a misconception that's how women felt their breasts as well.  It was an understandable mistake to make.  But that is *not* how actual breasts feel.  
  
Comparing the pleasure that a man gets from his nipples to what a woman can feel in her breast is like a sparkler to a showcase firework.  The *entire* thing is an erogenous zone.  
  
Admittedly, I only have little breast buds at this point, and they ache a lot (in addition to being sensitive as hell).  But there is a new world of pleasure available now.  Nipple play isn't even really required, and I cringe when I think of the manhandling I must have done in years past to cis women.  
  
Just tracing the fingers around the breast, gently cupping them, lightly squeezing them... all these actions are enough to make your face flush with delicious feelings.  And it's a deep, satisfying, upper-body filling pleasure too.  This isn't some tiny localized twinge like with male nipples.  
  
It ties into the estrogen and the three-dimensionality of emotions that come with female hormones, but suffice it to say it is an all-encompassing experience that creates enough of an erotic universe inside your own mind that little external stimuli is needed.  Now it's increasingly clear to me why females don't seem to need porn or much external excitement - because there is already an overload going on inside the nervous system and brain.   
  
If the experience of testosterone-charged sexual buildup and release looks like this:  https://i.imgur.com/kcTGp51.png then I can only compare the estrogen-charged version of that (with developed breasts) to this: https://i.imgur.com/WstO1oM.gif

sophiasentiment,asktransgender,How can I decide what surgery I ought to go for first?,"How can I decide what surgery I ought to go for first? FFS or GRS?  

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Sorry if my opinions or reasoning seem offensive or incongruent with other users, these are just my experiences.  

&amp;nbsp;

Both seem equally important to me. I am saving for FFS with Facial Team in Spain and GRS most likely with Chettawut. I will soon have the funds for ONE procedure and am distraught and burdened with deciding which to go for first, knowing it could be years before I could afford the other. To me, life is not complete without both.  

&amp;nbsp;

To anyone who had to prioritize and pick one surgery to go for first; how did you manage to make such a decision?  

&amp;nbsp;

To me it is overwhelming and I have no idea how to choose. I have tried to think of pros and cons but so often feel I come out equal. I lean towards FFS first simply because I feel crowd sourcing money is a more viable option for GRS which more people seem to understand and sympathize with. Unfortunately I think most people see FFS as cosmetic vanity. That is my basic question. If it helps anyone, I've listed my thoughts about both surgeries below.  

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you for reading my post. I'm very nervous posting here but depression has become almost unbearable and I have no idea of where else I can go for support as I have no-one in my personal life.  

&amp;nbsp;

EXTRA READING:  
FFS  
-Passing is very important to me. I look disgustingly masculine and desperately want to be able to walk through life like my female friends.  
-My face is probably one of the biggest ""changeable"" things that affect my passing.  
-I want to be attractive to someone as female. Most interest anyone takes in me is often because (as they explain to me) they are attracted to skinny, effeminate men.  
-I wonder if it will be easier to burden my genitals if the outside world still sees and recognizes me as female.  
-Distraught as I would still have to carry my genitals everywhere and be reminded of what I am.  

&amp;nbsp;

GRS  
-Probably my biggest personal concern, having GRS would be a massive personal comfort and sense of meaning.  
-It is something I have wanted since childhood.  
-I want to be able to have sex in a way that feels safe and normal to me.  
-I am tired of being told it would be too difficult for partners to be with me as it would ""feel like being with a man""  
-But how could I find a meaningful relationship while I still look male?  
-To the outside world I still look just as male.  "
Thu0117,asktransgender,"When I am alone I feel MTF, when I'm in public I'm agender?","When I am alone, I can often get angry, upset, really dysphoric and sometime suicidal about being AMAB. I just hate the fact I was born male and not female. I feel like if I were born a girl everything would be so much better. I imagine myself as a woman, and it feels so much better.


When I am in public, I feel agender. I don't really feel like anything. I see guys, I don't feel like a guy. I see women, I'd rather be like them but it seems more of a fantasy rather than anything.

In my dreams I am completely cisgender, I am just like any other guy (sometimes trans stuff comes up, but hardly ever).

I honestly don't know why I feel like this. I'd rather feel female, but I don't continuously think about being female. 


Sometimes I think living as a guy will be so much easier. People don't judge as much, I don't have to worry about makeup, passing, etc. It makes me wonder why transition in the first place, but when I am alone I feel like I can't live as a guy much longer.



I'm so scared of not being trans, to the point where I don't want to do anything about it in case I discover I'm not really trans. Maybe I am messing with my own mind, playing tricks into making me think I am transgender. I don't know. Is it strange to think this? Does anyone else think this?


At the moment (01:10), I don't really know how I feel, but probably in an hour or so my gender dysphoria will get really bad and I will have suicidal thoughts, or get really angry or something. It's mostly worse at night and fine in the morning and afternoon.

I'd rather be an AFAB agender than a AMAB agender. I'd even rather be FTM, because I'd still have memories of being female (is that strange, too?)


I have just turned 17, AMAB, and mostly closeted. I've told a couple of people I am transgender, although I am not 100% sure if I am or not, and I kind of regret telling them."

Thank you! "
Maya-K,asktransgender,I refuse to be associated or seen with other transwomen in my day-to-day life. I'm conflicted over this. Has my cautiousness become cruelty? (WALL OF TEXT),"I'm not really sure where to start, aside from saying that I feel bad over the entire thing. I avoid other trans women as a rule of thumb, and I know I ought not pretend as though an entire group of people doesn't exist, but my situation kind of backed me into a corner where I feel I didn't used to have a huge amount of choice. Now, I'm not so sure.

From what I gather, I'm an odd case of a trans girl. I transitioned aged 16, am now 24, but I've had no surgery of any kind and have only ever been on HRT for a five-week period between May-June last year - I had to stop as I was getting immense chest pain. The rest of these eight years, though, I've made do without HRT, because various things keep preventing me from getting it.

Yet in that entire time, I've passed. I go out, nobody questions what they see, they make an unconscious judgement of me as female and don't bother looking twice. Nobody pays me any particular attention in that regard. I'm not aware of ever being clocked, aside from within the first two months or so of my transition, when I was awkward and didn't really know what I was doing. I've never been deadnamed. Particularly, I have *never* been misgendered, not even a single time.

I live in what I would call 'Honest-Semi-Stealth': nobody other than my family, a few friends and family friends mostly from before I transitioned, and my doctor, know I'm trans, but nobody else because I actively avoid ever giving any hint that I am. When I encounter a situation with someone, however, where the choices would be 'pretend I'm cis' or 'admit being trans', if I'm with a group of women discussing periods and they turn to me, for instance, I'll then admit being trans. These are the source of the few other, non-close-friend people who know I'm trans. Nobody else does.

I can do this, live in stealth and completely pass without HRT, because my puberty messed up. I was AMAB, but... let's say the male parts never really worked. I got landed with things like light facial and body hair, but also grew breasts, for example. My voice gained the ability to pitch deeper but never lost the higher ranges it had before that, so I simply 'switched' to a female voice when I transitioned instead of having to train myself. I have the smallest adult hands I've ever seen, feet are a similar story, I'm very short and have what is essentially a female skeleton with narrow shoulders and wider hips. My facial structure was never really hit by testosterone. Why all this, as examples, happened to me, is still unknown. Nobody can give me an answer. It's been very confusing over the years. When younger, I used to wonder if I was 'destined' to be female after all, given the changes my body went through.

In the first year or so of transition, the only other trans people I could find in my fairly-small city were a small group of perhaps 10-15, all of whom were at least 40 years old and hence more than twice my age, sometimes more than four times as old. On that level, I couldn't relate to them and found myself rather set apart. But there was immediately something else: all had transitioned in middle-age and maybe one-fifth of them could pass on a good day, the rest unfortunately stood little chance. But then there's me - I don't think I make an attractive woman, but I can go and fetch groceries straight from bed with messy hair and no makeup, in a men's t-shirt and baggy jeans, and still pass. I became very concious of this around that group, realizing I was the odd-one-out, and more, I became very conscious of how aware they all were of this. Further than that, I've never been very feminine, more like a tomboy who owns no dresses but wouldn't trade her hoodies for anything and fits into the edge of the alternative scene. These things work in direct contrast to the stereotype of 'extremely feminine transwoman', which I think helps me blend in even further.

At the time, I was both hung up on thinking I didn't pass, worrying about supposedly masculine traits in my face which I was seeing in a distorted manner, and felt uncomfortable and guilty with knowing how much more natural a female I looked than them. Over time, these combined into me starting to avoid them all: I felt unsure over my ability to pass as female, and thought that being around the members of that group, with them not passing, would push suspicion onto me - person-on-street clocks visible transwoman, looks at who she's with and is already in a mindset to look deeper at what they see. I was terrified of the result, of someone realizing I was trans through association, because I'd heard all the stories of violence. To me, as the powerless teen that I was, nothing seemed worse. After that point, I never went back to that group.

I'm older now, but that fear never left me. I'm terrified of being clocked through association with trans women who don't pass as close to 100% of the time as possible, and I've never knowingly met someone who fit that in person. Originally this isolation was due mainly to the thought of potentially being a victim of violence should the wrong person find out, but while that is still a factor, other aspects have emerged over time.

I'm now also terrified of being misgendered. In my early days of transition, I probably wouldn't have been, but now I'm actively afraid of the possibility. I read about it, and it's described as being horrible, the worst disrespect when deliberate and removing the validity one feels about oneself when accidental. This has never happened to me, and after hearing about it so much, I'm now desperate to ensure it never happens at all. I want to be able to go to my grave while truthfully saying *""Nobody ever called me 'him' or 'sir' after I transitioned""*. The thought of the opposite being true fills me with a sense of dread. I suppose I'd almost prepared for it in earlier years, but now that one precious pillar of my stealth is still standing tall most of a decade later, I can't abide the thought of it falling. And I suppose part of my fear of people knowing I'm trans is because I know it changes their perception of me. Sure, they'll tell me it doesn't, but I see it in them - they've been surprised, they think they've been caught out and wonder if they could have seen it before had they looked harder. Their eyes will scan me for anything 'male', almost without their recognition. I hate that, I can't stand it. But that reaction is natural, it can't be prevented - I can only prevent people finding out about me in the first place.

And I suppose that aversion to being clocked also comes down to me only ever wanting to be a woman. I never wanted to be a transwoman, I never wanted to be a woman with asterisks or additional information in parentheses. Just a woman as far as the world cared, nothing else. I'm not ashamed of being trans, not at all, but it definitely isn't something I'm *proud* of. I'm fortunate enough that I get to live this: my world is one where I am 'just a woman', and I can ignore and forget that I'm trans 95% of the time.

And other transwomen rattle that without meaning to. They shake that comfortable world I live in. I feel bad about that, because I don't want to exclude most transwomen from my life, but I feel most of all that I have to protect myself, and this is how I do it. I might have continued doing this until my dying day but for an incident which happened in November: while shopping, I spotted a woman nearby who was visibly and audibly trans. Other people avoided her, taking longer routes around shelves just so as to not be near her. I did the same without thinking.

Later, I asked myself if my actions there were so different to the other people who avoided her: they were uncomfortable, I was uncomfortable. We had different reasons for that, but the outcome was the same: we all acted as though she was something to be far away from. I tried putting myself in her shoes, realizing she was probably hoping for someone to validate her - this was the women's section of a clothes store - and that when I was newly-transitioned, I would have appreciated any recognition, so unsure of myself was I. For years I'd been protecting my stealth by refusing to be seen near transwomen, and now I was feeling such shame that I wanted to go back right then and apologize, though by that point it would have been impossible.

That experience has rattled me. I'm not really sure what to think about it all, now. I suppose I knew all along that I was excluding people from my life, but I never saw it as ostracizing anyone - now I'm not so sure. What harm might I have done in the 8 years since I transitioned? Me, not being seen as trans, as just another woman in the crowd, those transwomen I avoided would never have known my reasons - to them, I was just *'some cis girl who's ignoring me like everyone else, maybe she's even laughing internally'*.

I don't want to be that person. I would, ideally, like to be better in those kind of situations when they occur - if I could go back, I'd like to be able to walk up to that woman I saw while shopping and ask what she was looking at, whether she'd bought anything, what styles she liked. To be a better person to her. I don't inherently want to be someone who thinks *'they're trans, protect yourself, turn around and walk away'*. I also don't want to feel like I'm at all risking my stealth, ever. Perhaps I've gotten myself into a loop with that and there's no real risk, but that's a hard thought to get past. People fear what they don't know, and... I don't know what it's like to not live in near-total stealth 100% of the time.

So, if anyone has opinions on this mess my head is in, please throw them at me, no matter what they are. I'm a big girl now, I can take criticism. And sorry for the wall, I wanted to get this out."

I try to tell him that while healthy scepticism is a good thing, I've asked myself all these questions: with being transgender the only way to truly tell if it's the correct path is to try HRT, because it's such a subjective feeling. And I understand why he's sceptical; I've always been kind of masculine in my interests and such, gender dysphoria is difficult to differentiate from other depressive conditions etc., but I keep stressing other things (such as my developmental difficulties growing up, the ineffectiveness of anti-depressants and therapy), trying to keep things strictly scientific in order to appeal to his rationalism. 

He says that I may do whatever I feel I need to do to be happy, and that's a lot better than I can say for a lot of parents' reactions to their children's transgenderism. 

Part of me hopes I'm wrong about this, but moreover I hope I'm right, just to end this ceaseless quest for the answer to my constant depression, to feel like I fit in somewhere, somehow, to feel comfortable in my own skin and not feel like an outcast. If I'm wrong will I ever find an answer?

At first my Dad always uses the stock phrases: ""Just get on with it. Just plough in the other direction. Just do something. Just get a job. Just get a girlfriend."" None of these things help; I simply can't do them. What do I tell him? How do I stop feeling as though I'm some warbling, desperate disappointment lazily seeking an easy escape from their problems? 

I haven't even told my mother; just the prospect of the fall out from this and how difficult it will make my life make me wish I was either cisgender (which at this point would be a relief but I doubt it's the case), or dead.

What can I do, or say? "

xXWhoAmI121Xx,asktransgender,What is wrong with me? Am I trans or am I just losing my mind?,"Good evening reddit,
I dont even know if this is a real question, but I feel like I have to talk to someone about it. I'm 21yo and biologically male. I really dont know if I felt that way all my life, but when I where 13 or 14 I thought to myself, that I might be female inside. This feeling never ever vanished since that day. In the past I tried to talk about it with some classmates and my parents, but I'm a very shy person and I could never really open up to anyone. Soon they forgot the whole thing and took it as a phase of me growing up. 

The next years where terrible as depression where coming and going. 4 years ago I reached a point where I lost the control over my feelings and tried to hang myself. Easy to tell it failed. 

As the years went by, my feelings about me being female grew stronger, but my thoughts about transitioning got worse. At this point I dont think that it would make me happy to start a transition. Everytime I look in the mirror I see this man there and I know, he will never completly vanish. Something will stay. Maybe its everyone will be able to tell I was born a boy just by looking at me or maybe it would be my voice that will uncover my past.

I'm so unsecure about my feelings. Is it even possible that I am trans, when I dont believe  that a transition could make me happy, thus meaning there is no chance I EVER will be able to be a woman?"

henx125,asktransgender,How did you choose your name?,"While my parents gave a somewhat androgynous name that I think would work fine either way sometimes it still feels like a bit embarrassing to tell people who know that I am trans that I'm still using the same name.

To that end, I've been trying to think up random names to use as backups for the possible future but nothing seems to fit me. 

Honestly, the idea of naming myself seems silly - I personally feel that names have more meaning when someone else came up with it - so it seems like anything I could come up with would fit me less than the name I was originally given.

Does anyone else feel similar? And how did you go about choosing a name that you felt fit you?"
Throwaway999333222,asktransgender,Maybe I should just end it tonight,"I've got a couple hours before my mom goes to bed and the night to hide in. I should just go out, find somewhere to jump off of, or somewhere to get hit by a car, or killed by a mugger.

I can't stand the body I was given, nor the voice, and especially not the face. Looking at pictures of myself, seeing my reflection, feeling my body, hearing my voice ... It's gotten to practically be torture to me. I am not pretty, attractive, passable, or even AVERAGE in looks. Friends have called me ugly, people on this site (not sub) have done so as well, even on generously and generally complimentary people ...

I can't stand it. Since posting photos of myself to r/amiugly and reading the responses ... I just feel dead. When I look in the mirror everday, when I get in the shower every night, I look at myself and reel in disgust before looking closer because of morbid curiosity. This repeats until I'm a cowering, shakig mess, staring at my reflection and watching it stare back at me. Then I get angry and scared at and of my own body. I want to scream, to shatter the mirror and my reflection and feel the shards cut into my oversized man hands.

IAnd sure, you can say it gets better, or with time it will pass, but I've been told that for years and guess what? It hasn't! What a surprise! I live in a world that hates us, that hates people like me, that rejects people like me. And as ic being trans wasn't enough, I'm lesbian, so I'm sure the TERFs want my head on pike, I'm also fat ad ugly raised in a society that values beauty over everything.

I cannot see anything good about myself anymore. If I do, I find myself remembering the times close friends have called me ugly, or I read the ppsts on my images until my phone is shaking and my breathing is shallow. I cannot change this, I cannot change who I am or what I look like, but I so wish I could. 

And even if I can with surgery? It won't even be me anymore. I'll just be another engineered fake, a poser, trying desperate to make itself feel like ANYTHING more than an 'it'. I mean, that's how fucking inhuman I feel now, that I literally refer to myself as an it! Fucking rich, right?

I was, am, and always will be a mistake, and one that should be fixed. But nothing short of death fixes a fat ugly vain freak like me. I deserve to feel this way, I DESERVE to be unhappy, and most of all? What I deserve is death. The world would be better of without a hideous monster like me anyway.

And I'm sorry for posting so much. I just ... all these issues I keep from my friends are too much, and are dismissed by my family and therapists. I just can't fucking take this anymore. "
CanItPleaseJustStop,asktransgender,Been wondering forever now.,"Hello! I'm 19 years old(almost 20) and I've been wondering if I am trans for quite a while now.
So.. Here's my life story. 
It all started when I was 11 years old, and for the first time read Ranma1/2. 
(A manga about a guy that can switch genders when contacting either hot or cold water.)
I really enjoyed it and read all the Volumes.

I later became afraid of touching water, as if I thought it would happen to me, that fear didn't last long.
I have since developed a Gender-Bender fetish and its one of the only things that can really get me off.

When I was 14 years old and exploring my sexuality I came across a post saying that my attraction to Women might just be Admiration and that wasn't sexually attracted to them, and that I was Trans.

This really burned into my mind and I Strongly remember those weeks as the worst weeks of my life.
I was pretty much questioning everything, and the only thing I could think off was whenever I was Trans or not.
 I got so emotionally crushed that I either wanted to Die, forget I even had this thought or just wake up one day and be a Woman.

Then I just pretty much stopped thinking about it, and continued with my life.
 Puberty came and I didn't really care about it.
 More or less I was happy since I was much later than everyone else. I had those times when I thought I might be trans, but in the end I just decided it wasn't me, and that in the end I was happy at the moment, and that there were no reason to change that. 

Fast forward to the end of last year. I have now for one year now suffered depression, or a sense of lack of purpose like everything is pointless.

And I read about this trans thing, and started thinking about it again, I read about it online and that other people have experienced similar things. especially the Gender bender manga thingy.

I also read that my depression and lack of purpose might be the result of Gender Dysphoria.

The last weeks have been absolute hell, there has not been a second That i have not questioned or tested myself.

Testing might mean things like, ""How did i feel about being called by male pronoun?"",
 ""Am  I attracted to her or do I just want to be like her?"". And when I think things like, I didn't really care about being called he/him, I wonder if I am lying to myself or if that is what I actually feel.

I look back in my past to try and find evidence, like ""I didn't really like sports when i grew up."" 
and sometimes ""I can't be Trans I have absolute no problem with my genitalia"".
and ""wait I really dislike having a erection sometimes"". and  ""It always felt uncomfortable  showering with the other guys after P.E"" and ""If I actually was trans how would I have made it through the large majority of puberty without a problem?"" 

I have also tried cross-dressing, it didn't do anything for me though it was a long time ago 

There have been moments when I am 100% sure that I am Trans/Not Trans. And I honestly don't know anymore. When I wake up, the first thing I ask myself is if I want to be a Girl or not.

It's causing me a lot of stress, and I haven't been able to sleep lately. 
I still occasionally forget about these thoughts and have a decent day.

Shit.. I don't want to be Trans.
There is so much extra work and pain.
Well thanks so much for Reading this, I'm seeing a psychologist soon.
I would still love your inputs though.
Hope you guys/gals have a wonderful day.

throwaway_2243,asktransgender,"In college, need advice","Throwaway since people know my reddit. 

About a year ago I started exploring this subreddit out of curiosity and I realized that my long time attraction to crossdressing might be something a whole lot more complex—a lot of things from my childhood and teenage years suddenly made sense. Since then, I’ve struggled with my gender quite a bit. Over the past few months, my dysphoria has increased to a point where I rarely go a day without questioning my gender or thinking of something transgender related. I’ve come to terms with the fact that I have to, at the very least, explore transition at some point in the future; however, there are so many roadblocks in my life at the moment.

I’m 20 years old, currently in my sophomore year of college out of state. To put it simply, I just don’t think I could fully transition while in college, it would be too difficult socially (I go to a small college) and it would almost certainly affect my academics in a negative way. Furthermore, I’m not sure my parents would support transition while continuing to pay for my education. That being said, it gives me anxiety to think that every year that passes makes transition a little harder. So I’m stuck in a hard place, and I don’t know what to do.

My question for you is, what can I start doing now that would make transition easier/faster/etc. once I graduate college? I’ve explored gender therapists in my hometown for when I come home this summer, but I don’t know how I’d pay for it without outing myself to parents (which I’m not ready for). Would going on anti-androgens for a few years be a feasible option to halt further masculinization until I am ready to fully transition? Would a low dose of hormones help dysphoria without noticeably changing me physically (breasts, impotence, sexual function,)? 

Thanks, any advice is appreciated. God knows this sub has already helped me a lot .

kuriatsu,asktransgender,What's the difference?,"I want to start out with saying I apologize, I don't mean to offend.

My question is this: 
We all should know about the ridiculous fallacy that is Texas latest choice.
What is the ""legal difference"" between a religion, and our believing that of our gender identity?

Basically, the way I see it(knowing next to nothing about law)  the judge has effectively stated by law that belief doesn't mean diddly squat and that transgendered people are vulnerable to discrimination as are those women who need an abortion. That's not entirely true in my opinion. He's effectively saying belief in general doesn't mean diddly squat by nullifying protections in place for having a (to them) ridiculous belief in the first place. Doesn't that also nullify religious protections because of a belief in something that cannot exactly be proven at this point in time, just like our belief of our gender identity?

If not, couldn't this be bypassed by playing the religion card ourselves? ""Genuinely held religious quality belief that we are and identify as _______"" 

I'm sorry if I offended anyone, just trying to learn, more or less.

I should point out that I have never had sex with a man but I've masturbated, etc over men. I never even thiught about women sexually. I keep thinking ""what if because i never had sex with a man or woman I'm just in denial"".

honaka_namnah,asktransgender,Can anyone help me with understanding non-binary?,"I'm MtF and don't identify as non-binary, maybe partly because I don't really understand what it means. Maybe my lack of understanding is similar to me having a hard time understanding why anyone would want to be a man. Rationally I fully accept that there are FtM people in a very similar (yet opposite) situation as myself but on an emotional level it just doesn't *click* why anyone would want to transition to become a man. I know it's just a projection of my brain telling me it has trouble being stuck in a male body. Maybe the fact that I don't really understand what non-binary entails is similar for me because it just isn't the case for me? If I'm making any sense?

Anyway, I do want to understand this better because being educated on the subject is important to me. I recently spoke to someone (MtF) who told me that ""non-binary/trangenderists don't really exist because they're fooling themselves"" which I found plain ignorant but I just didn't know what to reply. Another person (MtF) told me she thinks she's non-binary because she also likes male activities (like talking about military stuff). I don't really think that's really on point either because that way just about anyone is non-binary, right?

Isn't it more about how someone views themselves (having the body they feel comfortable in) and how they want to present themselves in social situations? I would assume that gender dysphoria would explain this correctly:

* Both a cis-woman and a trans-woman experience dysphoria when stuck in a male body or when regarded as male.
* A non-binary person experiences dysphoria when stuck in either a purely male or female body or when regarded purely as male or female.

Is that a good way to approach this or am I missing something? Any input is greatly appreciated!"

cheesykeyboard,asktransgender,Why does my dysphoric thoughts keep changing?,"Generally, when I lie on my bed, for some reason my dysphoric thoughts get really bad. Sometimes I get angry, start kicking/punching, and just feel really suicidal.


Then other times, often when I am at school, I don't really have that much dysphoria at all. I still don't feel ""right"" being male, but it doesn't bother me that much. Times like these I genuinely question why I even get angry/depressed/suicidal over it.


Other times, such as right now, I feel some dysphoria, I would like to transition, but I just don't really care about it. I'd like to be female, but I'm not that bothered by it. Right now I am sitting at my desk on my PC.



I find it often gets triggered one way or another. Like, I might be fine for hours, but as soon as I remember I am male, it triggers it. Often when I wake up in the morning, I completely forget about my dysphoria, then the thought comes into my head (often 30 seconds upon waking up) and then I get bad dysphoria. 


Mostly my dysphoria is fine in the morning, but bad at night. "
Fit_Trans_Chick,asktransgender,"Semi stealth by accident, potential legal issue at work due to management lack of caring about my privacy and I don't know what to do from here.","Format on this got away from me, I'm sorry. I haven't slept well and just woke again. It's coherent, but still a word dump.

Now, I don't hide my stuff intentionally. I just have the... luck?... of passibility most the time. I have been in transition for several years at this point. My legal name has not been changed as of yet due to finances and debt concerns from myself.

Now. My boss handed my coworker and I some things to do. Mine was simple, since I leave frequently for what is my actual job; empty two binders for use in the new year. My coworker's was simple too. Go through a list of all employees, write their names and hire date and department code on a separate individual piece of paper for each employee. It has my legal name on it.

When I pointed this out, my manager said ""oh &lt;General Manager&gt; said to have &lt;coworker&gt; do this for me"" since she was so busy and ""wasn't getting out of here any time soon.""

THIS coworker, I let slip a small piece of information (why I was hospitalized years before I even worked here) and when I was discussing something with a second coworker she just blurted it out. Basically, it was shot day and I was limping because I fucked up and hit a nerve I think that day. It was dumb, but obvious that my leg was hurt. Second coworker asked, and I just said my meds hurt today. She asked about the meds, and I explained it as it helps me and keeps me from getting sick (emotionally) or hospitalized. 

I was trying to be vague, but it came out wrong. 

She asked about my hospitalization and I just said it's a long story I don't want to go into. First coworker blurted out ""just tell her you put yourself in the hospital. It isn't that big of a deal""

She was right though, it wasn't, but she shouldn't have been saying about it. And it was my own fault for letting slip to her. I know that. 

Since then, I've kept my shit on lock and don't discuss my life with my coworkers.

My manager spoon fed my coworker my legal name. I even said ""I'm not okay with this"" which got the GM line and the ""this is a corporate document, it has to be that way"" line. Which is bullshit given my last, amazing job I left had all my info changed for me. (Left for non Trans reasons). I repeated that that doesn't mean I have to be okay with it. 

Now, I am led to believe corporate has never been told of my situation. My GM may actually be involved, or my manager is just trying to pin it up the chain. But most of all, my concerns were not listened to and I was made to feel like that didn't matter. That *I don't* matter. 

""It isn't a big deal, it's just your name"" may be what you're thinking. But to me, it *is* a big deal. I do not want other people I am not involved with to know.

When I was hired, I was told specifically that the only people that knew were my GM, AGM, and the guy who helped me get hired (I told him) and that would stay that way unless I specifically told someone. It was my choice to talk about it; they wouldn't. I had since told my front end manager (who would have dealt with my legal name, and is the one this is about)  and a personal out of work friend. That's it. No one else knew or knows about my name, life, or transition that work here. 

Yet here we are. 

My last sales manager also knew before I was comfortable enough to tell him. Which was a while ago. I have no issue with my bosses knowing. It's my coworkers who shouldn't, and my management who handed it over to them. Aside from one person who used to be my coworker and got promoted into sales. She was hard to work with but has since become a happy person with the promotion, but I have never told her and don't want her to know.

And I'm extremely uncomfortable to the point I don't even want to go to work today, and paranoid to the point that who the hell else knows by management spouting off about my personal life that I don't even discuss with them. It effects my job performance in zero ways, it's my life and it isn't for then to share. So why share it? I'm extremely upset and nervous and paranoid. They said they wouldn't discuss it. It has no bearing on my job. I've missed exactly 1 day and never been late in the entire time I've been here. I've proven I'm not a bad employee, I'd like to think. So why this?

I'm very, very damn upset. And I'm unsure what there is to do aside from calling HR department who I've never even met since they aren't on location. HR doesn't give a fuck about employees, so I doubt I'm going to get anywhere there. I'm just sick to my fucking stomach and nervous and paranoid.

Any advice?

EDIT :: My mom reminded me of our LGBT center here. I haven't been in years, and I went down and spoke with their Trans issues manager, forget his title.

I have some options going forward, one of which is to file a full complaint which could open me up to being fired as it is a right to work state here. 

Another is schedule a sit down with the next up or HR, as well as have him reach out to the corporate office semi anonymously to figure how they deal with these issues. Another is to go to the law office for pro bono help or however that's spelled... sorry, I'm tired. 

As of yet, I've decided the semi anonymous option is the way to go and to keep my head down and document everything that could occur. 

Now, I don't want them to be able to do this kind of stuff again or towards any other employee who may be like me. So, I'm debating on if im gonna pursue this I think. But I'm also going keep my head down and eyes open. I may ahve to nuke this post at some point."

I used to just accept that, especially because I'm only 20 so I feel like I still have the potential to get good changes, but like... now that T is a real thing on the horizon, I'm starting to get almost consumed by ""what if even after years on T I don't pass?""

TheBatIsBack,asktransgender,"Um, did anyone else catch the premiere of Emerald City on Friday???","Emerald City (for those who don't know) is a dark gritty reboot of The Wizard of Oz.

Specifically I wanted to bring to light the character Tip. A young person trapped by their mother in their house, who is presented to the audience as a young boy at the beginning of the episode, but by the end, without their medience transforms back into a female charcter. 

So I did some digging online and came across this article: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bustle.com/p/who-is-tip-in-emerald-city-the-character-is-oz-original-28365/amp

tl;dr: TV Guide described the character as having a big role in the series and that Tip will ""be a moving meditation on the complexities of gender identity and compassion for transgender individuals.""

Is this really happening?! I legit started crying! So if you haven't watched it you need to! The acting is a bit one dimensional, but this is seriously a big deal and we should be supporting this! The first two episodes I believe are available on NBC's site for free.

The visuals are stunning at the very least, and it kinda is like if Game of Thrones met The Wizard of Oz. Also it has Vincent Philip D'Onofrio as the Wizard of Oz, who, if you don't know, did a spectacular job playing Kingpin in Netflix's Daredevil.

allen476,asktransgender,"The first hurdle to transition is done, the second starts Feb. 10th. Also a surreal two days with my mom.","For those that don't know me, I was about 420# at 6'1"". I had roux-en-y gastric bypass on 12/20 and as of last night I have lost 45 pounds already. My goal weight is 170 which all of my doctors agree is doable. 

So the first hurdle is done. Weight is coming off, just need to keep that goal in sight and not be tempted to eat the way I used to. The bypass helps with that a lot.

Second hurdle is to start HRT. I start with my initial appointment with Planned Parenthood on 2/10. I hope that things might be sped along by the fact that I am already on dutasteride and spiro for unrelated issues. My T-levels should be near zero. My PCP and therapist have given their blessing for HRT as well. 

My mom has a rare blood cancer and is currently undergoing treatment. I came out to her during this time. It hasn't really sunk in to her yet but she has been really supportive though. We had a conversation shortly after coming out about when I was a small child and that I was ""off"" and would act effeminate and that she and my sister noticed that I still do to this day. My mom told me she has known that I was either gay or trans since I was 5 she just wished that I would have admitted it to myself before now. 

So I stopped the other day to install her Christmas presents. Video cameras, a video doorbell, a house monitor, and a cloud storage device. While I was working, she mentioned that she saw in an ad she got that a local store was running a sale on bra's and that even plus size was included. This started a 45 minute conversation about bra's, clothes, and my losing weight. I told her I wasn't buying any clothes until I absolutely needed to and when I do, it would be female clothes. The only exception was bra's and underwear. 

It then dawned on me on the way home that I just had a long conversation with my mom about my transition. She talked to me as though I was already her daughter. 

The next night I had to stop and finish up a couple of little things. It took me about 15 minutes to finish. Without saying a word, she hands me a bag. In it were two bra's in the size I told her from the day before in a style that I told her I liked. She then said that she would take me to get more when I needed them. 

Now if I could get some of her acceptance to rub off on my sister.

AlikiVougiouklaki,asktransgender,[Questioning] Is this subreddit biased?

But I have a feeling that nobody who regretted transitioning (even if few people regret it) would be commenting on this subreddit, right?

As a counterpoint, do you think Natalie Reed is right [when she objects](http://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/30/cheerleading-and-the-dangerous-irresponsibility-of-jennifer-finney-boylan/):

&gt; A few trans people trying to offer some encouragement to counteract this overwhelming deluge of negative, transphobic, cis-supremacist messages is by no means enough to actually drive a cis person into transition.

How skeptical should a questioner like me be about the optimism on this subreddit? And of course strangers on the Internet can't replace an actual therapist."

sometimes she's there powerful and strong
Other times she hides, and cowers in fear
Rejection she fears, bar none

She wants her shackles off,

Protection is not enough

I let her hide from the light
From love, I can't leave her there
I unlock her rusty shackles and
Show her the light

Blinded we are the light,
together far brighter together
""I seek freedom"" she cry
""I seek hope release me and be free""
Little by little I've let her free
Until I realize she is me

I am free,
free too feel,
free too hope, 
And hope too love

Together I am stronger than fear
I am stronger than pain that burns within and without
Of rejection I fear,  I'm apart from my family I am even when together
Freeing myself
I hope to find a real me
my family
my future

galacticclusterfuck,asktransgender,"Concerned about some HRT (MtF) side-effects, can anyone offer some advice?","Hey!

I'm from the UK and I'm going to my appointment at my nearest GIC tomorrow. I've done everything they could possibly ask of me to make sure I'm ready for HRT and so they can't possibly have any doubts or further requirements of me.

I **need** to be on HRT. I'm miserable with how I look and feel, and it's always been my main end goal since coming to terms with everything. I'm worried about how long they'll make me wait after this appointment before actually prescribing me them and I plan to push the issue very hard and tell them I'll be self-medding if they don't help (and I will, this isn't an empty ""threat"" - I'm sick of waiting and need this).

I do have some concerns however. Some that scare me. I'm an incredibly sexual person. It's a huge part of who I am, it's a very important thing to me in relationships and it's a big part of how I feel intimacy and connection with a partner. Most people I've read about experience a huge loss of libido and also end up unable to get erections and therefore PI-whatever sex becomes pretty much impossible. I absolutely love anal, but I'd hate to lose the use of my penis and be unable to perform penetrative sex.

Everything else about being on HRT makes me so excited to start, but I'm genuinely scared about losing my libido and/or my ability to get/maintain erections. Is there any advice anyone can give me about this? Do certain types of HRT have lesser effects on this side of things? Are there ways to avoid the loss of these? Anything. Even just information about your own experiences would be useful, particularly similar to my own."

So I'm Struggling to understand the whole gender vs sex thing and it's all pretty confusing not going to lie.. Wasnt gender and sex the same thing like ten years ago? 

I went searching for info on /changemyview and I found some really great comments by a transgendered person and then my app crashed and I lost my place. Their username had the word shell in it and they were really smart and calm and logical. They had Iver a hundred thousand comment karma and were part of team periwinkle. If anyone knows about this user could you please let me know so I can contact them with a few questions I just know they will answer well. 

Aside from that... It's my understanding that the whole proof for the trans thing is in the brain scans that show say.. A ftm Trans person having the same scan as a cis male.. So if that's the proof that it all rests on.. Why is that not the test for whether or not a person is trans. And if the answer to that is that it's not always 100% that way then my follow up question is if that is the case.. How is that considered proof that male/female gender is of the mind.

Im really struggling to understand all of this. That person who's username included shell had written a huge message to a person similar to me in their understanding of the issue. It was so well put I really with my app didn't crash I was right on the edge of understanding.

She worries that my jawline and my frame are so masculine. She worries about me experiencing poverty as a result of transition. And to be fair to her, she's seen some shit. She's seen poverty personally as a kid, and abuse. She works with people in much worse places than I am. She's not anti trans either. She knows I struggle now. She also knows I love my wife and kids, don't want to upset them, she knows I don't know. But I just get on this goddamn hamster wheel of wanting to transition and then worrying about the consequences. I feel bad - really bad - at the thought of never transitioning though. How do I even process this decision?"
catfusion,asktransgender,'CIS' instead of 'cis'?,"I'm seeing this in caps a lot lately, like it's some kind of acronym, i.e., CIS.

It doesn't stand for anything in the context of a prefix of gender, i.e., cisgender, transgender, not CIS same as it's not TRANS. (Although I'm sure we could come up with some nifty backronyms.)

**What I'm really curious about though is how the ALLCAPS writing of 'cis' got started? Where did it come from?** 

(I know when/where the term itself originated/came into usage, approximately, but the 'CIS' thing is new. Semiotically, it seems like it's an attempt to conceptually distance cis from trans or something but I really don't know.)"
someone-someguy,asktransgender,"People who have transitioned while being a teacher, what was your experience?","Currently I'm pursuing a career in teaching. I recently began to wonder what sort of experiences a trans person has while teaching. Right now I'm waiting until I graduate and move away before I try to openly transition, but I'm starting to get anxious about how being trans and being a teacher would mix. 

I'd like to hear many experiences if possible. It really can influence what I decide to do with the next five or so years of my life. Thanks :)"
icecoldbath,asktransgender,Immediately after vaginoplasty?,I've read conflicting things about immediate post op situation. Do you literally have to lay flat on your back for 2 days?

ThisGirlIsLost,asktransgender,Being treated differently as your true gender.,"I had a new experience while sitting in the doctor's office last week. I don't dress overly feminine, I think I'm more androgynous/feminine leaning in my appearance, but I do get gendered female most of the time. I also have pretty bad social anxiety, so I always look nervous sitting around a bunch of strangers.

An older guy was leaving the office, getting on the elevator. The door closed and then it opened again and he started walking over to me. I'm like wtf? He comes over and says ""Ma'am, I usually don't do this, but you looked scared"" He then started to give me a pep talk on how everything happens for a reason and I'll be alright. I guess he thought I was just given a cancer diagnosis.
I never had that happen when people thought I was a guy.

What are some of your stories about being treated differently now that you are transitioning/transitioned?"
zauraz,asktransgender,Idk really why I post this but eh..,"I don't really know how to bring this up and it will turn more into a rant probably tbh. I think I am trans and have been like this for months now. All real discussion however about it has been through text, internet, forums etc. My closest friends and parents know but I know no one in real life I can talk to and I am already going to therapy. No one seems to understand nor do I seem able to bring it up and talk about it because it feels like I am bothering them with something..

Idk why but I just sort of wanted to get this out somewhere. I feel distanced from the emotions etc when I write them here in text form. It feels less real and direct and its sort of hurting me and giving my doubt roots to grow in.

hey_its_Espeon,asktransgender,Preferances,"Since I came out as trans (MtF) to my parents and some friends I've been thinking about my sexuality. I've always been more physically attracted to girls/women, but I would much rather go on a date and have a relationship with a guy. Is this normal?

I used to not even think about guys that way because it was weird considering I was male myself. 

Do any of you have the same experience?"
danielajazminsss,asktransgender,[NSFW] I get erections all the time and what are ways to cope with it?,"My question is: How do y'all, fellow trans girls, cope or avoid with erections, while pre-hrt or anything? Do you take medications, or a certain diet? Sit in a certain way? Tuck in a certain way? Everything just to get rid or avoid it?

I'm pre-hrt and everything, hoping I could get it this year. So for the last one and a half months, I've been getting way more erections than I use to. I've been very dysphoric and combined with my other problems, quite suicidal. I go out as a girl outside though, and I feel quite feminine actually, no matter how masculine I look.

I usually don't get erections when I'm outside, but once sitting somewhere comfortable, like my house, I just get it. Scrolling through Instagram or something had became a nightmare.  Without even thinking of something. I get hard, then horny, conflicted. Masturbating makes me feel way worse, but I do it anyways. When I do it, I'll usually lock myself inside my house and refuse to interact with other people other than my parents. I feel disgusted and like a monster. I feel like mine is a tumor that id pulsating all the time.

I've been taking some medications for acne, coincidentally started it one and a half months ago. I'm kinda scared to ask about their side effects, like if it includes an increase in libido.

Thank you!!!

MissAtom,asktransgender,For both MtF and FtM,"How is your transition going?
"
Napstablooregard,asktransgender,"Making a FAQ ""answer sheet"" for people coming out","Hey all!

What are some of the questions or comments you got when coming out?

Like it says in the title, I want to create an answer sheet of frequently asked questions to help people trying to come out. Common, uncommon, mean, nice, curious, confused, etc., I want to hear what you've got. 

I've found the best way to combat prejudice is with education, patience, and kindness; and being able to have well-researched answers with sources is something that I think could benefit a lot of people.

When I've compiled a good list of questions/comments and answers/responses, I'll post the list here, updating as need be."
The_Oen,asktransgender,Strange dysphoria increase,"(**Note**: I'm mtf but everyone's input is appreciated)

Before realizing I was trans, I never really experienced any acute body dysphoria. I was always depressed, but for whatever reason I didn't particularly hate having a masculine body.
Until now.
For the first few weeks after accepting I'm transgender I was honestly excited, because I finally figured out what my problem was and could start to see a way to fix it. However recently dysphoria has absolutely overwhelmed me, to the point of being paralyzing. I can't even drive most of the time because I'm so suicidal I'm tempted to just smash into a tree at 90 mph. 

Why is this suddenly happening now?
Does anyone have any similar experiences or advice?"
meetmario,asktransgender,Is dysphoria trans like eating candies?,"This afternoon I got dressed up and spent the entire time just walking around the historical city center with my girlfriend. There must have been a makeup fail somewhere because I got clocked more than usual, but despite the odd looks I still enjoyed immensely. Despite the fact that I do this to alleviate dysphoria, i came home to discover, undressing, that I'd rather have real breasts than prosthetic ones, and I'd rather come home with a very horny man to scratch my itch.

I thought of myself as bigender this far, therefore I doubted my need for a transition to woman (I am considering a transition to something in between), but I am now thinking that maybe if I let myself do this too comfortably I might end up wanting a full transition, and possibly quit my current wonderful relationship just to have sex with men.

Can anyone relate? Does dysphoria simply go deeper the more it's satisfied?"

feelingitnow13579,asktransgender,This is insane to think about...,"Well not to long ago I remember seeing a video about fetus development. It sparked my curiosity and I did some additional reading. (I may not be 100% correct). 

Before you were even a fetus, within seconds after the sperm enters the egg, the chromosomes begin to mix. Xy makes a guy xx makes a girl. This is just sheer luck, a gamble, 50/50. Now just imagine if instead of xy you got xx. Your not even born yet and those two little chromosomes just changed absolutely everything about your life. Many weeks later, as the baby begins to resemble a human, your gametes would have turned into ovaries, instead of becoming testicles. The skin that makes up your ball sack would have formed into labia's. The phallus would have stayed a tiny clitoris instead of turning into a penis. Our nipples would eventually grow into breasts. 

Just imagine if that damn 50/50 shot was xx. Its insane to think about. You wouldn't even be reading this. But at the same time, maybe the experience of living as girl can only be appreciated after you have lived as a guy. 

Don't dwell on this to much because it hurts, but food for thought. "

themg2,asktransgender,Does anyone has any experience with Gender Therapists in Delaware?,"With the help of my long-distance trans-girlfriend, I finally stopped denying to myself that I am actually a trans-woman back in December. I was visiting a therapist prior to that to treat depression, but I want to visit a gender therapist as well and get on HRT.

I am a college student living in Delaware. I was linked a list of ""trans-friendly"" resources in Delaware, however the only two people that I saw that fit the title of ""Gender Therapist"" were Jill Gaumer and Brett Herb. I saw a [negative review for Jill Gaumer dating from 2012](http://foryourhealthandsafety.tumblr.com/post/35250075140/jill-gaumer-newark-delaware-united-states) so I'm leaning towards Brett Herb, but does anyone here have any experience with either of these people?

aconfusedmoron,asktransgender,Maybe I'm not really trans?,"I never crossdressed until I started consciously questioning recently and started experimenting to get answers.

Even in retrospect I can't find any hints from early childhood, before middle school-puberty.

Being called he in real life never bothered me before I started questioning, maybe it only bothers me because I'm expecting/hoping it will.

I don't feel disconnected from the person in the mirror.

I don't feel ""more like me"" when I crossdress. I feel better, but not in an obvious lightning bolt sense.

I don't feel like I'm a woman, just like I wish I were one.

The DSM says that's enough if you wish ""strongly"", but I don't know if I wish strongly enough.

I've always wished to be a girl (from puberty onward), but longingly, not desperately?

I don't hate my genitals or have anything else that's unambiguously dysphoria.

When I ask to be called she, I feel fake.

Why am I even thinking about this when I've been fine as a guy so far? (Well, I did plan on killing myself a few years ago, but for depression reasons, not obviously caused by gender.)

My personality isn't feminine enough.

I was feeling really confident lately, but now I just feel doubtful and depressed."

Gothrenapp,asktransgender,"Thinking about going drag, suggestions?","At my latest therapy session my father and I debated against each other about me being transgender.
On the way home, he mentioned trans folk 'try being a girl', referring to drag Queens, not expecting me to want to do that. To his surprise, I've wanted to be drag for about as long as I've been transgender. 
I'd say he's somewhat unsupportive, but if I were to go drag, how would I do it?
I recently got my hair trimmed, and my hair is much too short for my liking and looks masculine. So I thought I want a wig. 
Also I have a prominent Adam's apple, so I'm also thinking a scarf, but maybe high collars would take care of that, I'm not sure.
